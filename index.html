<p>Personally I do not believe in the concept of a patent, however along with many other concepts I choose not to describe to, patents are something that continue to impact my personal, and business life, and are something I feel will continue to impact the world of APIs.</p> 

<p>I’ve done a lot of work in the area of APIs + Copyright, another concept I don’t subscribe to, but I identify that we are going to have to take a stance, one way or another, or large enterprises like Oracle will steamroll over much of the good work we are doing in the space—I feel the same about the world of patents.</p>

<p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) show up in thousands of patents, and my goal is to better understand the role that APIs are playing in patent. Once I started doing simple searches via Google Patent search, I recognized that there was more going on with APIs and patents than was being discussed in the wider API space.</p>

<p>As I do with other areas of my API research, I started this working repository, and will publish any data, tools, and other resources here, as I have time. I will work to also tell the story of my research, providing a single place I can come back to when i pick up the API patent discussion.</p> 

<p>If you know of any good stories that should be shown here, let me know. I’m not sure how much time I will have to research the world of APIs and patents, but I get a feeling, if I don’t work to bring this dark layer of APIs out of the shadows, things could get worse, rather than better for the world of APIs.</p>
