	"abstract": "The invention described here deals with implementing custom data processing of HTTPS based on a Browser-Plugin Method. Such custom data processing may include, but is not limited to, custom data compression, custom data encryption, data monitoring, data modification. There are two distinct methods to implement the Browser-Plugin Method for Advanced HTTPS Data Processing of the subject invention (BPAHDP). In both cases, BPAHDP provides the option of conducting custom data processing that co-exists with data compression, data encryption, or other types of data processing operations supported by the HTTP standard. Additionally, both BPAHDP methods ensure that the web-browser still implements and executes the underlying SSL/TLS channel setup and encryption operations. In both embodiments of BPAHDP, the most critical functionality is the ability to modify HTTP request/response headers and data sent over a TLS/SSL channel. In the regular HTTP case (HTTP over TCP) headers and data are sent as clear-text (i.e., as unencrypted data). Therefore, any HTTP proxy component can intercept and modify header/data as it choosesu2014allowing custom data processing operations (including a custom compression operation) to be implemented. For HTTPS traffic, the data leaving a web-browser is encrypted. Therefore, a proxy cannot modify encrypted data, hence the novelty of the BPAHDP methodology. Both methods require specific implementation methods that are described. In particular, both embodiments of BPAHDP require specific techniques to facilitate the use of Microsoft Internet Explorer as a BPAHDP enabled web-browser. Microsoft COM (Component Object Model) interfaces and IE's Pluggable Protocol capabilities are utilized to meet all requirements of both BPAHDP embodiments.",

A visual display is typically comprised of one or more visual elements, as well as an underlying data model.

However, using the declarative animation system, visual elements can be associated with an underlying data model in a manner that allows the visual display layer to recognize and respond to changes in the underlying data model. This association can also be leveraged to allow automatically generated animation between visual elements without the addition of custom programmatic code.

	"abstract": "A cloud management system is described herein that provides the ability for an application to span two or more clouds while allowing operation, management, and troubleshooting of the distributed application as a single application. The system provides infrastructure that communicates across datacenters for execution and for centralizing knowledge of instances of an application that are running at different locations. The infrastructure provided by the system monitors both the application and connections between the clouds, with intelligence to know if issues are within the application or because of the connection between the clouds. The system coordinates management functions across multiple cloud platforms/locations. Thus, the cloud management system creates a single monitoring and troubleshooting interface and knowledge and execution fabric across multiple clouds so that applications spread across multiple clouds can be monitored, managed, and debugged more easily.",

	"abstract": "Many imaging scenarios involve an achromatic image (e.g., a panchromatic image or a near-infrared image) and one or more concurrently captured monochromatic images (e.g., RGB images captured through a Bayer filter array), and the compositing of these images through de-mosaicing and/or pan-sharpening to generate a high-resolution color image. However, in many such scenarios, the monochromatic images may exhibit distortion of edge geometry, resulting in artifacts and/or color distortions near visual edges of the composite image. However, such distortions may be absent from the achromatic image, and edge geometry may be represented as an intensity gradient among respective neighborhoods of achromatic pixels. Presented herein are techniques for reducing such distortions in monochromatic images through iterative adjustment of monochromatic pixel intensity to reflect the gradients of the neighborhoods of the corresponding achromatic pixels. Convergence of such adjustments produces composite images exhibiting accurately reconstructed edge geometry.",

A computer-implemented method for providing a topographical graph includes accessing, by a computer processor, road map data associated with a geographic area, and accessing, by the computer processor, elevation data associated with the geographic area. The computer processor references the elevation data to determine points at which there is a change in incline along roads in the geographic area. The topographical graph is constructed, with the points defining nodes in the topographical graph, and arcs between the nodes representing road segments having a substantially constant degree of incline. Further provided are methods for determining levels of perceived exertion in traversing arcs, and for optimizing travel routes for minimal perceived exertion.",

The system models hierarchical data with one data object called data vine and one data structure type called data vine list. A data vine includes a name, a property list, and a child list. A data vine list is an ordered list of data vines. A data vine is recursively defined with its child list as a data vine list. The system introduces five basic operators, cast, restrict, unique, sort, and traverse. Each operator acts on one data vine list and returns another data vine list. A property list in a data vine is unordered with set operations implemented, which include default operation, update operation, elimination operation, replacement operation, and intersection operation.",

When an application program emits a call to execute one or more machine code scene programs, the graphics driver transmits corresponding scene programs execution commands to the graphics pre-processing unit. For each scene program execution command, the graphics pre-processing unit processes instructions, programmatically reconfigures the graphics pipeline based on the execution of the machine code scene program, and launches one or more parallel threads that execute commands within the graphics pipeline.

But this may not be desirable in many cases. So we need to provide option to the user to specify the preferred list of backup locations to service a client request. The present solution achieves this configurability by using a GSLB policy based on preferred location. One can configure preferred location(s) via a GSLB policy to redirect the client to preferred location(x). One can configure individual policies for different client locations.

In particular, the management threads may converge information for describing services, applications, workloads, in an information technology infrastructure. For example, a discovery engine may reference an identity vault to capture enriched models of an infrastructure, and a management infrastructure may then generate one or more scorecards that can be used to manage the infrastructure. In particular, the scorecards may provide information for tuning or otherwise controlling risk, complexity, cost, availability, and agility versus rigidness in the infrastructure.",

The droplet operations may in some cases be electrode-mediated. The droplet operations may redistribute and/or circulate the magnetically responsive beads within the droplet. In some cases, the droplet may include a sample droplet may include a target analyte. The redistributing of the magnetically responsive beads may cause target analyte to bind to the magnetically responsive beads. In some cases, the droplet may include unbound substances in a wash buffer. The redistributing of the magnetically responsive beads causes unbound substances to be freed from interstices of an aggregated set or subset of the magnetically responsive beads.",

	"abstract": "To provide key management layered on a quasi-out-of-band authentication system, a security server receives a request for activation of a user interface window for a particular user from a network device via a communication channel. It then transmits an activation PIN to an out of band authentication system for forwarding to the user's telephone via a voice or text message. It next receives the previously transmitted PIN from the network device via the communication channel, and authenticates the user based on the received PIN. After authenticating the user, it establishes a secure, independent, encrypted communication channel between the user interface window and the security server on top of the original communication channel. It then generates and transmits to the user interface window and/or receives from the user interface window via the secure communication channel, key material and certificate material for public key and/or symmetric key cryptography based operations.",

	"abstract": "A certificate management system provides automated management of certificate lifecycles and certificate distribution. Rather than depend upon an administrator to manually distribute and manage certificates, the system self-generates certificates, distributes the certificates to appropriate servers or other parties, and transitions from old certificates to new certificates in a well-defined manner that avoids breaking functionality. After generating one or more certificates, the system securely shares certificates in a way that parties that use them can find the new certificates without an administrator manually distributing the certificates. When it is time to update certificates, the system generates new certificates and shares the new certificates in a similar way. During a transition period, the system provides a protocol by which both old and new certificates can be used to perform authenticated access to resources, so that the transition from an old to a new certificate does not break services.",

	"abstract": "Ultraviolet light-emitting diodes with tailored AlGaN quantum wells can achieve high extraction efficiency. For efficient bottom light extraction, parallel polarized light is preferred, because it propagates predominately perpendicular to the QW plane and into the typical and more efficient light escape cones. This is favored over perpendicular polarized light that propagates along the QW plane which requires multiple, lossy bounces before extraction. The thickness and carrier density of AlGaN QW layers have a strong influence on the valence subband structure, and the resulting optical polarization and light extraction of ultraviolet light-emitting diodes. At Al>0.3, thinner QW layers (<2.5 nm are preferred) result in light preferentially polarized parallel to the QW plane. Also, active regions consisting of six or more QWs, to reduce carrier density, and with thin barriers, to efficiently inject carriers in all the QWs, are preferred.",

In particular, the management threads may converge information for managing planned changes and recovery processes for version-controlled snapshots of the information technology models. For example, a discovery engine may enrich models of an infrastructure with identity information obtained from an identity vault and the infrastructure itself, and a management infrastructure may then manage planned changes to the infrastructure model. In particular, the management infrastructure may construct implementation plans that coordinate interaction between managed entities to implement the planned changes, and may further detect drifts between operational states and planned states for the infrastructure models.",
