  header: I have pulled any patents that have API, Application Programming Interface, or Hypermedia in the title, abstract, or full content of the patent. I have broken them down into separate repositories, for easier management by year.
  footer: These are all forkable on Github, letting me manage the data using Jekyll within a Github repository. I also have filtered APIs (JSON feeds) for each of the years providing me with specialized access to common keywords I'm tracking on.
