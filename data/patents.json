The method identifies a first rate controller parameter that is based on at least a first value that quantifies one characteristic of the first camera. The method uses the first rate controller parameter to configure a set of rate controllers to adjust a bit rate for encoding video pictures captured by the first camera. The method identifies a second rate controller parameter that is based on at least a second value that quantifies the same characteristic of the second camera. The first and second values are different, and the difference causes the first and second rate controller parameters to be different.

In one aspect of the invention, an exemplary method of the invention allows a user to directly snapback to a previous accessed document presentation without having to select from a menu of items or go through the intermediate pages. In this method, when a first document presentation is accessed, a first location of the first document presentation is recorded, automatically or manually. Subsequently, when a sequence of additional document presentations originated from the first document presentation is accessed, in response to a first input, without having to select from a menu of items, the first document presentation is directly retrieved from a recorded first location and displayed in a window. In one particular embodiment, a second document presentation is accessed and a second location of the second document presentation is recorded, where the recordation of the second location resets or supercedes the recordation of the first location. Other methods and apparatuses are also described.",

A multiplexer component collects input signal from the one or more LED strings via a first set of one or more monitoring pins, processes the collected input signal, and extracts at least one output signal. The at least one output signal is conveyed to a demultiplexer component through a second set of one or more monitoring pins, wherein the number of elements in the second set of monitoring pins is equal to or smaller than the number of monitoring pins in the first set. The collected input signal is processed in accordance with at least one mode of operation of the multiplexer component, the mode of operation autonomously configured by the demultiplexer component. The multiplexer component can autonomously generate intelligence on operating status of the set of LED strings.",

Invalid intersections can arise from imprecision in computer-based number representation, causing ray origins to be located inappropriately. In some aspects, a ray can be associated with information relating to an expected angle between the ray's direction and a normal for a to-be-identified primitive intersected by that ray. If the angle between the ray's direction and the normal of an intersected primitive is within expectations, then that information can be used in predicting whether the intersection is valid. Such expectation information can be presented as a single bit determined by a shader performing a dot product of the ray and a normal of a primitive intersected by a parent ray, or can be obtained as a by-product of ray/primitive intersection testing. Such information also can be based on whether the shader is emitting to have reflection or refraction type ray behavior.",

Instead, the module performs parts of the KDF operation, as indicated by the application using the module. This saves the module from implementing the entire KDF for each KDF needed. Instead, the module implements only re-usable parts that are common to most KDFs.

The database of metadata may be referred to herein as a u201cmetabase.u201d For example, to generate a metabase, a data agent may traverse a file system to obtain certain characteristics of data managed by the file system while substantially simultaneously detecting and recording change notifications. These actions may be performed even if the actions of the data agent are interrupted one or more times during the traversal of the file system. The data agent may process the characteristics and change notifications to generate and update a metabase. Once formed, the metabase may be consulted to determine changes in system data rather than determining the changes by scanning the data files themselves.",

	"abstract": "Disclosed herein are systems and methods for regulating network bandwidth by means of monitoring network traffic, predicting network loads, and scheduling traffic utilizing traffic reporting and bandwidth reservation mechanisms. These systems and methods may reduce network congestion and support more efficient processing by network applications. Traffic reporting may comprise broadcasting control messages to network nodes indicating appropriate times to send and receive messages. Network nodes may use traffic reports (e.g., control messages) to proactively regulate their use of the network. Bandwidth reservation may allow network nodes to do productive processing while waiting to send and receive data, and may decrease mean wait times. Reservations may be implemented in a synchronous or asynchronous manner. In an exemplary embodiment, the reservation mechanism may emulate a traditional stream socket API. Embodiments enabling enhanced TV applications to run more effectively over cable TV out-of-band networks are described.",

A router applet operating on the mobile device receives the request for the short-form AID applet, determines the long-form AID applet corresponding to the short-form AID applet, and routes the request to the long-form AID applet, thereby invoking the long-form AID applet. In this manner, legacy readers that have stored therein only the short-form AID applet can invoke the functionality of the long-form AID applet on the smart card. Additionally, newer readers implementing the long-form AID applet can request directly the long-form AID applet.",

	"abstract": "Techniques for identifying and selecting equivalent sets of agents with defined capabilities to perform certain actions are disclosed herein. In one embodiment, determining agents to gather information for a storage area network fabric may be performed through the use of fabric discovery operations which identify agents capable of performing various actions within the fabric. From the determined capabilities of the agents, a dynamic capability grid may be populated to assist with the generation of a list of equivalent subsets to perform the various actions. The most efficient set of agents from each equivalent subset may then be selected to perform actions, with other sets of agents in the equivalent subset available as secondary choices in case of an unexpected failure. For example, a fabric probe may be executed in a storage area network using discovered agents from a list of equivalent subsets to most efficiently accomplish network operations such as zoning and topology.",

The parabolic reflectors are mounted on a support frame in various panels or arrays to form a parabolic solar concentrator. Each parabolic reflector focuses light in a line segment pattern. Light beam pattern focused onto a receiver via the parabolic solar concentrator can be optimized. The receiver is attached to the support frame, opposite the parabolic reflector arrays, and includes a photovoltaic (PV) module and a heat harvesting element that enable dual-mode energy conversion operation. To increase performance of the parabolic solar concentrator, the PV module can be configured to advantageously exploit a light beam pattern optimization regardless irregularities in the pattern.",

Even when a fact is logically deleted, a physical record is kept available. The record of a logically deleted or invalid fact has associated lifetime information. For example, valid-from and valid-to time values. The record of a fact not yet deleted may have a valid-from time value indicating when it was created, became valid, etc. Queries against the semantic store may specify a timeslice (a point in time or a time range). The lifetime information can be used to satisfy such time-specific queries. Because records are maintained after they are logically deleted, it is also possible to accurately query a past state of the semantic store. Even if such a query is run at different times, same results may be obtained.",

The multi-touch plug-in system receives platform-specific touch data from an operating system or touch hardware, interprets the platform-specific touch data to convert the platform-specific touch data to generic touch data, and provides the generic touch data to a hosted application running within a plug-in sandbox. Often, sandboxed environments only allow identified, trusted plug-ins to execute. By managing multi-touch data within a trusted plug-in, the plug-in can ensure that hosted applications are properly restricted to well-defined behavior, while still allowing rich features such as multi-touch interaction. Thus, the multi-touch plug-in system brings rich multi-touch interaction to a web browsing environment.",

Accordingly, an interpolated image may be generated by interpolating values for unvalued points based upon values of valued points. In particular, a set of valued points having desired cost paths may be determined for an unvalued point. A model may be applied to the set of valued points to interpolate a value for the unvalued point. One or more interpolated images may be projected onto a new view.

An access terminal adjusts a monitoring rate of a downlink control channel either (i) after transmitting a multicast registration message in a sector that is not supporting a given multicast session or (ii) after receiving an announce message announcing the given multicast session. An access network anticipates the monitoring rate adjustment, and sends a message advertising the given multicast session (e.g., a broadcast overhead message (BOM)) based on the adjusted monitoring rate. Further, the announce message sent by the access network can be sent on the downlink control channel, and can be sent based on expected paging cycles, or monitoring rates, of the downlink control channel at one or more access terminals within the network prior to the monitoring rate adjustment.",

	"abstract": "A method of adjusting quality of service (QoS) with respect to changes in a transmission environment of a mobile terminal receiving data based on a stream control transmission protocol (SCTP) session. When the transmission environment of the mobile terminal receiving data based on the SCTP session changes, the mobile terminal transmits link information indicating a new transmission environment to a destination node, and the destination node adjusts the quality of data or the size of a transmission window based on the link information. Thus, without adding separate network devices, the QoS of the data being transmitted can be adjusted with respect to the changed transmission environment, only by adding functions with software to the transmission terminal and the reception terminal. Also, since the destination node manually adjusts the transmission window according to the link information, packet loss can be minimized compared to the conventional congestion control method.",
