A software application creates multiple render targets associated with a surface. For each render target, the software application also creates an associated render target sample mask configured to select one or more samples included in each pixel. Within the graphics pipeline, a pixel shader processes each pixel individually and outputs multiple render target-specific color values. For each render target, a ROP unit uses the associated render target sample mask to select covered samples included in the pixel. Subsequently, the ROP unit uses the render target-specific color value to update the selected samples in the render target, thereby achieving sample-level color granularity. Advantageously, by increasing the effective resolution using render target sample masks, the quality of the rendered image is improved without incurring the performance degradation associated with processing each sample individually.",

The RCS interface translates application-originated RCS signaling that complies with the RCS protocol into the OS-specific RCS access protocol for delivery to the RCS resources, and the RCS interface likewise translates application-terminated signaling that complies with the OS-specific RCS access protocol into the RCS access protocol for delivery to one of the RCS client applications.",

The service provider interface is used to call an external function, such as an encryption utility, that is used to facilitate secure document exchange between a sending entity and a receiving entity. The encryption utility may be configured for local download to and installation in the machine on which the SPI is invoked, but a preferred approach is to use the SPI to invoke an external encryption utility as a u201cservice.u201d In such case, the external encryption utility is implemented by a service provider. When the calling program invokes the SPI, preferably the user is provided with a display panel. Using that panel, the end user provides a password that is used for encryption key generation, together with an indication of the desired encryption strength. The service provider uses the password to generate the encryption key. In one embodiment, the service provider provides the key to the service provider interface, which then uses the key to encrypt the document and to complete the file transfer operation. In the alternative, the service provider itself performs the document or file encryption. The service provider interface also preferably generates and sends an email or other message to the receiving entity that includes the key or a link to enable the receiving entity to retrieve the key. This approach obviates the sending and receiving entity having to install and manage matched or other special-purpose encryption utilities.",

The irradiated target area image is formed via exploiting both the spatial diversity of the physical multi-transmitter and multi-receiver array and synthetic aperture/array that is generated by the motion of the platform that carries the radar system.

A signature to detect is compiled into executable logic that is executed to communicate with an engine that evaluates network traffic. The signature logic provides an expression set (such as group of regular expressions) for the engine to match against a token corresponding to the network traffic. When matched, the engine notifies the logic and receives a further expression set to match, or a communication indicative that that the signature was detected. The signature thus directs the analysis, facilitating a lightweight, generic engine. Safety of the signature logic is described as being accomplished through layers, including by publisher signing, and by compilation and execution (e.g., interpretation) in safe environments.",

In another embodiment, the server receives the data, maps the temporary identifier to a unique network address of the second client device and generates a record of the data transmission between the respective client devices. In another embodiment, the server maintains an association for the temporary identifier after the first and second client devices are disconnected from their P2P connection to permit supplemental communication.",

	"abstract": "Some embodiments provide a method that identifies a network topology that is involved in routing of the network traffic between the endpoints in a pair of endpoints. The identified topology covers (1) all the routing paths (e.g., hardware and software-defined paths) between the endpoints and (2) all the forwarding elements (e.g., hardware and software-defined non-edge forwarding elements) along each path that forwards the network traffic (e.g., network packets). The method identifies, and groups together, the receiving interfaces as well as the forwarding interfaces of each forwarding element along different paths between the endpoints. By doing so, the method can identify a real link between a pair of forwarding elements when a set of forwarding interfaces of each one of the forwarding elements in the pair points to the other forwarding element.",

The method includes automatically determining the end of an initiated parking session based on detecting movement of the vehicle away from a parking spot provided the Handset containing the parking payment App has sensed a Bluetooth tag in the vehicle or paired with the built-in Bluetooth system of the vehicle. The method also includes targeted parking enforcement where parked vehicles are identified wirelessly by short range radio beacons emitted by tags placed in/on the vehicles and their session status checked with information downloaded from a parking application server.",

	"abstract": "While each node in a cluster of nodes sources connections with the same IP if each node allocates a port on this IP independently, there may be port clashes. Also, the return traffic is not guaranteed to hit the originating node. These issues are addressed by allocating a port in such a way that the response traffic hashes back to the originating node. A good hash is chosen such that the ports are equally divided among the nodes. When a node leaves, the other nodes take over the port range used by this node. When a node joins, the node takes back its share of ports.",

In one aspect, a Tail Optimization Protocol (TOP) enables cooperation between a mobile device and an associated radio access network to eliminate idle periods (e.g., tails) when possible. Various systems and methods described herein can leverage the ability of applications and/or their associated connections to accurately predict a long tail time, from which a mobile device can notify an associated cellular network on such an imminent tail in order to allow the cellular network to immediately release tail resources. Various other aspects provided herein realize TOP via fast dormancy and/or other similar notification mechanisms, which enable a handset or other device to notify a cellular network for immediate resource release.",
