title: Computer system and method of displaying hypertext documents with internal hypertext link definitions
abstract: A computer system and method display internal and external hypertext link definitions in different representations to simplify a user's recognition of the external/internal status of each hypertext link definition in a document. Additional information, such as the direction from an internal hypertext link definition to the location in the document pointed to by that definition, and/or the absolute or relative position of the location pointed to by an internal hypertext link definition, may also be displayed. Moreover, a computer system and method may also display the position of the location pointed to by an internal hypertext link definition on a scroll bar such that location information about a particular document is centralized within a common user interface component.

No. 09\/438,080, filed on Nov. 10, 1999 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,585,776 by Bates et al., which is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/925,565, filed on Sep. 8, 1997 by Cary L. Bates et al. (issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,987,482), which applications are incorporated by reference herein.","The invention is generally related to computers and computer software. More specifically, the invention is generally related to a manner of displaying hypertext documents on a computer display.","Hypertext linking has radically simplified the manner in which users interact with computers. With hypertext linking, links are defined between a source location in one document and a target location in the same or another document. A user navigates from the source to the target typically by selecting a hypertext link definition at the source location. In addition, a hypertext link definition can be associated with a particular object displayed in a document so that the associated object may be selected by a user to activate a hypertext link.","By associating hypertext link definitions with displayed objects, an extremely powerful, efficient, and intuitive interface is provided to a user. As an example, a document may include hypertext links between selected words and their definitions. A user reading that document may then be able to pull up definitions of particular words that he or she does not understand by merely selecting those words directly. In a typical graphical or windows-type computer system, selection may be performed quickly and easily by moving a pointer over a specific word using a mouse and then clicking a button on the mouse\u2014a concept known as \u201cclicking on\u201d an object.","Hypertext link definitions may be associated with a wide variety of display objects such as text, images, sounds, animation, and video clips, among others. One segment of the Internet, the World Wide Web, relies extensively on hypertext linking to permit users to navigate between documents that contain a wide variety of such multimedia objects. Documents are formatted using a standard language known as the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).","Users typically view documents from the World Wide Web using a computer software application (known as a browser) that is configured to read this specific document format. A browser typically incorporates at least one graphical window that displays all or a portion of a particular document. The window may also include a scroll bar that a user manipulates to scroll through different portions of a displayed document.","It is in large part the simplicity and intuitiveness of hypertext linking that has made the World Wide Web the most popular segment of the Internet for many users. In addition, hypertext linking has enjoyed such popularity on the Internet that many private computer networks are set up as intranets that use the same hypertext linking concepts to organize and permit access to information stored on a company's network. Hypertext linking concepts are also used with many help systems, and have even been incorporated into the basic user interface mechanisms of some operating systems.","Many conventional browsers highlight text-based hypertext link definitions using different formatting for the word or words associated with each definition. As an example, a hypertext link definition may be highlighted through underlining and\/or by portraying the text in a different color than the surrounding text. Different colors may also be used with hypertext link definitions to distinguish between those that point to previously-viewed documents and those that point to new documents, so that a user is less likely to inadvertently take a link to a document that he or she has already visited.","Hypertext link definitions may be categorized into external and internal hypertext link definitions. An external hypertext link definition links together two different documents, while an internal hypertext link definition links together two different locations within the same document. With conventional browsers, however, most users are unable to readily distinguish between external and internal links without actually taking the individual hypertext link definitions.","It is often frustrating for many users when they discover that a particular hypertext link that they have taken leaves them at a different location within the same document\u2014and often at a location that they have already viewed. Moreover, other users may realize that they have taken an internal hypertext link to a previously-viewed location in a document only after they have read some of the information at the new location. Conversely, other users may desire to stay within a particular document and avoid taking external hypertext links, since navigation to external links is often slower than to internal links. Navigating between hypertext links therefore can become a tedious and time consuming trial and error process.","It is often desirable to maximize the time a user is viewing documents while minimizing the time a user is navigating hypertext links. This desire is even more prominent when the effects of network congestion (which can slow retrieval of new documents as well as of updates to existing documents) are considered. Avoiding navigation to undesired hypertext links would therefore eliminate a significant source of user frustration and lost productivity.","More sophisticated users having a detailed knowledge of HTML may be able to determine whether a link definition is for an internal or external link by referring to the location of the target of the link definition that is displayed in a pop-up window or status bar of some browsers when a mouse pointer is positioned over the link definition. A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) address is often displayed for documents from the World Wide Web, and filename and directory information is typically displayed for documents stored on a private network or a user's local computer. For the casual user, however, the information displayed about a target location is often meaningless.","Therefore, a significant need continues to exist for a manner of improving the efficiency of hypertext linking, particularly through minimizing the navigation of undesired hypertext links.","The invention addresses these and other problems associated with the prior art in providing in one aspect a computer system and method in which internal and external hypertext link definitions are displayed in different representations to simplify a user's recognition of the external\/internal status of each hypertext link definition in a document. Consistent with another aspect of the invention, additional information regarding internal hypertext link definitions may also be provided to a user. For example, in one aspect a user may be informed of the direction from an internal hypertext link definition to the location in the document pointed to by that definition. In another aspect, a user may be informed of the position in the document, whether absolute or relative, of the location pointed to by an internal hypertext link definition.","Using any or all of the information supplied to a user about the hypertext link definitions in a document, a user can often make a more informed decision as to whether it would be productive to take any given link in the document. As a result, the number of unproductive links that are taken may be minimized, often making browsing a more enjoyable and productive task.","Consistent with another aspect of the invention, a computer system and method may also be provided for displaying in a window a hypertext document with an internal hypertext link definition, with the position of the location pointed to by the internal hypertext link definition indicated on a scroll bar displayed in the window. Given that one principal use of a scroll bar is in indicating where a user is located in a given document displayed in a window, the additional functionality imparted to a scroll bar consistent with the invention efficiently centralizes location information about a particular document within a common user interface component.","These and other advantages and features, which characterize the invention, are set forth in the claims annexed hereto and forming a further part hereof. However, for a better understanding of the invention, and of the advantages and objectives attained through its use, reference should be made to the Drawing, and to the accompanying descriptive matter, in which there is described exemplary embodiments of the invention.","The embodiments of the invention described hereinafter visually distinguish between internal and external hypertext link definitions, as well as optionally provide direction and\/or position information for the same. The embodiments discussed hereinafter may find applicability, for example, with hypertext documents in an HTML format, e.g., as used on the World Wide Web (among other applications). However, it should be appreciated that other hypertext document formats may be used in the alternative.","In general, a hypertext document may include any collection of information whether stored in one or more specific files on a computer, in one or more records in a database, etc. Hypertext documents typically include text, but may also include various multimedia objects such as images, sound, animation, video clips, etc.","A hypertext link definition is typically rendered in a hypertext document and may be selected by a user to invoke a link defined in the hypertext link definition. An external hypertext link typically includes the location of a target, typically including a uniform resource locator (URL) having a different resource than the current document. An external hypertext link may also include a specific location in another document when an anchor reference is appended to the URL.","An internal hypertext link typically includes a fragment URL that refers to an anchor within the same document as the definition. The anchor is typically designated by a \u201c#\u201d followed by an anchor token. An internal hypertext link definition points to the same resource as the current document, although this resource information may or may not be included in the URL specified in the definition.","Turning to the Drawing, wherein like numbers denote like parts throughout the several views, a computer system  consistent with the invention is illustrated in . Computer system  is illustrated as a networked computer system including one or more client computer systems ,  and  (e.g., desktop or personal computers, workstations, etc.) coupled to server system  through a network . Network  may represent practically any type of networked interconnection, including but not limited to local-area, wide-area, wireless, and public networks (e.g., the Internet). Moreover, any number of computers and other devices may be networked through network , e.g., multiple servers. Furthermore, it should be appreciated that the principles of the invention may be utilized as well by stand-alone computers and associated devices consistent with the invention.","Computer system , which may be similar to computer systems , , may include a processor such as a microprocessor ; a number of peripheral components such as a computer display  (e.g., a CRT, an LCD display or other display device); storage devices  such as hard, floppy, and\/or CD-ROM disk drives; a printer ; and various input devices (e.g., a mouse  and keyboard ), among others. Computer system  operates under the control of an operating system, and executes various computer software applications, programs, objects, modules, etc. For example, one such computer software application is a hypertext browser , a window of which is displayed on computer display . Moreover, various applications, programs, objects, modules, etc. may also execute on one or more processors in server  or other computer systems , , e.g., in a distributed computing environment.","In general, the routines executed to implement the illustrated embodiments of the invention, whether implemented as part of an operating system or a specific application, program, object, module or sequence of instructions will be referred to herein as \u201ccomputer programs\u201d. The computer programs typically comprise instructions which, when read and executed by one or more processors in the devices or systems in networked computer system , cause those devices or systems to perform the steps necessary to execute steps or elements embodying the various aspects of the invention. Moreover, while the invention has and hereinafter will be described in the context of fully functioning computer systems, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the various embodiments of the invention are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, and that the invention applies equally regardless of the particular type of signal bearing media used to actually carry out the distribution. Examples of signal bearing media include but are not limited to recordable type media such as volatile and non-volatile memory devices, floppy disks, hard disk drives, CD-ROM's, DVD's, and transmission type media such as digital and analog communications links.","Those skilled in the art will recognize that the exemplary environment illustrated in  is not intended to limit the present invention. Indeed, those skilled in the art will recognize that other alternative hardware environments may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","21","28","21","26","27","20","10","18","23","21","22","20","21","18","22","23","26","27","28"]},"A browser  is illustrated as resident in memory . However, it should be appreciated that browser  may be stored on network  or mass storage  prior to start-up, and in addition, may have various components that are resident at different times in any of memory , mass storage , network , or within registers and\/or caches in processor .","Browser  processes hypertext documents for viewing. The hypertext documents may be retrieved from mass storage  or over network , e.g., through an Internet connection. Moreover, hypertext documents may be cached from time to time in the memory  and\/or mass storage  once they are viewed to accelerate subsequent viewing by a user.","It should be appreciated that other software environments may be utilized in the alternative.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["50","30","50"]},"Routine  begins in block  by waiting for system events, in a manner known in the art. Events which are not relevant to an understanding of the invention are handled in a conventional manner as represented by block . For example, events such as scrolling, link selection, window resizing, and other conventional browser events, may be handled in a manner known in the art.","One event which is relevant to the invention, however, is a display document event which is detected at block . In response to this event, a parse document routine  is executed to generate a data structure with the formatting information for each display object in a hypertext document, and a render document routine  is called that utilizes the parse data structure generated by parse document routine  to display each display object in the hypertext document on the computer display.","Parse document routine  is illustrated in greater detail in . As illustrated at block , routine  typically performs general parsing operations well-known in the art. Upon completion of these operations, a loop is initiated at block  to scan for internal hypertext link definitions in a hypertext document. Starting at block , a while loop executes until each hypertext link definition in the hypertext document has been scanned. In block , the next hypertext link definition in the hypertext document is retrieved. Next, in block , the link definition is scanned to determine whether the definition relates to an internal or external link. For example, to determine an internal link, block  may look for an anchor reference with a URL having either no resource information or the same resource information as the current document.","If the link definition is determined to be an external link, control passes back to block  to retrieve the next link definition. If, however, the link definition is for an internal link, one or both of blocks  and  are optionally performed to determine specific information relating to the internal hypertext link definition.","Block  determines a direction for the internal hypertext link definition by comparing the location of the link definition to that of the target referenced therein. In addition, block  may also determine if the target is located at the top or bottom of a document and set an appropriate flag indicating such.","Block  determines the relative or absolute position of the target of the link definition by comparing the location of the target to that of the link definition.","Block  may determine an absolute position that is representative of the actual location of the target in the document. The absolute position is typically independent of the location of the link definition and may be indicated by various numerical indicators such as line number, column number, byte number and\/or x, y coordinates, among others. The absolute position may also be stored as a specific value, or as a percentage of the overall size of the document.","Block  may also calculate a relative position of the target relative to the link definition. The relative position may be stored as a specific distance, e.g., in terms of line number, column number, byte number, character number, and\/or x, y coordinates, among others. The relative location may also be stored as a percentage of the document size, for example.","As an example, if a document has ten lines with an internal hypertext link definition defined at line three and pointing to a target located at line eight, the absolute position of the target may be stored as a numerical indicator, such as line eight, or a percentage indicator, such as eighty percent (indicating that the target is located eighty percent of the way through the document). A relative position may also be stored as a numerical value such as line five, indicating that the target is five lines away from the internal link definition. In the alternative, the relative position may be stored as a percentage such as fifty percent, indicating that the target is half the document size away from the internal hypertext link definition.","It should be appreciated that the direction and position information may also be combined into the same value. For example, a negative relative position may indicate a backwards direction, with a positive relative position indicating a forward direction.","Once direction and\/or position information are optionally determined, block  sets the display attributes for the internal hypertext link definition. For example, a flag may be set to indicate the internal status of the definition. In addition, the direction and\/or position information may be stored in the display attributes. The display attributes may represent any suitable data structure, e.g., nodes in a parse tree, as is known in the art. Upon completion of block , control passes back to block  to scan the remaining hypertext link definitions in the hypertext document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["58","58","86","88","98","58","90"]},"Whenever a display object for an internal hypertext link definition is detected at block , control passes to block  to optionally determine whether internal links have been enabled. In particular, a user may be given the option of disabling internal links so that the links may not be navigated, or may not even be shown. This may be performed, for example, by setting the display properties for internal links to be that of the surrounding text such that the links are not highlighted to a user. Also, the selection of internal links may be disabled in the link selection handling routines for the browser. In general, this optional functionality may be desired by some users should they never wish to be informed of internal links within documents. However, it should be appreciated that this function may be omitted in the alternative.","If block  determines that internal links have been enabled, control is passed to execute either or both of blocks  and . Block  renders a link definition using the representation selected by the user for internal hypertext link definitions. Block  displays direction and\/or position indicators in conjunction with, or in lieu of, a link definition rendered in block . As discussed below, some indicators may indicate various combinations of internal\/external status, direction, and\/or position. Consequently, it may not be necessary to render separate link definitions, direction indicators and position indicators. For example, just the fact that a direction and\/or position indication is provided may be sufficient to indicate the internal\/external status of a link without a separate representation. In addition, some position indicators inherently show direction, and therefore separate direction and position indicators may not be required.","Various modifications may be made to the routines disclosed in  consistent with the invention. For example, external hypertext link definitions may also be separately handled, with similar additional information generated for such links. Moreover, the position of the target in a new document may be calculated and utilized in rendering external hypertext link definitions.

discussed above, various internal status indications may be used to provide a visually distinct representation of an internal hypertext link definition compared to an external hypertext link definition. As shown in , for example, a window  for browser  displays hypertext document , which is the rendered representation of the source code shown above in Table I. Hypertext document  includes an internal definition  which points to target . In addition, an internal hypertext link definition  points to a target  and an internal hypertext link definition  points to a target . Moreover, an internal hypertext link definition  points to a target  that is disposed at the top of hypertext document . Finally, an external hypertext link definition is defined at .","As shown in , the internal and external hypertext link definitions may be distinguished by a display characteristic such as the manner in which each definition is formatted. For example, the internal hypertext link definitions , ,  and  are shown formatted with double underlines, with external hypertext link definition  formatted with a single underline. Other formatting or display characteristics may also be used to distinguish internal and external hypertext link definitions. For example, different colors, font faces\/sizes, styles (e.g., underline, italics, bold, etc.), and\/or other display characteristics may be used. In addition, animation techniques, e.g., blinking, may be used to distinguish one or both of the internal and external hypertext link definitions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["130","132","132"]},"Various manners may also be used to indicate direction information for an internal hypertext link definition. For example, as shown in , an internal hypertext link definition  includes a direction indicator  displayed as an arrow icon pointing in the direction of the target. It should be appreciated that icon  also functions as an internal status indication if no similar icons are used for external links. It should be appreciated that in the alternative various display characteristics such as colors, fonts, etc. may also be used to distinguish the direction of an internal hypertext link.","As shown in , an internal hypertext link definition  may also include a top\/bottom direction indicator  which separately indicates when an internal hypertext link definition points to the top or bottom of the document. Icon  may also utilize other representations to indicate the top or bottom of the document, e.g., \u201cT\u201d or \u201cB\u201d icons. In addition, different fonts, colors, etc. may also be used to distinguish top\/bottom indicators from standard direction indicators.","Various manners of indicating position may also be used consistent with the invention. For example,  illustrates an internal hypertext link definition  that has its text shaded or colored like a bar graph showing the percentage of the document where the target is located. In particular, definition  is rendered with different colors ,  that form a boundary therebetween illustrating the absolute position of the target.","In the alternative, as shown in , a combined direction\/position indicator  may be used to show both position and direction of an internal hypertext link definition . As shown in this figure, an arrow  is shaded like a vertical bar graph with the absolute position of the target located at the relative location in the document corresponding to the boundary between the two shadings for arrow . It should be appreciated that an icon may also be varied in other manners, e.g., varying the size or length of an arrow icon according the relative position of the target.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["162","164","170","162","166"]},"This figure also illustrates that graphical information, such as a graphical depiction  of the hypertext document, may be included. Depiction  also includes an indicator  showing the position of the target and\/or the link definition in the document. One suitable indicator is that of an arrow which extends from the link definition to the location of the target thereto.","It should be appreciated that pop-up window  may be displayed in other containers such as another window or a panel in the current window. For example, a continuous display of a graphical depiction of the document may be shown, with the arrow illustrating the internal hypertext link definition activated only when the internal hypertext link definition has focus.","Various modifications may be made to the above-described embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, separate external hypertext link indicators may be used, such as specific colors, icons, etc. A door or arrow icon may be utilized to indicate that a link definition points to a target that is external to the current document. Other modifications will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.","An additional manner of displaying status, direction and\/or position information regarding an internal hypertext link definition may be to integrate such information into a scroll bar for the browser window in which a hypertext document is displayed. It should be appreciated that a scroll bar already displays the relative location of the information on the hypertext document that is currently displayed in the window. In addition, it should be appreciated that in some operating systems, the size of the slider used in the scroll bar may be varied to show the relative size of the information that is currently displayed in the window. Accordingly, by providing status, direction and\/or position information within a scroll bar, a centralized user interface component may be used to view a wide variety of location information for a document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["200","30","202","204","54","50","204","56","58"]},"Block  handles mouse movement events, with any additional events received by browser  handled by block  in a manner known in the art. If a mouse movement event is detected, block  is executed to determine whether focus has been placed on an internal hypertext link definition. If so, block  is executed to set an indicate position flag for the internal hypertext link definition, and block  is executed to display a position indicator on the window scroll bar. Blocks  and  may be implemented, for example, in an object-oriented system by creating a subclassed scroll bar control having a position indicator object that can be rendered in conjunction with the rendering of the scroll bar on a window. Such a subclassed object may include a method such as an IndicateTargetPosition( ) method that sets or clears a flag and receives position information for the internal hypertext link definition and\/or its target. Such information then may be used during rendering of the scroll bar to determine if and where to render an indicator on the scroll bar indicating information about the internal hypertext link definition. Other manners of implementing an indicator overlapping a scroll bar may be used in the alternative.","Returning to block , if focus is not on an internal link, control passes to block  to clear the indicate position flag for the internal hypertext link definition, and to hide the position indicator on the scroll bar. Next, in block , other mouse movement events received via block , e.g., focus being placed on other display objects, are handled in a manner known in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIGS. 14 and 15","FIG. 14"],"b":["220","232","234","226","236","232","236","238","226","236","232","236","234"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 14"],"b":["240","250","252","254","242","242","244","242","246","254"]},"It should be appreciated that various alternate indicator representations may be used in the alternative. For example, the positions of multiple internal link definition targets may be displayed simultaneously on a scroll bar, typically without requiring the user to focus on a particular link definition. In such applications, it may be desirable to use different colors to coordinate position indicators with particular link definitions. Also, other manners of coordinating position indicators and link definitions, e.g., icons or alphanumeric identifiers, may be used. For example, different geometric shapes, or different letters or numbers, may be appended to link definitions and displayed on the scroll bar to illustrate the position of each link definition target in the document.","Various additional modifications may be made to the above-described embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
