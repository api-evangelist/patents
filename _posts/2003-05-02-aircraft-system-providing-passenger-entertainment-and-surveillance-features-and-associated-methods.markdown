{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/544,883 filed Apr. 7, 2000, now U.S. Pat No. 6,748,597 the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to the field of aircraft systems, and more particularly, to an aircraft system providing passenger entertainment and aircraft surveillance.","Commercial aircraft carry millions of passengers each year. For relatively long international flights, wide-body aircraft are typically used. These aircraft include multiple passenger aisles and have considerably more space than typical so called narrow-body aircraft. Narrow-body aircraft carry fewer passengers shorter distances, and include only a single aisle for passenger loading and unloading. Accordingly, the available space for ancillary equipment is somewhat limited on a narrow-body aircraft.","Wide-body aircraft may include full audio and video entertainment systems for passenger enjoyment during relatively long flights. Typical wide-body aircraft entertainment systems may include cabin displays, or individual seatback displays. Movies or other stored video programming is selectable by the passenger, and payment is typically made via a credit card reader at the seat. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,568,484 to Margis discloses a passenger entertainment system with an integrated telecommunications system. A magnetic stripe credit card reader is provided at the telephone handset, and processing to approve the credit card is performed by a cabin telecommunications unit.","In addition to prerecorded video entertainment, other systems have been disclosed including a satellite receiver for live television broadcasts, such as disclosed in French Patent No. 2,652,701 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,790,175 to Sklar et al. The Sklar et al. patent also discloses such a system including an antenna and its associated steering control for receiving both RHCP and LHCP signals from direct broadcast satellite (DBS) services. The video signals for the various channels are then routed to a conventional video and audio distribution system on the aircraft which distributes live television programming to the passengers.","In addition, U.S. Pat. No. 5,801,751 also to Sklar et al. addresses the problem of an aircraft being outside of the range of satellites, by storing the programming for delayed playback, and additionally discloses two embodiments\u2014a full system for each passenger and a single channel system for the overhead monitors for a group of passengers. The patent also discloses steering the antenna so that it is locked onto RF signals transmitted by the satellite. The antenna steering may be based upon the aircraft navigation system or a CPS receiver along with inertial reference signals.","A typical aircraft entertainment system for displaying TV broadcasts may include one or more satellite antennas, headend electronic equipment at a central location in the aircraft, a cable distribution network extending throughout the passenger cabin, and electronic demodulator and distribution modules spaced within the cabin for different groups of seats. Many systems require signal attenuators or amplifiers at predetermined distances along the cable distribution network. In addition, each passenger seat may include an armrest control and seatback display. In other words, such systems may be relatively heavy and consume valuable space on the aircraft. Space and weight are especially difficult constraints for a narrow-body aircraft.","Published European Patent Application No. 557,058, for example, discloses a video and audio distribution system for an aircraft wherein the analog video signals are modulated upon individual RF carriers in a relatively low frequency range, and digitized audio signals, including digitized data, are modulated upon an RF carrier of a higher frequency to avoid interference with the modulated video RF carriers. All of the video and audio signals are carried by coaxial cables to area distribution boxes. Each area distribution box, in turn, provides individual outputs to its own group of floor distribution boxes. Each output line from a floor distribution box is connected to a single line of video seat electronic boxes (VSEB). The VSEB may service up to five or more individual seats. At each seat there is a passenger control unit and a seat display unit. Each passenger control unit includes a set of channel select buttons and a pair of audio headset jacks. Each display unit includes a video tuner that receives video signals from the VSEB and controls a video display.","A typical cable distribution network within an aircraft may be somewhat similar to a conventional coaxial cable TV system. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,214,505 to Rabowsky et al. discloses an aircraft video distribution system including amplifiers, taps and splitters positioned at mutually distant stations and with some of the stations being interconnected by relatively long lengths of coaxial cable. A variable equalizer is provided at points in the distribution system to account for different cable losses at different frequencies. The patent also discloses microprocessor-controlled monitoring and adjustment of various amplifiers to control tilt, that is, to provide frequency slope compensation. Several stations communicate with one another by a separate communication cable or service path independent of the RF coaxial cable. The patent further discloses maintenance features including reporting the nature and location of any failure or degradation of signals to a central location for diagnostic purposes.","Camera systems providing surveillance are also available for commercial aircraft. This is a particularly important feature provided to the pilot, which may be used to anticipate or even prevent in-flight disturbances by a passenger, for example. U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,828 to Feher discloses cameras internal as well as external the aircraft, with the images from these cameras being provided to the pilot for viewing. The disclosed camera system is a standalone surveillance system. That is, the surveillance system does not share any resources with any of the other systems on the aircraft. This type of configuration negatively affects the limited space and weight constraints, particularly for a narrow-body aircraft.","In contrast, European Patent No. 653,887 discloses an aircraft camera system integrated with an in-flight entertainment system. However, the images provided by the cameras are for passenger entertainment only. The cameras are placed in the cockpit area of the aircraft for providing take-off and landing images as viewed through the cockpit. Unfortunately, this is of little use in terms aircraft surveillance.","In view of the foregoing background, an object of the present invention is to provide an aircraft camera surveillance system and an in-flight entertainment system in accordance with space and weight constraints for an aircraft, particularly a narrow body aircraft.","This and other objects, advantages and features in accordance with the present invention are provided by an aircraft system comprising at least one entertainment source, at least one passenger display for displaying images from the at least one entertainment source, and a signal distribution network connecting the at least one entertainment source to the at least one passenger display. The aircraft system preferably further includes at least one camera for aircraft surveillance, and at least one pilot display for displaying images from the at least one camera. The signal distribution network also preferably connects the at least one camera to the at least one pilot display.","The at least one camera may be positioned to provides images of inside and\/or outside the aircraft. In one embodiment, a plurality of cameras are spaced throughout a cabin area of the aircraft. This advantageously allows the pilot to monitor the activities of the passengers. Since the signal distribution network is typically routed throughout the aircraft for connecting the entertainment source with the passenger displays, connection of the cameras and the pilot display may also be provided via the same signal distribution network. This advantageously eliminates hardware redundancy and is well-suited for the space and weight constraints of the aircraft.","The aircraft system preferably further includes a respective pilot control unit connected to each pilot display. The pilot control unit may include a camera select mode for selecting the images from a desired camera for viewing, and a scan mode for scanning the images from each camera.","In another embodiment, the at least one camera preferably comprises at least one passenger camera and at least one pilot camera. The passenger cameras are in the cabin area of the aircraft for providing images to the pilot display. The pilot camera is in a cockpit area of the aircraft for providing pilot images to the passenger displays. In addition to providing surveillance of the passengers via the cameras in the cabin area, images from the cockpit may be provided to the passengers for information purposes. For example, the pilot camera advantageously allows the pilot to be viewed while addressing the passengers prior to takeoff and landing, for example.","The aircraft system preferably further comprises a recording device for recording the images from the various cameras. This advantageously allows a particular incident to be later reviewed if necessary. In addition, a transmitter may be included as part of the aircraft system for transmitting the images to a location external the aircraft for remote viewing. The remote viewing may be while the aircraft is in-flight, or while the aircraft is on the ground.","Another aspect of the present invention is directed to a method for operating an aircraft system comprising at least one entertainment source, at least one passenger display, a signal distribution network connecting the least one entertainment source to the at least one passenger display, at least one camera for aircraft surveillance, at least one pilot display, and the signal distribution network connecting the at least one camera to the at least one pilot display. The method preferably comprises displaying images from the at least one entertainment source on the at least one passenger display, and displaying images from the at least one camera on the at least one pilot display.","The present invention will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout, and prime notation is used to indicate similar elements in alternate embodiments.","The major components of an in-flight entertainment system  in accordance with the present invention are initially described with reference to . The system  receives television and\/or audio broadcast signals via one or more geostationary satellites . The geostationary satellite  may be fed programming channels from a terrestrial station  as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.","The in-flight entertainment system  includes an antenna system  to be mounted on the fuselage  of the aircraft . In addition, the system  also includes one or more multi-channel receiver modulators (MRMs) , a cable distribution network , a plurality of seat electronic boxes (SEBs)  spaced about the aircraft cabin, and video display units (VDUs)  for the passengers and which are connected to the SEBs. In the illustrated embodiment, the system  receives, distributes, and decodes the DBS transmissions from the DBS satellite . In other embodiments, the system  may receive video or TV signals from other classes of satellites as will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art.","The antenna system  delivers DBS signals to the MRMs  for processing. For example, each MRM  may include twelve DBS receivers and twelve video\/audio RF modulators. The twelve receivers recover the digitally encoded multiplexed data for twelve television programs as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.","As shown in the more detailed schematic diagram of , an audio video modulator (AVM)  is connected to the MRMs , as well as a number of other inputs and outputs. The AVM  illustratively receives inputs from an external camera , as well as one or more other video sources , such as videotape sources, and receives signal inputs from one or more audio sources  which may also be prerecorded, for example. A PA keyline input and PA audio input are provided for passenger address and video address override. Audio for any receiver along with an associated keyline are provided as outputs from the MRM so that the audio may be broadcast over the cabin speaker system, for example, as will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art. In the illustrated embodiment, a control panel  is provided as part of the AVM . The control panel  not only permits control of the system, but also displays pertinent system information and permits various diagnostic or maintenance activities to be quickly and easily performed.","The AVM  is also illustratively coupled to a ground data link radio transceiver , such as for permitting downloading or uploading of data or programming information. The AVM  is also illustratively interfaced to an air-to-ground telephone system  as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.","The AVM  illustratively generates a number of NTSC video outputs which may be fed to one or more retractable monitors  spaced throughout the cabin. Power is preferably provided by the aircraft 400 Hz AC power supply as will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Of course, in some embodiments, the retractable monitors may not be needed.","The MRMs  may perform system control, and status monitoring. An RF distribution assembly (RDA)  can be provided to combine signals from a number of MRMs, such as four, for example. The RDA  combines the MRM RF outputs to create a single RF signal comprising up to  audio\/video channels, for example. The RDA  amplifies and distributes the composite RF signal to a predetermined number of zone cable outputs. Eight zones are typical for a typical narrow-body single-aisle aircraft . Depending on the aircraft, not all eight outputs may be used. Each cable will serve a zone of seatgroups  in the passenger cabin.","Referring now more specifically to the lower portion of  and also to , distribution of the RF signals and display of video to the passengers is now further described. Each zone cable  feeds the RF signal to a group of contiguous seatgroups  along either the right or left hand side of the passenger aisle. In the illustrated embodiment, the seatgroup  includes three side-by-side seats , although this number may also be two for other types of conventional narrow-body aircraft.","The distribution cables  are connected to the first SEB  in each respective right or left zone. The other SEBs  are daisy-chained together with seat-to-seat cables. The zone feed, and seat-to-seat cables preferably comprise an RF audio video coaxial cable, a 400 cycle power cable, and RS 485 data wiring.","For each seat  in the group , the SEB  tunes to and demodulates one of the RF modulated audio\/video channels. The audio and video are output to the passenger video display units (VDUs)  and headphones , respectively. The tuner channels are under control of the passenger control unit (PCU) , typically mounted in the armrest of the seat , and which also carries a volume control.","Each VDU  may be a flat panel color display mounted in the seatback. The VDU  may also be mounted in the aircraft bulkhead in other configurations as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. The VDU  will also typically include associated therewith a user payment card reader . The payment card reader  may be a credit card reader, for example, of the type that reads magnetically encoded information from a stripe carried by the card as the user swipes the card through a slot in the reader as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. In some embodiments, the credit card data may be processed on the aircraft to make certain processing decisions relating to validity, such as whether the card is expired, for example. As described in greater detail below, the payment card reader  may also be used as the single input required to activate the system for enhanced user convenience.","Having now generally described the major components of the in-flight entertainment system  and their overall operation, the description now is directed to several important features and capabilities of the system in greater detail. One such feature relates to flexibility or upgradability of the system as may be highly desirable for many airline carriers. In particular, the system  is relatively compact and relatively inexpensive so that it can be used on narrow-body aircraft , that is, single-aisle aircraft. Such narrow-body aircraft  are in sharp contrast to wide-body aircraft typically used on longer overseas flights and which can typically carry greater volumes and weight. The narrow-body aircraft  are commonly used on shorter domestic flights","The system , for example, can be first installed to provide only audio. In addition, the first class passengers may be equipped with seat back VDUs , while the coach section includes only aisle mounted video screens. The important aspect that permits upgradability is that the full cable distribution system is installed initially to thereby have the capacity to handle the upgrades. In other words, the present invention permits upgrading and provides reconfiguration options to the air carrier for an in-flight entertainment system and while reducing downtime for such changes.","The cable distribution system is modeled after a conventional ground based cable TV system in terms of signal modulation, cabling, drops, etc. Certain changes are made to allocate the available channels, such as forty-eight, so as not to cause potential interference problems with other equipment aboard the aircraft  as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. In addition, there are basically no active components along the cable distribution path that may fail, for example. The cable distribution system also includes zones of seatgroups . The zones provide greater robustness in the event of a failure. The zones can also be added, such as to provide full service throughout the cabin.","Referring now additionally to the flow chart of , a method for installing and operating an aircraft in-flight entertainment system in accordance with the invention is now described. After the start (Block ), the method preferably comprises installing at least one entertainment source on the aircraft at Block . The entertainment source may include a satellite TV source, such as provided by the DBS antenna system  and MRMs  described above. The method at Block  also preferably includes installing a plurality of spaced apart signal distribution devices, each generating audio signals for at least one passenger in an audio-only mode, and generating audio and video signals to at least one passenger in an audio\/video mode. These devices may be the SEBs  described above as will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. The SEBs  include the capability for both audio and video when initially installed to thereby provide the flexibility for upgrading.","At Block  the cable network is installed on the aircraft  connecting the at least one entertainment source to the signal distribution devices. In other words, the MRMs  are connected to the SEBs  in the various equipped zones throughout the aircraft . Operating the aircraft in-flight entertainment system  at Block  with at least one predetermined signal distribution device in the audio-only mode, permits initial weight and cost savings since the VDUs , for example, may not need to be initially installed for all passengers as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. For example, a carrier may initially decide to equip first class passengers with both video and audio entertainment options, while coach passengers are initially limited to audio only. Hence, the cost of the VDUs  for the coach passengers is initially deferred.","Installing the cabling  and SEBs  at one time will result in substantial time and labor savings as compared to a piecemeal approach to adding these components at a later time as needed. Accordingly, should an upgrade be desired at Block , this may be readily accomplished by connecting at least one VDU  to the at least one predetermined signal distribution device, or SEB , to operate in the audio\/video mode and while leaving the cable network unchanged (Block ). Accordingly, the downtime experienced by an air carrier is greatly reduced over other systems which require significant recabling and other difficult equipment installation operations for upgrading. The method is particularly advantageous for a single-aisle narrow-body aircraft  as shown in the illustrated embodiment, where cost effectiveness and low weight are especially important.","As noted above, the entertainment source may preferably comprise a DBS receiver. The step of later upgrading may further comprise leaving the at least one predetermined signal distribution device, such as the SEB , unchanged. The step of installing the cable network  may comprise installing coaxial cable, power cable and data cable throughout the aircraft as also described above. The step of later upgrading may include installing at least one VDU  in the aircraft , such as on backs of passenger seats .","Of course, the aircraft  in some embodiments may include different seating classes as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Accordingly, another important aspect of the invention relates to offering different entertainment services based upon the different seating classes at Block . In addition, the different seating classes may be reconfigurable, and the step of reconfiguring offered entertainment services may then be based upon reconfiguring of the seating classes. The offering of different entertainment services may comprise offering different packages of television channels, for example. In addition, the step of offering different entertainment services may comprise offering audio-only and audio\/video modes of operation based upon seating classes.","Yet another aspect of the invention relates to a method for operating an aircraft in-flight entertainment system  for an aircraft  when seating classes are reconfigured. Continuing down the flowchart of , this aspect of the method preferably comprises determining whether a reconfiguration is desired at Block , and reconfiguring offered entertainment services based upon reconfiguring of the seating classes at Block  before stopping at Block . For example, the step of offering different entertainment services may include offering different packages of television channels. Alternately, the step of offering different entertainment services may comprise offering audio-only and audio\/video modes of operation based upon seating classes. In either case, the reconfiguring can be readily accomplished using the existing cable distribution network  and distribution devices, that is, SEBs  as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.","The various upgrading and reconfiguring aspects of the in-flight entertainment system  can be performed in a reverse sequence than that illustrated in  and described above. of course, the upgrade steps may be practiced without the later reconfiguring steps as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.","To further illustrate the method aspects, the flowchart of  is directed to the subset of offering different services and later reconfiguring those services based upon reconfiguring seating. More particularly, from the start (Block ), the in-flight entertainment system  is installed (Block ) and operated (Block ) for offering different services based upon seating class, such as offering video to first class passengers, and offering only audio to non-first class passengers. If it is determined that the seating should be reconfigured at Block , then the in-flight entertainment system  can be readily reconfigured at Block  before stopping (Block ).","Turning now additionally to , advantages and features of the antenna system  are now described in greater detail. The antenna system  includes an antenna  which may be positioned or steered by one or more antenna positioners  as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. In addition, one or more position encoders  may also be associated with the antenna  to steer the antenna to thereby track the DBS satellite or satellites . Of course, a positioning motor and associated encoder may be provided together within a common housing, as will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art. In accordance with one significant advantage of the present invention, the antenna  may be steered using received signals in the relatively wide bandwidth of at least one DBS transponder.","More particularly, the antenna system  includes an antenna steering controller , which, in turn, comprises the illustrated full transponder bandwidth received signal detector . This detector  generates a received signal strength feedback signal based upon signals received from the full bandwidth of a DBS transponder rather than a single demodulated programming channel, for example. Of course, in other embodiments the same principles can be employed for other classes or types of satellites than the DBS satellites described herein by way of example.","In the illustrated embodiment, the detector  is coupled to the output of the illustrated intermediate frequency interface (IFI)  which converts the received signals to one or more intermediate frequencies for further processing by the MRMs  as described above and as will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. In other embodiments, signal processing circuitry, other than that in the IFI  may also be used to couple the received signal from one or more full satellite transponders to the received signal strength detector  as will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art.","A processor  is illustratively connected to the received signal strength detector  for controlling the antenna steering positioners  during aircraft flight and based upon the received signal strength feedback signal. Accordingly, tracking of the satellite or satellites  is enhanced and signal service reliability is also enhanced.","The antenna steering controller  may further comprise at least one inertial rate sensor  as shown in the illustrated embodiment, such as for roll, pitch or yaw as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. The rate sensor  may be provided by one or more solid state gyroscopes, for example. The processor  may calibrate the rate sensor  based upon the received signal strength feedback signal.","The illustrated antenna system  also includes a global positioning system (GPS) antenna  to be carried by the aircraft fuselage . This may preferably be provided as part of an antenna assembly package to be mounted on the upper portion of the fuselage. The antenna assembly may also include a suitable radome, not shown, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. The antenna steering controller  also illustratively includes a GPS receiver  connected to the processor . The processor  may further calibrate the rate sensor  based upon signals from the GPS receiver as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.","As will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the processor  may be a commercially available microprocessor operating under stored program control. Alternately, discrete logic and other signal processing circuits may be used for the processor . This is also the case for the other portions or circuit components described as a processor herein as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. The advantageous feature of this aspect of the invention is that the full or substantially full bandwidth of the satellite transponder signal is processed for determining the received signal strength, and this provides greater reliability and accuracy for steering the antenna .","Another advantage of the antenna system  is that it may operate independently of the aircraft navigation system  which is schematically illustrated in the lower right hand portion of . In other words, the aircraft  may include an aircraft navigation system , and the antenna steering controller  may operate independently of this aircraft navigation system. Thus, the antenna steering may operate faster and without potential unwanted effects on the aircraft navigation system  as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. In addition, the antenna system  is also particularly advantageous for a single-aisle narrow-body aircraft  where cost effectiveness and low weight are especially important.","Turning now additionally to , another embodiment of the antenna system \u2032 is now described which-includes yet further advantageous features. This embodiment is directed to functioning in conjunction with the three essentially collocated geostationary satellites for the DIRECTV\u00ae DBS service, although the invention is applicable in other situations as well. For example, the DIRECTV\u00ae satellites may be positioned above the earth at 101 degrees west longitude and spaced 0.5 degrees from each other. Of course, these DIRECTV\u00ae satellites may also be moved from these example locations, and more than three satellites may be so collocated. Considered in somewhat broader terms, these features of the invention are directed to two or more essentially collocated geostationary satellites. Different circular polarizations are implemented for reused frequencies as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.","In this illustrated embodiment, the antenna \u2032 is a multi beam antenna having an antenna boresight (indicated by reference B), and also defining right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) and left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP) beams (designated RHCP and LHCP in ) which are offset from the antenna boresight. Moreover, the beams RHCP, LHCP are offset from one another by a beam offset angle \u03b1 which is greatly exaggerated in the figure for clarity. This beam offset angle \u03b1 is less than the angle \u03b2 defined by the spacing defined by the satellites , . The transponder or satellite spacing angle \u03b2 is about . degrees, and the beam offset angle \u03b1 is preferably less than 0.5 degrees, and may be about 0.2 degrees, for example.","The beam offset angle provides a squinting effect which allows the antenna \u2032 to be made longer and thinner than would otherwise be required, and the resulting shape is highly desirable for aircraft mounting as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. The squinting also allows the antenna to be constructed to have additional signal margin when operating in rain, for example, as will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art.","The multi-beam antenna \u2032 may be readily constructed in a phased array form or in a mechanical form as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art without requiring further discussion herein. Aspects of similar antennas are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,604,624 to Amitay et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,617,108 to Silinsky et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,413,263 also to Amitay et al.; the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The processor \u2032 preferably steers the antenna \u2032 based upon received signals from at least one of the RHCP and LHCP beams which are processed via the IFI \u2032 and input into respective received signal strength detectors , of the antenna steering controller \u2032. In one embodiment, the processor \u2032 steers the multi-beam antenna \u2032 based on a selected master one of the RHCP and LHCP beams and slaves the other beam therefrom.","In another embodiment, the processor \u2032 steers the multi-beam antenna \u2032 based on a predetermined contribution from each of the RHCP and LHCP beams. For example, the contribution may be the same for each beam. In other words, the steering or tracking may such as to average the received signal strengths from each beam as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. As will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art, other fractions or percentages can also be used. Of course, the advantage of receiving signals from two different satellites , is that more programming channels may then be made available to the passengers.","The antenna system \u2032 may also advantageously operate independent of the aircraft navigation system \u2032. The other elements of  are indicated by prime notation and are similar to those described above with respect to . Accordingly, these similar elements need no further discussion.","Another aspect of the invention relates to the inclusion of adaptive polarization techniques which may be used to avoid interference from other satellites. In particular, low earth orbit satellites (LEOS) are planned which may periodically be in position to cause interference with the signal reception by the in-flight entertainment system . Adaptive polarization techniques would also be desirable should assigned orbital slots for satellites be moved closer together.","Accordingly, the processor \u2032 may preferably be configured to perform adaptive polarization techniques to avoid or reduce the impact of such potential interference. Other adaptive polarization techniques may also be used. Suitable adaptive polarization techniques are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,027,124 to Fitzsimmons et al; U.S. Pat. No. 5,649,318 to Lusignan; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,309,167 to Cluniat et al. The entire disclosures of each of these patents is incorporated herein by reference. Those of skill in the art will readily appreciate the implementation of such adaptive polarization techniques with the in-flight entertainment system  in accordance with the present invention without further discussion.","Other aspects and advantages of the in-flight entertainment system  of the present invention are now explained with reference to . The system  advantageously incorporates a number of self-test or maintenance features. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the maintenance costs to operate such a system  could be significantly greater than the original purchase price. Accordingly, the system  includes test and diagnostic routines to pinpoint defective equipment. In particular, the system  provides the graphical representation of the aircraft seating arrangement to indicate class of service, equipment locations, and failures of any of the various components to aid in maintenance.","As shown in , the system  includes a control panel display , and a processor  connected to the control panel display. The control panel display  and processor  may be part of the AVM  (), but could be part of one or more of the MRMs  (), or part of another monitoring device as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. The control panel display  may be touch screen type display including designated touch screen input areas -to also accept user inputs as would also be appreciated by those skilled in the art.","More particularly, the processor  generates a seating layout image  of the aircraft on the control panel display  with locations of the signal distribution devices located on the seating layout image. These locations need not be exact, but should be sufficient to direct the service technician to the correct left or right side of the passenger aisle, and locate the seatgroup and\/or seat location for the defective or failed component. In addition, the locations need not be constantly displayed; rather, the location of the component may only be displayed when service is required, for example.","The processor  also preferably generates information relating to operation of the signal distribution devices on the display. The signal distribution devices, for example, may comprise demodulators (SEBs ), modulators (MRMs ), or the video passenger displays (VDUs ), for example. Accordingly, a user or technician can readily determine a faulty component and identify its location in the aircraft.","As shown in the illustrated embodiment of , the representative information is a failed power supply module of the # SEB of zone . In , the information is for a failed # MRM. This information is illustratively displayed in text with an indicator pointing to the location of the device. In other embodiments, a flashing icon or change of color could be used to indicate the component or signal distribution device requiring service as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.","This component mapping and service needed feature of the invention can be extended to other components of the system  as will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. For example, the processor  may further generate information relating to operation of the entertainment source, such as the DBS receiver, or its antenna as shown in . Again, the technician may be guided to the location of the failed component from the seat image layout .","Returning again briefly to , another aspect of the invention relates to display of the correct seating layout  for the corresponding aircraft . As shown, the display  may also include an aircraft-type field  which identifies the particular aircraft, such as an MD-80. The corresponding seating layout data can be downloaded to the memory  or the processor  by a suitable downloading device, such as the illustrated laptop computer . In other embodiments, the processor  may be connected to a disk drive or other data downloading device to receive the seat layout data.","The seat layout data would also typically include the data for the corresponding locations of the devices installed as part of the in-flight entertainment system  on the aircraft as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Accordingly, upgrades or changes in the system  configuration may thus be readily accommodated.","Another aspect of the invention relates to a soft failure mode and is explained with reference to . A typical DBS system provides a default text message along the lines \u201csearching for satellite\u201d based upon a weak or missing signal from the satellite. Of course, an air traveler may become disconcerted by such a message, since this may raise possible questions about the proper operation of the aircraft. In other systems, a weak received signal may cause the displayed image to become broken up, which may also be disconcerting to the air traveler.","The system  as shown in  of the present invention includes a processor  which may detect the undesired condition in the form of a weak or absent received signal strength, and cause the passenger video display  to display a substitute image. More particularly, the processor  may be part of the AVM  as described above, could be part of another device, such as the MRM , or could be a separate device.","The processor  illustratively includes a circuit or portion  for determining a weak received signal strength as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Suitable circuit constructions for the weak received signal strength determining portion or circuit  will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art, and require no further discussion herein. The threshold for the weak received signal strength determining portion or circuit  can preferably be set so as to trigger the substitute image before substantial degradation occurs, or before a text default message would otherwise be triggered, depending on the satellite service provider, as would be appreciated by those skilled in the art. In addition, the substitute image could be triggered for a single programming channel upon a weakness or loss of only that single programming channel, or may be generated across the board for all programming channels as will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art.","In the illustrated system  of , a substitute image storage device  is coupled to the processor . This device  may be a digital storage device or a video tape player, for example, for causing the passenger video display  to show a substitute image. For example, the image could be a text message, such as \u201cLiveTV\u2122 Service Temporarily Unavailable, Please Stand By\u201d. Of course, other similar messages or images are also contemplated by the invention, and which tend to be helpful to the passenger in understanding a loss of programming service has occurred, but without raising unnecessary concern for the proper operation of the aircraft  to the passenger.","This concept of a soft failure mode, may also be carried forward or applied to a component malfunction, for example. As shown in the system \u2032 of , a component malfunctioning determining portion or circuit \u2032 is added to the processor \u2032 and can be used in combination with the weak received signal strength determining portion \u2032. Of course, in other embodiments the malfunction determining circuit portion \u2032 could be used by itself. Again, rather than have a disconcerting image appear on the passenger's video display \u2032, a substitute image may be provided. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the weak received signal strength and component malfunction are representative of types of undesired conditions that the present system  may determine and provide a soft failure mode for. The other elements of  are indicated by prime notation and are similar to those described above with respect to . Accordingly, these similar elements need no further discussion.","Yet another advantageous feature of the invention is now explained with reference to . Some commercial aircraft provide, on a common cabin display or overhead monitor, a simulated image of the aircraft as it moves across a map between its origin and destination. The image may also include superimposed data, such as aircraft position, speed, heading, altitude, etc. as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.","The in-flight entertainment system  of the invention determines or receives the aircraft position during flight and generates a moving map image  of the aircraft as a flight information video channel. Various flight parameters  can also be displayed along with the moving map image . This flight information channel is offered along with the DBS programming channels during aircraft flight. In the illustrated embodiment, the passenger may select the flight information channel to be displayed on the passenger video display  using the passenger control unit (PCU)  which is typically mounted in the armrest as described above. In other words, the flight information channel is integrated along with the entertainment programming channels from the DBS system.","As shown in the illustrated embodiment, the moving map image  including other related text, such as the flight parameters , may be generated by the illustrated AVM  and delivered through the signal distribution network  to the SEB . Since the antenna steering controller  () includes circuitry for determining the aircraft position, etc., these devices may be used in some embodiments for generating the moving map image as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.","For example, the GPS receiver  and its antenna  can be used to determine the aircraft position. The GPS receiver  is also used to steer the antenna in this embodiment. In other embodiments a separate GPS receiver may be used as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. As will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the inertial rate sensor(s)  of the antenna steering controller  may also be used in some embodiments for generating flight information.","The processor  illustratively includes a parameter calculator  for calculating the various displayed flight parameters  from the position signal inputs as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. For example, the parameter calculator  of the processor  may determine at least one of an aircraft direction, aircraft speed and aircraft altitude for display with the map image. Information may also be acquired from other aircraft systems, such as an altimeter , for example, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Also, the illustrated embodiment includes a map image storage device  which may include the various geographic maps used for the moving map image .","Weather information may also be added for display along with the moving map image . Further details on the generation and display of moving map images may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,884,219 to Curtwright et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,992,882 to Simpson et al., the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Referring now briefly additionally to , another embodiment of the system \u2032 including the capability to display a flight information channel among the offered DBS or satellite TV channels is now described. In this embodiment, a moving map image generator \u2032 is added as a separate device. In other words, in this embodiment, the flight channel signal is only carried through the distribution cable network \u2032 and delivered via the SEB \u2032 to the passenger video display \u2032, and there is no interface to the components of the antenna steering controller  as in the embodiment described with reference to . In this embodiment, the moving map image generator \u2032 may include its own position determining devices, such as a GPS receiver. Alternately, the moving map image generator \u2032 may also receive the position data or even the image signal from a satellite or terrestrial transmitter.","Referring now additionally to the flowchart of  and the associated schematic block diagram of , another advantageous aspect of the invention relating to initiation and payment is now described. In particular, from the start (Block ), the system  may be first powered up and it performs its test and maintenance checks at Block  as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. If the system components are determined to be operating correctly (Block ), the payment card readers  are monitored at Block . If there is a failure, an alarm may be generated (Block ) so that corrective action may be taken.","The payment card  carried and presented by the passenger for payment may be a credit card, for example, and which includes a plastic substrate  and a magnetic stripe  thereon. The payment card  may also be a debit card, an automated teller machine (ATM) card, a frequent flyer card, or a complimentary card provided by the airline or the entertainment service provider for example. Other types of payment cards are also contemplated by the present invention as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. The magnetic stripe  includes identification information thereon, and may also include expiration data encoded as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. In the illustrated embodiment, the card reader  is a swipe-type reader, wherein the passenger simply swipes the correctly oriented card  through a receiving channel or slot.","Other types of card readers are also contemplated by the present invention as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. For example, the system  can also be readily compatible with smart card technology. A smart card reader  is shown in the right hand portion of . As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the smart card  may include a plastic substrate  which carries an integrated circuit . The integrated circuit  is read or communicated with to arrange for payment. The connection to the integrated circuit  may be through contacts  carried by the substrate , or can be through short range wireless coupling as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.","In the illustrated embodiment, the passenger video display  is connected to the SEB , which in turn is connected, via the cable network , to the upstream DBS receiver as explained in detail above. The SEB  is also connected to the PCU  to permit user channel selection, volume control, etc. as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Passenger headphones  are also illustratively connected to the PCU .","On a typical narrow-body aircraft , the flight attendants are busy serving food and beverages during the relatively short duration of the flight. Accordingly, if the system  could only be manually initiated by the flight attendant after handling a cash exchange, such would be very impractical.","In accordance with the present invention, passenger and airline convenience are greatly enhanced based upon using the passenger's presentation of his payment card  to initiate service. In other words, returning again to the flowchart of , if a monitored card reader  is determined to have had a card  presented thereto (Block ), the card is read at Block .","The processor  of the SEB  may perform certain basic validity checks on the read data as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. For example, the processor  could provide a check of the validity of the expiration date of the payment card . Other validity checks could also be performed, although contact with an authorization center would not typically be desired. For example, the payment card type could also be checked against a preprogrammed list of acceptable or authorized card types. For example, the identifying data may indicate whether the card is an American Express, VISA, Delta Airlines, or service provider complimentary card.","In addition, a data validity or numerical sequence test, such as a CRC test, could be performed on the data to determine its validity. For example, the data may include data necessary to the financial transaction, such as the account number, person's name, expiration date, etc. and additional data which causes the data collectively to pass a certain mathematical function test. In other words, if the card  was invalid as determined at Block , service could be denied, and\/or a certain number of retries could be permitted.","At Block , if the optional validity check is successful, the selection and display of the programming channels is enabled before stopping (Block ). Moreover, in accordance with the invention, the only needed or required initiation input from the passenger is the presentation of a valid payment card . The passenger need not enter personalized passwords or hard to remember codes. Accordingly, passenger convenience is greatly enhanced. Risk of revenue loss to the airline is also relatively small since the airline has a record of the assigned passenger for each seat. In addition, the service fee is relatively small.","Although the payment reader  has been described for a payment card , the invention is also more broadly applicable to any user carried token which includes identifying date thereon for payment. Accordingly, many modifications and other embodiments of the invention will come to the mind of one skilled in the art having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings.","Another aspect of the invention relates to an aircraft system  comprising an in-flight entertainment system and at least one camera, such as passenger cameras , for providing aircraft surveillance, as best illustrated in . The illustrated aircraft system  comprises an entertainment source , at least one passenger display (PDU)  for displaying images from the entertainment source, and a signal distribution network  connecting the entertainment source to the passenger displays.","Electronic equipment, carried by an equipment rack , interfaces between the entertainment source  and the signal distribution network . The illustrated equipment rack  includes an audio\/video modulator (AVM) , at least one multi-channel receiver\/modulator (MRM)  and an RF distribution assembly (RDA) . Instead of the electronic equipment being collocated in an equipment rack , the equipment may installed in different spaced apart locations throughout the aircraft  in other embodiments.","The AVM  receives inputs from the passenger cameras , as well as from the entertainment source  which may provide pre-recorded information, for example. If the entertainment source  is a satellite television receiver, such as a DBS receiver, for example, then the signals are provided to the MRM . There may be more than one MRM , such as four, for example. The RDA  combines the MRM RF outputs to create a single RF signal comprising up to  audio\/video channels, for example. The RDA  amplifies and distributes the composite RF signal to a predetermined number of zone cable outputs via the signal distribution network . The signal distribution network  may include a dedicated set of cables interfacing with the various displays  and , or the cables may also support other functions associated with the in-flight entertainment system. In other embodiments, the signal distribution network  may be implemented as a wireless network, or as a combined cable and wireless network.","The aircraft system  further includes at least one pilot display (PDU)  in the cockpit area  of the aircraft  for displaying images from the passenger cameras . The signal distribution network  connects the passenger cameras  to the pilot display  via a seat electronic box (SEB) . As discussed above, the signal distribution network  includes a cable network as well as distribution devices, such as the SEBs . Since the signal distribution network  is typically routed throughout the aircraft  for connecting the entertainment source  with the passenger displays , connection of the passenger cameras  and the pilot display  may also be provided via the same signal distribution network. This advantageously eliminates hardware redundancy and helps to reduce equipment and installation costs, particularly for retrofits and upgrades.","The aircraft system  advantageously allows the pilot to view the images from the passenger cameras  while flying the aircraft. In the illustrated embodiment (), four passenger cameras  are spaced throughout the passenger area  of the aircraft . The actual number of passenger cameras  is based upon the size and layout of the aircraft, and the desired areas to be monitored. The images from the passenger cameras  are displayed on the pilot display , and are not typically displayed on the passenger displays . That is, the passengers do not view the images from the passenger cameras .","Camera control is provided to the pilot via a pilot control unit  connected to the pilot display  via the SEB . Depending on the size of the aircraft , there may be two pilot displays  in the cockpit area , with each display being controlled by a respective pilot control unit . For example, one pilot display \/pilot control unit  may be on the left side of the cockpit area , and another may be on the right side.","Each pilot control unit  may have a camera select mode  for selecting a desired passenger camera  for viewing. Each pilot control unit  may further or alternatively include a scan mode  for scanning the images from each passenger camera . In other words, the images from a single passenger camera  are momentarily displayed before displaying the images from a different passenger camera. This cycle continues through each of the remaining passenger cameras , and then repeats. In addition, the pilot display  may be configured so that the images from more than one passenger camera  may be displayed at one time, i.e., a split screen, as readily understood by one skilled in the art. The pilot may also have the option to view the images from an external camera  and a cargo camera . These particular cameras will be discussed below.","The pilot may not be limited to viewing images from the various cameras on the pilot display . For instance, the pilot may have the option of selecting the weather channel via the pilot control unit  so that weather related information may be displayed on the pilot display , for example. A weather related programming channel will be discussed in greater detail below.","Another advantageous feature of the aircraft system  is based upon the addition of at least one pilot camera  in the cockpit area  of the aircraft  for providing pilot images to the passenger displays  via the AVM  and the signal distribution network . This advantageously allows the pilot to selectively address the passengers, particularly prior to takeoff and landing, for example.","As discussed above, an external camera  may also be positioned for providing images from outside the aircraft . Images from outside the aircraft  may be of flight critical components, such as the tail section , for example. Other external cameras  may also be placed for providing images of the entry points of the aircraft  used by the various aircraft support personnel. A cargo camera  may be placed in the cargo bay  of the aircraft , for example.","The aircraft system  further illustratively includes a recording device  for recording the images from the various cameras , ,  and . In addition, the aircraft system  further illustratively includes a transmitter  for transmitting the images from the various cameras , ,  and  to a location external the aircraft  for remote viewing. The illustrated transmitter  has an antenna  connected thereto Interface from the AVM  may be provided via an Ethernet connection for providing video snapshots from the different cameras to the transmitter , as readily appreciated by one skilled in the art. The remote viewing may be while the aircraft  is in flight or on the ground, and is performed at the schematically illustrated monitoring station , for example.","In another embodiment of the aircraft system \u2032, the entertainment source is a satellite receiver  providing only audio channels to the passengers, as illustrated in . The satellite receiver  may be compatible with a Sirius Satellite Radio satellite, an XM Satellite Radio satellite, or a WorldSpace satellite, for example, as readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. Since video images are not being displayed to the passengers, passenger control units (PCU)  provide the audio channels received by the satellite receiver  to the passengers via passenger headphones  while the pilot continues to receive images from the various cameras \u2032, \u2032 and \u2032.","As stated above, the signal distribution network may be implemented as a cable network \u2032, as a wireless network \u2033, or as a combined cable and wireless network \u2033. Similarly, the interface between the satellite receiver  and the equipment rack \u2032 may be a wired  or a wireless \u2032 interface, or a combination of both. Likewise, the interface between the various cameras \u2032, \u2032 and \u2032 and the equipment rack may be a wired  or a wireless \u2032 interface, or a combination of both","Turning now additionally to , another feature of the present invention is directed to an in-flight entertainment system  receiving terrestrial signals from a plurality of terrestrial transmitters , . For purposes of discussion, the terrestrial transmitters ,  transmit television (TV) programming channels. However, this aspect of the present invention is not limited to TV programming channels, and is compatible with other types of terrestrial transmitters, such as those associated with voice and data (including e-mail) communications The partially illustrated in-flight entertainment system  further includes an adaptive antenna  and a terrestrial receiver , such as a terrestrial TV receiver, for receiving the TV programming channels. An antenna  is illustratively connected to the terrestrial receiver , and at least one display  is connected to the terrestrial receiver  via the signal distribution network .","The illustrated signal distribution network  is a cable network. In other embodiments, the signal distribution network may be implemented as a wireless network, or as a combined cable and wireless network. In addition, if the terrestrial receiver  is intended to support voice communications, then the VDU  may be supplemented or replaced by a PCU . The PCU  provides audio channels to a passenger via passenger headphone , whereas the VDU  provides data (i.e., text and e-mail messages) to the passenger.","A controller  is connected to the adaptive antenna  for determining a desired terrestrial TV transmitter, and for directing the adaptive antenna  for the desired terrestrial TV transmitter. If a new desired terrestrial TV transmitter is determined, then the controller  redirects the adaptive antenna for the new desired terrestrial TV transmitter.","Once the aircraft  reaches its flying altitude, the adaptive antenna  typically has a line of sight path to more than one terrestrial TV transmitter, such as transmitters  and , for example. Each transmitter  and  transmits within the same assigned frequency allocation, but the transmitted TV programming channels are not the same. Consequently, this results in the terrestrial TV receiver  receiving a corrupted signal that is difficult to process. The controller  advantageously determines the desired terrestrial TV transmitter, and directs the adaptive antenna  for this transmitter.","As the aircraft  travels, it may become out-of-range of the desired terrestrial TV transmitter, and become in-range to a new desired terrestrial TV transmitter. The controller  also advantageously determines when to redirect the adaptive antenna  for the new desired terrestrial TV transmitter. In one approach for controlling the adaptive antenna , the controller  determines the desired terrestrial TV transmitter by discriminating among received terrestrial TV signals.","The illustrated controller  includes a signal processor  for performing the discriminating based upon at least one of a frequency domain analysis and a time domain analysis of the received terrestrial TV signals, as readily understood by one skilled in the art. The signal processor  includes an algorithm for weighting the received terrestrial TV signals in the time domain as well as in the frequency domain, with both the amplitude and phase of the signals being weighted. This advantageously allows digital beam steering to be performed in which the received terrestrial TV signals are first digitized and weighted using digital signal processing.","In another approach for controlling the adaptive antenna , the controller  uses knowledge of the position of the terrestrial TV transmitters , . That is, the controller  operates in a closed loop configuration. Position of the terrestrial TV transmitters, such as transmitter  and , for example, are stored in a memory  within the controller . The memory  is connected to the signal processor . Alternatively, position of the terrestrial TV transmitters ,  may be stored directly in an embedded memory within the signal processor .","To determine position of the aircraft , the controller  includes a position determining system  connected to the signal processor . The illustrated position determining system  is a GPS receiver, which has an antenna  connected thereto. In lieu of using a position determining system  within the controller , the aircraft navigation system  may be used. If the position of the terrestrial TV transmitters ,  are not known, then the controller  operates in an open loop configuration and relies on discrimination among the received terrestrial TV signals.","The adaptive antenna  will now be discussed in greater detail. In one embodiment, the adaptive antenna  comprises a phased array antenna  connected to an adaptive processor . The adaptive processor  interfaces between the signal processor  and the phased array antenna . The adaptive processor  steers an antenna beam from the phased array antenna  towards the desired terrestrial TV transmitter, such as transmitter , for example, based upon commands from the signal processor , as readily appreciate by one skilled in the art. A null from the phased array antenna  would then be directed towards the undesired TV transmitter . In an alternative embodiment, the function of the adaptive processor  and the function of the signal processor  are combined into a single processor, which may be within the controller  or external the controller, as readily appreciated by one skilled in the art.","The phased array antenna  may include several fixed patterns, wherein the adaptive processor  selects the desired fixed pattern based upon commands from the signal processor , as also readily appreciate by one skilled in the art. Alternatively, the phased array antenna  may be a fully adaptive phased array, wherein the adaptive processor  selects from an infinite variety of antenna patterns.","As the aircraft  travels along its route, the signal processor  continues to monitor the received TV programming channels based upon the different relative phases and amplitudes of the received terrestrial TV signals for determining if a different terrestrial TV transmitter is desired. In one embodiment the monitored signals are not passed to the terrestrial TV receiver . That is, the monitoring is performed in the controller . In particular, if the signal processor  determines a new desired terrestrial TV transmitter, then the signal processor redirects the adaptive antenna via the adaptive processor  towards the new desired terrestrial TV transmitter, such as transmitter , for example. Alternatively, the signal processing function of the controller  may be incorporated within the terrestrial TV receiver , as readily appreciated by one skilled in the art.","Another feature of the phased array antenna  is that multiple beams may be steered or directed so that there is uninterrupted performance when transitioning from the desired terrestrial TV transmitter  to the new desired terrestrial TV transmitter . In lieu of multiple antenna beams, a time delay may be used to minimize any interruption in the transition from one terrestrial TV transmitter to another.","In another embodiment, the adaptive antenna  comprises a plurality of antennas  spaced apart on the aircraft . As illustrated in , the plurality of antennas  include four antennas, for example, with each antenna providing an antenna beam in a respective 90 degree quadrant so that collectively the four antennas provide a 360 degree coverage. The actual number of antennas may vary based upon the desired level of performance, as readily appreciated by one skilled in the art.","In this particular embodiment, the controller  selects via the adaptive processor  the antenna beam from the quadrant that includes the desired terrestrial TV transmitter . To provide a null toward the undesired terrestrial TV transmitters, reception from the remaining antennas are not passed to the terrestrial TV receiver . However, the signal processor  continues to periodically monitor the received terrestrial TV signals from these antennas for determining if a new desired terrestrial TV transmitter  should be selected. If the signal processor  determines a new desired terrestrial TV transmitter , then the signal processor selects via the adaptive processor  a different antenna  having its antenna beam covering the quadrant that includes the new desired terrestrial TV transmitter .","Referring now to , the weather information feature of the in-flight entertainment system  will now be discussed. The in-flight entertainment system , only select components of which are illustrated in , comprises at least one entertainment source , a satellite weather information receiver  for receiving at least one weather related programming channel from at least one satellite, and a plurality of displays  for displaying images from the at least one entertainment source and for displaying weather related information corresponding to selected geographic areas. A signal distribution network  connects the entertainment source  and the satellite weather information receiver  to the plurality of displays .","The in-flight entertainment system  further comprises a map image device  connected to the satellite weather information receiver  and to the plurality of displays  for storing map images of the selected geographic areas. The displayed weather related information includes the map images. The map image device  also comprises a moving map image generator for generating a moving representation of the aircraft position on the map images.","At least one processor  is connected to the satellite weather information receiver  for determining the weather related information corresponding to the selected geographic areas. The processor  compares the information identifying the selected geographic with information provided by the at least one weather related programming channel. In other words, only a subset of the received weather related information is selected to be displayed. Since the received weather related programming channel is a digital signal, the processor  compares stored information identifying the selected geographic areas to the received weather related programming channel, as readily understood by one skilled in the art.","The selected geographic areas comprise geographic areas along a flight path of the aircraft, for example. As the aircraft travels along its flight path, the displays  scroll through the weather related information for each selected geographic area. The selected geographic areas also include a destination of the aircraft. This aspect of the weather information feature of the in-flight entertainment system  does not require any input from the passengers. The selected geographic areas, which are input into the processor  before flight or during the flight, are selected based upon the flight path of the aircraft. This entry may be accomplished by the pilot through a pilot control unit, for example.","Another aspect of the weather information feature is that the passengers may input information into the system for obtaining weather related information on a particular geographic area. A plurality of control units  are connected to the plurality of displays  for selecting the geographic areas. Each control unit  is associated with a respective display, and comprises input means or an input device for selecting the geographic areas. The geographic areas are selected by entering at least one of a city name, a zip code and an area code via the input device. The input device may be an alpha-numeric keypad, for example.","The selected geographic area may be a final destination of an aircraft passenger, and consequently, any passenger is able to obtain current weather related information for this particular area via the input device . The weather related information  displayed on the passenger displays  includes the high and low temperatures, relative humidity, and the projected weather forecast, for example.","For example, if Orlando, Fla. is the final destination of the passenger, the passenger enters \u201cOrlando, Fla.\u201d via the input device . A zip code, area code or other pertinent information may be entered for identifying the selected geographic area. Once \u201cOrlando, Fla.\u201d has been entered, this term is compared with the information provided by the weather related programming channel for a match. Since the weather related programming channel is a digital signal, the PCU  converts \u201cOrlando, Fla.\u201d into a digital signal so that a digital comparison can be made.","If the passenger does not select a geographic area, a default position for the selected geographic area may correspond to a current position of the aircraft , for example. The current position of the aircraft  may be provided by a positioning determining system, such as a GPS receiver.","The in-flight entertainment system further includes a plurality of signal distribution devices  connecting the satellite weather information receiver  to the passenger displays . The at least one processor  may comprise a plurality of processors, with each processor being included within a respective signal distribution device .","In one embodiment, the satellite weather information receiver  operates within a frequency range of about 1 to 3 GHz, for example. The satellite providing the weather related programming channel may thus be a Sirius Satellite Radio satellite, an XM Satellite Radio satellite, or a WorldSpace satellite, as readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. However, operation of the weather information feature as disclosed herein is not limited to this particular frequency range and to transmissions from these satellites.","Another embodiment \u2032 of the weather information feature of the in-flight entertainment system will now be discussed with reference to . In this particular embodiment, a satellite receiver \u2032 is used for receiving at least one weather related programming channel and at least one entertainment related programming channel. The weather related programming channel is for the pilot's benefit for receiving accurate weather information that is regularly updated while in flight.","The weather related information may be displayed on a pilot display . A pilot control unit  is connected to the pilot display  for selecting the geographic areas, and includes an input device for selecting these areas, as discussed above for the passenger control units . The pilot display  and the pilot control unit  may be implemented as separate units or as a single integrated device.","In lieu of a pilot display , the weather related information may be displayed on an on-board computer , which may be mounted within the cockpit or may be a portable laptop computer carried by the pilot. The geographic areas would also be selected by the on-board computer . When the aircraft is on the ground, weather information may be provided to the pilot via a wireless data link .","If the entertainment related information provided to the passengers by the satellite receiver \u2032 is audio only, then passenger control units (PCU)  may be used for providing this audio to the passengers via passenger headphones . However, in other embodiments, the weather information may also be provided to the passengers (via the passenger displays ) as discussed above, along with the weather information being provided to the pilot.","Referring now additionally to the flowchart of  and the associated schematic block diagram of , another advantageous feature of the invention relates to determination of a respective pricing level on the available features of the in-flight entertainment system  for each passenger. From the start (Block ), information is collected on passengers of the aircraft at Block . The information may be generated based upon frequent flyer profiles and an airline passenger database, for example. The collected information may be stored in a memory  connected to a processor  within the SEB .","The in-flight entertainment system  uses the collected information at Block  for determining a respective pricing level for each passenger on the available features of the system.

The entertainment source  comprises a satellite TV receiver, such as a direct broadcast (DBS) receiver, for example.","The available features of the in-flight entertainment system  may also include instant messaging, and may provide connecting gate information and other travel related information. The other travel related information may include hotel and rental car information, for example. In addition, the collected information may affect the pricing levels for the various duty free items offered to each passenger when traveling overseas.","The method further includes determining a seating location of each passenger based upon an assigned passenger seating list at Block . A passenger is preferably identified at Block  before displaying the respective pricing level. This ensures that the passenger receives the correct pricing level.","The identifying may also be performed using a token reader  and a token  associated therewith. In the illustrated embodiment, the token reader  comprises a card swipe reader, and the token  comprises a substrate  and a magnetic strip  thereon. The processor  reads the magnetic strip.","After identification, the respective pricing level  is displayed on an associated passenger display at Block . The token reader  may comprise a payment token reader, and the token  comprises a payment token, such as a credit card. Consequently, the method further includes a passenger using the payment token  to pay, if necessary, for selected features of the in-flight entertainment system  according to the respective pricing level. The method ends at Block .","The collected information may be based upon frequent flyer profiles, a separate airline database, and an assigned passenger seating list, for example. The collected information is preferably updated before each flight. Passengers that frequently travel and passengers that fly first class would have a lower pricing level on the available features of the in-flight entertainment system  as compared to passengers that seldom travel. A respective pricing level would thus vary between passengers in first class and in coach. Premium services would then be provided at little or no cost to a passenger in first class, whereas the same services would be offered to a passenger in coach but at a higher cost.","The illustrated processor  generates on the passenger displays  a respective pricing level on available features of the in-flight entertainment system  for each passenger. As noted above, each respective pricing level is based upon information collected on aircraft passengers. The collected information may be stored in the memory . The processor  also determines a seating location of each passenger based upon an assigned passenger seating list.","The illustrated processor  is included within a respective seat electronics box  connecting the entertainment source  to the passenger displays . A PCU  is illustratively connected to the SEB , and passenger headphones  are connected to the PCU.","Referring now additionally to the flowchart of  and the associated schematic block diagram of , another advantageous feature of the in-flight entertainment system  relates to selectively matching advertisements based upon passenger profiles. From the start (Block ), information is collected on passengers of the aircraft at Block , and passenger profiles are generated based upon the collected information.","The method according to the present invention advantageously generates a profile for each passenger, and selectively matches advertisements to each passenger based upon the generated profile. This allows the airlines to generate increased advertisement revenue. The collected information may be based upon frequent flyer profiles and airline passenger databases, for example.","Passenger profiles are selectively matched to the passenger profiles at Block . The method further includes determining a seating location of each passenger based upon an assigned passenger seating list at Block . In addition, at least one flight parameter of the aircraft  is monitored at Block . The at least one flight parameter may comprise at least one of a geographic location of the aircraft , an estimated time of arrival of the aircraft, and destination of the aircraft.","A passenger is identified at Block  before displaying the selectively matched passenger advertisements on an associated passenger display . This ensures that the correct passenger receives the appropriate advertisements. The verifying may be performed using a token reader  and a token  associated therewith. After verification, the selectively matched passenger advertisements corresponding to respective passenger profiles are displayed at Block  based upon the monitored flight parameter. The method ends at Block .","For example, as the aircraft  approaches its final destination, the flight control computer  reports the position of the aircraft  to a processor . In lieu of the flight control computer , a position determining system, such as a GPS receiver, may be used to provide the position of the aircraft  to the processor .","The processor  is programmed to generate advertisements within a predetermined range of the airport, such as 100 miles, for example. Other aircraft parameters may be used to trigger display of the advertisements, as mentioned above. If a passenger profile indicates that the passenger is an avid fisherman, and the passenger's destination is Orlando, for example, then the selectively matched advertisements  are directed toward deep-sea fishing off the coast of Florida.","A map image storage device  connected to the processor  provides an image  of the coast of Florida. This directly enhances the displayed advertisement . The advertisement  may include information on chartered fishing boats, and even lodging and restaurant information. A memory  is also connected to the processor  for storing the selectively matched passenger advertisements, and the passenger profiles. Alternatively, the memory may be embedded within the processor .","The in-flight entertainment system  also comprises an entertainment source , such as a direct broadcast (DBS) receiver. The entertainment source  may also be used to provide the pre-recorded advertisements. Alternatively, the passenger advertisements from the entertainment source  may be inserted with other programming channels or may appear on its own dedicated channel(s). The illustrated processor  may be included within a respective SEB  connecting the satellite receiver to the passenger displays . A PCU  is illustratively connected to the SEB , and passenger headphones  are connected to the PCU.","Many modifications and other embodiments of the invention will come to the mind of one skilled in the art having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings. Therefore, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed, and that modifications and embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims.","In addition, other features relating to the aircraft in-flight entertainment system are disclosed in copending patent applications filed concurrently herewith and assigned to the assignee of the present invention and are entitled AIRCRAFT IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM RECEIVING TERRESTRIAL TELEVISION BROADCAST SIGNALS AND ASSOCIATED METHODS, Ser.
