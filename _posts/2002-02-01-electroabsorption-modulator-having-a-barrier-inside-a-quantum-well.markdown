No. 60\/2653,954 filed Feb. 1, 2001.","This invention was make with Government assistance under SPAWAR Grant 28001, Contract #N-M-1452. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention generally relates to electroabsorption modulators, and more particularly to a high-power electroabsorption modulator having a barrier inside quantum wells.","Electroabsorption modulators (EAMs) have been shown to be useful in fiber-optic links operating near either 1.3 or 1.55 \u03bcm for both analog and digital signal transmission. They are small in size and can be integrated with a laser diode, for example, while being very effective in changing the light intensity as a function of the applied electric field. In particular, EAMs that use multiple quantum well active regions are currently very popular. As those skilled in the art will understand, a quantum well is a material unit that has a very thin \u201cwell\u201d material (typically of the order of 100 Angstrom) surrounded by potential energy barriers. Inside the quantum well, particle, such as electrons or holes, are restricted in motion in the dimension perpendicular to the well and has well-defined quantized states with respect to momentum and energy. The particles are free to move around in the other two directions. When these quantum wells are stacked together without interactions between each other, this resultant structure is referred to as multiple quantum wells (MQW). The MQW provides a large absorption-coefficient change via the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE), which is the shift of the excitonic (the resonance state of electron-hole pairs) absorption peak of the quantum well under the influence of an applied electric field. Typically, the peak shifts to lower energy when an electric field is applied.","An analog fiber link is an optical fiber communication channel for transmitting analog signals. For an externally modulated analog fiber link, which uses a transmitter with the light modulation occurring outside the laser source, increasing the received optical power reduces the link loss, which is the ratio of the input signal intensity to the output signal intensity. The output signal of the receiver is proportional to the square of the optical power. The optical power used in the link, however, is currently limited by the optical saturation properties of the EAM. An optical saturation occurs when the output signal intensity is no longer linearly proportional (or becomes sub-linear) to the input signal power to the EAM. Consequently, a concern for the MQW EAMs is their relatively low saturation optical power, where optical saturation begins. This power level can be determined from the optical power when the output signal intensity is 1 dB below that which corresponds to unsaturated modulation. The conventional MQW EAMs, particularly those made of InGaAs\/InP, tend to saturate at a much lower level.","In quantum wells (QWs), the barriers hinder the sweep-out of the photo generated electrons and holes, particularly holes, resulting in carrier pile-up near the barriers. The traditional approach to reduce this effect had been to use InGaAsP or InAlAs (or InGaAlAs) instead of InP as barrier materials to reduce the valence band offset, which was shown to improve the optical saturation of the MQW EAMs. Also, there have been attempts to use strain-compensated InGaAsP\/InGaAsP and InAsP\/GaInP quantum wells, which have shallow wells, to improve the saturation optical power at 1.55 and 1.3 \u03bcm. A strained quantum well refers to a quantum well where either the barrier or the quantum well is lattice mismatched to the substrate so that the quantum well as a unit is under (tensile or compressive) hydrostatic strain. A strain compensated quantum well refers to a quantum well structure in which the well and the barrier are oppositely (compressive versus tensile) strained so that the net strain in one unit of quantum well is zero. Although it has been reported that the MQW EAMs with InGaAs\/InAlAs can handle optical power up to 40 mW without degradation in the bandwidth, the link gain at RF frequencies was observed to saturate at a much lower level. The maximum optical power that does not cause RF gain saturation is currently limited to approximately 10 mW.","It has also been observed that increasing the electric field reduces the screening effect due to spatially distributed holes that cannot be drifted out of the quantum well (their presence causes an effective reduction of the applied electric field). Hence in order to increase the saturation optical power further, the operating bias must be increased for a given intrinsic layer thickness without compromising the modulator performance such as modulator slope efficiency, which is defined as the maximum change in optical transmission versus change in applied voltage.","One embodiment of the invention is directed to an electroabsorption modulator including first and second electrically conductive electrodes, and first and second cladding layers provided between the first and second electrodes. A quantum well layer is provided between the first and second cladding layers, and includes an InAlAs first region, an InGaAs second region adjacent the first region, and an InGaAlAs third region adjacent the second region.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, an electroabsorption modulator includes first and second electrically conductive electrodes, and first and second cladding layers provided between the first and second electrodes. A multiple quantum well layer is provided between the first and second cladding layers, and each quantum well includes an InP (or InGaAsP) first region, an InGaAs (or InGaAsP) second region adjacent the first region, and an InGaAsP third region adjacent the second region.","Another embodiment of the invention is directed to an electroabsorption modulator having at least one quantum well in a conduction band and a corresponding quantum well in a valence band. A step barrier made from InGaAlAs or InGaAsP is formed within the quantum wells of both the conduction and valence bands.","A further embodiment of the present invention relates to a method for delaying a red shift of a quantum-confined Stark effect to a higher electric field, and increasing transition energy and an oscillator strength response after the onset of the red shift, in an electroabsorption modulator. The method includes creating at least one first quantum well in a conduction band and at least one corresponding second quantum well in a valence band, and forming a step barrier made from InGaAlAs or InGaAsP in a portion of the first and second quantum wells.","Turning now to , an electroabsorption modulator (EAM) in accordance with an embodiment of the invention is indicated generally at , and includes a n-InP substrate  in contact with an n-InAlAs waveguide cladding layer  (where n indicates an electron concentration, for example, of approximately 1\u00d710cm, in this embodiment). The EAM  also includes an p-InP buffer layer  provided between a heavily doped p-InGaAs contact layer  (where p indicates hole concentration, for example, of approximately 1\u00d710cmin this embodiment) and a p-InAlAs waveguide cladding layer  (where p=1\u00d710cm). On the surface opposite the p-InP buffer layer , the p-InGaAs contact layer  is in contact with a positive electrode  made of electrically conductive metal alloy such as AuZn followed by gold, for example. Similarly, the surface of the n-InP substrate  opposite the waveguide cladding layer  is in contact with an n type electrode , which is also made of electrically conductive metal alloy such as AuGe followed by gold, for example.","A multiple intra-step-barrier quantum well (IQW) layer  is provided between the two waveguide cladding layers , , and includes repeating regions of an InAlAs barrier , an InGaAs well  and an InGaAlAs intra-step-barrier  (best shown in ), in the direction generally perpendicular to the surfaces of the waveguide cladding layers , . In one embodiment, the InGaAlAs of the IQW layer  is grown by repeating InGaAs\/InAlAs layers several times to form a short-period superlattice, and the EAM  is grown by molecular beam epitaxy.","Turning now to , an exemplary energy band diagrams of the IQW layer  includes the InAlAs barrier , the InGaAs well  and the InGaAlAs intra-step-barrier  for both conduction (E) and the valence (E) bands. The nominal bandgap energy of the InGaAlAs intra-step-barrier layer  is 0.97 eV and the layer is lattice-matched to InP. It should be noted that the intra-step-barriers  in the conduction (E) and valence (E) bands are generally symmetrical or mirror images of each other, although the depths of the wells  and the heights of the step-barriers  may differ somewhat as a result of the chemical make-up of the wells and the step-barriers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIGS. 2\u20135","b":["26","1","1","34","36","38","30","32","26","1","1"]},"At zero electric field (), the electrons in the conduction band Eis rather loosely confined over the whole well region , while the holes are tightly confined in the well  (i.e., the InGaAs well ) of the valence band E. This is mostly due to the effective mass difference. As the electric field is applied in the \u2212z direction (e.g., 100 kV\/cm) (), the electron envelope wavefunction  moves in the +z direction, while the hole envelope wavefunction  begins to cross over the intra-step-barrier  in the \u2212z direction. Up to this point, the overall transition energy shift is very small or even a little positive (\u201cblue-shifted\u201d). This is because the hole energy level increases with the electric field although the electron energy level decreases. Hence, the normal \u201cred-shifted\u201d quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) is effectively suppressed.","With the electric field further increased (e.g., 140 kV\/cm) (), the energy shift becomes negative (red-shifted), as the hole envelope wavefunction  crosses further over the intra-step-barrier  of the valence band Eand the hole energy level starts to decrease. Also the oscillator strength, which is a measure of the transition probability leading to electroabsorption in the quantum well, is proportional to the square of the spatial overlap integral between the electron and the hole envelope wavefunctions , , and is reduced dramatically as the hole envelope wavefunction crosses over the intra-step-barrier , due to the spatial separation of the wavefunctions. At an even larger electric field, (e.g., 200 kV\/cm) (), the holes are mostly confined over the intra-step-barrier  and the oscillator strength becomes very small.","The result is summarized in  for the change in the transition energy, and in  for the square of overlap integral as a function of the applied electric field. The results are compared with conventional quantum wells (QW) with thickness of 7.2 nm and 10.0 nm. The 7.2 nm QW was chosen as a conventional QW for 1.55 \u03bcM operation. The 10.0 nm QW was chosen to show the effect of intra-step-barrier, although the zero-field transition energy is not the same as that of the IQW of the same thickness.","In , it can be seen that the intra-step-barrier  (best shown in ) effectively suppresses the onset of the red shift of the QCSE for up to approximately 100 kV\/cm. After this point, the transition energy decreases quickly, crossing that of a 7.2-nm thick conventional QW with a steeper slope. This implies that the EAM  with the IQW  will be more efficient than that of the conventional QW. When compared with the conventional QW with thickness of 10.0 nm, the slope of the energy shift with respect to the electric field is similar after approximately 100 kV\/cm, the curve for the IQW  being translated to a higher electric field. Hence the IQW  effectively takes advantage of the wider well region  width, with the delayed onset of the red shift.  illustrates a unique feature in the square of the overlap integral of this IQW . This sharp change combined with the energy shift gives a very good QCSE.","With the above results, the change in the absorption coefficient with the electric field was estimated for the 7.2-nm thick conventional quantum well. A Gaussian broadening function was used, whose zero-field full width at half maximum (FWHM) was obtained from experimental values (\u02dc20 me.V). It was varied following the overlap-integral change with the electric field. The absorption coefficient was also estimated from the experimental values. The transfer curve as a function of the applied bias was then calculated for the EAM with intrinsic layer thickness of 0.25 \u03bcm, an optical confinement factor of 0.20, and a waveguide length of 200 \u03bcm for 1.55 \u03bcm light. The same calculation was repeated for the EAM  with the 10.0-nm IQWs with the same device parameters, using the same form of Gaussian broadening.","Turning now to , the estimated transfer curves show that the present EAM  with IQW  can be operated at a higher bias for the highest modulator slope efficiency. For instance, for the FWHM of 20 meV, the highest slope efficiency for the IQW EAM  (2.9 V) occurs at approximately 2.7 V, while for the conventional QW EAM, it happens at about 1.4 V, which represents an increase by a factor of approximately 2. Moreover, the slope efficiency itself is increased by a factor of about 3.6 with the use of the present IQW , which is the consequence of the sharper transition energy shift with the IQW at a higher electric field. This means that the IQW EAM  will not only improve the saturation optical power, but also yield a higher slope efficiency.","Referring to , an electroabsorption modulator (EAM) in accordance with another aspect of the present invention is indicated generally at  and includes features similar to those described above with respect to the EAM  of . The EAM  includes a n-InP substrate \u2032 in contact with an n-InGaAsP waveguide cladding layer \u2032 (n=1\u00d710cm). The EAM  also includes an n-InP buffer layer \u2032 provided between a p-InGaAs contact layer \u2032 (p=1\u00d710cm) and a p-InGaAsP waveguide clading layer \u2032 (p=1\u00d710cm). On the surface opposite the p-InP buffer layer \u2032, the p-InGaAs contact layer \u2032 is in contact with a positive electrode \u2032 made of electrically conductive metal alloy such as AuZn followed by gold, for example. Similarly, the surface of the n-InP substrate \u2032 opposite the n-InGaAsP waveguide clading layer \u2032 is in contact with a negative electrode \u2032, which is also made of electrically conductive metal alloy such as AuGe, followed by gold, for example.","A multiple intra-step-barrier quantum well (IQW) layer  is provided between the waveguide cladding layers \u2032, \u2032, and includes repeating regions of an InP (or InGaAsP) barrier , an InGaAs (or InGaAsP) well  and an InGaAsP  intra-step-barrier  (best shown in ), in the direction perpendicular to the surfaces of the waveguide cladding layers \u2032, \u2032. In one embodiment, the InGaAsP intra-step-barrier of the IQW layer  is grown by repeating InGaAs\/InP layers several times to form a short-period superlattice, and the EAM  is grown by molecular beam epitaxy or organometallic vapor phase epitaxy.","It should be understood that other material systems can also be used to obtain an electroabsorption modulator having an intra-step-barrier quantum well in both the conduction band Eand the valence band E, with some modification on the band offsets, effective masses, and the composition of the well, barrier, and the intra-step-barrier.","From the foregoing description, it should be understood that an improved electroabsorption modulator (EAM) has been shown and described which has many desirable attributes and advantages. The intra-step-barrier quantum well (IQW) moves the onset of the red-shifted QCSE to a higher electric field. After the onset of the red shift, the transition energy and the oscillator strength respond sharply to the electric field. The present EAM with the IQW operates at a higher optical power with enhanced modulator slope efficiency, which enhances the optical link performance.","While various embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it should be understood that other modifications, substitutions and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications, substitutions and alternatives can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which should be determined from the appended claims.","Various features of the invention are set forth in the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 9"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
