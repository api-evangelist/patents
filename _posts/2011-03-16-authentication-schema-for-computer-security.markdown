{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to computer security, and more specifically, to authentication of users of a computing system.","When a user attempts to log in to a computer system, a typical authentication process requires that the user enter a password or provide answers to selected questions. However, this activity can be easily detected or observed when the user is in a public place (e.g., airport, coffee shop, ATM, or any place with public data access facilities) and, unbeknownst to the user, the information can be procured for use by the observer.","What is needed, therefore, is an authentication mechanism that prevents or minimizes unauthorized procurement of computer access information.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a method for implementing computer security is provided. The method includes displaying information elements on a computer display screen. Some of the information elements are mapped to corresponding parameters. The method also includes receiving a selected information element from the information elements displayed on the computer display screen, and determining a value of a parameter associated with the selected information element based on a condition. The value of the parameter is changeable according to changes in the condition. The method further includes comparing the selected information element with the value of the parameter, and upon determining the value of the parameter matches the selected information element, providing a user with access to a system resource.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, a system for implementing computer security is provided. The system includes a computer processor and an authentication application executable by the computer processor. The authentication application performs a method. The method includes displaying information elements on a computer display screen. Some of the information elements are mapped to corresponding parameters. The method also includes receiving a selected information element from the information elements displayed on the computer display screen, and determining a value of a parameter associated with the selected information element based on a condition. The value of the parameter is changeable according to changes in the condition. The method further includes comparing the selected information element with the value of the parameter, and upon determining the value of the parameter matches the selected information element, providing a user with access to a system resource.","According to a further embodiment of the present invention, a computer program product for implementing computer security is provided. The computer program product includes a storage medium embodied with computer-readable program code, which when executed by a computer causes the computer to implement a method. The method includes displaying information elements on a computer display screen. Some of the information elements are mapped to corresponding parameters. The method also includes receiving a selected information element from the information elements displayed on the computer display screen, and determining a value of a parameter associated with the selected information element based on a condition. The value of the parameter is changeable according to changes in the condition. The method further includes comparing the selected information element with the value of the parameter, and upon determining the value of the parameter matches the selected information element, providing a user with access to a system resource.","Additional features and advantages are realized through the techniques of the present invention. Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed invention. For a better understanding of the invention with the advantages and the features, refer to the description and to the drawings.","Exemplary embodiments of the invention provide an authentication mechanism that prevents or minimizes unauthorized procurement of computer access information. The exemplary embodiments display information elements on a computer display screen. Some of the information elements are mapped to corresponding parameters, which may be defined according to varying types of authentication schema. A user who is attempting to log in to a system selects one or more of the information elements from the display screen. The computer security processes receives the selected information element(s) and determines a value of a parameter associated with the selected information element(s) based on a condition. The authentication schema provides for variability of the parameter according to changes in the condition. The computer security processes compare the selected information element(s) with the value of the parameter, and upon determining the value of the parameter matches the selected information element, the computer security processes provide the user with access to a system resource.","With reference now to , an exemplary system upon which the computer security processes may be implemented will now be described. The system of  includes a user system  in communication with a host system  over one or more networks . The user system  represents a computer processing device through which a user may contact the host system . The user system  may be implemented using a general-purpose computer executing a computer program for carrying out the processes described herein. The user system  may be a personal computer (e.g., a lap top, a personal digital assistant) or host attached terminal. If the user system  is a personal computer, the processing described herein may be shared by the user system  and the host system  (e.g., by providing an applet to the user system ). In one exemplary embodiment, the user system  executes computer instructions for performing the computer security processes described herein (via, e.g., an authentication application ). In another exemplary embodiment, the host system  executes computer instructions for performing the computer security processes (via, e.g., the authentication application ).","In an exemplary embodiment, the host system  is also communicatively coupled to a storage device . The storage device  may be implemented using a variety of devices for storing electronic information. It is understood that the storage device  may be implemented using memory contained in the host system  or that it may be a separate physical device (e.g., as shown in ). The storage device  is logically addressable as a consolidated data source across a distributed environment that includes network(s) . Information stored in the storage device  may be retrieved and manipulated via the host system  and\/or via the user system . In one exemplary embodiment, the storage device  stores applications, information elements, and parameters (which collectively represent one or more authentication schemas), as well as user preferences that facilitate the computer security processes described further herein.","The network(s)  may be any type of known networks including, but not limited to, a wide area network (WAN), a local area network (LAN), a global network (e.g. Internet), a virtual private network (VPN), and an intranet. The network  may be implemented using a wireless network or any kind of physical network implementation known in the art. The user system  may be coupled to the host system through multiple networks (e.g., intranet and Internet). One or more user systems and the host system  may be connected to the network  in a wireless fashion. In one embodiment, the network is an intranet and one or more user systems execute a user interface application (e.g., a web browser) to contact the host system  through the network . In another exemplary embodiment, one or more of the user systems  is connected directly (i.e., not through the network ) to the host system  and the host system  is connected directly to or contains the storage device .","The data repository includes one or more databases containing documents, files, and related data in support of the computer security processes. In one exemplary embodiment, the computer security processes are configured to allow users to select from various authentication schemas that are implemented in an authentication process, as described further herein. In this embodiment, the user system  and\/or the storage device  may store user profile records, which house the authentication schema (e.g., information elements, parameters, information elements) selected for use. In another embodiment, the host system  may dictate which authentication schema may be implemented for a particular user system . In yet a further embodiment, multiple authentication schema may be selected and implemented interchangeably, e.g., a different schema used for each log in attempt. The user profile records may also include, e.g., e.g., personal\/identification information related to the user of user system , as well as the user system  operated by the user (e.g., an Internet address assigned to the user device), which may be used for various purposes, such as identifying a geographic location of the user system , as will be described further herein.","The host system  depicted in  may be implemented using one or more servers operating in response to a computer program stored in a storage medium accessible by the server. The host system  may operate as a network server (e.g., a web server) to communicate with the user system . The host system  handles sending and receiving information to and from the user system  and can perform associated tasks.","The host system  may also operate as an application server. As described above, the host system  may execute one or more computer programs to provide the computer security processes, e.g., authentication application . Processing may be shared by the user system  and the host system  by providing an application (e.g., java applet) to the user system . Alternatively, the user system  can include stand-alone software applications for performing a portion or all of the processing described herein. As previously described, it is understood that separate servers may be utilized to implement the network server functions and the application server functions. Alternatively, the network server and the application server may be implemented by a single server executing computer programs to perform the requisite functions.","In one embodiment, the authentication application  provides a user interface that enables users to customize or configure the authentication schema to be implemented. The user profile records may be used to store information derived via the user interface as indicated above.","The exemplary computer security processes may be implemented by various components of the system  of . Turning now to , a portion of these components will now be described in an exemplary embodiment.","A login module  may reside locally on the user system  and implemented by the user system  as part of the user system's  operating system (e.g., BIOS). In this embodiment, system resources  sought for access by a user may be the applications and data that reside on the user system  itself. Other system resources  may include peripheral devices, such as back up storage devices, printers, facsimile machines, or other devices communicatively coupled to the user system  (e.g., in a wireline or wireless fashion). Still other system resources  may include communication devices managed by the user of the user system , e.g., the user's smart phone, intelligent home appliances, home safety systems, or entertainment devices, such as digital video recording devices or Internet appliances.","In another exemplary embodiment, the login module  may reside on the host system  whereby the user system  implements a login process to access the host system  resources  (e.g., applications, storage systems, network computers, and\/or peripheral network devices) that are managed by the host system  over one or more networks .","The authentication application  may be implemented as an application programming interface (API) to the login module  or may be integrated therewith as a single tool. Once the login module  is activated, e.g., a user is attempting a login process, the authentication application  and\/or the integrated login module  and authentication application  displays a login screen  on the user system . The authentication application  accesses information such as parameters, information elements, applications, etc. from one or more databases  for presentation on the login screen . For example, in one embodiment, the authentication schema is a clock or time feature. The applications associated with the authentication schema may include a clock application (e.g., atomic clock). The parameters hold values that specify \u2018time,\u2019 and the value changes based upon changes in a condition, whereby the condition reflects the passage of time. For example, in one embodiment, the information elements represent a matrix of numbers (e.g., four-by-four matrix) that visually depict the numbers as they would appear on the face of a clock (i.e., the outer cells of the matrix display numbers 1-12 in a clockwise sequence starting from the top cell of the matrix), as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mn":"1"},{"mn":"2"},{"mn":"3"},{"mn":"4"}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"12"},{"mn":"13"},{"mn":"14"},{"mn":"5"}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"11"},{"mn":"16"},{"mn":"15"},{"mn":"6"}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"10"},{"mn":"9"},{"mn":"8"},{"mn":"7"}]}]}}}},"In this embodiment, the parameter is time, and a variable condition is determined for the value of the parameter. That is, the current time at which the user is attempting the login is determined and is assigned as the value of the parameter \u2018time.\u2019 This value changes depending upon the time the user is attempting to log in to the user system . At login, the authentication application  accesses a clock application and is used to determine the value of the parameter as the user is selecting the number (information element) that reflects the current time as the password.","The parameters, information elements, applications  may be stored locally on the user system  (e.g., in internal memory) or may be stored at the host system  (e.g., in storage device ).","Once the user login process has been successfully implemented, the user is provided with access to one or more system resources .","As indicated above, multiple authentication schemas may be employed for a single user system or for access to the host system . That is, information elements, parameters, applications, etc. used may vary for each login attempt or may be selected by the user system  or host system , or a combination thereof.","Turning now to , an exemplary process for implementing the computer security system will now be described. In step , the computer security processes perform a set up phase, which configures parameters and maps information elements to these parameters. Steps - describe an exemplary authentication process performed using an authentication scheme provided via the computer security processes.","At step , information elements are mapped to parameters. Parameters, in turn, will have values that dynamically change based upon one or more conditions. The type of information elements and parameters employed are based upon the type of authentication schema desired, as will be described further herein.","A user at user system  begins a log in process. At step , the authentication application  (e.g., in conjunction with the login module ) displays information elements on a display screen of the user system . The information elements may be displayed on login screen .","At step , the authentication application  receives a selection of one or more of the information elements displayed on the display screen. Using the clock authentication schema described above, for example, the information elements may be a four-by-four matrix of numbers that visually depict the face of a clock. If the current time were 12:00 pm, the user would select the number 12 from the information elements on the display screen.","At step , the authentication application  determines value of the parameter based upon a condition. The value of the parameter \u2018time\u2019 is the current time. In one embodiment, the authentication application  accesses an application (e.g., a clock program) from the applications stored in databases . The authentication application  determines the current time and passes this value as the parameter value for the authentication process.","At step , the authentication application  compares the selected information element to the value of parameter.","At step , the authentication application  determines if the selected information element matches the value of the parameter. If so, at step , the authentication application  provides the user with access to a system resource (e.g., system resource ). Alternatively, in one exemplary embodiment, the authentication application  may provide another set of information elements in which the process described in steps - are repeated for a second level of security.","At step , if the selected information element does not match the value of the parameter, the user may be prompted to retry (e.g., given an option to select another information element or provided with a new and different set of information elements) or the user may be denied access.","Using the time authentication schema, the user may conceivably select two different information elements during two separate login attempts depending upon the changing condition (i.e., passage of time). In other words, the information elements selected will change if the time of login changes, essentially creating a new password at each log in. In this manner, one who may be observing the first login would not be able to procure this password (i.e., selected information element) for appropriation unless the observer happened to attempt to login at the same time that the user logged in; i.e., the password changes depending upon the time of login.","In addition to the clock authentication schema mentioned above, other types of authentication schema will now be described. In one exemplary embodiment, a weather authentication schema may be employed. In this embodiment, the parameter holds a value that corresponds to the current local weather (e.g., the weather conditions determined at the time and place of the user's login). The information elements may include graphical icons that depict varying weather conditions (e.g., a sun, a cloud, a cloud with rain, etc.) The authentication application  may access a weather application (e.g., one of the applications stored in databases ) to determine the current local weather. In one embodiment, the locale of the user system may be determined using pre-defined location information entered by the user in the weather application (e.g., zip code) that is saved by the weather application. In another embodiment, the locale of the user may be determined by searching other applications or processes on the user system  (e.g., information provided by a Wi-fi hot spot that communicates the location information to the user system ).","Using the weather authentication schema, the user selects a sun icon from the information elements, which is compared with the parameter value determined by the weather application, and a comparison of the selected information element and the parameter value is made to authenticate the user with the system. Again, as indicated above, the icon selected changes based upon changing conditions, where in this embodiment the changing conditions reflect changes in the weather.","In another authentication schema, a multi-media file is presented that includes the information elements. In this embodiment, a sequence of images that is known to the user may be mixed in with other information elements. For example, a girl holding a kite, followed by the girl getting into a cab, and then the girl entering a red house (a sequence of three images). The sequence may be displayed along with or in sequence with other information elements. When the user sees the defined sequence, the user selects the image immediately following the sequence. This image may be different each time the sequence is displayed (e.g., the image may be randomly assigned at runtime). The parameter in this embodiment stores a value that is unknown until the image (i.e., information element) is assigned. Thus, the parameter is an unknown image or object that immediately follows a known sequence of information elements. The condition changes at each login; that is, the object that follows the sequence varies based upon random assignments at runtime. An observer who identifies the selection of the information element, e.g., a sneaker, would not be able to duplicate this password as the parameter value would change at the next login attempt (e.g., the image following the sequence may be a horseshoe).","In yet another authentication schema, the information elements may be presented as a multimedia file that depicts images and music. The information element for selection is known in advance by the user as a word that is displayed at the time the song mentions the word, \u2018moon.\u2019 The parameter is the unknown image associated with the word \u2018moon\u2019 in a song. Whenever the user hears the word \u2018moon\u2019 in the song, the user selects the image that is displayed at the exact time the user hears the word \u2018moon\u2019 in the song. The image differs for each instance of the word \u2018moon\u2019 in the song, such that an observer who witnesses the selection of a four-leaf clover by the user would not successfully duplicate the password as it is tied to the song and not to the image itself.","In a further authentication schema, the information elements may be presented in a maze or map on the display screen that depicts images that navigate the user through the map. A sequence of navigational markers or locations directs the user through the map (e.g., left, right, left) and is known in advance by the user. The map displays a series of images that direct the user through the map. The user selects the image that corresponds to the direction of the known sequence (e.g., left, right, left). The images may change each time the map is displayed such that an observer would not be able to duplicate the selection. For example, a banana peel corresponds to a left direction and a heart corresponds to a right direction. The user selects the banana peel as the first element in the sequence of left, right, left. The next time the user logs in to the user system , the banana peel may be replaced by a diamond. The user selects the image or information element that corresponds to the direction or location on the map. Thus, the parameter value corresponds to a location in the map, which in turn corresponds to the known direction navigated by the user in the authentication process.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product. Accordingly, aspects of the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a \u201ccircuit,\u201d \u201cmodule\u201d or \u201csystem.\u201d Furthermore, aspects of the present invention may take the form of a computer program product embodied in one or more computer readable medium(s) having computer readable program code embodied thereon.","Any combination of one or more computer readable medium(s) may be utilized.
