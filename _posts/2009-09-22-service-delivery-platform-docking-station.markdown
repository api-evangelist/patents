Technical Field","This application relates to a multiple layer implementation for a service delivery platform, which may, for example, support selection, activation, and provisioning of telecommunications services.","2. Related Art","The demand for telecommunications products and services continues to be driven by strong market demand for new services, enhanced capabilities for existing services, and increased cost effectiveness for those services. In the past, implementing telecommunications products and services required a significantly complex and expensive monolithic service delivery platform for implementing, provisioning, and executing telecommunications services. The monolithic service delivery platforms were inflexible, took long to implement and debug, and provided little, if any, customization capability.","A service delivery platform (SDP) docking station (referred to below as an \u201cextension\u201d) is part of a multiple layer service delivery platform implementation. The SDP extension adds, for example, a second SDP layer between the end subscriber and a core SDP. The core SDP implements the logic that enables, provisions, and executes telecommunications products and services. The SDP extension provides a customizable front end to the core SDP, to solve the technical problems of local service provider customization, flexible local selection and activation of products and services, and other technical problems.","Other systems, methods, features and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the following claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","104","106","104","106","108","110","112","104","106","114","116"]},"The service resellers ,  include service delivery platform extensions, such as the service delivery platform (SDP) extension . The SDP extension  communicates with the local BSS , OSS , and BI  to locally handle billing, support, service integration, reporting, and other telecommunications service provider functions. In addition, the extension  communicates with the core SDP  in place at a site established by a service aggregator . To that end, the core SDP  may expose web services interfaces toward the service resellers over which the SDP extension  communicates with the core SDP  to execute locally requested services.","The service aggregator  communicates through application enablers  to service providers . In the service aggregator , the core SDP  implements service execution and service provisioning to fulfill service requests and service provisioning requests arriving from the SDP extension . Accordingly, the core SDP  provides the fundamental capabilities to handle telecommunications service orchestration, service management, service catalogues, service subscriptions, identity management, and third party management. The service aggregator  may be an Accenture\u2122 service factory, an aggregator client, or other service aggregator that provides a core SDP.","Thus,  shows a multi-layer service delivery platform implementation . The implementation  implements service delivery in two layers. The first layer  includes the core SDP . The second layer  includes the localized SDP extensions , BSS, OSS, and other support systems which collaborate with the core SDP  to deliver services to local subscribers, and which facilitate local management and customization of user experience (e.g., personalized look and feel) for the local subscribers. The resultant multi-location SDP (composed of the two layers  and ) exposes the same services as provided by the core SDP , but implements its own user interfaces in the SDP extensions , and routes messages or parts of messages to local systems (e.g., the OSS  or BSS ) for local accounting.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["118","118","202","204","206","208","118","210","212","210","214","202","204","206","208","212","210","202","210","214","212","212","120","206","118"]},"The core service delivery platform interface  may implement any desired service proxies toward the core SDP  business services. These proxies natively integrate the extension  with the core SDP . The interface  may expose the service proxies as APIs, and may include message transformation logic to convert message formats used within the SDP extension  to message formats used within the core SDP . When each service call is invoked, within the SDP extension  the ESB  may duplicate corresponding support messages. One copy of the messages may route through the core service delivery platform interface  to the core SDP  to execute the core processing needed to support the service. Another copy of the messages, or portion thereof, may be used for local logging and metering, CDR generation, for BSS and OSS functionality and reporting, or other local functions.","The service orchestration component  implements a centrally managed messaging layer (e.g., with an ESB ) as a single point of contact to the subsystems (e.g., , , , , , , , ) within the SDP extension . The service orchestration component  further provides connectors to entities interacting with the service orchestration component .","The subscriber user interface component  may be implemented with a web application that subscribers access to activate, configure, and execute the services exposed by the extension . Because the extension  is a localized layer separate from the core SDP , the extension  may be widely customized to align with the look and feel desired by the local service reseller. In one implementation, the service orchestration component  exposes Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)-based Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for accessing the functions provided by the core SDP , and the subscriber user interface component  invokes the SOAP-based APIs and in turn exposes a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) to the subscriber.","The administration user interface component  may be implemented as a web application that an administrator accesses to manage the extension . As examples, the administration user interface component  may configure and monitor service orchestration, configure metering preferences for the metering component , and access metering and other reports.","The metering component  intercepts service calls, or data extracted from service calls, flowing through the service orchestration component . The metering component  may then store any desired information related to telecommunications service calls flowing through the service delivery platform extension  into a persistent layer , such as a metering database. In one implementation, XML Stylesheets (XLSTs) define the fields of each message to be saved by the metering component , such as user ID, time of request, duration of request, and other fields for building a CDR. The administration user interface component  configures the metering component  to set verbosity and depth of information that will be captured and retained in the persistent layer . The metering component produces Call Data Records (CDRs) for billing purposes.","The batch feed component  communicates data extracted from the metering component  to external systems on any desired schedule and with regard to any desired information stored in the persistent layer . In one implementation, the batch feed component  asynchronously extracts data according to an XML filter, transforms the data using XLST, and invokes an external engine, such as a rating or charging engine with the transformed data.","The network gateway adaptor (NGA)  converts requests to and from network elements. For example, the NGA  may be a Short Message Service (SMS) gateway and may convert messages from one datamodel format to another (e.g., consistent with the Short Message Peer to Peer (SMPP) protocol) for integrating, for example, with an SMS-Center. In other implementations, the NGA  may provide one or more network layers for communicating with any external entity.","The business adaptor  may implement a real-time interface toward the business support systems , such as customer resource management (CRM) and billing systems. For inbound requests the business adaptor  exposes web services APIs for the CRM systems to query extension  data. For outbound requests, the business adaptor  may send real-time CDRs to the billing systems () and may also implement message adaptation to convert message from one system format to another.","The operation adaptor  may provide a real-time interface toward the OSS , including integrated order management (IOM) and service assurance. For IOM, the operation adaptor  may expose APIs for user subscription to services. For service assurance, the operation adaptor  may expose a consolidated set of extension status flags and alarms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","118","300","302","202","204","300","304","304","120"]},"The architecture  also includes a service orchestration layer , which may implement the functionality noted above with respect to the local service orchestration component , the core service delivery platform interface , or other logic, such as the error handler logic . Inside of the service orchestration layer , business services  and component services  are defined and executed. The business services  provide provisioning services, such as adding a user, removing a user, clearing user data; authentication services; and service execution services, which invoke the corresponding service through the core SDP . The component services  may be provided to invoke external web services or other logic.","In one implementation, the service orchestration layer  includes routing and dispatching logic  and listener logic  to facilitate the communication of messages between the service orchestration layer  and the remainder of the architecture . Messages flow through the SDP extension  between queues controlled by queue managers.  shows three examples of queue managers for Java Message Service queues for specific types of messages: the metering queue manager , the batch feed queue manager , and the error handler queue manager .","The metering component  in the architecture  may include message reception and processing logic, such as the listener logic , and various message processing logic . The batch feed logic  may include scheduling logic  for controlling when data is communicated in batch form to other systems, as well as message processing logic .","The data access layer  may include data management logic for different functionality in the SDP extension . For example, the data access layer  may include a metering data manager , a routing data manager , and an error data manager . Each of the specific data managers may coordinate data flow between the persistence manager  and the SDP extension database  in the data layer . The persistence manager  may control how long and how much data is retained in the SDP extension database . The SDP extension database  may include the persistent layer  as part of a unified data model, or as a separate database.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","118","104","120","118","120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","118","504","506"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","118","602","603","204","606","604","120","604","120","602","118","120","608","118","610","120","118","118"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","118","120","604","702","704","118","704","704"]},"Upon selection of a service configuration, the SDP extension  may ask the product manager to provide additional service technical parameters. The additional parameters may establish, set, or otherwise configure the service for use (e.g., to set domain names, bandwidth, maximum number of users, to enable SMS functionality), and other configuration options. Such parameters may be entered through the services configuration user interface , for example.","The SDP extension  accepts the information entered through the user interfaces - and generates an order fulfillment request . The SDP extension  sends the order fulfillment request  to the core SDP . The core SDP  may accept, process, and activate the service, then send back an acknowledgement to the SDP extension . If the acknowledgement indicates successful activation, then the SPD extension  may insert a link to access the service on a home page access through the SDP extension . Alternatively, the SDP extension  may insert or install a supporting application or portlet into the subscriber portal accessed by subscribers to facilitate access to the newly activated product or service. The station user interface  may report whether activation has succeeded or failed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["800","118","802","120","118","802","804","804","806","808","118","802"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","118","206","118","216","118","206","902","206","118","902","206"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["1000","118","1002","1002","1004","1006","1008","1010"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIGS. 4 and 5"],"b":["1100","100","120","120","1102","1104","1106","1108","120","118","120","1110"]},"One technical advantage provided by the SDP extension  is its flexibility in terms of local customization (e.g., look and feel) for local customers. In that respect, the local reseller may customize the interfaces through which subscribers interact with the SDP extension  to any extent ().","In operation, the SDP extension  implements user interfaces such as the subscriber user interface  and the administration user interface  (). The SDP extension  interacts with the subscribers to execute services through the core SDP , while locally metering the service use using the metering component  ().","In addition, as noted above with respect to , the SDP extension  may obtain a service catalog  of available services from the core SDP  (). The SDP extension  generates and displays a service selection interface . The service selection interface  may display the services available from the core SDP , as listed in the service catalog. The SDP extension  may also accept service selections from the service selection interface listing (), and coordinate activation of the selected service with the core SDP  ().","The service delivery platform extension  may include a subscriber user interface component, a service metering component, a core service delivery platform interface component, and a local service orchestration component. The local service orchestration component may implement an enterprise service bus in communication with the subscriber user interface component, the administration user interface component, and the core service delivery platform interface component. In addition, the local service orchestration component may include service provisioning logic operable to generate a local service provisioning interface on the subscriber user interface component, receive a subscriber service provisioning request for a telecommunication service through the subscriber user interface component, communicate the subscriber service provisioning request through the local service orchestration component to the core service delivery platform interface component, communicate telecommunications service provisioning messages, through the core service delivery platform interface component, to a remote core service delivery platform which implements service provisioning to fulfill the service provisioning request, and locally meter, using the metering component, telecommunications service calls flowing through the service delivery platform extension and arising from the telecommunication service.","The service provisioning logic may be further programmed to download from the remote core service delivery platform a plugin extension for implementing the telecommunication service, and locally install the plugin extension in the service delivery platform extension. In addition, the service provisioning logic may be further operable to download a service catalog of available telecommunications services from the remote core service delivery platform, display a telecommunications service selection menu on the local service provisioning interface, the service selection menu comprising telecommunication service entries derived from the service catalog, as well as receive a subscriber service provisioning request for a telecommunication service selected from the telecommunications service selection menu.","The systems, components, and logic described above may be implemented in many different ways, including a combination of hardware and software, or as software for installation on any desired operating system including Linux, Unix, or Windows. The functionality may be implemented in a single system or functionally partitioned across multiple systems. As another example, the components, systems, and logic may be implemented as computer-executable instructions or as data structures in memory and may be stored on, distributed across, or read from many different types of machine-readable media. The machine-readable media may include RAM, ROM, hard disks, floppy disks, CD-ROMs, flash memory or other machine-readable medium. The components, systems and logic may also be encoded in a signal, such as a signal received from a network or partitioned into sections and received in multiple packets communicated across a network. The systems may be implemented in software, hardware, or a combination of software and hardware.","Furthermore, the systems may be implemented with additional, different, or fewer components. As one example, a processor or any other logic or component may be implemented with a microprocessor, a microcontroller, a DSP, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), program instructions, discrete analog or digital logic, or a combination of other types of circuits or logic. As another example, memories may be DRAM, SRAM, Flash or any other type of memory. The systems may be distributed among multiple components, such as among multiple processors and memories, optionally including multiple distributed processing systems. Logic, such as programs or circuitry, may be combined or split among multiple programs, distributed across several memories and processors, and may be implemented in or as a function library, such as a dynamic link library (DLL) or other shared library.","The transport layer between components and systems such as the core SDP and the SDP extension  or user devices and the core SDP  may include Transport Control Protocol (TCP), Real Time Transport Protocol (RTP) or other transport logic. The network layer may route information based on Internet Protocol v4, v6 (i.e., IPv4 or IPv6) or other network layer protocols. The data link layer may include wired or wireless links, such as IEEE 802.11, WiFi, WiMAX, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), Ethernet, or other data link layers over optical fiber, coaxial cable, twisted pair or other physical layers.","Interfaces between the systems and the logic and modules within systems may be implemented in numerous ways. For example, interfaces between systems may be Web Services, Simple Object Access Protocol, or Enterprise Service Bus interfaces. Other examples of interfaces include message passing, such as publish\/subscribe messaging, shared memory, and remote procedure calls.","The hardware and software platforms that run in the SDP DS may vary widely. As examples, the endpoints may run the Windows CE\u2122 operating system, JAVA ME\u2122 system, Symbian\u2122 operating system, Palm\u2122 operating system. The hardware platforms may be implemented with a general purpose processing platform, such as those available from Sun Microsystems, Hewlett Packard, or International Business Machines and running Unix, Windows\u2122, Linux or other operating systems.","While various embodiments of the invention have been described, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible within the scope of the invention.
