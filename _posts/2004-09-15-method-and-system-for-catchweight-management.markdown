{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","EXAMPLE 1","EXAMPLE 2","EXAMPLE 3"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of priority afforded by provisional application No. 60\/604,828 filed Aug. 27, 2004.","The field of the invention relates to software applications for catch-weight management and, in particular to methods and systems for the capture and processing of multiple units of measure (\u201cUOMs\u201d) with a variable relationship to each other for a single article type.","Currently catch-weight articles, in the strict sense, are articles for which there is a variable relationship between a base unit of measure (\u201cUOM\u201d) and a parallel UOM. As the relationship between the UOMs is unknown, or can vary every time goods movements are recorded, it is necessary to \u201ccatch,\u201d i.e., measure, the weight at each recordation. This means that a quantity has to be entered for both the parallel UOM and for the base UOM. This necessitates some form of weighing or measuring before entry. In addition, the fact that the articles could undergo natural shrinkage, such as weight loss during storage, must also be taken into account.","As conversion factors between the base UOM and the parallel UOM are not always fixed, both UOMs have to be updated separately in an inventory management application. The relationships between other alternative UOMs have to be fixed to either the base UOM or the parallel UOM (i.e., pallets (base UOM) to cases (parallel UOM)). Both the base UOM and the parallel UOM can be any UOM and are not restricted to a specific type of UOM (i.e., either UOM can be a volume, or a length, or a weight, etc.).","For certain materials in the Consumer Products (\u201cCP\u201d) industry, there is a distinction between a logistic UOM and a valuation UOM. While the logistic UOM is the deciding UOM for all processes in operative logistics (i.e., in every goods handling process), since the planning for and actual movement of the goods is accomplished using the logistic UOM, the valuation and payment flows take place on the basis of the valuation UOM. These materials occur mainly in businesses where non-standardized products are handled. A standardized product is a good where the conversion factor can be standardized, i.e., fixed, for example, for frozen food or standard packaged food, such as: fresh meat (chicken, beef, pork, etc.); some dairy companies that produce fresh cheese (rounds of cheese, etc.); fish industry; and other selected fresh food companies, such as those for fruits and vegetables.","The relationship between logistic and valuation UOM is variable and the logistic UOM is often expressed as pieces, cases or eaches, while the valuation UOM is often in weight UOMs like kilogram (\u201cKG\u201d or \u201ckg\u201d) or pounds (\u201cLB\u201d or \u201clb\u201d) are used. In addition, metric UOMs (e.g., length) or volume UOMs might be used as valuation UOMs. Unfortunately, conventional inventory management systems are not capable of dealing with this requirement.","For many materials in the Consumer Products industry, the piece UOM is just as important as the weight UOM. While the piece UOM is the deciding UOM for all processes in operative logistics (that is to say in every goods-handling process, in purchase orders and requests), the valuation and payment flows take place on the basis of the weight UOM. The relationship between the piece UOM and the weight UOM is, however, variable here. The weights, therefore, can vary from piece to piece, either due to biological variations or because of weight loss during transfer and\/or storage. This variability should not be lost by using fixed conversion factors, as this would mean that many business processes would be based on incorrect values. If, for example, 100 cases of meat that weigh 950 kg in total are delivered in a goods receipt, the use of a fixed conversion factor of 1:10 would lead to a higher stock quantity in kg than was actually delivered. In a valuation based on kg, the stock value in this example would also be too high.","If kg was used as the base UOM in this example, and the actual quantity of 950 kg was updated, conversion using the fixed conversion factors would lead to a too small number of cases, and rounding errors could also occur. There is an additional problem in the availability check here when the requests are processed in the piece UOM.","For materials with a variable relationship between the UOMs, updating quantities in only one UOM and using fixed conversion factors does not give a definitive display of the actual stocks in each of the different UOMs. Stock control becomes more difficult. Although there are no more cases of meat in the warehouse, for example, quantities can theoretically still be available in kg, as meat and other natural products, such as cheese and fish, lose weight through surface evaporation when stored unpacked. Inventory management only in the weight UOM will always give incorrect quantities. The only reliable stock criterion in this case is the piece UOM. Despite this, the weight UOM is also needed as it is used to value stock, and purchase and sales prices are expressed in monetary UOMs per weight UOM. This is explained in the following example:\n\n","As the management of the material, in the meat industry, for example, has an over-proportional influence on business results, it is very important to have exact inventory management for both the piece UOM and the weight UOM.","The Consumer Products area therefore has the following features desirable for a solution for catch-weight materials:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","120","130","140","160","170","180","190","130","180","190","140"]},"Therefore, there is a need in the art for an automated method and system to permit the efficient and parallel quantity updating of multiple UOMs information for a single good\/item.","Embodiments of the present invention provide improved methods and systems for the capture, processing and use of multiple UOMs for a single article type. Although, the multiple UOMs are, generally, not the same, there are embodiments in which they may be the same. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a method may include associating a base unit of measure with an article in a database; associating a parallel unit of measure with the article in the database, the parallel unit of measure having a planned conversion factor to the base unit of measure; and selecting a valuation unit of measure for the article from the base unit of measure and the parallel unit of measure. The method may also include storing a first base unit of measure value in the database for the article from a first location; and storing a second parallel unit of measure value in the database for the article upon issue from the first location, the second parallel unit of measure having a first conversion factor to the base unit of measure. The method may further include storing a new first base unit of measure value in the database for the article from a second location upon receipt of the article at the second location; and storing a new second parallel unit of measure value in the database for the article from the second location upon receipt of the article at the second location, the second parallel unit of measure having a second conversion factor to the base unit of measure.","The following phrases are used herein:","\u201cParallel quantity update\u201d refers to the system simultaneously updating two or more quantities entered during goods movements. Hereafter, if only two quantities are updated they may be referred to as \u201ctwo transaction quantities\u201d (\u201c2TQs\u201d).","The \u201cbase UOM\u201d is the UOM, in which materials are moved and planned, and the \u201cvaluation UOM\u201d is the UOM, in which materials are valued. This means that two scenarios are possible:\n\n","\u201cMultiple transaction quantities\u201d (\u201cMTQ\u201d) is the general term for the quantities in different UOMs that are entered in parallel within inventory management during goods movements and associated processes. Since this term was once used for describing scenarios with at a minimum two independent quantities in different UOMs, the phrase \u201ctwo transaction quantities\u201d was introduced for the identification of the business need for exactly two transaction quantities that are updated in parallel. Materials updated in two UOMs are referred to as 2TQ materials, which are handled, in parallel independent of their role as valuation or base UOM. If a weight is referred to just as 2ndTQ UOM, this is the additional UOM besides the base UOM independent of its role.","\u201cCatch-weight articles\u201d, in the strict sense, are articles for which there is a variable relationship between the base UOM and the 2ndTQ UOM. As the relationship between the UOMs is unknown, or can vary every time goods movements are entered, it is necessary to \u201ccatch,\u201d i.e., measure, the weight of the goods. This means that a quantity has to be entered for both the 2ndTQ UOM and for the base UOM. This necessitates some form of weighing or measuring of the good before entry. This helps to account for the fact that the articles can undergo natural shrinkage, such as weight loss during transportation and\/or over time during storage. As there are no fixed conversion factors between the base UOM and the 2ndTQ UOM, both UOMs have to be updated separately in an inventory management application. The relationships between other alternative UOMs have to be fixed to either the base UOM or the 2ndTQ UOM (i.e., pallets to cases).","\u201cRandom weight articles\u201d refer to articles for which there is a variable relationship between the base UOM and the 2ndTQ UOM. The term \u201crandom weight\u201d can be used interchangeably with the term \u201ccatch-weight.\u201d","\u201cBatch-specific UOMs\u201d (e.g., proportion\/product UOMs) refers to UOMs that have a batch-specific conversion factor for a material. This conversion factor is fixed for each batch as soon as the batch is posted for the first time. Batches are used for this standard functionality. Stock records are kept in base UOMs for materials with proportion\/product UOMs.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, alternative UOMs for goods in the inventory may be created with fixed conversion factors for the base UOM. These fixed conversion factors may be used in all goods movements and in the inventory display to convert quantities in alternative UOMs to quantities in the base UOM and vice versa. However, for many materials there is a variable relationship between alternative and base UOMs (random weight), meaning that fixed conversion factors may not be used. Although the relationship between these UOMs can be taken as fixed in planning processes, in extreme cases it may differ from goods movement to goods movement. Currently, when quantities are updated in just one UOM, the system does not store the variability between the inventory-managed UOMs.","Neither the entry nor parallel update of quantities in different UOMs currently exists to the full extent of its functionality in standard systems. \u201cParallel update\u201d refers to the parallel and\/or substantially simultaneous update of quantities in multiple UOMs with variable conversion factors Until now, the only way it has been possible to enter and update different conversion factors between the base UOM and an alternative UOM is by using batches as a basis. Unfortunately, this solution is not sufficient for many applications. For example, in financial applications, the problem with catch-weight processes is that valuation always uses the base UOM. Therefore, customers may either value on the basis of pieces, or they may use the weight UOM for logistical processes as well. To be able to meet the requirements arising from catch-weight processes, it may be possible to specify the valuation UOM independently of the base UOM. To provide this new option in a catch-weight solution, decoupled financial components may be needed to implement the parallel update of quantities in different UOMs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","210","220","230","240","250","210","1","2","3","4","210","5","230","12","240","220","6","230","230","10","250","7","230","7","240","9","230","250","8","240","11","230","250"],"i":["a","b"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","305","310","320","330","340","350","360","310","310","312","310","316","317","318","319","310","340","314","350","315","360"]},"In sales delivery component  a sales order element  may be involved in generating and processing sales orders from customers, a delivery element  may control delivering goods listed in the sales orders and verifying the amount of the delivered goods, and a billing element  for billing the customers based on the verified amount of delivered goods.

Planning process  may send its logistics planning information to production process , which may use the information in combination with the goods receipt from goods receipt purchase order process  to produce a production goods receipt using both UOMs for the finished product.

Likewise, in warehouse processes only the base UOM may be supported. In inbound and outbound processes to the warehouse, a second UOM may be added to the transfer order, although the transfer order requisition may stay with the base UOM and the basis for confirmation of picking activities may also be the base UOM. In case the order UOM in the sales order differs from the logistic UOM, the effect on the process may be that the order UOM may be converted to the base UOM in the delivery document with keeping the original order UOM in parallel for information.

statistical goods receipt is posted before the billing document may be created. Therefore, a third-party purchase order item may be set up to be invoiced via a goods-receipt-based invoice verification system. Such a goods-receipt-based invoice verification may guarantee for a third-party purchase order item that a goods receipt is posted before an invoice document may be posted.","Physical inventory element  may perform inventory management to post goods movements for catch-weight managed materials. Although not all transactions for goods movements may be supported for the catch-weight materials, the quantities may be stored and managed by Inventory Management () for all and the material values may be stored and managed by inventory accounting component , non-catch-weight managed materials as well as catch-weight managed materials.","In , when entering a goods movement, the different UOM quantities for the goods may be entered. For materials that are not catch-weight managed, the standard fields for quantities may be ready for input, although the catch-weight specific quantity fields may not be visible. In general, the catch-weight specific quantity fields will only be visible and ready for input for catch-weight managed materials. The system may be able to default to values for the different quantities. The default logic may be implemented in a Business Add-In (BADI). Moreover the BADI may contain an implementation to check tolerances, i.e., the relation between the quantity in base UOM and valuation UOM.","A physical inventory for materials in warehouse management  (\u201cWM\u201d) may be done as always, because quantities in WM  may be managed in one UOM, the base UOM or an alternative UOM to the base UOM. When posting the differences, an approximation for the quantity in the valuation UOM may be calculated. The physical inventory information in the inventory management component  may provide for the approximated quantities in base UOM as well as in 2ndTQ UOM (or corresponding alternative UOMs)","Invoice verification element  may receive invoice documents with actual values. In invoice verification element , only two quantities might be entered: the quantity in a purchase order UOMs and in purchase order price UOMs. The values and quantities defaulted to by the system may be edited in an item list. If order UOM and order price UOM are identical, only the field for the quantity in order UOM may be editable. Therefore, the quantity in order UOM and order price UOM will then be the same. In general, standard default logic may be used during an assignment or reassignment process. Although, the standard default logic may not be suited for all customers that work with the catch-weight solution, a BADI may be used to implement customer-specific default logic for quantities and values.","Invoice verification element  may use the catch-weight invoice documents to update the purchase order history in MM component  by updating the quantity in order UOM and in order price UOM as well as the invoiced amounts. Goods receipts may only be used to update the purchase order history with the quantities in order UOM and order price UOM as well as in base UOM. In general, the goods receipts will not write the corresponding values to the purchase order history and no changes are necessary in the invoice verification element  for a correct update of purchase order histories.","For certain products, such as precious metals, invoice verification element  may automatically perform \u201crepricing\u201d of the purchase conditions during goods receipt for the purchase order. The repricing may replace the original condition price with the appropriate current price (for example, the current gold price). The requirement for MTQ materials is that for quantity-based conditions, the conditions value at goods receipt may be repriced per UOM for which a condition exists, based on the actual quantities entered or calculated. This means that the system may carry out a quantity-based \u201crepricing\u201d. This requires, in principle, waiting to perform the repricing until all quantities may be known. In addition, the problem of quantity variations may be handled by invoice verification element . This means that in cases of under or over quantity deliveries, invoice verification element  may either calculate new prices for the affected scales, or refer the scale conditions to the planned quantities from the purchase order, according to customer requirements.","Alternatively, price determination in purchasing may be performed using the price copy control technique. In this technique, the document conditions of the purchase order position may be transferred at goods receipt and updated as needed. As a result, an independent price determination may be possible in the material document and the document conditions may be stored for the material document by specifying a copy control in the system. What this means is that the system may determine how the document conditions of an order item of document type X, item category Y may be transferred to a material document item of document type Z (movement type Z). As a result, the conditions may be copied and undergo a price determination in accordance with the price determination category. For example, the following may occur:\n\n","Currently, the ordered and delivered quantities may be updated in the purchase order price UOM and the purchase order UOM in the purchase order history and the associated history. For MTQ materials, the quantities in the corresponding UOMs may be to be adjusted to the actual entered or calculated quantities after goods receipt. This may be illustrated by an example from the Consumer Products area. For example, cheese may be ordered from a vendor in boxes containing five rounds of cheese, but the actual weight of a box of cheese cannot be determined at the purchase order stage. The purchase order price UOM is in kilograms. A conversion factor for kilogram to box must therefore be given for price determination in the purchase order. The actual weight of the cheese is not determined until goods receipt, when the delivered cheese is weighed. The conversion routines that convert the purchase order price from purchase order UOM to valuation UOM instead of base UOM may be adjusted. The conversion is needed, for example, to compare the valuation price and the purchase order price. As the valuation price now refers to the valuation UOM, the base UOM may be replaced by the valuation UOM.","When the invoice is received\/entered, the actual values (including delivery costs) may be defaulted to by the system and inserted, either manually or automatically. In the purchase order history the purchase order UOM and the purchase order price UOM are known. In case the purchase order UOM is weight and the purchase order price UOM is also weight (independent of the setup of the logistic and valuation UOM), the logistic UOM may not be known in invoice verification. The purchase order history may be displayed in the purchase order UOM, and in the purchase order price UOM. Because of requirements in invoice verification, it may also be necessary to be able to display the purchase order history in the valuation UOM, for MTQ materials. Therefore, the purchase order price UOM may be equal to the valuation UOM, since the valuation UOM may not be explicitly added to invoice verification.","Since the goods receipt is always to be posted in financial components , in , the invoice verification element  may assume that no goods receipt for the purchase order has taken place (=invoice receipt before goods receipt). Therefore, invoice verification element  may post the complete invoiced amount (excluding taxes) to goods receipt\/invoice receipt (\u201cGR\/IR\u201d) information , independent of the sequence of invoice receipt and goods receipt. In general, invoice documents may not be posted to stock accounts. The posting logic for invoice verification element  may be adjusted and may be valid for all transactions, e.g., when posting invoices, credit memos, subsequent debits and credits. Canceling invoice documents may also follow this posting logic. In general, direct posting to material stock accounts will not be supported in the catch-weight solution.","The catch-weight system may only be used to clear quantity differences, but may not call accounting interface  if there is only a difference between delivered and invoiced quantity. The transaction may only create a logistics document and an entry in the purchase order history to balance the quantity. However, in the catch-weight system it may be necessary to also forward the quantity differences to inventory\/accounting component . Accounting interface  may transfer the necessary GR\/IR data to inventory accounting component  where it may be used to create line items in the corresponding journal.","In the architecture  illustrated in , a third-party order may create a purchase order requisition that may later be used to create a third-party purchase order. The third-party order may always be created in the order UOM and the order UOM of the third-party purchase order may correspond to the same UOM, i.e., it may be adopted from the third-party order. As a consequence goods receipts and invoice documents that are posted for a third-party purchase order item may contain the correct quantities that may be forwarded to SD component  for billing. The billing index may be built from the incoming invoices that are posted for a third-party purchase order. Since the billing index does not need the 2TQ quantity, which only serves as a trigger for billing, the interface of invoice verification element  to SD component  need not be extended.","In the catch-weight solution the stock information may be kept in inventory management component  and may have a stock overview transaction that receives the data to be displayed from inventory management component  and may show the stock in two different quantity UOMs.","In accordance with the present embodiment, in sales delivery (\u201cSD\u201d) component , there is, generally, only one UOM in the sales order available. According to the entered material there may be a check whether it is a 2TQ material or not. For 2TQ materials, only an indicator may be set in the background. The following requests may be taken into consideration for the sales order processing:\n\n","In accordance with the present embodiment, the fulfillment of a sales order may be done in sales UOM for catch-weight items (instead of base UOM for standard items). In the sales order item, the order quantity that is still open may be calculated based on the quantity that has already been delivered, the under-delivery and over-delivery tolerances and the completion rule, and a status may be determined. Normally for non-catch-weight materials the basis for the calculation of the open quantity and the status determination is, apart from materials with batch-specific UOMs, the quantity in base UOM.","In the architecture  illustrated in , the 2ndTQ quantity from billing document element  may not be transferred to the follow-on document in debit memo and credit memo requests (e.g., order documents) for catch-weight materials. Since the price determination may be based on the 2ndTQ quantity, the correct process may be to directly transfer the billing document to a credit or debit memo where changes may be directly entered in the credit\/debit memo. When a credit or debit memo request is being created, an information message may be displayed, if a 2ndTQ quantity is available in the referenced billing document. If so, the credit or debit memo may be created directly. In this case the credit memo may be created with a status of \u201cblocked\u201d and released to financial component  via accounting interface  after the correct 2ndTQ quantity is entered. In this way an approval process may be established by directly using credit and debit memos without an intermediate debit or credit memo request. Return Orders may be handled with restrictions regarding the standard, for example,\n\n","In billing element  the 2ndTQ quantity that may be updated for each delivery item may also be available in the billing document for price determination. In general, it may be sufficient to access the relevant delivery items to determine the relevant condition quantities and condition values in the billing document. However, since prices and conditions may be determined again in the billing document, quantities may be changed when a billing document is created by billing element . As billing documents may also be used as reference documents for credit and debit memos, the 2ndTQ quantity may be updated for the billing document too. This solution may permit a user to create credit and debit memos as billing documents with reference to an existing billing document and then the defaulted catch-weight quantities from the reference document may also be changed when creating the credit and debit memo. In the case of a new valuation UOM the interface to financials may include the quantity relevant to the valuation. In outbound processes, only delivery based billing might be possible and order-related billing may not be supported (i.e., cash sales), except for third-party ordering. Third-party ordering may also be possible for catch-weight materials under certain conditions.","Price determination for 2TQ quantities may be carried out with the quantities that were created or calculated for the purchase order goods receipt and in the billing document in SD component . This means that the quantity conversion in the price determination may not always run with the numerator and denominator from the (planned factors) material management component . The 2ndTQ quantity created or calculated in their relevant process may be taken into consideration when determining the condition basis for quantity-based prices or conditions. The prerequisite for this is that this quantity is already in the price determination. As a result, the quantities may be transferred to the relevant application when calling the price determination. There are three different cases, which may result from determining the condition basis:\n\n","In outbound deliveries the sales UOM may describe the UOM being transferred from the preceding documents (particularly the order: sometimes also with other descriptions) as the delivery UOM. Fulfillment in sales UOMs may be the logical approach from the process point of view. However, as long as the ATP check is only done in the base UOM, this may cause inconsistencies during the process, if, for example, a weight UOM was used in the order and cases are the base UOM. The completeness of the picking process may always be checked with the base UOM independent of the sales UOM used in the customer order. To guarantee a consistent process, the sales UOM (of the delivery), in general, is either the base UOM or it is convertible using a fixed ratio. Under this prerequisite, preceding documents may be completed on the sales UOM (i.e., batch splitting) for 2TQ materials. In the WM interface, the logic may work with the base UOM so the delivery may be completely picked, if the quantity of the base UOM is fulfilled.","When creating an outbound delivery from preceding documents (for example, order, stock transfer order, etc.), all planned quantities may be copied and an additional 2ndTQ quantity may be calculated or set from sales or base quantity. When a rush order is saved, one or more deliveries may be created. The details given above may still be relevant, regardless of the fact that no availability check may be run. When a delivery is created without a reference, the planned conversion factors from material management component  may be used to convert delivery quantities and quantities stored. Otherwise, the same process may be used as described above for changing the delivery.","An automatic batch determination may be performed when creating deliveries and changing individual items. The batches that are determined may be added as batch split items from the delivery with reference to the batch's main item. The quantities of the sub items on the main item may be accumulated in the base UOM. At the same time, they may be taken from the quantities that are to be delivered in sales and base UOMs so that these quantities may be reduced to zero for an item that is completely covered by batches. The delivery quantity and the remaining 2ndTQ UOM may be reduced on the main item one by one using the relevant quantity from the batch split items instead of being calculated using the planned conversion factors from the stored quantity.","Likewise, correlated items in the delivery (for example, bills of material, delivery groups, etc.) may consist of a main item and several sub items. If the quantity is changed on the main item, the quantities in the sub items may automatically be correlated via the quantities in base UOM.","Creating a picking order may be accomplished by creating a WM  transfer order. When this is created, the quantity in sales UOM that can be converted by planned factors into the base UOM may be entered as the target quantity in the base UOM. In case several transfer orders are generated for a delivery item, the quantity may be adjusted accordingly. If the WM component  is handling-unit management active, the picking order may contain single quantities or handling units.","The net weight of a non-2TQ quantity may result directly from the net weight stored for the base UOM in the material management component . The gross weight and the volume may depend on the sales UOM and may be calculated using the fixed conversion factors from the stored quantity. When the 2ndTQ UOM is a weight or volume UOM, the corresponding weight or volume fields may be synchronized automatically correspondingly to the 2ndTQ quantity. In this case, for 2TQ materials, the weight and volume data from material management component  may be only a proposal as long as the actual 2ndTQ quantity has not been entered\/caught. The gross weight\/volume of a 2TQ material may be determined based on the master data and the sales UOM, as long, as no actual 2ndTQ quantity has been caught. When the actual 2ndTQ quantity has been determined and entered, the corresponding gross UOM (gross weight, volume) may be calculated based on the actual 2ndTQ quantity, the sales UOM and the tare (i.e., gross\u2212net). If UOMs are displayed as weight or volume UOMs, then the net weight and volume fields may no longer be changed. Otherwise, as described above, weights and volumes that have been changed manually may be adjusted proportionally.","Business Application Programming Interfaces (\u201cBAPIs\u201d)\/Intermediate Documents (\u201cIDocs\u201d) may contain additional optional fields for the additional 2ndTQ quantity. In addition, the 2ndTQ quantity in the proof of delivery will be provided.","An incompleteness protocol may be written, if the 2ndTQ quantity picked or packed is not entered manually or the calculated quantity based on planned conversion is not confirmed manually or automatically. If this occurs, goods issue and invoice documents may not be created.","The inbound delivery is the equivalent of a shipping notification, which is simply an Electronic Date Interchange (EDI) message. A goods receipt (\u201cGR\u201d) to the warehouse may be carried out using an inbound delivery. Extensions to the inbound delivery may be made analogous to the previously described extensions. In addition to quantity in a base UOM, the 2ndTQ quantity may be entered. If one of the updated UOMs is a weight UOM, the net and gross weight may be adjusted in the delivery.","In the architecture  illustrated in , transactions in WM component  may be oriented towards the physical processes in the warehouse. A simple removal from storage, therefore, may be a process consisting of several steps, for example, removal from storage=creating a transfer order+receipt confirmation+material transport confirmation. The material stocks may be held in WM component  on the storage bin level in base UOM only. The stock in 2ndTQ UOM may be known for each material for the whole warehouse (=total stock of the storage location in inventory management), but may not be known on the storage bin level. Internal movements within the warehouse (i.e., from bin to bin) generally do not need the 2ndTQ quantity. The additional 2ndTQ quantity may only be needed for movements that change the total stock of the warehouse (or more precisely the total stock of a storage location). Such movements may be removals for an outbound delivery or transfer postings from one storage location to another. The stock may be updated in the logistics UOM when it is placed in storage or removed from storage. The quantities in 2ndTQ UOM may be entered during confirmation of a transfer order (\u201cTO\u201d) in WM component . The physical inventory on the storage bin level may not be possible for the 2ndTQ quantity, as it is generally not held at the storage bin level. If stock differences occur either inside the physical inventory process (i.e. on the base UOM level) or outside the physical inventory process (e.g. one missing piece on a storage bin during picking) the stock in inventory management may be updated using the planned conversion factor or an average factor on storage location level, which may estimate the unknown 2ndTQ quantity. Since handling units may also be supporting 2ndTQ quantities, they may be used to keep track of 2ndTQ quantities inside the warehouse at the pallet level (i.e. on the handling unit level).","The IDocs of a warehouse management warehouse control unit (\u201cWM-WCU\u201d) interface may be enhanced to include the relevant UOMs (i.e., 2ndTQ UOMs and 2ndTQ quantity fields). In this way 2ndTQ quantities may be transferred to a subsystem (e.g., a Warehouse Control System) and may be confirmed again by the subsystem. The BAPIs for the integration of a decentralized WM component  may contain additional optional fields for the 2ndTQ quantity.","Internal stock transfers (i.e., transfer from one storage bin to another, like a replenishment to a picking bin) are generally, not relevant for the 2ndTQ quantity, since the total stocks in the warehouse for 2TQ materials in internal movements do not change. As a result, transfer orders for such transfers may not need 2ndTQ quantities.","Delivery is complete, if the transfer order has fulfilled the required quantity from the delivery in the base UOM or in a UOM, which has a fixed conversion factor to the base UOM.","Handling units are packages that may be used for the logistics-related components. There are special handling unit managed storage locations whose stock are managed by Handling Unit Management. The handling unit may lead to material transfer postings for packing and unpacking processes. A handling unit is a n-level hierarchy that may contain materials on every level. These material items may use only the base quantity and\/or, for catch-weight relevant materials, the 2ndTQ quantity. The 2ndTQ quantities may be evaluated and posted in the goods movement postings for the handling units between HU and non-HU managed storage locations. It may be possible to enter and maintain the 2ndTQ quantity for every material item of a handling unit. Handling unit management may be integrated into the WM component  and the delivery processes. The following processes may be supported for catch-weight relevant materials in WM component :\n\n","In production planning and control (\u201cPP\u201d), it may not be necessary to update the valuation UOM in the order even if it varies from the base UOM, since the production can still operate with production quantities and base quantities. Only from a controlling perspective may it be necessary to keep track of the confirmed values in the valuation UOM, for example:\n\n","In confirmations of production orders the goods movements for 2TQ components may be supported. This may also apply for back flushing of 2TQ-managed components if the 2TQ material is combined with product UOMs. The interim table for posting confirmations that is also used from a process control system (\u201cPCS\u201d) interface will be extended with an additional 2ndTQ quantity.","The material quantity calculation may stay unchanged to permit using the available functionality for 2TQ materials in combination with product UOMs. Material quantity calculation may also be used after confirmation of the process order for adapting the planned quantities of component materials even with product UOMs.","Goods movements that were automatic may be triggered using process messages and process instruction sheets. It may also be possible to use goods movements' postings for 2TQ materials, to copy the 2TQ quantities from a subsystem in process messages, and create the 2TQ quantities in the process instruction sheet. As the 2TQ function concerns the quantity special stock segments and all goods movements in particular, it may be considered to provide the relevant statistics update with the information on quantities in two UOMs. An availability check may be carried out for the base UOM only.","For batch-specific UOMs, the ATP check  and purchase order process  may only be able to map to the base UOM, such that it may be needed to couple the product quantities and the 2TQ processing. Two priorities may be implemented for the conversion:\n\n","The following criteria may be relevant to selecting batches in the batch determination:\n\n","The 2ndTQ quantity may be determined according to the planned conversion in the stock determination or calculated according to a defined conversion routine. In exceptional cases, the 2ndTQ quantity might be entered manually.","In the architecture  illustrated , all goods movements may be valued in inventory accounting component  at standard prices or moving average price and documented with financial documents. Valuation may always be on the basis of the valuation UOM. Other UOMs are, generally, not available in financials component . To correct variances between the physical inventory and the book inventory, physical inventory may be taken on key dates. The inventory quantity differences may be entered in the logistics components, while valuation may take place in financials component .","Goods receipts and invoice receipts may be integrated with the new inventory management in financial component . Goods receipts may be valued at standard price, but not with the purchase order price. When the GR\/IR account  is cleared, purchase price variances may be posted.","Production scenarios include production by lot size (PP production orders) and process manufacturing (PP-PI process orders). Both make-to-stock production and make-to-order production scenarios are possible. For production orders and process orders, activity consumption might only be recorded in production confirmations. Central entry of goods movements facilitates both goods issues and goods receipts for orders to be entered and posted. Overhead may be allocated in the period-end closing activities. The value of the work in process may be corrected and target costs may be calculated.","Sales processing may remain in sales delivery component . Goods issues for sales orders may be valued and posted in the financial component . Billing may be triggered in SD component  and posted in financial component . Sales revenues and the cost of sales may be analyzed in profitability analysis (\u201cCO-PA\u201d) matrix .","The catch-weight management architecture  illustrated in , including inventory accounting component , may be activated at the client level. All financial valuations may be based on the quantity in the valuation UOM, which may be relevant to both catch-weight and to materials with fixed conversion factors. Only the valuation UOM may be available in the inventory accounting component  and may be defined independently of the base UOM.","General ledger (\u201cGL\u201d)  documents may be updated in financial component  for all financial-relevant transactions. In addition, the line items for GL  documents may be stored (such as, accounts receivable and payable). For example, only the line items that document business transactions from the perspective inventory accounting component  and may be created in financial component  might be stored, such as warehouse inventories and work-in-process inventories and GR\/IR (goods receipt\/invoice receipt allocation). This helps ensure that no redundant documents are stored in either inventory accounting component  or financial component . From the perspective GL  ledger, the business transactions may be documented in (document+line item) and, depending on the subsidiary ledger, either assets, customers, and vendors in financial component  or inventories and GR\/IR in inventory accounting component .","Since no catch-weight processes need to be supported for GL , all GL  functionality in financial component  may continue unchanged. However, subsidiary ledgers affected by changes (e.g., materials\/work in process or inventories) may be re-implemented in inventory accounting component . Postings from these subsidiary ledgers may be posted back to the GL  the account level through accounting interface .","The general ledger  may be updated from the subsidiary ledger \u201cinventories\u201d. The following postings may be posted from inventory accounting component  back to the GL  so that all postings necessary for proper closing are in GL . Specifically, the postings can include warehouse inventories, work-in-process inventories (\u201cWIP\u201d); and price differences. Updating GL  may take place at the account level through accounting interface  both synchronously and transaction-based during each goods movement posted in inventory accounting financial component .","Accounts for material inventories and WIP inventories are the same in financial component  and inventory accounting  and, thus, the posting may be transferred one-to-one from inventory accounting component  to financial component .","Activity allocations may be posted in inventory accounting component  as a primary posting (on account+cost element). However, for a secondary posting (i.e., inventory financial component ), if it is not possible to update the Work in Process inventory account (balance sheet account), the posting may be transferred to GL  in exactly the same form. Therefore, an account may exist in GL  for the \u201callocated activities\u201d cost element (=secondary cost element). To support this posting logic it may be possible to create financial component  accounts for secondary cost elements with overheads or activity allocation.","Overhead costs may also be posted primarily in inventory accounting component . Financial component  may be updated through accounting interface . However, this may mean that the overhead costs may be posted under a secondary cost element and a matching financial component  account.","Material ledger functions may be divided up between MM component  and financial component  and a partial subsidiary ledger functionality may be implemented in inventory accounting component , for example, a new subsidiary ledger for materials. In this new subsidiary ledger, the balance sheet item inventories may be displayed broken down into sub-items. The subsidiary ledger may consist of several sub items including, for example, raw materials and supplies, trading goods, goods produced in-house (semi finished products and finished products), and work in process. Lean inventory management engine  may provide the logistical inventory management function to update all material inventories and inventory-relevant goods movements in the logistical UOM and in the valuation UOM. Goods movements that are relevant to valuation may be transferred to inventory accounting component  in the valuation UOM. In the new subsidiary ledger Inventories, the movements may be valued and the financial documents may be generated. Inventory accounting component  may recognize only the quantity in the valuation UOM since movements and inventories may be valued at standard price. Although in the present embodiment, embodiments are contemplated in which the moving average price may be supported.","In MM component  only standard prices may be used for all materials, even non-catch-weight materials. Price control may be equal to standard price for all material types and it is generally not possible to change the price control. In general, valuation may be based on the material\/plant level and split valuation and valuation at the batch level may not be supported. However, embodiments of the present invention are contemplated in which split valuation and valuation may be supported at the batch level. Production orders and process orders in general ledger  may be used as logistical objects and to calculate and store planned costs. All actual postings may be done in the financial components and may never be posted in the general ledger  production or process orders. For each production\/process order there may be an additional object in the financial component to collect the actual costs. It may be important to hide some financials-relevant fields in order to prevent period-end closing activities (WIP, variances) from being carried out in general ledger . Period-end closing for production orders and process orders may be triggered and executed in financial component . New order types with the corresponding settings may be created and all other order types may be deleted.","Goods receipt for purchase orders may be valued at standard price (e.g., stock and GR\/IR posting at standard price). The goods receipt may be valued in inventory accounting component  and may be subsequently posted through accounting interface  in real-time (transaction-based) general ledger .","Invoice verification may remain in general ledger  logistics invoice verification since the goods receipt may be posted in the financial component  and invoice verification may assume that no GR for the purchase order has taken place (=invoice receipt before goods receipt). Invoice verification may therefore post the complete invoiced amount (excluding taxes) to the GR\/IR account . Invoices may not be blocked just because of the posting logic \u201cinvoice receipt before goods receipt\u201d or because the goods receipt posting is not valued in general ledger . Direct postings to material accounts may not be supported in invoice verification.","In standard general ledger processing, for purchase orders with no quantity differences between goods receipt and invoice receipt, the balance on the GR\/IR account  may be automatically balanced to zero when the goods receipt and invoice receipt are posted. Quantity differences between goods receipt and invoice receipt may result in a balance on a GR\/IR clearing account. If no more goods or invoices for the purchase order are received, the balance may be cleared manually. The clearing may be done, for example at the end of a period or fiscal year.","As an embodiment of the present invention, the catch-weight system may have a different logic, specifically:\n\n","All goods movements may be posted from the inventory management component  to inventory accounting . Nevertheless, there are still material-based postings that may still be posted directly in GL , for example, invoice verification. To ensure a homogeneous and coordinated solution, the \u201caccount determination\u201d may operate on the basis of the settings in GL . That is, the valuation class may still be maintained in material management component , and the assignment of accounts to transactions may be configured to be in material management component .","Standard prices may only be changed after a cost estimate has been released, and inventory cost estimates and price calculations for balance sheet valuation purposes (first-in, first-out (\u201cFIFO\u201d), last-in, first-out (\u201cLIFO\u201d), lowest value, etc.) may not be supported for catch-weight materials or for non-catch-weight materials. However, embodiments are contemplated in which balance sheet valuations may be supported.","In GL , material consumptions, activities, and overhead may be posted to the production order or process order as actual costs. During period end closing, WIP information  may be allocated from the order to WIP cost elements or accounts. In the financial component, material consumption may be posted directly from the material stock to the work-in-process inventory as an accounting exchange on the assets side. Activity consumption and overhead may also be posted directly as work in process. The benefits of this solution may include:\n\n","The plan price may be set manually and may be calculated iteratively by GL . The planned prices may be calculated in accordance with planned activity types for each cost center and activity type by dividing the planned costs by the planned activity quantity. Revaluation of the posted actual activity flows with changed plan prices may not be supported in the present embodiment. However, alternative embodiments are contemplated in which revaluation may be supported. In actual price determination, the system may calculate the prices iteratively for activity type on the basis of actual costs and actual activity quantities. Although revaluation of the posted actual activity flows with actual prices is not supported in the present embodiment, alternative embodiments are contemplated in which revaluation is supported.","Activity allocations and overhead may be posted in the inventory accounting component . The work-in-process inventory may be debited and the cost centers may be credited accordingly. Accounts and primary cost elements may be used both for posting to the work-in-process inventory and for the posting \u201cinternal activities.\u201d Activity allocations may be posted to GL  through a standard interface, for example, accounting interface , which ensures that Cost Center Accounting is updated correctly. The activity quantity may be updated to the general ledger line items in addition to the cost center and the activity type. The activity allocation may still be posted with a secondary cost element, since updating the output quantity to the cost center is only possible with secondary cost elements. If the output quantity on the cost center were not posted, it would not be possible to calculate actual prices. For overheads the following posting logic may be used: debit WIP (balance sheet account) and credit cost center (secondary cost element with account).","Activity allocations within CO-OM  on cost centers or internal orders may be posted with standard GL transactions and only updated in GL . In general, activity allocations may only be posted on production orders with the confirmation transaction in Production Planning and Control\/Production Planning for Process Industries (\u201cPP\/PP-PI\u201d).","Although updating of commitments is not supported, alternative embodiments are contemplated in which it may be supported.","The complete internal order functionality may remain in GL , with only small constraints, for example, no commitments on internal orders, and no WIP calculation for internal orders.","Product cost planning component (\u201cCO-PC-PCP\u201d)  may be used in the catch-weight system. Cost estimates may be created based on quantities in valuation UOM. To recalculate from the base UOM to the valuation UOM, the planned conversion factors from material management component  may be used. The GL  cost estimated with quantity structure may be used without any restrictions, and it may also be used to create raw material cost estimates. However, moving average, tax and commercial prices may or may not be available depending on the implementation. The costing lot size (in material management component ) may be maintained in the valuation UOM. Overheads may be calculated using the costing sheet, but template calculations may or may not be supported.","Planned scrap may be specified in the logistical structures (Bill of Materials (\u201cBOM\u201d), material master, or routing) and the following types of scrap may be supported in product cost planning:\n\n","By-products may be valued with a fixed price to reduce the cost of the primary product (or of the cost estimate). In the BOM of the leading co-product, the by-product maybe listed with a negative quantity. A fixed price for the by-product may be specified in the material master. The negative quantity in the BOM may be valued with this price. For product cost planning it is also possible to apportion the total cost across multiple co-products based on equivalence numbers. The apportionment structure may be maintained in material management component . If it is not possible to split actual costs to the different co-products, actual cost posting and reporting may always be on the leading co-product. Preliminary settlement may or may not be supported.","Since all material-based processes in GL Cost Object Controlling use the base UOM, separate financial components for the catch-weight solution are needed. In general, GL Cost Object Controlling (\u201cCO-PC-OBJ\u201d) may not be used in the catch-weight system, including not even for non-catch-weight materials.","Preliminary costing may be done using the GL  functionality and planned costs may be stored on GL  production or process orders.","The financial component quantities may only updated in the valuation UOM. Actual costs (or work in process) maybe posted when materials are consumed for orders or when production activities are confirmed. The consumption of materials in the production process (i.e., goods issue for order) may be entered in two UOMs (e.g., pieces and kilograms). The quantities in the valuation UOM may be used for the update of work in process in inventory accounting component . If the material consumption is entered in the base UOM only, the quantity in the valuation UOM may be calculated using the planned conversion factor in material management component . For production back flushes, a direct activity allocation that debits the WIP inventory  and credits the cost center may be posted in the inventory accounting component . Overhead may be allocated based on quantities or as a percentage of the direct costs. When the overhead is allocated, WIP inventory  may be debited and the cost center may be credited (primary posting, since relevant to inventory). Actual overhead costs may be calculated in each period. When goods receipts (GR) are entered, work-in-process inventory  may be transferred to the warehouse stock. This posting may be based on the GR quantity in the valuation UOM and may be valued using the standard price of the material being manufactured.","By-products may be entered in the BOM as material items with a negative quantity and a fixed price may be entered in the system for all by-products. Goods receipts for by-products may also result in a reposting of WIP to warehouse stock. This posting may be valued with the fixed price of the by-product. In such a case, preliminary settlement for joint production may not be supported; however, this case is merely an exemplary embodiment, as it is contemplated that preliminary settlement may be supported, as discussed above.","Since WIP inventory  may be updated directly with all consumption for production orders or process orders, only a periodic run to correct and adjust the WIP inventory  may be needed. This run may be triggered and executed in inventory accounting component  and repost the variances in WIP inventory  to a price difference account (P&L account). The closing process may cancel the WIP for certain orders, for example, orders that may have the status \u201cfinal delivery\u201d, \u201ctechnically completed\u201d, or \u201ccompleted for business\u201d. Although, variances may not be calculated in GL  target costs for all standard GL  target cost versions may be calculated. These target costs may be transferred to a data warehouse and in combination with the actual cost information the data warehouse may define a variance reporting in the data.","Actual scrap postings may or may not be possible, since confirmations for the order or at the last operation of the order may only specify the yield. After a quality check, yield may be re-posted to a material number for B goods by means of a material-to-material transfer posting, if necessary. The standard price for B materials may be specified manually. Similarly, although rework may or may not be supported.","Sales orders may not have a CO object (this applies to both make-to-stock and make-to-order production), which means that no postings on sales orders may be possible. Therefore, planned costs may not be calculated for sales orders and sales orders may not be costed. There may be only one standard price for each material\/plant combination. Sales order stocks may be valued with this standard price, although it is contemplated that sales orders may have a CO object to permit postings on sales orders.","Profit center accounting may be done in GL . For all the postings done in the inventory accounting component , profit centers may be derived similar to the GL  logic for: materials inventory from material master; work in process from process or production order to profit center from the produced material; material consumptions for cost centers or internal orders from cost center or order master; and activity allocations and overheads from cost center master and order. It is contemplated that transfer prices may and\/or may not be supported.","Since the sales order may not have a CO object, there may be no make-to-order production with a CO object.","Billing may be based on the value for different UOMs. However, the primary UOM may be the weight (i.e., the valuation UOM) and a condition for the consumption price may be updated with the value from the goods issue or the standard price. There may be no valuation of material movements in GL  and no standard price in GL . In general, all material valuation may take place in the inventory accounting component . At the time of billing, the total cost of sales may be available in CO-PA . To supply CO-PA  with detailed information on the cost of goods sold, it may be possible to transfer the cost component split from product cost planning  to CO-PA . This may require transferring the quantity sold in valuation UOMs from the billing document to CO-PA .","Profitability analysis may be handled by CO-PA  and costing-based profitability analysis may be supported in inventory accounting component .","The valuation UOM may be relevant for results reporting (e.g., kilograms or tons). Sales delivery component  may send the valuation UOM to CO-PA , both on the sales order and on the billing document. An SD quantity field may send the same UOM to CO-PA (that is, either the valuation UOM or always the base UOM).","As an exemplary embodiment, the following information from billing element  may be sent to CO-PA : quantities; revenues; sales deductions; and cost of sales (\u201cCOS\u201d). The cost of goods manufactured (with cost component split) may be transferred from CO-PCP-CP  to CO-PA . In GL , overhead may be transferred from GL  Cost Center Accounting to CO-PA . In general, production variances may not be transferred to CO-PA .","Further, the general evaluation level may be on the characteristics, i.e., for example, division, customer group, product\/product group. In addition, third-party business transactions may not be supported in CO-PA  for the catch-weight system.","Further, financial component  standard reporting may not be used in the following areas because the data in financial component  that may be reported is only updated in inventory accounting component , including inventory reporting with valued inventories and cost object controlling.","Several embodiments of the present invention are specifically illustrated and described herein.
