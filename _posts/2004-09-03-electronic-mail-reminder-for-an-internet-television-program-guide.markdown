{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/987,740 filed Dec. 9, 1997 now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/938,028, filed Sep. 18, 1997 now abandoned, which are incorporated herein in their entireties.","This invention relates to the Internet, and more particularly, to techniques for reminding a user via electronic mail (e-mail) of scheduled television programs displayed on an Internet television program guide.","Cable, satellite, and broadcast television systems provide viewers with a large number of television channels. Viewers have traditionally had to consult preprinted television program listings to determine which programs were scheduled to be broadcast on a particular day and at a particular time. Technological advances have allowed more convenient and advanced program guide services to be developed. For example, passive television-based program guides have been developed that allow television viewers to view television program listings directly on their television sets. In addition, interactive television program guide services have been developed that allow a service provider to deliver television program listings data to a user's set-top box. An interactive program guide application in the set-top box allows the user to display the television program listings on the user's television set. More recently, television program guide systems have been developed that provide television program listings over the Internet.","With such an Internet television program guide system, users with personal computers or integrated personal computers and televisions (PC\/TVS) can obtain television program listings on-line. In addition, the users of Internet television program guides are able to view promotional video clips, interview segments, audio clips, and other multimedia material related to a given television program.","Although Internet television program guides provide users with a number of useful features, users are still faced with the problem of missing the television programs that they desire to watch because of not remembering when the program is to be broadcast on television. Users must often refer back to the program listings to determine when desired programs are to air.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a way to remind users of Internet television program guides when certain television programs are to be aired.","This and other objects of the invention are accomplished in accordance with the principles of the present invention by providing an Internet television program guide electronic-mail (e-mail) reminder system. The system sends e-mail messages to users to remind the users when selected television programs are to be aired.","Television program information and related data for an Internet television program guide are provided to a web server from a computer system which may be maintained by a service provider. The web server provides this information to the user's multimedia system via an Internet communications link. The user's multimedia system may include a personal computer, an integrated personal computer and television, or an Internet capable set-top box and a television.","The program information and related data are preferably provided to the user's multimedia system in the form of one or more web pages. Program guide listings may be displayed in a grid format organized in channel order from top to bottom and by broadcast time from left to right. Web browser cursors allow the user to scroll through the listings to locate programs at different times in the day or different days in the month.","If a user selects a program or pay-per-view event from the program listings, additional information related to the program or event may be displayed in a program information box. In addition to viewing further information on the program selected, the user may order an e-mail reminder message to remind the user when the selected program will be broadcast. Options are provided that allow the user to determine when and how many messages will be generated and received. Before the scheduled broadcast time of each selected program, the system sends an e-mail message to the user that reminds the user of the program.","If desired, the user may order e-mail reminder messages without first viewing the program listings. This may be accomplished by directly entering the title of a television program for which reminders are to be ordered. This approach is useful when the user knows the program title and does not wish to consult the program listings or when the user knows the program title but does not know the location of the program in the program listings.","The user may also view a list of all currently requested e-mail reminders. Information such as the program name, type of e-mail reminder, and the date and time the request was submitted may be displayed on the list for each reminder. Entries may be added to the current reminder list as soon as the user submits a new request. In addition, the user may cancel reminder entries if the user no longer wishes to be reminded of that program.","In another aspect of the invention, e-mail reminder messages may be ordered and generated to remind a user when scheduled pay-per-view programs will be broadcast.","In yet another aspect of the invention, e-mail reminders may be ordered and generated based on other preferences which the user can specify.","Further features of the invention, its nature and various advantages will be more apparent from the accompanying drawings and the following detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiments.","An Internet television program guide system  in accordance with the present invention is shown in .
