title: Mechanism to adjust and restrain gun traverse on a tripod mount
abstract: A traverse stop clamp is provided for restricting sweep of a machine gun mounted on a tripod. The stop clamp is installable on a traverse bar connecting to rear legs of the tripod, the traverse bar having an inverse U-shape cross-section that form edges at ends of the U-shape. The stop clamp includes an open ring member, a shift member, a handle, a spring pin and a locking nut. The open ring member has a C-shaped ring with an interrupted circumferential outer periphery and an inner periphery with channels for receiving the edges of the traverse bar. The outer periphery has first and second ring ends separated by an adjustable gap. The open ring member further includes first and second tabs disposed to extend radially outward from the first and second ends. These first and second tabs respectively have first and second through-holes. The shift member has a tang and a shaft at respectively first and second shifter ends. The receiver has a third through-hole, and the shaft has a threaded terminus. The tang and shaft pass respectively through the first and second through-holes. The handle has a lever and a clevis head with coaxial fourth through-holes. The head has a cam separating a lock clevis face and a release clevis face. The lock clevis face engages the tang in response to the lever being adjacent the outer periphery. The release clevis face engages the tang in response to pulling the lever away from the outer periphery. The handle pivots at the fourth-through-holes to widen the gap between the tabs. The spring pin passes through the fourth and third through-holes to connect the tang and the clevis head pivotably together. The threaded lock nut attaches to the threaded terminus to engage the second tab.

In particular, the invention relates to devices designed as a physical stop to limit pivot sweep angle of fire from a machine gun mounted to a tripod.","The US Army (USA) and US Marine Corps (USMC) have used the M122 machine gun tripod since about 1935, which provides a more stable and versatile platform for accurate and controlled angular sweep during successive firings than available by the bipod mounted to a standard M240 machine gun. To enable soldiers and marines to flank a position forward of the M240 gun, the gunner restricts the sweep with a rear leg of the M122 tripod for the first side, and a hose clamp (or duct tape) for the second side. Such conventional and impromptu techniques do not provide definitive stopping positions and can be cumbersome and time-consuming to install.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["100","110","120","125","130","135","120","110","120","140","145","150","140","150","155","160","160","165","155"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["170","110","180","185","180","190","125","195","165","160","155","170"]},"Conventional traverse stop devices for machine gun tripods yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, exemplary embodiments provide a traverse stop clamp for restricting sweep of a machine gun mounted on a tripod. The stop clamp is installable on a traverse bar installed on rear legs of the tripod, the traverse bar having an inverse U-shape cross-section that form edges at ends of the U-shape. The stop clamp includes an open ring member, a shift member, a handle, a spring pin and a locking nut.","In exemplary embodiments, the open ring member has a C-shaped ring with an interrupted circumferential outer periphery and an inner periphery with channels for receiving the edges of the traverse bar. The outer periphery has first and second ring ends separated by an adjustable gap. The open ring member further includes first and second tabs disposed to extend radially outward from the first and second ends. These first and second tabs respectively have first and second through-holes. The shift member has a tang and a shaft at respectively first and second shifter ends. The receiver has a third through-hole, and the shaft has a threaded terminus. The tang and shaft pass respectively through the first and second through-holes. The handle has a lever and a clevis head with coaxial fourth through-holes.","The head has a cam separating a lock clevis face and a release clevis face. The lock clevis face engages the tang in response to the lever being adjacent the outer periphery. The release clevis face engages the tang in response to pulling the lever away from the outer periphery. The handle pivots at the fourth-through-holes to widen the gap between the tabs. The spring pin passes through the fourth and third through-holes to connect the tang and the clevis head pivotably together. The threaded lock nut attaches to the threaded terminus to engage the second tab.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Exemplary embodiments are provided in response to USMC requirements. The adjustable traverse limiting clamp constitutes part of the tripod system and has been designed for quick, easy, and secure position adjustments of sweep angle. The clamp can slide freely along the traverse bar and be locked into position by a cam lever. The clamp functions as a physical stop to the traverse of a tripod-mounted gun so as to be quickly reset to another position without the need of tools.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["200","210","220","225","230","235","220","210","220","240","245","250","240","250","260","270","210","230","240","250","230","240","250","240","250"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["280","210","290","260","260","290","295","195","190","225","170"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","290","310","295","315","320","310","330","335","295","330","310","335","330","335","295","330","315","195","170","295","320","325"]},"The T&E adjuster  also includes a graduated shaft , a base , an azimuth adjustment wheel  (between the shaft  and the base ), a bracket  with a mounting channel  that rests on the traverse bar . A screw  on the bracket  enables tightening of the channel  on the bar  via a handle . The shaft  extends below the elevating wheel  and is threaded to enable elevation of the yoke assembly  for adjustment up and down.

However, sufficient flexibility existed in the ring member  that this was deemed somewhat superfluous, but not adverse to operation. The flanking channels  inhibit rotation of the stop clamp  while sliding along the elongated member . By contrast, the DISA mount for German MG3 machine gun included traverse stops for a traverse bar having a key spline to inhibit rotation of its associated clamp, which was a bivalve composition, the distal end secured to the spline and the proximal end being adjustable by lock washers and shims, and lockable by a pivoting handle.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 6A","b":["600","270","510","610","620","625","630","635","610","570","410","575","520","640","645"]},"A cam screw  includes a tang  and the shaft  with threaded portion .

The stop clamp , when engaged with the lever  pushed adjacent the C-ring , provides sufficient hoop compression to hold the stop clamp  fixed on the traverse bar . Pulling the lever  loosens the C-ring  and enables the stop clamp  to slide along the elongated member  for rapid adjustment of firing sweep limits in the field.","In summary, the cam screw  operates as a tensioner when the stop clamp  is engaged with the elongated member . The tang  prevents the handle  from rotating within the stop clamp . Optionally, the stop clamp  by its configuration maintains upright orientation on the traverse bar . This rotation inhibition is accomplished by aligned channels that conform to a hollowing chamber of the elongated member , the latter design feature having the advantage of reduced weight.","The exemplary adjustment sprocket  and offset through-hole  enable tension compensation of the traverse bar  when connecting the legs  and  together. By altering the angular position of the hole  in the first end , the length of the traverse bar  can be extended slightly, to compensate for misalignment and component wear from field use. The hole  can be repositioned by removing the sprocket  from the toothed cavity in the first end , rotating the sprocket  in relation to its previous position, and reinserting the sprocket  within the toothed cavity, both cavity and sprocket  having complementary patterns that provide a snug non-interference fit.","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art.
