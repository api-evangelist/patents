Field of the Invention","This invention relates to health related data analysis and more particularly relates to an apparatus system and method for rapid cohort analysis.","2. Description of the Related Art","Most corporations, including health insurance corporations, maintain a high volume of data. Such data may be analyzed and exploited for valuable information regarding business trends, and other important statistics. Data mining is a common strategy for identifying and analyzing such data.","There are many various forms of data mining. Custom analytic operations may be developed to meet specific needs. Alternatively, commercially available statistical analysis tools, such as Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) may be used to identify statistical trends in data.","Health insurance companies typically maintain databases of health insurance claim information, demographic information, and other data about health insurance plan members. Such information may be used to gain valuable insights into disease causes, progressions, and potential cures. Unfortunately, typical methods for analyzing such data are often cumbersome, costly, and require unworkably high processing times and resources.","The referenced shortcomings are not intended to be exhaustive, but rather are among many that tend to impair the effectiveness of previously known techniques disease management; however, those mentioned here are sufficient to demonstrate that the methodologies appearing in the art have not been satisfactory and that a significant need exists for the techniques described and claimed in this disclosure.","From the foregoing discussion, it should be apparent that a need exists for an apparatus, system, and method for rapid cohort analysis.","An apparatus for rapid cohort analysis is presented. In one embodiment, the apparatus includes an interface and a processor. The interface may receive an identifier of a first index attribute. The processor may search the database for a first group of records associated with the first index attribute, search the database for a second group of records, each record in the second group of records sharing a common second index attribute with a record in the first group of records, but not associated with the first index attribute, and calculate a statistic in response to information associated with the first group of records and the second group of records.","A system is also presented for rapid cohort analysis. In one embodiment, the system includes a data storage device configured to store a database comprising one or more records, each record having one or more attributes. The system may also include a server in data communication with the data storage device. The server may receive an identifier of a first index attribute, search the database for a first group of records associated with the first index attribute, search the database for a second group of records, each record in the second group of records sharing a common second index attribute with a record in the first group of records, but not associated with the first index attribute, and calculate a statistic in response to information associated with the first group of records and the second group of records.","In one embodiment, the server may narrow the first group of records according to a limiting criterion. In a further embodiment, the server may assign a first distinguishing identifier to each record in a subset of the first group of records in response to a determination that the subset of records have a common value for the second index attribute. The server may also assign a second distinguishing identifier to a record in the second group of records that corresponds to the first distinguishing identifier assigned to a record in the subset of the first group of records.","In one embodiment, the server may count distinct records in the first group of records and the second group of records. The server may also aggregate records from the first group and from the second group according to a selected attribute. In still another embodiment, the server may compute a probability in response to a ratio of a number of records in the first group having the selected attribute and a number of records in the second group having the selected attribute.","A method is also presented for rapid cohort analysis.

The method may also include assigning a first distinguishing identifier to each record in a subset of the first group of records in response to a determination that the subset of records have a common value for the second index attribute. Additionally, the method may include assigning a second distinguishing identifier to a record in the second group of records that corresponds to the first distinguishing identifier assigned to a record in the subset of the first group of records.","In a further embodiment, calculating the statistic further comprises counting distinct records in the first group of records and the second group of records. Calculating the statistic may also include aggregating records from the first group and from the second group according to a selected attribute. Additionally, calculating the statistic may include computing a probability in response to a ratio of a number of records in the first group having the selected attribute and a number of records in the second group having the selected attribute.","The term \u201ccoupled\u201d is defined as connected, although not necessarily directly, and not necessarily mechanically.","The terms \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d are defined as one or more unless this disclosure explicitly requires otherwise.","The term \u201csubstantially\u201d and its variations are defined as being largely but not necessarily wholly what is specified as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, and in one nonlimiting embodiment \u201csubstantially\u201d refers to ranges within 10%, preferably within 5%, more preferably within 1%, and most preferably within 0.5% of what is specified.","The terms \u201ccomprise\u201d (and any form of comprise, such as \u201ccomprises\u201d and \u201ccomprising\u201d), \u201chave\u201d (and any form of have, such as \u201chas\u201d and \u201chaving\u201d), \u201cinclude\u201d (and any form of include, such as \u201cincludes\u201d and \u201cincluding\u201d) and \u201ccontain\u201d (and any form of contain, such as \u201ccontains\u201d and \u201ccontaining\u201d) are open-ended linking verbs.

This may be referred to as an \u201cindex signature.\u201d For example, it may be helpful for a user of the present apparatus, system, and method, to identify occurrences of a particular combination of diagnoses, events, characteristics, or the like. In such an example, a physician may desire to know the number of males over the age of 40 who have both diabetes and renal failure. Thus, the first index attribute in this example may include the diagnosis code for diabetes, as well as a diagnosis code for renal failure, an age attribute having a value over \u201840,\u2019 and a gender attribute having a value of \u2018male.\u2019 Similarly, the second index attribute may include a combination of a plurality of attributes, field values, characteristics, or variables. In certain aspects, the first group of records and the second group of records may differ in one index attribute (the first index attribute), such as a diagnosis of disease, but can share a combination of attributes (the second index attributes), such as age, gender, area, minority status, income level, etc.","In a further example, the first and second attributes may include a temporal component. For example, the first index attribute may include a temporal difference between two attributes. In such an embodiment, the trigger for the first index attribute would include the combination of two attributes separated by a specified time frame. In such an example, the first group of records may include all diabetics with a retinopathy within 1 year of diabetic onset (which could be either an ICD9 code or a lab reading or both) with another set of attribute of interest aggregated 1 to 5 years after the first retinopathy diagnosis. The second group of records (the cohort group) may include the entire patient population or could be limited to diabetics of the desired enrollment span who have not had a retinopathy.","Although the various functions of the server  and the processor  are described in the context of modules, the methods, processes, and software described herein are not limited to a modular structure.

Alternatively, the functions may be implemented in software coded in C, C++, C#, php, Java, or the like. In still another embodiment, the functions may be implemented in web based instructions, including HTML, XML, etc.","Generally, the interface module  may receive user inputs and display user outputs. For example, the interface module  may receive an identifier of a first index attribute. The interface module may further receive identifiers of one or more second index attributes, limiting criterion, and other user inputs. In a further embodiment, the interface module  may display cohort analysis results. Such cohort analysis results may include statistics, tables, charts, graphs, recommendations, and the like.","Structurally, the interface module  may include one or more of an I\/O adapter , a communications adapter , a user interface adapter , and\/or a display adapter . The interface module  may further include I\/O ports, pins, pads, wires, busses, and the like for facilitating communications between the processor  and the various adapters and interface components -.

These software modules may include a first search module , a second search module , and a calculation module .","In a specific embodiment, the processor  may load and execute computer software configured to generate, retrieve, send, or otherwise operate SQL instructions. For example, the first search module  may communicate a first SQL query to the data storage device  which is configured to search the database for a first group of records associated with the first index attribute. The first index attribute may include a field value, such as a healthcare billing or diagnosis code stored in a database of healthcare insurance information. In a specific embodiment, the first search operation may identify a first group of individuals having records that include a specified ICD-9 diagnosis code. For example, the first search may identify a first group of records in the database associated with individuals that have been diagnosed with diabetes.","The second search module  may generate and\/or communicate a second SQL query to the database in response to the results of the first SQL query. The second query may be configured to search the database for a second group of records, each record in the second group of records sharing a common second index attribute with a record in the first group of records, but not associated with the first index attribute. The second group of records may be cohorts of the first group of records. The second index attribute may include a separate field of data values stored in the records. For example, the second index attribute may include a field value that indicates certain specified characteristics of the individuals associated with the records, such as age, gender, minority status, a geographic feature, lab tests, lab results, other diseases or diagnoses, use of medication, a genetic feature (presence or absence of a genetic marker such as single nucleotide polymorphism, a specific genotype, a specific gene or gene cluster, a characteristic of a specific chromosome), and the like, or a combination thereof.","By way of example, the first search module  may identify a first group of individuals that have been diagnosed with diabetes or some other illness based on an ICD-9 field value associated with such a medical diagnosis. The second search module  may then identify cohorts for each individual or record identified by the first search. The cohorts may share one or more common second index attributes with the individuals or records identified in the first group, such as age, gender, or the like; however, the cohorts would not include the first index attribute. In this example, the cohorts may be the same age and gender as the individuals in the first group, but not have been diagnosed with diabetes.","In certain embodiments, for each record identified in the first group, the second search module  may identify one or more cohorts, for example, at least or about 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200 cohorts (or any range derivable therein) with a difference in the first index attribute but a matching second index attribute. For example, for each record associated with a diabetic subject, 100 non-diabetic cohorts may be identified for a match of age and gender. This aspect may reduce the noise in cohort matching and measurement of attributes to compare between matching records in the second group (primary) and the first group (cohort) by over-sampling.","In further embodiments, the cohort group can be sampled in a deterministic or random way by altering the analytic function of the second search module . For example, as shown in the SQL instructions described later, the cohort group may be sampled randomly based on internal data access with specific instructions like:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"row_number( ) over (partition by age_at_onset2,year_of_onset2,"]},{"entry":[{},"gender order by year_of_onset2) rn_inplay2"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In another embodiment, the second search module  may identify the cohort group of records by forcing randomness into the cohort group, as exemplified by the instructions like:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"row_number( ) over (partition by age_at_onset2,year_of_onset2,"]},{"entry":[{},"gender order by random( ) ) rn_inplay2"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In a further aspects, the sampling of the cohort group may be performed in a deterministic manner with predetermined individuals as matching cohorts, with exemplary instructions like:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"row_number( ) over (partition by age_at_onset2,year_of_onset2,"]},{"entry":[{},"gender order by individual_id) rn_inplay2"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In a further embodiment, the first search module  and the second search module  may be integrated into a single search module. Specifically, a single set of SQL instructions may be used to both identify the first group of records and identify the cohorts. The benefits of this embodiment may include reduced system overhead, reduced search and analysis time, reduced labor for configuration and generation of queries, etc. For example, with a single integrated SQL query, a user may be able to obtain results for analysis in far less time than he\/she might otherwise expect. Such an embodiment, would not require separate analysis and generation of separate queries for the first group and the second group. Consequently, a significant time savings may be realized.","In one embodiment, the calculation module  may calculate a statistic in response to information associated with the first group of records and the second group of records. For example, the calculation module may include analogue or digital logic, firmware, or software configured to carry out one or more calculations according to one or more predefined logic functions. In a further embodiment, the processor  may include a software defined calculation module  configured to perform analysis and calculation of statistics in response to the information and data retrieved from the database for the first group of records and the associated second group of cohort records.","In a specific embodiment, the first search module  and the second search module  may feed retrieved data into a spreadsheet configured to perform one or more calculations on the data. For example an Excel\u00ae spreadsheet may include one or more embedded functions or operations configured to calculate statistics such as averages, odds ratios and other probabilities, counts, summations, and the like. The data may be automatically imported into a spreadsheet using a macro, a software-based script, or the like. In an alternative embodiment, the calculation module  may include hard-coded or dynamically variable software functions for calculating such statistics and generating results for a user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","600","102","302","302","702","704","706","606","708","710","712","714"]},"In a further embodiment, the narrow module  may narrow the first group of records according to a limiting criterion. The narrow module  may narrow the first group of records by restricting search parameters before the first search is performed. Alternatively, the narrow module  may filter, remove, or otherwise delete the search results according to the limiting criterion. In a certain embodiment, multiple limiting criteria may be used to restrict the scope of the returned search results. In one embodiment, a limiting criteria may include a field value, such as record date, age, gender, or the like.","In one embodiment, the server  may assign a first distinguishing identifier to each record in a subset of the first group of records in response to a determination that the subset of records have a common value for the second index attribute. For example, the processor  may include a first assignment module  configured to assign the first distinguishing identifier to the records. In an alternative embodiment, an SQL command generated by the server  or stored in RAM  or on the data storage device  may include instructions, that when executed by a storage controller  or the processor  on the server , may cause the first distinguishing identifier to be assigned to each of the matching records. In such an example, the SQL code may include instructions to search the database for records associated with a diagnosis code indicating diabetes or some other illness. If multiple search results have matching second index attributes, such as age, gender, or the like, the SQL instructions may include an operation to assign an incremental distinguishing identifier, such as a \u20181\u2019, \u20182\u2019, or \u20183\u2019 to each of the records in the subset of records having common second index attributes.","Similarly, the server  may assign a second distinguishing identifier to a record in the second group of records that corresponds to the first distinguishing identifier assigned to a record in the subset of the first group of records. This operation may be performed in similar ways as those described above with relation to the first distinguishing identifier. Specifically, a second assignment module  may make the assignment. Alternatively, an SQL operation embedded with the search may perform the assignment.","In one embodiment, the server  may include a count module  configured to count distinct records in the first group of records and the second group of records. The counting function may be implemented using a hardware-based counter. Alternatively, the counting function may be implemented in software. In a specific embodiment, the processor  may execute SQL instructions configured to provide the record count in response to search or query results. In such an embodiment, the counting function may be integrated with the search and assignment instructions into a single set of SQL commands or instructions.","In one embodiment, the server  may include an aggregation module  configured to aggregate records from the first group and from the second group according to a selected attribute. For example, the selected attribute shared between the first and the second group may be a temporal index date, such as a start date of certain event or occurrence, e.g., diagnosis, treatment, drug administration, procedures, lab tests, or the like. In certain embodiments, the temporal index date may be set by an event for each record (primary) in the first group (e.g., onset date of diabetes or insertion of a pacemaker) and set in an arbitrary manner for each matching record (cohort) in the second group (e.g. the same event date for each primary-cohort pair when the cohort in the second group is the same age as the primary). In other embodiments, the temporal index date may be set by an event for each record in the first group (e.g. onset date of diabetes, administration of a drug, perform a treatment or procedure, or insertion of a pacemaker) and may be set in a determined manner in the second group (e.g. the time the cohort shared a similar but different event, such as administration of a different drug, onset of a related but different treatment or procedure, or insertion of a different pacemaker brand). The index date could be seconds, hours, years, or a combination thereof, etc, depending on the event.","In certain embodiments, after determination of the index date for each record, the first and second groups of records may be aggregated respectively on the relatively same time frame for comparison as further illustrated in .","The server  may also include other modules for computing, formatting, and otherwise producing statistics, including a compute module  and a graph module . The compute module  may compute a probability in response to a ratio of a number of records in the first group having the selected attribute and a number of records in the second group having the selected attribute. The graph may generate, format, and provide a graphical representation of the statistics. These modules - may be stand-alone modules implemented in hardware, firmware, or software. Alternatively, the functions may be accomplished through commercial calculation products or spreadsheets, or software or SQL instructions that are integrated with the other functions of the server . In a specific embodiment, the calculation module , including some or all of its component modules -, may communicate the statistics with the interface module  for display or communication to a user.","The schematic flow chart diagrams that follow are generally set forth as logical flow chart diagrams. As such, the depicted order and labeled steps are indicative of one embodiment of the presented method. Other steps and methods may be conceived that are equivalent in function, logic, or effect to one or more steps, or portions thereof, of the illustrated method. Additionally, the format and symbols employed are provided to explain the logical steps of the method and are understood not to limit the scope of the method. Although various arrow types and line types may be employed in the flow chart diagrams, they are understood not to limit the scope of the corresponding method. Indeed, some arrows or other connectors may be used to indicate only the logical flow of the method. For instance, an arrow may indicate a waiting or monitoring period of unspecified duration between enumerated steps of the depicted method. Additionally, the order in which a particular method occurs may or may not strictly adhere to the order of the corresponding steps shown.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","602","802","800","302","804","104","302"]},"The processor  may then issue a command to search  the database for a second group of records. Each record in the second group of records may share a common second index attribute (which could be one or more common attributes) with a record in the first group of records, but not include the first index attribute. For example, SQL query issued by the processor  may also include a query statement to search for a second group of individuals, each individual having the same age and\/or gender as an individual identified in the first group, but not having the diabetes diagnosis code in their record. These individuals in the second group may be considered cohorts of the individuals in the first group of records.","The server  may then receive the results from the database searches , . The calculation module  may then calculate  a statistic in response to the information associated with the first group of records and the second group of records. For example, a spreadsheet program may calculate probabilities of being diagnosed with diabetes in the presence of certain identified lab values, other diagnoses, physical conditions, healthcare patterns, weight, age, gender, etc. The statistics may include averages, probabilities, and other computational products including identification of trends and commonalities among the records.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","900","602","902","602","602"]},"Limiting criterion may include windowing values configured to limit or restrict the time frames from which records will be searched, restrictions on minimum enrollment time, minimum number of records, gender restrictions, age restrictions, and other similar threshold and limiting values. The narrowing module  may incorporate the limiting criterion into a query used to search  the database for the first group of records associated with the first index attribute. For example, the query may search for all records associated with individuals that have been diagnosed with diabetes, but the query may be restricted to return only results associated with individuals that have at least two years worth of records in the database.","If the first assignment module  determined  that multiple records within the first group of records have common second index attributes, the first assignment module  may assign  a distinguishing identifier to each matching record. The second search module  may then search  the database for cohorts of each record in the first group. If it had been determined  that multiple records in the first group of records had common second index attributes, the second assignment module  may assign a distinguishing identifier to each of the cohort records in the second group of records that correspond to a distinguished record in the first group of records. In such an embodiment, the second search module  may identify a cohort for each record in the first group of records.","In one embodiment, the aggregation module  may aggregate  records from the first group and from the second group according to a selected attribute. An example of aggregation  is illustrated in . The compute module  may then compute  an odds ratio. In an alternative embodiment, the compute module  may compute an average, or some other mathematical statistic. In certain further embodiments, the count module  may produce a count of records having a selected characteristic, as shown in . In still a further embodiment, the graph module  may generate one or more graphs to graphically display one or more statistics calculated by the server .","In a specific example, the server may send a single set of SQL instruction to perform the first search , assign  distinguishing identifiers, perform the second search , and other searching functions. In a further embodiment, the SQL instructions may further include instructions for aggregating  the records.
