title: Maritime emergency cable cutter
abstract: A marine cable cutter is provided for wirelessly severing wire responsive to an electromagnetic command signal. The cutter includes an explosive package for wrapping around the wire, and a clamshell case for containing the package around the wire. The package includes a wireless receiver to receive the command signal, an electric pulse generator triggered by the receiver, an explosive initiated by the generator, and a platform for containing the receiver, generator and explosive. The clamshell case includes a pair of envelopes connected along mutual first edges by a hinge and mutual second edges by respective clamps. The envelopes pivot on the hinge to open and receive the package with disposal of the wire therein, and subsequently to close and secure by the clamps. The envelopes can be composed of sheet metal with the clamps being flanges with aligned holes for receiving bolt fasteners.

In particular, the invention relates to a mechanism to expeditiously and reliably sever a heavy-duty cable used between ships for supply operations.","Naval ship replenishment at sea, also known as an undersea replenishment (UNREP) operation, involves rendezvous of approach and control ships on parallel courses, followed by connection of ships by a span cable. For liquid supplies, e.g., fuel, the delivering ship extends a hose along the cable to the receiving ship for connection to the appropriate receptacle. Other supplies, such as weapon stores can also be exchanged via cable suspension.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","125","130","135","140","145","150","155","140","145","150","155","160","165","155","110","180","160","190","120","195"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","110","120","220","225","110","230","235","240","245","250","255","260","265","255","260","270","220","110","275","250","120","280","285","255","260","265"]},"In the event of an emergency replenishment termination, the cable is severed manually.

The completed and installed assembly can operate to sever the span wire  on command. Upon receiving an electromagnetic commanding signal from a ship-board transmitter, the trigger switch  can initiate a pulse from the oscillator  for discharging the caps  to detonate their charges .","The afore-described embodiments provide a mechanism to safely and reliably cut heavy braided steel span wires , in the event of an emergency during heavy underway replenishment operations. The objective is to fabricate an emergency-use explosive cable cutter (as in view ), which is safe, reliable, and can meet safety certifications necessary for shipboard use. Flexible linear shaped charges  represent an exemplary reliable method for cutting the braided steel span wire  (typically 1\u215c\u2033 in diameter). Shipboard applications would enable minimization of fragmentation and blast effects from any explosive cable cutting system\u2014while still ensuring effective use.","The exemplary embodiments provide a two-part modular assembly: first a heavy blast-resistant clamshell case , designed to easily clamp around and fasten onto the braided steel cable; and second, a flexible conformal cutting charge package , which readily inserts into the case . This package  contains the secure wireless remote detonation switch , a voltage multiplier-charge capacitor pulse generator , a long-life battery , two strips of flexible linear shaped charge  with industry-standard igniters  and blasting caps . In the event of an emergency, such as the fouling of cables interconnecting two ships  and  during UNREP in heavy seas, the UNREP supervisor could press a button to remotely trigger the explosive cable cutting device, and sever the fouled span wire  or other similar cable.","Within the United States joint and international military community, such a device would have general applicability to combat engineering brigades, and potentially for purpose applications faced by special operations forces. Building demolition companies could employ such a device for dismantling bridges, and other structures with steel reinforcement bar of significant dimensions.","Conventional explosive cable cutters are not approved for shipboard operation due to blast and fragmentation considerations. Mechanical cutting systems, e.g., electric drive or hydraulic drive, are relatively slow and require unacceptably many seconds (or minutes) to sever a heavy braided steel cable. Further, these systems require support systems such as electricity, wiring, hydraulics, and hydraulic lines. Reliability and maintenance of these electrical and hydraulic systems over the long-haul are perceived to be cost prohibitive, as well as creating additional ship modifications. The described exemplary designs provide an effective alternative for such emergency cable severing operations.","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is, therefore, to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and various other features and aspects of various exemplary embodiments will be readily understood with reference to the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like or similar numbers are used throughout, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIGS. 8A and 8B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
