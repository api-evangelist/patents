No. 10\/486,406, filed Feb. 6, 2004 and issued as U.S. Pat. No, 8,019,081 on Sep. 13, 2011, which is the National Stage Entry of PCT International Application No. PCT\/CA02\/01225, filed Aug. 6, 2002, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/310,330, filed Aug. 6, 2001. The entirety of U.S. patent application Ser.

Technical Field","The present invention relates generally to the field of communications, and in particular toward processing encoded messages.","2. Description of the State of the Art","In many known secure message exchange schemes, signatures, encryption, or both are commonly used to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of information being transferred from a sender to a recipient. In an e-mail system for example, the sender of an e-mail message could either sign the message, encrypt the message or both sign and encrypt the message. These actions may be performed using such standards as Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S\/MIME), Pretty Good Privacy\u2122 (PGP\u2122), OpenPGP and many other secure e-mail standards.","When an encrypted message is received, it must be decrypted before being displayed or otherwise processed. Decryption is a processor-intensive operation which, on a mobile device with limited processing resources, tends to take a relatively long time, on the order of several seconds. Such time delays may be unacceptable for many mobile device users. Even if the message is not encrypted, it may be encoded in such a way that some processing may be required before displaying the message to the user. Two examples of such an encoding would be the Base-64 encoding commonly used to transfer binary data embedded in email messages on the Internet, and the ASN.1 encoding required by many Internet and security standards. The decoding step may also cause a time delay that is unacceptable for many mobile device users.","Since the content of encrypted messages should generally remain secure even after receipt, such messages are normally saved to long term storage only in encrypted form and decryption operations must be performed each time an encrypted message is opened. Also, when a user asks to verify a signature on a message, the original message contents are typically required to perform the operation, so messages are often stored in their encoded form. Therefore, each time such an encoded message is opened or displayed for example, the decoding operations must be repeated as well.","There is therefore a general need for a faster and less processor-intensive message processing system and method.","A method for processing messages at a message receiver may include the steps of receiving an encoded message, decoding the received message, and storing the decoded message to memory, wherein the stored decoded message is used for subsequent processing of the received message.","As will be appreciated, the invention is capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details are capable of modifications in various respects, all without departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description of the preferred embodiments set forth below are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive.","As used in this description, references to \u201cencoding\u201d should be interpreted to include such operations as signing, encryption, encoding such as Base-64 or ASN.1 encoding, more general encoding by otherwise reversibly transforming data, or any combination thereof. Similarly, \u201cdecoding\u201d should therefore includes any processing operations necessary to invert or reverse any encoding applied to a message.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","20","40","85","90","105","100"]},"An e-mail sender system  may for example be connected to an ISP (Internet Service Provider) on which a user of the system  has an account, located within a company, possibly connected to a local area network (LAN), and connected to the Internet , or connected to the Internet  through a large ASP (application service provider) such as America Online (AOL). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the systems shown in  may instead be connected to a wide area network (WAN) other than the Internet, although e-mail transfers are commonly accomplished through Internet-connected arrangements as shown in .","The message server  may be implemented for example on a network computer within the firewall of a corporation, a computer within an ISP or ASP system or the like, and acts as the main interface for e-mail exchange over the Internet . Although other messaging systems might not require a message server system , a mobile device  configured for receiving and possibly sending e-mail will normally be associated with an account on a message server. Perhaps the two most common message servers are Microsoft Exchange\u2122 and Lotus Domino\u2122. These products are often used in conjunction with Internet mail routers that typically use UNIX-based Sendmail protocols to route and deliver mail. These intermediate components are not shown in , as they do not directly play a role in the secure message processing described below. Message servers such as server  typically extend beyond just e-mail sending and receiving; they also include dynamic database storage engines that have predefined database formats for data like calendars, to-do lists, task lists, e-mail and documentation.","The wireless gateway  and infrastructure  provide a link between the Internet  and wireless network . The wireless infrastructure determines the most likely network for locating a given user and tracks the user as they roam between countries or networks. A message is then delivered to the mobile device via wireless transmission, typically at a radio frequency (RF), from a base station in the wireless network  to the mobile device . The particular network  may be virtually any wireless network over which messages may be exchanged with a mobile device.","As shown in , a composed e-mail message  is sent by the e-mail sender , located somewhere on the Internet . This message  is normally fully in the clear and uses traditional Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), RFC822 headers and Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) body parts to define the format of the mail message. These techniques are all well known to those skilled in the art. The message  arrives to the message server  and is normally stored in a message store. Most known messaging systems support a so-called \u201cpull\u201d message access scheme, wherein a mobile device must request that stored messages be forwarded by the message server to the mobile device. Some systems provide for automatic routing of such messages which are addressed using a specific e-mail address associated with the mobile device. Messages addressed to a message server account associated with a host system such as a home computer or office computer which belongs to the user of a mobile device  are redirected from the message server  to the mobile device  as they are received.","Regardless of the specific mechanism controlling the forwarding of messages to a mobile device , the message , or possibly a translated or reformatted version thereof, is sent to the wireless gateway . The wireless infrastructure  includes a series of connections to wireless network . These connections could be Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), Frame Relay or T1 connections using the TCP\/IP protocol used throughout the Internet. As used herein, the term \u201cwireless network\u201d is intended to include three different types of networks, those being (1) data-centric wireless networks, (2) voice-centric wireless networks and (3) dual-mode networks that can support both voice and data communications over the same physical base stations. The combined dual-mode networks may include, but are not limited to (1) the modern Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) network, (2) the Groupe Special Mobile or the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) network both developed by the standards committee of CEPT, and (3) the future third-generation (3G) networks like Enhanced Data-rates for Global Evolution (EDGE) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS). GPRS is a data overlay on the very popular GSM wireless network, operating in virtually every country in Europe. Some older examples of data-centric network include the Mobitex\u2122 Radio Network, and the DataTAC\u2122 Radio Network. Examples of older voice-centric data networks include Personal Communication Systems (PCS) networks like GSM and TDMA systems that have been available in North America and world-wide for nearly 10 years.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["30","45","65","75","110","100"]},"The central host system  will typically be a corporate office or other LAN, but may instead be a home office computer or some other private system where mail messages are being exchanged. Within the host system  is the message server , running on some computer within the firewall of the host system, that acts as the main interface for the host system to exchange e-mail with the Internet . In the system of , the redirection program  enables redirection of data items from the server  to a mobile device . Although the redirection program  is shown to reside on the same machine as the message server  for ease of presentation, there is no requirement that it must reside on the message server. The redirection program  and the message server  are designed to co-operate and interact to allow the pushing of information to mobile devices . In this installation the redirection program  takes confidential and non-confidential corporate information for a specific user and redirects it out through the corporate firewall to mobile devices . A more detailed description of the redirection software  may be found in the commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,219,694 (\u201cthe '694 patent\u201d), entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Pushing Information From A Host System To A Mobile Data Communication Device Having A Shared Electronic Address\u201d, and issued to the assignee of the instant application on Apr. 17, 2001, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/401,868, Ser. No. 09\/545,963, Ser. No. 09\/528,495, Ser. No. 09\/545,962, and Ser. No. 09\/649,755, all of which are hereby incorporated into the present application by reference. This push technique may use a wireless friendly encoding technique preferably including encryption to deliver all information to a mobile device thus effectively extending the security firewall  to include each mobile device  associated with the host system.","As shown in , there may be many alternative paths for getting information to the mobile device . One method for loading information onto the mobile device  is through a port designated , using a device cradle . This method tends to be useful for bulk information updates often performed at initialization of a mobile device  with the host system or a computer  within the system . The other main method for data exchange is over-the-air using wireless networks to deliver the information. As shown in , this may be accomplished through a wireless VPN router  or through a traditional Internet connection  to a wireless gateway  and a wireless infrastructure , as described above. The concept of a wireless VPN router  is new in the wireless industry and implies that a VPN connection could be established directly through a specific wireless network  to a wireless mobile device . The possibility of using a wireless VPN router  has only recently been available and could be used when the new Internet Protocol (IP) Version 6 (IPV6) arrives into IP-based wireless networks. This new protocol will provide enough IP addresses to dedicate an IP address to every mobile device  and thus make it possible to push information to a mobile device  at any time. A principal advantage of using this wireless VPN router  is that it could be an off-the-shelf VPN component, thus it would not require a separate wireless gateway  and wireless infrastructure  to be used. A VPN connection would preferably a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\/IP or User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\/IP connection to deliver the messages directly to the mobile device . If a wireless VPN  is not available then a link  to the Internet  is the most common connection mechanism available and has been described above.","In the automatic redirection system of , a composed e-mail message  leaving the e-mail sender  arrives to the message server  and is redirected by the redirection program  to the mobile device . As this redirection takes place the message  is re-enveloped, as indicated at , and a possibly proprietary compression and encryption algorithm can then be applied to the original message . In this way, messages being read on the mobile device  are no less secure than if they were read on a desktop workstation such as  within the firewall. All messages exchanged between the redirection program  and the mobile device  preferably use this message repackaging technique. Another goal of this outer envelope is to maintain the addressing information of the original message except the sender's and the receiver's address. This allows reply messages to reach the appropriate destination, and also allows the \u201cfrom\u201d field to reflect the mobile user's desktop address. Using the user's e-mail address from the mobile device  allows the received message to appear as though the message originated from the user's desktop system  rather than the mobile device .","Turning back to the port  and cradle  connectivity to the mobile device , this connection path offers many advantages for enabling one-time data exchange of large items. For those skilled in the art of personal digital assistants (PDAs) and synchronization, the most common data exchanged over this link is Personal Information Management (PIM) data . When exchanged for the first time this data tends to be large in quantity, bulky in nature and requires a large bandwidth to get loaded onto the mobile device  where it can be used on the road. This serial link may also be used for other purposes, including setting up a private security key  such as an S\/MIME or PGP specific private key, the Certificate (Cert) of the user and their Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) . The private key is preferably exchanged so that the desktop  and mobile device  share one personality and one method for accessing all mail. The Cert and CRLs are normally exchanged because they represent the largest part of S\/MIME, PGP and other public key security methods. A certificate chain is a Cert along with a number of other Certs required to verify that the original Cert is authentic. The receiver of the message is able to verify that each Cert in the chain was signed by the next Cert in the chain, until a Cert is found that was signed by a root Cert from a trusted source, perhaps from a large Public Key Server (PKS) associated with a Certificate Authority (CA) such as Verisign or Entrust for example, both prominent companies in the area of public key cryptography. Once such a root Cert is found a signature can be verified and trusted, since both the sender and receiver trust the source of the root Cert.","Although the encoded message processing systems and methods described herein are in no way dependent upon pre-loading of information from a host computer or a computer  in a host system  through a port arrangement, such pre-loading of typically bulky information such as Certs and CRLs may facilitate transmission of encoded messages, particularly those that have been encrypted and\/or signed or require additional information for processing, to mobile devices . If an alternate mechanism for transferring such messages, like S\/MIME or PGP e-mail messages for example, to a mobile device is available, then these messages may be processed as described herein.","Having described several typical communication network arrangements, the transfer and processing of secure e-mail messages will now be described in further detail.","E-mail messages generated using the S\/MIME and PGP techniques may include encrypted information, and\/or a digital signature on the message contents. In signed S\/MIME operations, the sender takes a digest of a message and signs the digest using the sender's private key. A digest is essentially a checksum, CRC or other preferably non-reversible operation such as a hash on the message, which is then signed. The signed digest, the Cert of the sender, and any chained Certs and CRLs are all appended to the outgoing message. The receiver of this signed message must also take a digest of the message, then retrieve the sender's public key, verify the Cert and CRLs and decrypt the signed digest. Finally the two digests are compared to see if they match. If the message content has been changed, then the digests will be different. If the message is not encrypted, this signature does not prevent anyone from seeing the contents of the message, but does ensure the message has not been tampered with and is from the actual person as indicated on the \u2018From\u2019 field of the message.","In encrypted S\/MIME message operations, a one-time session key is generated and used for each message, and is never re-used for other messages. The session key is then further encrypted using the receiver's public key. If the message is addressed to more than one receiver, the same session key is encrypted using the public key of each receiver. Only when all receivers have an encoded session key is the message then sent to each receiver. Since the e-mail retains only one form, all encrypted session keys must be sent to every receiver, even though they cannot use these other session keys. Each receiver must then locate its own session key, possibly based on a generated Recipient Info summary of the receivers that may be attached to the message, and decrypt the session key using its private key. Once the session key is decrypted it is then used to decrypt the message body. The S\/MIME Recipient Info attachment can also specify a particular encryption scheme that must be used to decrypt the message. This information is normally placed in the header of the S\/MIME message.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that these operations relate to an illustrative example of S\/MIME messaging and its associated encoding operations, namely encryption and\/or signing. However, the operations are in no way restricted thereto. Encryption and signing are merely two examples of the type of encoding operations to which the systems and methods described herein may be applied.","Referring now to , encoded message transfer will be described in further detail.  illustrates an example system for transferring messages that were encoded by encryption and possibly signing using S\/MIME or similar techniques.","In , User X at system  creates a mail message  and decides to encrypt and sign the message. To achieve this, the system  first creates a session key and encrypts the message. Then the public key for each recipient is retrieved from either local storage or a Public Key Server (PKS) (not shown) on the Internet  for example if public key cryptography is used. Other crypto schemes may instead be used, although public key cryptography tends to be common, particularly when a system includes a large number of possible correspondents. In a system such as shown in , there may be millions of e-mail systems such as  that may from time to time wish to exchange messages with any other e-mail systems. Public key cryptography provides for efficient key distribution among such large numbers of correspondents. For each recipient, the session key is encrypted, as shown at A, B and C for three intended recipients, and attached to the message preferably along with the RecipientInfo section. Once the encryption is complete, a digest of the new message, including the encrypted session keys, is taken and this digest is signed using the sender's private key. In the case where the message is signed first a digest of the message would be taken without the encrypted session keys. This digest, along with all the signed components, would be encrypted using a session key and each session key would be further encrypted using each recipient's public key if public key crypto is used, or another key associated with each recipient if the sender is able to securely exchange e-mail with one or more recipients through some alternate crypto arrangement.","The encrypted and signed message , with the session keys  and digital signature and signature-related information  is sent to the message server  running on a computer system. As described above, the message server  may process the message and place it into the appropriate user's mailbox. Depending upon the mobile device e-mail access scheme, a mobile device  may request the e-mail from the message server , or redirection software  (see ) may detect the new message and begin the redirection process to forward the new e-mail message to each recipient that has a mobile device . Alternatively, the e-mail message and attachments may possibly be sent directly to a mobile device  instead of or in addition to a message server system. Any of the transfer mechanisms described above, including over the Internet  through a wireless gateway and infrastructure \/ and one or more wireless networks  or through the Internet  and wireless network  using a wireless VPN router  () may be used to forward the e-mail message and attachments to a mobile device . Other transfer mechanisms that are currently known or may become available in the future, may also be used to send the message and attachments to a mobile device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","100","100","100"]},"If the message is not signed, such that X's signature and other signature-related information including X's CRLs, X's Cert and other chained Certs would not be part of the message, or the message was signed before it was encrypted, then when a user of a mobile device  opens the message, the appropriate encrypted session key is found and decrypted. However, if the message was signed after being encrypted then the signature is preferably first verified and the correct session key is then found and decrypted. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, session key decryption commonly involves the further security operation of entering a password or passphrase preferably known only to the user of a mobile device.","As described earlier, before a message can be displayed to the user, it must first be decoded (possibly including a decrypting the message), and any decoding steps may require a long time to complete. The decoding steps can be performed earlier and the resultant decoded message can be stored in a memory. The decoded message may then be retrieved quickly when the decoded message is required for display or further processing.","For example, consider first a message that is encoded by being signed but not encrypted. The contents of the message are not secret in this case, but they have nonetheless been encoded in some way. When the message is decoded, in this example by verifying the signature, it is stored in a temporary storage area such as in a random access memory (RAM) on a mobile device . The next time the message must be decoded, to be displayed or further processed for example, the stored decoded message is instead retrieved from memory. Note that the original encoded message may be retained so that signature verification may still be performed using the original encoding if necessary.","As another example, consider an encoded message that is encrypted (and possibly signed). When the message is decrypted, it can also be stored in a temporary storage area such as in RAM on a mobile device . The next time the message must be decrypted, the stored decrypted message is retrieved from memory. When both a session key and message content must be decrypted, as for an encrypted S\/MIME message, retrieval of the decrypted message from memory may be substantially faster than the decryption operations. However, unlike a message that is not encrypted, the contents of the decrypted message are secret and for security reasons should not be stored in RAM for long periods of time, in case an attacker were to gain control of the mobile device. Therefore, as a possible option, the message could be stored for only a short period of time, after which it would automatically be removed from RAM. The length of this short period of time could be configured, for example, by the user or by a system administrator; some such configurations are described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":"a ","b":["350","352","354","356","358","360","350"]},"Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the header portion typically includes addressing information such as \u201cTo\u201d, \u201cFrom\u201d and \u201cCC\u201d addresses, as well as possibly message length, indicators, sender encryption and signature scheme identifiers when necessary, and the like. Actual message content will normally include a message body or data portion  and possibly one or more file attachments , which may be encrypted by the sender using a session key. If a session key was used, it is typically encrypted for each intended recipient and included in the message as shown at . Depending upon the particular message transport mechanism used to send the message to a receiver such as a mobile device , the message may include only the specific encrypted session key for that recipient or all session keys. If the message is signed, a signature and related information  are included. Where the message is signed before encryption, according to a variant of S\/MIME for example, the signature may also be encrypted.","As described in further detail below, if the encoded message is unencrypted, a receiver decodes the message body, stores the decoded message content so that it may be subsequently viewed and\/or processed without repeating the decoding operations. If the message is encrypted, the decoding process may proceed as follows: the receiver locates and decrypts a corresponding encrypted session key, possibly after verifying a signature, uses the decrypted session key to decrypt any encrypted message content, and then if necessary further decodes the message body, for example where the message body has been base-64 encoded. The resultant decoded message content may also be stored by the receiver, possibly for only a short time for security reasons, and may be subsequently viewed and\/or processed without repeating the decoding operations. It is noted that at least the message body portion  may be decoded and stored to memory, although it may also be feasible and advantageous to also store decoded message attachments where desired. It should therefore be understood that references in this description to stored decoded messages and decoded content may include decoded versions of the message body , attachment(s)  or both.","The format shown in is for illustrative purposes only and it is to be understood that the encoded messages may have other formats. For example, as described above, the processing systems and techniques described herein are applicable to signed or unsigned, encrypted or unencrypted, and otherwise encoded messages, such that a received message may not necessarily include the portions related to encryption and\/or signing. In addition, the particular message components may appear in a different order than shown in . Depending upon the message scheme used, a message may include fewer, additional, or different message sections or components.","The temporary storage area in which the decoded message is stored is preferably in a volatile and non-persistent store. The decoded message may for example be stored for only a particular period of time, which may preferably be set by a user. A single message storage time period may be set and applied to all messages, although more customized settings are also contemplated. Particularly sensitive messages that normally arrive from certain senders or from senders whose e-mail addresses have the same domain name for example, may have a specific relatively short decoded message storage period, whereas decoded versions of encoded e-mails received from other senders, perhaps personal contacts, may be stored for a longer period of time. Alternatively, a user may be prompted for a storage time period each time a message is opened or closed. The decoded message storage feature might also be disabled for certain messages or messages received from certain senders. Message storage operations may possibly be automatically controlled by detection of specific predetermined keywords in a message. For example, the text \u201cTop Secret\u201d in an e-mail subject line may be detected by the mobile device when the e-mail is decoded and prevent the decoded message from being stored or delete the decoded message from storage if it had already been stored.","The particular criteria controlling decoded message storage will preferably be determined in accordance with the desired level of security of encoded messages at a mobile device. Storage of decoded message content represents a trade-off between usability and security. Longer decoded message storage intervals improve usability at the cost of decreased security, since the decoded content of an encoded message may be viewed or processed for a longer period of time after the encoded message is first decoded without having to decode the message again. A shorter message storage interval reduces the amount of time that decoded message contents remain accessible to an unauthorized user of a mobile device. When the decoded message is removed from storage, an unauthorized user would preferably be required to first correctly enter the device user's password or passphrase in order to decode and view encoded message content, particularly where the encoded message includes encrypted content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["402","404","406","410","408","418"]},"If the message was not signed, the signature is verified, or processing should continue after a failed signature verification attempt, the mobile device determines in step  whether the message was encrypted. If the message was encrypted, the receiving mobile device locates its corresponding session key in the message (at step ) if session keys were used in encrypting the message. However, if the session key could not be found or the key required to decrypt the session key is not available (at step ), for example if the user does not input a correct password or passphrase, then the mobile device cannot decrypt the session key or the message (at step ) and an error is preferably returned to the user (at step ). When a session key is found and the required decryption key is available (i.e. a correct password or passphrase is entered) on the mobile device, the session key is then decrypted (at step ) and used to decrypt the message, at step .","In step , the contents of the message, having already been decrypted if required, are further decoded if necessary according to the particular encoding used to send the message. The decoded message is then preferably stored to a non-persistent store at step . Any determinations relating to whether or not the decoded message should be stored or for how long the decoded message should be stored would be performed as part of step .

As described above, the message is preferably stored in a non-persistent store and for a certain time period. Thus, if the time period has expired, the mobile device has lost power or been turned off since the message was stored, or the message was not stored at all, then processing reverts (at step ) to initial message processing at step  (). Since the message is not in memory, it must be decoded again in order to be viewed or processed. If the decoded message is found in storage, message decoding operations are avoided and the message can thereby be displayed or processed much more quickly than in known message processing schemes. The mobile device need only retrieve the stored message and display or process it (at step ).","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that an encoded message processing method need not necessarily include all of the steps shown in  or may include further steps and operations in addition thereto. The operations may also be performed in a different order. For example, a message that was both signed and encrypted may have been signed and then encrypted, or encrypted and then signed. Depending on the order in which such operations were applied when the message was sent, the order in which the verification and decryption steps are applied may also need to change when the message is received. Other variations of the methods described above will be apparent to those skilled in the art and as such are considered to be within the scope of the invention.","As further examples of the wide variations of the systems and methods described herein,  illustrate encoded messages being handled by a mobile device.  depicts an example wherein a wireless connector system  transmits a message  from a sender  that is addressed to one or more message receivers. In this example, the sender's encoded message  is an encrypted message that includes encrypted content and further includes encryption accessing information (e.g., a session key or other equivalent technique) which allows the decryption of the encrypted content. The encoded message  also may be signed or unsigned.","The wireless connector system  may use a host system  in its transmission of the message  to a mobile device . The wireless connector system  may perform authentication and\/or encryption message processing upon the sender's message , or the wireless connector system may be of the type that does not perform any authentication and\/or encryption message processing.","The encoded message  is then transmitted to the mobile device . The mobile device  decodes the message  and uses a storage software module  to store the decoded message content portion  in memory  which is volatile and non-persistent. The memory  may include a message access data structure  to store the decoded message content portion  as well as access information (e.g., signature verification information) in the memory .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["620","620","710","720","700","614","702","710","618","710"]},"The system and method may also store message accessing information (, ), such as digital signature verification information or a session key, in the message access data structure . For example, the accessing software module  retrieves the first message's digital signature verification information  if the information is needed to verify a digital signature of the first message. Associations (, ) may be formed in the message access data structure  to indicate which decoded messages are associated with which message accessing information. In this way, the accessing software module  may recognize which data is associated with which messages. It should be understood that other types of accessing information may be stored and associated with decoded messages, such as the expiration time before a decoded message is removed from memory .","Still further examples of the wide scope of the systems and methods disclosed herein are illustrated in .  describe additional uses of the systems and methods within different exemplary communication systems.  is a block diagram showing an example communication system. In , there is shown a computer system , a WAN , corporate LAN  behind a security firewall , wireless infrastructure , wireless networks  and , and mobile devices  and . The corporate LAN  includes a message server , a wireless connector system , a data store  including at least a plurality of mailboxes , a desktop computer system  having a communication link directly to a mobile device such as through physical connection  to an interface or connector , and a wireless VPN router . Operation of the system in  will be described below with reference to the messages ,  and .","The computer system  may, for example, be a laptop, desktop or palmtop computer system configured for connection to the WAN . Such a computer system may connect to the WAN  via an ISP or ASP. Alternatively, the computer system  may be a network-connected computer system that, like the computer system  for example, accesses the WAN  through a LAN or other network. Many modern mobile devices are enabled for connection to a WAN through various infrastructure and gateway arrangements, so that the computer system  may also be a mobile device.","The corporate LAN  is an illustrative example of a central, server-based messaging system that has been enabled for wireless communications. The corporate LAN  may be referred to as a \u201chost system\u201d, in that it hosts both a data store  with mailboxes  for messages, as well as possibly further data stores (not shown) for other data items, that may be sent to or received from mobile devices  and , and the wireless connector system , the wireless VPN router , or possibly other components enabling communications between the corporate LAN  and one or more mobile devices  and . In more general terms, a host system may be one or more computers at, with or in association with which a wireless connector system is operating. The corporate LAN  is one preferred embodiment of a host system, in which the host system is a server computer running within a corporate network environment operating behind and protected by at least one security communications firewall . Other possible central host systems include ISP, ASP and other service provider or mail systems. Although the desktop computer system  and interface\/connector  may be located outside such host systems, wireless communication operations may be similar to those described below.","The corporate LAN  implements the wireless connector system  as an associated wireless communications enabling component, which will normally be a software program, a software application, or a software component built to work with at least one or more message server. The wireless connector system  is used to send user-selected information to, and to receive information from, one or more mobile devices  and , via one or more wireless networks  and . The wireless connector system  may be a separate component of a messaging system, as shown in , or may instead be partially or entirely incorporated into other communication system components. For example, the message server  may incorporate a software program, application, or component implementing the wireless connector system , portions thereof, or some or all of its functionality.","The message server , running on a computer behind the firewall , acts as the main interface for the corporation to exchange messages, including for example electronic mail, calendaring data, voice mail, electronic documents, and other PIM data with the WAN , which will typically be the Internet. The particular intermediate operations and computers will be dependent upon the specific type of message delivery mechanisms and networks via which messages are exchanged, and therefore have not been shown in . The functionality of the message server  may extend beyond message sending and receiving, providing such features as dynamic database storage for data like calendars, todo lists, task lists, e-mail and documentation, as described above.","Message servers such as  normally maintain a plurality of mailboxes  in one or more data stores such as  for each user having an account on the server. The data store  includes mailboxes  for a number of (\u201cn\u201d) user accounts. Messages received by the message server  that identify a user, a user account, a mailbox, or possibly another address associated with a user, account or mailbox  as a message recipient will typically be stored in the corresponding mailbox . If a message is addressed to multiple recipients or a distribution list, then copies of the same message may be stored to more than one mailbox . Alternatively, the message server  may store a single copy of such a message in a data store accessible to all of the users having an account on the message server, and store a pointer or other identifier in each recipient's mailbox . In typical messaging systems, each user may then access his or her mailbox  and its contents using a messaging client such as Microsoft Outlook or Lotus Notes, which normally operates on a PC, such as the desktop computer system , connected in the LAN . Although only one desktop computer system  is shown in , those skilled in the art will appreciate that a LAN will typically contain many desktop, notebook and laptop computer systems. Each messaging client normally accesses a mailbox  through the message server , although in some systems, a messaging client may enable direct access to the data store  and a mailbox  stored thereon by the desktop computer system . Messages may also be downloaded from the data store  to a local data store (not shown) on the desktop computer system .","Within the corporate LAN , the wireless connector system  operates in conjunction with the message server . The wireless connector system  may reside on the same computer system as the message server , or may instead be implemented on a different computer system. Software implementing the wireless connector system  may also be partially or entirely integrated with the message server . The wireless connector system  and the message server  are preferably designed to cooperate and interact to allow the pushing of information to mobile devices , . In such an installation, the wireless connector system  is preferably configured to send information that is stored in one or more data stores associated with the corporate LAN  to one or more mobile devices , , through the corporate firewall  and via the WAN  and one of the wireless networks , . For example, a user that has an account and associated mailbox  in the data store  may also have a mobile device, such as . As described above, messages received by the message server  that identify a user, account or mailbox  are stored to a corresponding mailbox  by the message server . If a user has a mobile device, such as , messages received by the message server  and stored to the user's mailbox  are preferably detected by the wireless connector system  and sent to the user's mobile device . This type of functionality represents a \u201cpush\u201d message sending technique. The wireless connector system  may instead employ a \u201cpull\u201d technique, in which items stored in a mailbox  are sent to a mobile device ,  responsive to a request or access operation made using the mobile device, or some combination of both techniques.","The use of a wireless connector  thereby enables a messaging system including a message server  to be extended so that each user's mobile device ,  has access to stored messages of the message server . Although the systems and methods described herein are not restricted solely to a push-based technique, a more detailed description of push-based messaging may be found in the United States patent and applications incorporated by reference above. This push technique uses a wireless friendly encoding, compression and encryption technique to deliver all information to a mobile device, thus effectively extending the company firewall  to include the mobile devices , .","As shown in , there are several paths for exchanging information with a mobile device ,  from the corporate LAN . One possible information transfer path is through the physical connection  such as a serial port, using an interface or connector . This path may be useful for example for bulk information updates often performed at initialization of a mobile device ,  or periodically when a user of a mobile device ,  is working at a computer system in the LAN , such as the computer system . For example, as described above, PIM data is commonly exchanged over such a connection, for example a serial port connected to an appropriate interface or connector  such as a cradle in or upon which a mobile device ,  may be placed. The physical connection  may also be used to transfer other information from a desktop computer system  to a mobile device , , including private security keys (\u201cprivate keys\u201d) such as private encryption or signature keys associated with the desktop computer system , or other relatively bulky information such as Certs and CRLs, used in some secure messaging schemes such as S\/MIME and PGP.","Private key exchange using a physical connection  and connector or interface  allows a user's desktop computer system  and mobile device  or  to share at least one identity for accessing all encrypted and\/or signed mail. The user's desktop computer system  and mobile device  or  can also thereby share private keys so that either the host system  or mobile device  or  can process secure messages addressed to the user's mailbox or account on the message server . The transfer of Certs and CRLs over such a physical connection may be desirable in that they represent a large amount of the data that is required for S\/MIME, PGP and other public key security methods. A user's own Cert, a chain of Cert(s) used to verify the user's Cert, and CRL, as well as Certs, Cert chains and CRLs for other users, may be loaded onto a mobile device ,  from the user's desktop computer system . This loading of other user's Certs and CRLs onto a mobile device ,  allows a mobile device user to select other entities or users with whom they might be exchanging secure messages, and to pre-load the bulky information onto the mobile device through a physical connection instead of over the air, thus saving time and wireless bandwidth when a secure message is received from or to be sent to such other users, or when the status of a Cert is to be determined.","In known \u201csynchronization\u201d type wireless messaging systems, a physical path has also been used to transfer messages from mailboxes  associated with a message server  to mobile devices  and .","Another method for data exchange with a mobile device ,  is over-the-air, through the wireless connector system  and using wireless networks , . As shown in , this could involve a Wireless VPN router , if available in the network , or, alternatively, a traditional WAN connection to wireless infrastructure  that provides an interface to one or more wireless networks , . The Wireless VPN router  provides for creation of a VPN connection directly through a specific wireless network  to a wireless device . Such a Wireless VPN router  may be used in conjunction with a static addressing scheme. For example, if the wireless network  is an IP-based wireless network, then IPV6 would provide enough IP addresses to dedicate an IP address to every mobile device  configured to operate within the network  and thus make it possible to push information to a mobile device  at any time. A primary advantage of using a wireless VPN router  is that it could be an off-the-shelf VPN component which would not require wireless infrastructure . A VPN connection may use a TCP\/IP or UDP\/IP connection to deliver messages directly to and from a mobile device .","If a wireless VPN router  is not available, then a link to a WAN , normally the Internet, is a commonly used connection mechanism that may be employed by the wireless connector system . To handle the addressing of the mobile device  and any other required interface functions, wireless infrastructure  is preferably used. The wireless infrastructure  may also determine a most likely wireless network for locating a given user, and track users as they roam between countries or networks. In wireless networks such as  and , messages are normally delivered to and from mobile devices ,  via RF transmissions between base stations (not shown) and the mobile devices , .","A plurality of connections to wireless networks  and  may be provided, including, for example, ISDN, Frame Relay or T1 connections using the TCP\/IP protocol used throughout the Internet. The wireless networks  and  could represent distinct, unique and unrelated networks, or they could represent the same network in different countries, and may be any of different types of networks, including but not limited to, data-centric wireless networks, voice-centric wireless networks, and dual-mode networks that can support both voice and data communications over the same or similar infrastructure, such as any of those described above.","In some implementations, more than one over-the-air information exchange mechanism may be provided in the corporate LAN . In the exemplary communication system of  for example, mobile devices ,  associated with users having mailboxes  associated with user accounts on the message server  are configured to operate on different wireless networks  and . If the wireless network  supports IPv6 addressing, then the wireless VPN router  may be used by the wireless connector system  to exchange data with any mobile device  operating within the wireless network . The wireless network  may be a different type of wireless network, however, such as the Mobitex network, in which case information may instead be exchanged with a mobile device  operating within the wireless network  by the wireless connector system  via a connection to the WAN  and the wireless infrastructure .","Operation of the system in  will now be described using an example of an e-mail message  sent from the computer system  and addressed to at least one recipient having both an account and mailbox  or like data store associated with the message server  and a mobile device  or . However, the e-mail message  is intended for illustrative purposes only. The exchange of other types of information between the corporate LAN  is preferably also enabled by the wireless connector system .","The e-mail message , sent from the computer system  via the WAN , may be fully in the clear, or signed with a digital signature and\/or encrypted, depending upon the particular messaging scheme used. For example, if the computer system  is enabled for secure messaging using S\/MIME, then the e-mail message  may be signed, encrypted, or both.","E-mail messages such as  normally use traditional SMTP, RFC822 headers and MIME body parts to define the format of the e-mail message. These techniques are all well known to one in the art. The e-mail message  arrives at the message server , which determines into which mailboxes  the e-mail message  should be stored. As described above, a message such as the e-mail message  may include a user name, a user account, a mailbox identifier, or other type of identifier that may be mapped to a particular account or associated mailbox  by the message server . For an e-mail message , recipients are typically identified using e-mail addresses corresponding to a user account and thus a mailbox .","The wireless connector system  sends or mirrors, via a wireless network  or , certain user-selected data items or parts of data items from the corporate LAN  to the user's mobile device  or , preferably upon detecting that one or more triggering events has occurred. A triggering event includes, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: screen saver activation at a user's networked computer system , disconnection of the user's mobile device  or  from the interface , or receipt of a command sent from a mobile device  or  to the host system to start sending one or more messages stored at the host system. Thus, the wireless connector system  may detect triggering events associated with the message server , such as receipt of a command, or with one or more networked computer systems , including the screen saver and disconnection events described above. When wireless access to corporate data for a mobile device  or  has been activated at the LAN , for example when the wireless connector system  detects the occurrence of a triggering event for a mobile device user, data items selected by the user are preferably sent to the user's mobile device. In the example of the e-mail message , assuming that a triggering event has been detected, the arrival of the message  at the message server  is detected by the wireless connector system . This may be accomplished, for example, by monitoring or querying mailboxes  associated with the message server , or, if the message server  is a Microsoft Exchange server, then the wireless connector system  may register for advise syncs provided by the Microsoft Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) to thereby receive notifications when a new message is stored to a mailbox .","When a data item such as the e-mail message  is to be sent to a mobile device  or , the wireless connector system  preferably repackages the data item in a manner that is transparent to the mobile device, so that information sent to and received by the mobile device appears similar to the information as stored on and accessible at the host system, LAN  in . One preferred repackaging method includes wrapping received messages to be sent via a wireless network ,  in an electronic envelope that corresponds to the wireless network address of the mobile device ,  to which the message is to be sent. Alternatively, other repackaging methods could be used, such as special-purpose TCP\/IP wrapping techniques. Such repackaging preferably also results in e-mail messages sent from a mobile device  or  appearing to come from a corresponding host system account or mailbox  even though they are composed and sent from a mobile device. A user of a mobile device  or  may thereby effectively share a single e-mail address between a host system account or mailbox  and the mobile device.","Repackaging of the e-mail message  is indicated at  and . Repackaging techniques may be similar for any available transfer paths or may be dependent upon the particular transfer path, either the wireless infrastructure  or the wireless VPN router . For example, the e-mail message  is preferably compressed and encrypted, either before or after being repackaged at , to thereby effectively provide for secure transfer to the mobile device . Compression reduces the bandwidth required to send the message, whereas encryption ensures confidentiality of any messages or other information sent to mobile devices  and . In contrast, messages transferred via a VPN router  might only be compressed and not encrypted, since a VPN connection established by the VPN router  is inherently secure. Messages are thereby securely sent, via either encryption at the wireless connector system , which may be considered a non-standard VPN tunnel or a VPN-like connection for example, or the VPN router , to mobile devices  and . Accessing messages using a mobile device  or  is thus no less secure than accessing mailboxes at the LAN  using the desktop computer system .","When a repackaged message  or  arrives at a mobile device  or , via the wireless infrastructure , or via the wireless VPN router , the mobile device  or  removes the outer electronic envelope from the repackaged message  or , and performs any required decompression and decryption operations. Messages sent from a mobile device  or  and addressed to one or more recipients are preferably similarly repackaged, and possibly compressed and encrypted, and sent to a host system such as the LAN . The host system may then remove the electronic envelope from the repackaged message, decrypt and decompress the message if desired, and route the message to the addressed recipients.","Another goal of using an outer envelope is to maintain at least some of the addressing information in the original e-mail message . Although the outer envelope used to route information to mobile devices ,  is addressed using a network address of one or more mobile devices, the outer envelope preferably encapsulates the entire original e-mail message , including at least one address field, possibly in compressed and\/or encrypted form. This allows original \u201cTo\u201d, \u201cFrom\u201d and \u201cCC\u201d addresses of the e-mail message  to be displayed when the outer envelope is removed and the message is displayed on a mobile device  or . The repackaging also allows reply messages to be delivered to addressed recipients, with the \u201cFrom\u201d field reflecting an address of the mobile device user's account or mailbox on the host system, when the outer envelope of a repackaged outgoing message sent from a mobile device is removed by the wireless connector system . Using the user's account or mailbox address from the mobile device  or  allows a message sent from a mobile device to appear as though the message originated from the user's mailbox  or account at the host system rather than the mobile device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 8","FIG. 9"],"b":["802","804","807","808","840","811","813","815","802","804","808","820","817","819","835","835","840","840","807","813","815","842","852","811","807","842","852","846","856","848","858","844","854","842","852"]},"The wireless connector systems ,  are similar to the wireless connector system  described above, in that it enables data items, such as e-mail messages and other items that are stored in mailboxes , and possibly data items stored in a local or network data store, to be sent from the LAN  to one or more mobile devices , . In  however, the network operator infrastructure  provides an interface between the mobile devices ,  and the LAN . As above, operation of the system shown in  will be described below in the context of an e-mail message as an illustrative example of a data item that may be sent to a mobile device , .","When an e-mail message , addressed to one or more recipients having an account on the message server , is received by the message server , the message, or possibly a pointer to a single copy of the message stored in a central mailbox or data store, is stored into the mailbox  of each such recipient. Once the e-mail message  or pointer has been stored to a mailbox , it may preferably be accessed using a mobile device  or . In the example shown in , the e-mail message  has been addressed to the mailboxes  associated with both desktop computer systems  and  and thus both mobile devices  and .","As those skilled in the art will appreciate, communication network protocols commonly used in wired networks such as the LAN  and\/or the WAN  are not suitable or compatible with wireless network communication protocols used within wireless networks such as . For example, communication bandwidth, protocol overhead and network latency, which are primary concerns in wireless network communications, are less significant in wired networks, which typically have much higher capacity and speed than wireless networks. Therefore, mobile devices  and  cannot normally access the data store  directly. The network operator infrastructure  provides a bridge between the wireless network  and the LAN .","The network operator infrastructure  enables a mobile device ,  to establish a connection to the LAN  through the WAN , and may, for example, be operated by an operator of the wireless network  or a service provider that provides wireless communication service for mobile devices  and . In a pull-based system, a mobile device ,  may establish a communication session with the network operator infrastructure  using a wireless network compatible communication scheme, preferably a secure scheme such as Wireless Transport Layer Security (WTLS) when information should remain confidential, and a wireless web browser such as a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) browser. A user may then request (through manual selection or pre-selected defaults in the software residing in the mobile device) any or all information, or just new information for example, stored in a mailbox  in the data store  at the LAN . The network operator infrastructure  then establishes a connection or session with a wireless connector system , , using Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) for example, if no session has already been established. As above, a session between the network operator infrastructure  and a wireless connector system ,  may be made via a typical WAN connection or through the VPN router  if available. When time delays between receiving a request from a mobile device ,  and delivering requested information back to the device are to be minimized, the network operator infrastructure  and the wireless connector systems ,  may be configured so that a communication connection remains open once established.","In the system of , requests originating from mobile device A  and B  would be sent to the wireless connector systems  and , respectively.

Signals received by the antenna  from the communication network  are routed to the receiver , which provides for signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., and may also provide analog to digital conversion. Analog to digital conversion of the received signal allows more complex communication functions, such as digital demodulation and decoding to be performed using the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted to the network  are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP  and are then provided to the transmitter  for digital to analog conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification and transmission to the communication network  via the antenna .","In addition to processing the communication signals, the DSP  also provides for transceiver control. For example, the gain levels applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP . Other transceiver control algorithms could also be implemented in the DSP  in order to provide more sophisticated control of the transceiver .","The microprocessor  preferably manages and controls the overall operation of the mobile device . Many types of microprocessors or microcontrollers could be used here, or, alternatively, a single DSP  could be used to carry out the functions of the microprocessor . Low-level communication functions, including at least data and voice communications, are performed through the DSP  in the transceiver . Other, high-level communication applications, such as a voice communication application A, and a data communication application B may be stored in the flash memory  for execution by the microprocessor . For example, the voice communication module A may provide a high-level user interface operable to transmit and receive voice calls between the mobile device  and a plurality of other voice or dual-mode devices via the network . Similarly, the data communication module B may provide a high-level user interface operable for sending and receiving data, such as e-mail messages, files, organizer information, short text messages, etc., between the mobile device  and a plurality of other data devices via the networks .","The microprocessor  also interacts with other device subsystems, such as the display , flash memory , RAM , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , serial port , keyboard , speaker , microphone , a short-range communications subsystem  and any other device subsystems generally designated as .","Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions. Notably, some subsystems, such as keyboard  and display  may be used for both communication-related functions, such as entering a text message for transmission over a data communication network, and device-resident functions such as a calculator or task list or other PDA type functions.","Operating system software used by the microprocessor  is preferably stored in a persistent store such as flash memory . In addition to the operating system, which controls low-level functions of the mobile device , the flash memory  may include a plurality of high-level software application programs, or modules, such as a voice communication module A, a data communication module B, an organizer module (not shown), or any other type of software module N. These modules are executed by the microprocessor  and provide a high-level interface between a user and the mobile device . This interface typically includes a graphical component provided through the display , and an input\/output component provided through the auxiliary I\/O , keyboard , speaker , and microphone . The operating system, specific device applications or modules, or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store, such as RAM  for faster operation. Moreover, received communication signals may also be temporarily stored to RAM , before permanently writing them to a file system located in a persistent store such as the flash memory .","An exemplary application module N that may be loaded onto the mobile device  is a personal information manager (PIM) application providing PDA functionality, such as calendar events, appointments, and task items. This module N may also interact with the voice communication module A for managing phone calls, voice mails, etc., and may also interact with the data communication module for managing e-mail communications and other data transmissions. Alternatively, all of the functionality of the voice communication module A and the data communication module B may be integrated into the PIM module.","The flash memory  preferably also provides a file system to facilitate storage of PIM data items on the device. The PIM application preferably includes the ability to send and receive data items, either by itself, or in conjunction with the voice and data communication modules A, B, via the wireless networks . The PIM data items are preferably seamlessly integrated, synchronized and updated, via the wireless networks , with a corresponding set of data items stored or associated with a host computer system, thereby creating a mirrored system for data items associated with a particular user.","Decrypted session keys or other encryption accessing information is preferably stored on the mobile device  in a volatile and non-persistent store such as the RAM . Such information may instead be stored in the flash memory , for example, when storage intervals are relatively short, such that the information is removed from memory soon after it is stored. However, storage of this information in the RAM  or another volatile and non-persistent store is preferred, in order to ensure that the information is erased from memory when the mobile device  loses power. This prevents an unauthorized party from obtaining any stored encryption accessing information such as a decrypted session key by removing a memory chip from the mobile device , for example.","The mobile device  may be manually synchronized with a host system by placing the device  in an interface cradle, which couples the serial port  of the mobile device  to the serial port of a computer system or device. The serial port  may also be used to enable a user to set preferences through an external device or software application, or to download other application modules N for installation. This wired download path may be used to load an encryption key onto the device, which is a more secure method than exchanging encryption information via the wireless network . Interfaces for other wired download paths may be provided in the mobile device , in addition to or instead of the serial port . For example, a USB port would provide an interface to a similarly equipped personal computer.","Additional application modules N may be loaded onto the mobile device  through the networks , through an auxiliary I\/O subsystem , through the serial port , through the short-range communications subsystem , or through any other suitable subsystem , and installed by a user in the flash memory  or RAM . Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device .","When the mobile device  is operating in a data communication mode, a received signal, such as a text message or a web page download, will be processed by the transceiver module  and provided to the microprocessor , which will preferably further process the received signal for output to the display , or, alternatively, to an auxiliary I\/O device . A user of mobile device  may also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, using the keyboard , which is preferably a complete alphanumeric keyboard laid out in the QWERTY style, although other styles of complete alphanumeric keyboards such as the known DVORAK style may also be used. User input to the mobile device  is further enhanced with a plurality of auxiliary I\/O devices , which may include a thumbwheel input device, a touchpad, a variety of switches, a rocker input switch, etc. The composed data items input by the user may then be transmitted over the communication networks  via the transceiver module .","When the mobile device  is operating in a voice communication mode, the overall operation of the mobile device is substantially similar to the data mode, except that received signals are preferably be output to the speaker  and voice signals for transmission are generated by a microphone . Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the mobile device . Although voice or audio signal output is preferably accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, the duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information. For example, the microprocessor , in conjunction with the voice communication module and the operating system software, may detect the caller identification information of an incoming voice call and display it on the display .","A short-range communications subsystem  may also be included in the mobile device . For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a short-range RF communication module such as a Bluetooth\u2122 module or an 802.11 module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that \u201cBluetooth\u201d and \u201c802.11\u201d refer to sets of specifications, available from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, relating to wireless personal area networks and wireless local area networks, respectively.","Having described in detail an encoded message processing system and method, it is to be understood that this operation could be carried out with different elements and steps. The above description is presented only by way of example and is not meant to limit the scope of the invention which is defined by claims.","For example, although described primarily in the context of a mobile device, the encoded message processing systems and methods described above may reduce processor load and time delays associated with viewing or otherwise accessing encoded messages for which respective messages have been previously decoded. Message decoding operations tend to involve much smaller time delays on desktop computer systems which typically have faster and much more powerful processors than smaller hand-held and portable devices. The power consumption associated with such processor intensive decoding operations also tends to be less of a concern in desktop or other larger computer systems with virtually unlimited power sources. However, the systems and methods described above may nonetheless provide for faster and less intensive encoded message decoding in such systems."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIGS. 6 and 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
