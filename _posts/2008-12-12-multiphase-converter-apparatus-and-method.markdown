{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["PRIORITY CLAIM AND REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. Nos. 61\/013,226, filed Dec. 12, 2007, and 61\/037,751, filed Mar. 19, 2008, under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119, which are incorporated in their entirety by reference herein.","This invention was made with Government assistance under National Science Foundation Award No. 0725887 and NSF CAREER Award No. 0239131. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The invention relates generally to the fields of electrical devices and power systems. The invention relates more particularly to the fields of electrical modulation and conversion.","Power conversion is often desired for providing particular power sources, for portability of power sources, for providing power in bulk, for transmission, or for other reasons. As one example, a major initiative has been taken recently towards the development of a modular solid-oxide-fuel-cell (SOFC) based inverter power system, which mainly feeds bulk power to a local utility load and, unlike active filters, does not need to support more than 30\u00b0 of load power factor. However, various barriers exist to efficient and effective power conversion.","For example, isolation between a power source and a load is highly desirable and often a necessity (e.g., for safety reasons). To provide such isolation, magnetic transformers may be used. Such transformers, though, can be quite large (e.g., tens of tons), bringing difficulties for installation, repair, etc.","An alternative type of power conversion uses a high-frequency transformer, which can provide isolation while reducing the size of the transformer by a significant amount. High-frequency transformers have become more feasible due to recent technical advances. One example is a high-frequency inverter power system, which reduces the huge cost associated with the labor, weight, and footprint of a traditional utility transformer. The potential for high-frequency transformers has been improved by nanocrystalline core based transformer technology and high-voltage and high-frequency Si IGBTs and (more recently) SiC MOSFETs.","Towards that goal, two example feasible high-frequency, high voltage topologies have received attention in the art. One topology  is shown in , and is referred to herein as direct-power-conversion (DPC) topology. Another topology, referred to herein as voltage-source inverter (VSI) topology, may be obtained from the DPC topology  in  by simply placing a link capacitor between output converter and the rectifier. Both the DPC and VSI topologies can support varying load power factor angle up to, as a nonlimiting example, 60 degrees or more.","Referring to , both topologies have a front-end high-frequency converter  and a diode-rectifier bridge , and satisfy a requirement for isolation of a galvanic transformer  for a power source , such as but not limited to a fuel cell, battery, photovoltaic cell, etc. In other embodiments, the rectifier bridge may be switch-based to allow bidirectional power flow.","However, the two topologies differ at the output stage. An output stage of the VSI topology is a dc\/ac inverter that is preceded by a decoupling link capacitor, while the last stage of the DPC topology is an ac\/ac converter , which is not preceded by any decoupling link capacitor. Further, for the DPC topology, the primary-side converter  is operated with sine-wave modulation. For the VSI topology, on the other hand, the primary-side converter operates with square-wave modulation and the output (dc\/ac) converter is sinusoidally modulated. In VSI, the filter capacitor provided after the rectifier feeds the output converter with a dc voltage rather than a pulsating dc.","In spite of advances in power conversion, several problems remain. One significant problem is switching loss of the converter. Another problem is the significant stresses (e.g., voltage, current stresses, electromagnetic emissions) on high-frequency, high-voltage devices.","According to example embodiments of the present invention, an ac\/ac converter is provided for accepting a pulsating dc input with encoded sinusoidal modulation and providing a multiphase modulated output. In an example embodiment, the converter comprises a bridge including a plurality of switches having switch legs for modulating the pulsating dc input at a carrier frequency over a plurality of phases. The bridge is coupled at one end to a pulsating dc source and coupled at another end to a modulated signal output. A controller is provided for the plurality of switches for causing, for each of the plurality of phases, under unity power factor, one of the switch legs to modulate the pulsating dc input at the carrier frequency while the other switch legs do not modulate the pulsating dc input at the carrier frequency.","According to example embodiments of the present invention, a hybrid modulation method and devices using hybrid modulation methods are provided for ac\/ac conversion. Generally, in an example hybrid modulation method, only one leg of a multi-phase switching scheme carries out forced switching (commutating) at any given time during a line cycle, while the other legs (e.g., two legs for a three-phase switching scheme) are not switching; that is, they do not change state. This is accomplished in example embodiments by inputting a modulated waveform to the example ac\/ac converter. The ac\/ac converter switches are triggered with a plurality of modulating references.","In a more particular example embodiment of the present invention, an ac\/ac converter is provided for accepting a pulsating dc input with encoded sinusoidal modulation (pulsating dc with encoded sinusoidal modulation) and providing a multiphase modulated output. However, it is contemplated that other inputs are possible, including ac. Multiphase may include any number of phases greater than one, and the invention is not to be limited to a particular number of phases. In an example embodiment, the converter comprises a bridge including a plurality of switches having switch legs for modulating the pulsating dc input at a carrier frequency over a plurality of phases. The bridge is coupled at one end to a pulsating dc source and coupled at another end to a modulated signal output. The source can be, as nonlimiting examples, a standalone source, an output\/input of a front end converter, and\/or various other sources. The invention is not intended to be limited to receiving an input from a particular source.","A controller, e.g., hardware, software, firmware, analog, digital, analog\/digital, etc., is provided for the plurality of switches for causing, for each of the plurality of phases, under unity power factor, one of the switch legs to modulate the pulsating dc input at the carrier frequency while the other switch legs do not modulate the pulsating dc input at the carrier frequency. Suitable drivers may be provided for driving the switches based on the controller. Nonlimiting example controllers are disclosed herein.","Hybrid modulation devices and methods have various applications. A nonlimiting example device according to an embodiment of the present invention provides a high-frequency and high-power direct-power-conversion (DPC) fuel-cell inverter topology, which can be unidirectional or bidirectional. The inventive modulation scheme reduces the overall loss of the output stage of the high-frequency-link inverter, as compared to a voltage-source-inverter (VSI) based topology, by reducing the switching requirements for the output stage while ensuring a total harmonic distortion that is comparable to the VSI topology whose output stage is forced switched at high frequency. In example devices, this is achieved using two general advantages: first, in the example DPC scheme, the output of the front-end isolated high-frequency dc\/dc converter is not filtered, and hence the modulation information of the sinusoidally-modulated high-frequency inverter is retained; and second, for bulk power generation, only one of the three legs of the output ac\/ac stage of the DPC topology is forced-switched while the other two legs are switched at significantly lower frequency because the input to the output ac\/ac converter is a pulsating dc with embedded sinusoidal-modulation information.","Preferred embodiments will now be discussed with respect to the drawings. The drawings include schematic figures that are not to scale, which will be fully understood by skilled artisans with reference to the accompanying description. Features may be exaggerated for purposes of illustration. From the preferred embodiments, artisans will recognize additional features and broader aspects of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2G","FIG. 1","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2G"],"b":["20","14","1","6","14","12"],"sub":"rec"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Modulation signals for ac\/ac converter."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"P1","P2","P3","P4","P5","P6"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"modA","Ab","1","1","ac","0","0"]},{"entry":[{},"modB","0","0","bc","1","1","Ba"]},{"entry":[{},"modC","0","cb","0","0","Ca","1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"The obtained outputs are used to trigger the ac\/ac converter switches  as shown in .  show that, in a complete line cycle, each of the three legs forced commutates for \u2153of the line cycle.

reaching analyses demonstrate that, the hybrid-modulation based DPC topology suffers no problem with convergence as compared to the VSI topology. It also demonstrates that the VSI topology can only ensure convergence only up to a minimum value of the intermediate capacitance and hence, progressively lower dc-link capacitance of VSI does not make it comparable to the DPC topology.","According to other embodiments of the present invention, example hybrid modulation methods and systems can be used to provide high-power, high-frequency and scalable inverters for power quality and distributed generation. In addition to residential usages with relatively low power rating, fuel-cells are increasingly considered for 1-10 mega-watt applications to support utility distribution circuit or supply stand alone loads. Similar to the low-power case, fuel-cell stacks in this power range most likely will have low voltage (less than 1 kV dc) and high current output characteristics. On the other hand, the desired output voltage is much higher (commonly 12.47 kV ac for the distribution systems in US). The huge gap between these two values makes the design of power electronics inverters, which should have high input current and high output voltage handling capabilities, a significant challenge.","Existing inverters with the aforementioned power ratings usually operate at low switching frequency (around 1 kHz or less) due to the limited turn on\/off performances of the high voltage power devices, resulting in bulky and costly magnetics and filters. Recent progress on semiconductor devices, especially on SiC based high voltage devices, makes inverter design with high-frequency switching at 10 kHz or higher a possible and potentially more favorable option than the low-frequency based design.","Connecting multiple power electronics modules with their inputs in parallel and outputs in series is a more viable option than using a single module inverter due to the lack of power semiconductor devices which have such high V-I ratings. The former option can also have relatively higher reliability and redundancy. Isolation among different modules is required to avoid short-circuit, and it is usually achieved by using transformers rather than using multiple input fuel-cell sources, since the latter option may not be available and is usually not cost effective for the power rating of 1-10 MW range.","The conventional high-power dc\/ac inverter topologies usually require multiple isolated dc\/dc converters with their outputs in series to obtain a high voltage dc bus to feed a following two-level or multi-level dc\/ac inverter. Alternatively, a multi-cell cascaded inverter can be used, since isolated dc sources are available.","In any case, inductors and capacitors are required for these so-called \u201crectifier type\u201d inverters to stabilize the dc bus and sink the current if diode rectifiers are used at the front. A typical \u201crectifier type\u201d inverter module  is shown in , which includes a two-leg full bridge isolated dc\/dc converter  and a three-phase voltage source inverter . The existence of relatively low-life time components L and C on the dc bus not only increases the cost but also reduces the system reliability.","Another topology, referred to as a \u201ccycloconverter type converter\u201d, reduces the system complexity by removing the dc stage. The circuit  shown in  includes a two-leg full bridge inverter  followed by a single-phase high-frequency transformer  and a three-phase PWM cycloconverter . Extension for the higher power can be achieved in two ways: (i) connecting the all modules' transformer secondary sides in series and feeding the obtained ac bus into a three-phase cycloconverter, or (ii) cascading the single-phase cycloconverter outputs to form one phase output. Although it has lesser power conversion stage, the number of active components required especially for the high voltage secondary side is relatively high due to the bidirectional switches for cycloconverters.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, hybrid modulation is used to provide a three-phase single-source high-frequency link isolated rectifier type inverter module that eliminates the need for an inductor or capacitor in its main circuit for high-power fuel-cell based distributed generation applications. As compared to the \u201ccycloconverter type\u201d inverter  (), the example topology has less number of active switchers to achieve three phase output.","Generally, a high-frequency link three-phase dc\/ac inverter is provided according to example embodiments for mega-watt range applications, as a potential substitute for the conventional low-frequency power electronics inverter. The premise of high frequency operation at high power relies on the availability of high voltage SiC power devices, currently under developmental progress. The example inverter structure and hybrid modulation method achieve low-voltage dc to high-voltage ac conversion without the need of constant dc bus. It can reduce the switching losses of the ac\/ac inverter, and enables the scalability for higher power higher voltage applications. An example inverter has less volume, low cost, and relatively high efficiency.","The circuit schematic of one module  of an example inverter is shown in . The module  comprises three stages of power conversion: 1) a high-frequency (10 kHz) sinusoidal phase-shift-modulated zero-voltage turn-on full-bridge inverter , which interfaces to a low-voltage and high-current fuel-cell stack ; 2) a three-leg diode rectifier  that transforms the bipolar ac voltage at the secondary of the high-frequency transformer  to a unipolar 20 kHz pulsating waveform (which has a 6-pulse envelope); and 3) an ac\/ac converter  that converts the pulsating output of the rectifier to an line-frequency ac output using pulse-width modulation. The high-frequency transformers  in  provide galvanic isolation, boost the input-side voltage, and enable series connection of multiple modules without short circuit.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the final stage ac\/ac converter  is switched in a hybrid manner. Thus, only at one-third of one period time the devices are operating with high-frequency (20 kHz) while they stay at either ON or OFF for the rest of the time. This fundamental difference in switching strategies of the inverter leads to lower switching losses. The example inverter  can support a load power factor angle up to \u00b130 degrees, and may support up to 60 degrees or more.

The voltage stresses of devices will be reduced by half as compared to the case of two-level.","According to other example embodiments of the present invention, soft-switching methods and systems are provided for an isolated dc\/dc converter. High efficiency, low cost, and high power density are important attributes of a low-input-voltage three-phase converter (fed with a low-voltage dc source), such as but not limited to battery based three-phase uninterruptible power supply (UPS), naval bi-directional power conversion modules (PCMs), fuel-cell powered electric motor drive, distributed generation (DG) systems with renewable energy sources, and others. Galvanic isolation is typically mandatory for safety concerns and voltage and current scalability, and in that regard, a high-frequency transformer-based approach can be a preferable choice from the standpoint of weight, footprint, and cost reduction.","Among all possible topologies, a high-frequency-link (HFL) pulse-width modulated (PWM) converter can eliminate the intermediate LC filter that is needed for a conventional high-frequency (HF) fixed-dc-link converter approach. Further, as compared to a resonant-link inverter, it yields lower switch stress, better THD, and a simpler all-device structure (i.e. no passive components in power stages). Thus, the PWM HFL converter approach is better suited from the viewpoints of cost, efficiency and portability.","Two typical HFL converter topologies have been considered in the art. One proposed topology is a cycloconverter-type HFL (CHFL) converter, which reduces the conversion complexity by directly placing a three-phase PWM cycloconverter to the secondary side of an HF transformer. The other topology is known as a rectifier-type HFL (RHFL) converter. It possesses a structure similar to that of a conventional fixed-dc-link converter except for the absence of the dc-link filter. Although the RHFL converter includes an extra rectifier stage, overall, it requires fewer switches since it does not need to handle bi-directional voltage.","A typical three-phase RHFL converter  is illustrated in . It includes two full-bridges, Bridges I and II, as the front-end followed by an HF transformer and an ac\/ac full-bridge (Bridge III) as the final stage. This voltage-source-inverter (VSI) like structure provides inherent free-wheeling paths in Bridge III, which simplifies its switching scheme, precluding the possibility of disruption of the load current due to open circuit. Furthermore, the auxiliary circuit, which is commonly used in an HFL converter to recover the transformer leakage energy and\/or to limit the secondary-side overvoltage, can be simplified. Nevertheless, the RHFL converter may suffer from additional switching losses because of three-stage HF operation.","To address this problem, several switching schemes have been proposed for achieving soft-switching without using any additional components. The conventional method is to implement a square-wave modulation on Bridges I and II, and apply one of many well-established continuous sine-wave modulation schemes to Bridge III. All associated switches on Bridges I and II turn-on and turn-off during the zero-vector intervals of Bridge III to achieve zero-current switching (ZCS). The normally-used schemes for Bridge III are continuous sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) and space-vector modulation (SVM). However, Bridge III still experiences significant switching losses owing to the usage of slow-speed high-voltage semiconductor devices that operate under hard-switching conditions.","Some discontinuous-modulation schemes, which were originally proposed for fixed-dc-input VSI, can be utilized for Bridge III to partially reduce its switching losses by allowing no switching on one of its three legs. The ZCS of front-end bridges is still applicable. A zero-voltage switching (ZVS) scheme has also been proposed, which can partially reduce switching losses of Bridge III by aligning the commutation edges of the devices with the zero-input-voltage intervals. However, this method violates the ZCS condition for front-end switches and may not be very effective.","According to additional embodiments of the present invention, a soft-switching mechanism is provided based on a zero-voltage-zero-current-switching (ZVZCS) principle for a front-end isolated dc\/dc converter of an isolated three-phase rectifier-type high-frequency-link (RHFL) bi-directional power converter. By using a back-end ac\/ac converter operating with hybrid modulation to reduce the number of hard-switched commutation per switching cycle, the example ZVZCS scheme can lead to less overall switching loss as compared to conventional switching schemes. Example ZVZCS devices and methods are effective for various load conditions, operate seamlessly with a simple active-clamp circuit, and are suitable for applications where low-voltage dc to high-voltage three-phase ac power conversion is required.","An example soft-switching scheme to further reduce the overall switching losses for the front-end isolated dc\/dc converter of the overall RHFL converter relies on shifting the three-phase sinusoidal modulation into primary side. The example soft-switching scheme enables ZVZCS for all switches on two front-end bridges, and is valid for various load conditions and bipolar load current.","The conventional switching scheme applies a square-wave modulation on the front-end bridges such that Bridge III can be treated as a fixed-dc-input VSI although its input is not strictly a dc. Various types of SPWM or SVM schemes can be utilized to modulate Bridge III, and the zero-current switching of both front-end bridges can be achieved by switching the associated switches during the zero-vector intervals of Bridge III.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":["FIG. 13A","FIG. 13A"],"b":["1","3","1","3","0","7","7","0","1","4","1","4"],"sub":["tr ","tr"],"sup":"rd"},"Some discontinuous SVM schemes, initially considered for fix-dc-link VSI, can also be adopted for Bridge III to reduce its switching loss without affecting the ZCS of Bridges I and II.

As observed from , \u03b4 is larger than \u03b4 to preclude short circuiting of Bridge-I output by Bridge II.","The zero-voltage regions on V(I and IV in ) allow ZVS operation of switches at the transformer secondary side. Furthermore, as will be explained below, the transformer current iremains zero during the zero-voltage regions, and thus provides possibility of ZCS on Bridge I.","Either Bridge I or II will act as a diode rectifier depending on the polarity of i, the input current to Bridge III. For positive i, diodes on Bridge II conduct, otherwise diodes on Bridge I conduct. In either case, current of a diode will decay to zero during the zero-voltage zero-current (ZVZC) region and before it sustains reverse-bias voltages. Therefore, diodes of both bridges have lossless turn-off, which eliminates reverse recovery problems.","Implied from , the starting point of a ZVZC region is determined by the turn-off edge of K or K if i\u22670 at the beginning of the region, or by the turn-on edge of Q or Q if i<0. On the other hand, the ending point of a ZVZC region is determined by the turn-on edge of K or K if i\u22670 right after the region, or by the turn-off edge of Q or Q if i<0. In any case, due to the existence of dead time \u03b4, a rising edge of K or K and a falling edge of K or K are always located inside a ZVZC region. Therefore, switches K and K will have ZCS on, and K and K will have ZCS off. Similarly, because of the existence of overlap time \u03b4, switches Q and Q will always have ZVS on, and Q and Q have ZVS off.","This example switching scheme enables a seamless transition between Bridge I ZCS and Bridge II ZVS according to the polarity of output current of Bridge II (i) without sensing any current or voltage, and therefore it is effective for various load conditions. For a three-phase RHFL converter, inormally experience abrupt changes in magnitude and polarity during a switching period. It is unlike the case in a high-frequency-switched dc\/dc (unidirectional or bidirectional) or a single-phase dc\/ac converter, where the output current of the rectifier stage can be regarded as constant.","Furthermore, the active-clamp circuit used in this example scheme can have multiple functions.

Example inverters employing hybrid modulation allow removal of the dc-link filter evident in conventional inverters, where the diode rectifier stage is followed by a low-pass filter and a voltage-source inverter (VSI). Significant reduction in switching loss of the ac\/ac converter switches, and hence an overall ac\/ac converter or overall inverter (if the ac\/ac converter is an integral part) is provided by modulating the switches of 2 of the 3 legs of a 6-switch ac\/ac converter at a low frequency (e.g., 120\/100 Hz) while modulating the third leg at high switching frequency. Yet, at the output of the AC\/AC converter or the overall inverter (if the AC\/AC converter is an integral part), a three-phase sinusoidal modulated waveform is still obtained using an all-forced switching VSI. Unlike the VSI approach, an example direct-power-conversion (DPC) inverter according to embodiments of the present invention allows the retention of the sine-wave modulated switching information at the output of the diode rectifier rather than filtering it. Thus, for high power applications, example embodiments of the present invention provide tangible improvement in footprint space and system reliability due to intermediate bulky filter elimination and higher energy conversion efficiency without compromising quality of voltage output as compared to a conventional VSI approach.","Variations on the example embodiments are possible, and such variations are to be considered part of the present invention. As one such nonlimiting example, the converters or inverters can be multilevel and scalable for higher power. As another example, the input frequency of the AC\/AC converter pulsating DC can be different from the forced switching frequency of the AC\/AC converter.","Additionally, example soft-switching schemes have been provided for the front-end of a rectifier-type high-frequency-link (RHFL) three-phase pulse-width-modulated (PWM) converter. This soft-switching scheme achieves zero-current switching (ZCS) for the primary side full-bridge, as well as zero-voltage switching (ZVS) for the secondary-side full-bridge rectifier. The body diodes on both the bridges turn-off softly and no reverse-recovery problem arises. Example ZVZCS schemes can reduce the overall switching loss of the RHFL converter by shifting switching actions from slow devices on the high-voltage side to relatively faster ones on the low-voltage side. Therefore, such methods and systems are suitable for low-voltage dc to high-voltage ac conversion. Example soft-switching schemes are valid for various load conditions with bi-directional power flow.","While various embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it should be understood that other modifications, substitutions, and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications, substitutions, and alternatives can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which should be determined from the appended claims.","Various features of the invention are set forth in the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","sub":"rec "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 2B-2F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2G"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"0","sup":["th ","rd "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 6A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 7A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 7C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIGS. 9A-9F","FIG. 9A","FIG. 9B","FIG. 9C","FIG. 9D","FIG. 9E","FIG. 9F"],"sub":["uv","rec"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIGS. 10A-10F","FIG. 10A","FIG. 10B","FIG. 10C","FIG. 10D","FIG. 10E","FIG. 10F"],"sub":["rec","rec","ab "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 11A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 11B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIGS. 13A-13B","FIG. 13A","FIG. 13B"],"sup":"rd ","b":"0"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIGS. 15A-15B","FIG. 15A","FIG. 15B"],"b":["2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIGS. 16A-16B","FIG. 15A","FIG. 15B"],"b":["2","3"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
