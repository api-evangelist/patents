No. 61\/108,232 filed on Oct. 24, 2008, the entire disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention was made with support from the U.S. Government under National Science Foundation Contract Nos. CNS 0454081 and IIS 0534520. Accordingly, the Government has certain rights in the present invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to electronic communications systems. More specifically, the present invention relates to a system and method for previewing calls in communications systems.","2. Related Art","In today's society, the abundance of technology-mediated communications systems\/devices, such as the now ubiquitous cell phone, as well as pagers, text messages, etc., has increased not only the ability to communicate, but also the possibility of being interrupted. Quite often, users of such systems are interrupted by calls from various individuals. While existing communications equipment permits identification of a caller before a call is taken, such information is often insufficient for a recipient to make an informed decision as to whether to take the call, and hence, accept the interruption. As a result, there is currently an increased research focus on technology for managing such interruptions. For example, interruption management has focused on systems that make use of different interruption management strategies such as deferral, negotiation, collaborative, availability awareness, and notification.","A drawback to existing interruption management techniques is that they do not provide users of communications devices with sufficient information to make an informed decision as to whether to accept a call. For example, they do not provide an interruptee with sufficient information relating to relational context information, which encompasses people's preferences and biases of the relationship between the interrupter and interruptee (who), as well as factors relating to the interruption that vary with each interrupter (what and why). Accordingly, what is needed, but has not yet been provided, is a system and method for previewing calls in communications systems, which provides rich information to an interruptee to allow the interruptee to more efficiently and accurately manage incoming calls.","The present invention relates to a system and method for previewing calls in communications system. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a system for previewing calls in a communications system. The system includes a first communications device operated by a sender, the first communications device executing first call preview code for allowing the sender to provide relational context information relating to a call; and a second communications device operated by a receiver, the second communications device executing second call preview code for receiving the relational context information from the sender and displaying the relational context information to the receiver, wherein the receiver can decide how to respond to the call from the sender based upon the relational context information. The system can also generate a plurality of user interface screens for allowing the receiver to participate in a survey relating to the call.","In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method for previewing calls in a communications system. The method includes the steps of displaying a first user interface screen on a first communications device operated by a sender in a communications network; allowing the sender to provide relational context information relating to a call using the first user interface screen; initiating a call between the sender and a receiver in the communications network; transmitting the relational context information to a second communications device operated by the receiver; displaying the relational context information to the receiver in a second user interface screen generated by the second communications device; and allowing the receiver to decide how to respond to the call based upon the relational context information.","In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a computer-readable medium holding computer executable instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause a communications device to execute the steps of: receiving relational context information from a sender in a communications network relating to a call; and displaying the relational context information in a user interface screen on the communications device. The receiver can decide how to respond to the call based upon the relational context information.","The present invention relates to a system and method for previewing calls in communications systems, as discussed in detail below in connection with . The term \u201ccall,\u201d as used herein, includes, but is not limited to, telephone calls, text messages, or any other type of electronic communication that is initiated with an intention to engage the receiver in a synchronous or near synchronous communication, such that the present invention provides a preview of such communication to a recipient.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","20","12","14","16","20","16","20","16","20","18","22","18","22","16","20"]},"As shown in , the sender  can provide relational context information prior to placing a call, using graphical user interface screens generated on the sender's device  by the call preview module . Such information can include, but is not limited to, voice information, text information, graphics, etc., and relates to context information about the sender . For example, as discussed hereinbelow in greater detail, the relational context information could include, but is not limited to, the caller's identification, a short description of the call subject, the caller's location, an activity the caller is currently engaged in, the anticipated length of the call, an indication of the urgency of the call, an indication of the importance of the call, an indication of the caller's mood, and\/or information about individuals surrounding or near the caller. Also, the relational context information could include interrupter-interruptee interaction history information that can be gathered from previously recorded\/captured data, such as the typical length of a call for a given caller, typical time of a call, typical location, typical reason for a call, etc. The relational context information, once entered by the sender , is transmitted from the sender's device  to the receiver's device  over the communications network, along with the call.","The context information transmitted to the receiver's device  is displayed in a graphical user interface screen on the user's device  by the call preview module . Using this information, the receiver  can decide how to respond to the call; that is, whether to accept the call, ignore it, or to send a response to the sender  in any desired format (e.g., voice, text, graphics, etc.). For example, the receiver  can send a message back to the sender  acknowledging receipt of the call, but indicating to the sender  that the receiver  will call the sender  back at a more convenient time.

The Predicted Interruption Value (PIV) , discussed above, is the result of a cost\/benefit evaluation in step  for the best course of action in response to the interruption, based on cognitive, social, and relational context. While individuals are aware of their own cognitive and social context, their knowledge of the relational context is to some extent unknown. As a result, they will typically try to reduce uncertainty regarding the relational context to derive the PIV.","Three categories of relational context factors are of particular importance to the model , and are processed by the present invention: 1) interrupter-related information which comprises factors such as who the interruption is from, his or her activity, location, mood, and the nature of relationship with people in the location; 2) interruption content which comprises factors such as what the interruption is about (analogous to subject fields in emails), how long it may last, and its urgency\/importance; and 3) interrupter-interruptee interaction history which comprises factors such as how often, for how long, what times the interrupter interrupts, and how many attempts were previously made.","The relational factors identified above vary with each interruption and the knowledge of these factors influences the interruptee's response to an interruption. However, in current CMC systems, the relational context knowledge is limited or non existent leading to uncertainty around an incoming interruption as discussed below.","Interrupter Related Information:","Uncertainty around interrupter's context in CMC comes from factors such as who the interrupter is and his or her social and cognitive context. Currently, identity of the interrupter is limited to information on interrupter identification (ID) in terms of numbers, names, usernames and email addresses. While relationships and affinities to the interrupter are not explicitly provided, they are implicitly derived in the interruptee's mind based on the interrupter's ID information. The implicit derivation however is based on the premise that the user ID presented is that of the person(s) having ownership or user rights to the communication device. The case of multiple users increases the level of uncertainty on who the interrupter is. As far as computer-mediated interrupter's social or cognitive context factors are concerned, currently the interrupter's context while initiating an interruption in terms of the location\/place, people in place and social\/cognitive activity, mood is not captured to be presented to the interruptees. Some level of uncertainty is reduced if the interruption is via a non-mobile communication device as one can assume that the person is calling from where the device is located. Micro details such as who they are with, their mobility, current task, and scheduled activities can help in reducing uncertainty further.","Interruption Content:","Uncertainty from on interruption content can arise from lack of knowledge on factors such as importance\/urgency of the interruption and length of interruption. Often, importance\/urgency as perceived by the interrupter is conveyed when engaged in the interruption itself and is rarely communicated ahead of the interruption. Typical asynchronous communication systems such as emails and voicemails allow for the urgency level to be conveyed. Anecdotal experiences shows that individuals can infer urgency\/importance based on communication history patterns of the sender such as frequency of and time of day interactions on certain communication media. Some interruptions may be considered important\/urgent based on regular communication patterns, for example, a mother who receives a call every evening at 9 pm from her son who is overseas. Alternatively, a break in routine communication patterns may be inferred as important, such as an early morning call from a person who rarely calls at that time maybe be perceived as important\/urgent. These scenarios highlight that importance\/urgency of an interruption currently is implicitly derived or understood or misunderstood. As far as knowing what an interruption is about, it is difficult to know for sure until it is engaged in. However some communication systems like emails allow for a subject line\/tag that is synonymous to a headline of a news story. This allows for reduced uncertainty for the receiver by enabling him\/her to gauge the value of engaging in the interruption.","Interrupter-Interruptee Interaction History:","Interaction patterns such as emails, text messages or phone logs that include times at which they are received and how long they last, etc., can be obtained based on the design capability of the device in question. Currently, aggregated\/meta information on interaction patterns such as frequency of interruptions, average length, usual times of interruptions are not available explicitly unless actively sought or implied by the user.","Knowledge of the foregoing three kinds of relational factors discussed, as captured by the present invention, reduces the uncertainty around an interruption leading to a more accurate prediction of the interruption value. The issues of uncertainty raised here are particularly relevant to current cell phone communication where the relational context information provided for incoming calls is limited to the identity of the caller (in other synchronous communications technology such as land phones one could deduce place in which the caller is and\/or her related activity the place). This can be addressed by leveraging social network and\/or location data to provide richer information to the interruptee, or by providing mechanisms for the capture and presentation of information such as call reason, importance and urgency to the interrupter.","The value of an interruption is defined as a net result of perceived costs and perceived benefits of an interruption. However, the model  shows that the costs and benefits are perceived based not simply on the social and cognitive factors as predominantly considered in previous paradigms but also on relational factors such as interrupter's context, interruption content and history of interrupter-interruptee interaction patterns. Thus, the PIV at time t is defined as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"PIV","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["C","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},"mo":"-"}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["B","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}}}}]}},{"msub":{"mi":["w","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"m"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["C","i","\u2032"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},"mo":"-"}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["B","i","\u2032"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}}}}]}},{"msubsup":{"mi":["w","i","\u2032"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["C","i","\u2033"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},"mo":"-"}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["B","i","\u2033"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}}}}]}},{"msubsup":{"mi":["w","i","\u2033"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}],"mo":["+","+"]}],"mo":"="}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":"where Ci(t), Bi(t), and wi(t) are perceived cost, benefit and weight of the ith cognitive factor respectively; C\u2032(t), B\u2032(t), and w\u2032(t) are perceived cost, benefit and weight of the ith social factor; and C\u2032(t), B\u2032(t), and w\u2032(t) are perceived cost, benefit and weight of the ith relational factor.\n\nA negative PIV indicates that the perceived costs outweigh the perceived benefits (i.e., the individual is less likely to respond to the interruption), whereas positive PIV indicates that the perceived benefits outweigh the perceived costs (i.e., the individual is more likely to respond to the interruption). It is noted that PIV is defined as user's perception and the way user assigns weights to each factor is influenced by how s\/he perceives the value of these factors. For example, an interruption may affect the productivity of a current task but if the interruptee perceives the importance\/urgency to the interrupter to be of higher weight, then the net PIV of responding to the interruption may be positive. Further, the PIV may or may not be accurate as it is evaluated based on the information available to the interruptee at the time of interruption. For example, an individual receiving a call from a colleague may perceive it to have high work related value and low social value. However, it may be that the colleague may have called to ask if the individual would go to a movie with him. The accuracy of PIV is related to the accuracy of interruption information one has at the time of interruption. The model  maximizes the accuracy of PIV by providing relevant information and reducing uncertainty around the unknown relational factors of an interruption. The closer the PIV is to the actual interruption value, the greater the individuals' satisfaction with the decision will be.\n"}}}},"The present invention was utilized in a study which implemented experience sampling methodology (ESM) to assess the validity of key aspects of the present invention. Forty participants were given a Qtek 9100 Windows Mobile cell phone loaded with survey software to be used for a week with their own SIM card and service plan. For each incoming call (answered, ignored intentionally, missed unintentionally), the following data were collected: a) information related to caller identification; b) the level of influence of relational (caller), cognitive (mental state) and social (place and people) contexts on call handling decisions. This study showed that relational context plays an enormous role (87.4%) in call handling decisions unlike the interruptee's current local social (34.9%) or cognitive (43%) contexts (N=834). Single-handedly, relational context influenced decisions 49.5% of the time while social and cognitive context influenced only 9% and 1.8%, respectively. Second, a clear disconnect was shown between the influence of local interrupee-context and relational context in terms of call handling decisions. Relational context did not correlate with either cognitive context (answered calls: Spearman's r=0.039, n=788, p=0.27; ignored calls: Spearman's r=0.072, n=163, p=0.36) or social context (answered calls: Spearman's r=\u22120.17, n=788, p=0.000; Ignored calls: Spearman's r=\u22120.26, n=163, p<0.001). Third, individuals engaged in the process of uncertainty reduction in call handling decisions. 35.4% of calls were answered (N=729) to find out what the call was about. These findings confirmed the underlying premises of the framework and its assertion that the localized cognitive and social context on their own lack in providing the necessary subtext to understand and predict people's willingness to be interrupted.","In the foregoing study, the phones were loaded with a survey that consisted of 4-13 questions which varied based on the way an incoming phone call was handled. Incoming calls were differentiated based upon: a) answered calls; b) ignored calls (missed intentionally); and c) missed calls (missed unintentionally). The surveys were triggered and administered as follows: a) immediately after the end of the call for answered calls; b) immediately after a call that was missed; or c) immediately after user hit ignore\/silence button for an incoming call. If the survey was not immediately answered due to reasons such as a missed call or other tasks, the survey was programmed to provide audible alert and a visual display of an icon suggesting pending incomplete surveys. In case of multiple missed surveys due to multiple missed calls, the surveys were queued and administered in the order of triggers detected.","A possible limitation of the ESM technique is that questionnaires are typically limited to 1 or 2 minutes so as to not burden the participants, and are typically presented to the subjects a number of times. As a result, a qualitative approach to ESM survey validity was adopted, using pretests and experts' opinion to ensure that a single item scales measure what was desired. Further, subjects were trained and briefed on every single survey question, so that there was no ambiguity in their understanding and responses. Pre-tests showed that the survey took 20-30 seconds to complete for each incoming call.","Subjects were trained and briefed before participating in the study on how to operate the phone and how to adhere to study requirements in providing data, and who to reach in case of problems. A total of 40 subjects were recruited for the ESM study and belong to two major groups: 1) 20 students of a research university; and 2) 20 full-time employees of a fortune 500 company. The majority of the subjects (37) had used cell phones for at least 3 years or more. The student group consisted of 8 undergraduate and 12 graduate full time students who volunteered solely because of their interest in the study. They received no course credit or other reward for participation, other than the chance to use a Pocket PC phone for a week. Nineteen of the subjects were 18-25 years of age and 1 was 36-50 years of age. Eight lived on campus, one held a full-time job, while another eight held part-time jobs. Jobs profiles included nurse, research assistants, tutors and desk assistants.","The full-time working group consisted of 20 adults from diverse professional backgrounds including research scientists, programmers, project managers, system administrators, software engineers, developers, business analysts, network engineers, computer scientists and purchasing staff. Subjects were given raffle tickets for an MP3 player in return for their participation. One subject was 18-25 years of age, 4 were 26-35 years of age, 8 were 36-50 years of age and 6 were 51-65 years of age.","The ESM survey consisted of 3 versions for the three call handling outcomes, namely: missed (unintentional), ignored (intentional), and answered. Survey versions for answered and ignored calls varied slightly from each other to reflect how the call was handled and were divided into the subsections described below. The survey version for missed calls however covered only relevant items in subsections (b) and (d):\n\n","The phones recorded a total of 1201 incoming calls for which ESM surveys were answered. The number of incoming calls that went directly to voicemail (typically received when the phone was switched off) is unknown. Data were collected from participants for an average of 6 days, as phone use varied from one person to another. One subject reported not using the phone at all after the first day, and another subject was unable to send the data due to his current location constraints. These two subjects were dropped from the study, and the data from the remaining 38 subjects was utilized.","All calls resulted in three categories of call handling outcomes: 65.6% of the calls were answered, 13.6% were ignored intentionally and 20.8% were missed unintentionally. Majority of the calls (79.1%) were intentionally handled while 20.8% of the calls were handled unintentionally. These results are shown in the graphs - of . Of the calls answered, 92.5% (729) of the callers were identified. Participants reported answering the calls for the following reasons: 1) expecting the call (42.2%); 2) wanting to know why they were called (35.4%); 3) 16.5% of the time they reported having answered because they had some idea of what the call was about; 4) obligation (7.4%); and 5) closeness to the caller (24.7%). Other reasons included the caller's call patterns such as time, length of calls, frequency, etc.","Participants reported being happy with the way the calls were handled 86% of the time. Specifically, with regard to intentional call handling decisions, participants reported being happy 96.7% of the times they answered calls and 97% when they ignored them. However, when the call handling outcome resulted in missed calls (unintentional), they reported being unhappy 52.4% of the time. This shows that participants were largely unhappy when decision was not deliberate.","Since 52.4% of the missed calls resulted in participants being unhappy, we decided to look at the reasons provided for having missed a call unintentionally. Participants reported that 32% of unhappy missed calls resulted due the ringer being turned off, 524 due to not hearing the ring or feeling the vibration. Other reasons reported included hanging up accidentally, away from the phone, unable to reach the phone on time, calling party hanging up, currently on another call and driving.","When asked how they would have liked to have handled these missed calls, they wished to have been notified of the incoming call 83.2% of the time, wished it went to the voice-mail 9.2% of the time, and wished they had known who the caller was but not have to pick up 5.3% of the time. They almost never (0.8%) wished they could have blocked it completely. Other reasons included better physical access to cell phone such a convenient place to hold the phone, and have an easier way to pull out phone from holder without hanging up.","When participants made an intentional call handling decision to either answer or ignore a call, we asked them to what level their decision was influence by (0\u2014no influence, 1\u2014least and 3\u2014most influence) the three factors representing the three contexts namely:\n\n","Of the 951 intentionally handled calls, 117 calls were reported to have no influence from any of these factors. For the remaining 834 calls, participants reported that the caller influenced their decisions 87.4%, their mental state of mind influenced 34.9% and the place\/activity\/people around 43% 1. Clearly, the caller played a very important role in their call handling decisions. Further, 49.5% of the time participants reported the caller alone influenced their call handling decisions. In contrast, the level of influence cognitive and social factors on their own was limited to only 1.8% and 9% respectively. These results are shown in . In particular, 51.9% of the times caller alone influence the decision to answer a call and 37% of the time in the decision to ignore a call. For answered calls, cognitive context was used in isolation 0.7% of the time and social context 6.3%. For ignored calls, cognitive context was used in isolation 7.4% of the time and social context 23%. It is noted that, since participants were asked to rate the influence of each context, percentages do not add up to a 100%.","The correlations between the three contexts were examined for answered and ignored calls. For answered calls, the relational context did not correlate with either cognitive context (Spearman's rho=0.039, n=788, p=0.27) or social context (Spearman's rho=\u22120.17, n=788, p<0.0001). However, social and cognitive context correlated highly (Spearman's rho=0.584, n=788, p<0.0001). Similarly for ignored calls, the relational context did not correlate with either cognitive context (Spearman's rho=0.072, n=163, p=0.36) or social context (Spearman's rho=\u22120.26, n=163, p<0.001). Contrary to the answered calls, social and cognitive context were not correlated (Spearman's rho=0.115, n=163, p=0.145) in the case of ignored calls.","The foregoing study confirms that relational context influences interruption management decisions more than the social and cognitive contexts. Further, the data suggests that social and cognitive factors are sparingly (less than 9%) used in isolation and are used in conjunction with the relational context. This is not surprising as people are fundamentally social beings and interruptions in the form of interpersonal communication are handled on relationship by relationship basis rather than the social and cognitive context one is in.","Further, it was also found that relational context had no strong correlation with cognitive and social context. This indicates a clear disconnect between the influence of local interrupee-context and relational context in terms of call handling decisions. This supports the argument that the localized cognitive and social context on their own lack in providing the necessary subtext to understand and predict people's willingness to be interrupted.","The findings of the foregoing study not only provide empirical evidence of how the cognitive and social interruptability paradigms used in previous work underplay the role of the relational context (who is calling and about what), but also revealed that relational context plays an enormous role in everyday interruption management practices. These results suggest that dramatic improvements in interruption management are likely to come from the provision of tools that leverage social relationship data rather than complicated inference from sensors about the social and\/or cognitive context.","In the foregoing study, it was found that the majority (79%) of the calls were handled intentionally by answering or ignoring. On encountering unintentionally missed calls, participants reported being unhappy more than 50% of the time and expressed a desire to be made aware of an incoming call at the very least. This suggests that the users may prefer deliberation of costs and benefits of their call handling decisions rather than have an agent control or filter their incoming interruptions. Further, it was seen that more than half these missed calls (54%) resulted from the not being able to hear\/feel the vibration and more than one third (32%) from the ringer being turned off. It was also seen that individuals engaged in the process of uncertainty reduction in call handling decisions where 35.4% (N=729) of identified calls were answered to find out what the call was about.","Having thus described the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the foregoing description is not intended to limit the spirit or scope thereof.
