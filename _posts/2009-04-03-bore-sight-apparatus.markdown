{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119, the benefit of priority from provisional application 61\/137,465, with a filing date of Jul. 24, 2008, is claimed for this non-provisional application.","The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy, and thus, the invention herein may be manufactured, used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates generally to bore sight alignment of a gun. In particular, the invention provides an apparatus using commercially available components with modest modification to enter the muzzle and traverse the bore of the gun.","A muzzle bore sight enables precise alignment of a gun onto a specified target by ballistic trajectory. Such tasks are routinely conducted by engineers and gun crews to precisely align the gun. Gun alignment is pivotal to any type of testing being conducted with naval gunnery. Historically, naval guns were sighted by placing a bore telescope at the breech of the gun and aligning the telescope with cross hairs contained at the muzzle. The cross hairs are then aligned on a target within the guns range, allowing for the gun sight to be zeroed in on target.","Utilizing the ability to bore sight a gun gives gunners and engineers precise gun alignment with which to evaluate a guns performance. Empirically measuring gun performance, against theoretically engineered specifications, is crucial for proper evaluation of the gun's design and construction. Conventionally, precision fabrication of any device used to align the gun is of utmost importance, requiring precision machining of any bore sight device used to sight in any gun.","Conventional gun-alignment devices yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, various exemplary embodiments provide an apparatus for traversing a barrel of a gun and disposing at a select position therein. The apparatus includes a bore-rider assembly and a sight-mount assembly. These assemblies can optionally be fabricated from commercially available components.","In various exemplary embodiments, the bore-rider assembly enters a muzzle of the barrel, slides within a bore of the barrel, and anchors to the select position. The sight-mount assembly projects a line-of-sight from the select position to the muzzle.","In various exemplary embodiments, the bore-rider assembly includes a rod having wedges, first and second bore-riders with proximal and distal ends, a sleeve couple that joins at axial ends the bore-riders in tandem from their proximal ends. Each bore-rider has a rim at the distal end and an extension at the proximal end. The rim has an outer diameter adjustable by expansion. The sleeve couple joins in tandem at each axial end each bore-rider from the proximal end. The rod passes through each bore-rider and the couple. The rod includes first and second wedges that engage their corresponding bore-riders.","Various exemplary embodiments also provide for the rim to include an angularly symmetric plurality of slits therethrough. The slits continuously extend into the extension. The extension includes an axial chamber through which a spring passes through to provide tension for the rod. Cables extend fore and aft of the device and at a slit of the nearest bore-rider and loop around the corresponding extension.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Cantilever moment due to the length of the gun barrel introduces an error caused by barrel droop. For a gun bore sighted at the muzzle, the projectile fires higher than alignment indication, resulting in target overshoot. This trajectory raising is caused by the barrel straightening as the gun fires due to gun blast pressure and the projectiles movement through the gun. Placement of a bore sight at the origin of bore (breech end) to negate barrel droop, reduces trajectory error to accurately align the gun on target.","Disposing the bore sight at the bore's origin has conventionally been accomplished with custom-designed precision-tolerance components, thereby raising expenditure. Universalizing an origin of bore sight reduces cost by reducing the number of instruments required for aligning various guns for test firing. Adaptability can include most guns sizes depending on the dimensions of instrument mounted on the bore sight. Cameras and lasers can be readily mounted on the bore sight depending on the test required of the gun. These specifications can be incorporated in various exemplary embodiments of the universalized origin of bore sight using a camera or a laser.","Conventional bore sights are of one solid machined component, disposed at the muzzle of the gun. This device employs three extendible contact pins, each pin having first and second positions for engagement and disengagement with the barrel interior surface. Depending on the model, each point of contact is of hardened steel or anodized aluminum allowing for smooth motion over the rifling of the barrel.","Several conventional techniques are employed to provide a concentric fit between the barrel and bore riders, while maintaining mobility in the bore. One method utilizes a spring-loaded contact pin at each support position, which creates an interference fit aligning the bore riders concentrically within the barrel. This design is complimented by its adaptability to changes in the inner bore diameter due to barrel fowling or erosion. Other designs that do not utilize the spring contact point require precise machining and tight tolerances to obtain a concentric fit. Such tight tolerance complicates insertion of the bore sight and often requires lubricants for installation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","110","130","110","140","140","120","130","150","140"]},"Another conventional configuration uses two positions of contact but incorporates six contact pins at each position. These bore-riders include metal tongs forming a tapered conical shape. The tongs allow for equal displacement when inserted into a barrel maintain concentricity within the barrel regardless of inner diameter.","Various types of bore sights use either an optic eye piece or laser for target alignment. An example of an optic eye piece would be a telescope with 90\u00b0-view attached to the bore rider. This enables an operator to view the desired target from the muzzle and align the gun accordingly. Replacing the telescope with a laser enables targeting by positioning the reflection dot on the target, which can accelerate gun target alignment. Camera bore sights use lenses and sophisticated closed couple device cameras mounted in line with the telescope relaying video back to personnel that control gun movement. This technique enables precise target tracking viewed from within the barrel.","Incorporating the previously cited above features into a universal bore sight provides the rationale for the configuration represented in various exemplary embodiments. Such a bore sight device can preferably be designed and fabricated for adaptation to multiple bore sizes. This device preferably also contain features to mount a camera and lens capable of viewing the target range of the gun being sighted, or alternatively to mount a laser for a secondary measure to sight the gun on target. The universal bore sight is capable of being disposed in any position along the axis of the barrel, from the muzzle to the origin of the bore.","Researching and examining several preexisting bore sight designs led to the option of adapting the star gauge to act as bore-riders, which would center within the bore of any gun placed in. The star gauge represents a device used to precisely measure the inner bore diameter of guns, ranging from 3-inch to 16-inch with accuracy to a ten-thousandth of inch. The gauge operates by inserting a head socket, attached to a connecting rod to a desired depth within the barrel. Upon reaching this depth, the connecting rod pushes a conical wedge into a head socket extruding out measuring points equally. These measuring points then contact the lands of the barrel and an inner bore diameter can then be measured. Assuming self-centering during this process, the star gauge provides a useful mechanism for aligning either a camera or laser within the bore of a gun. By varying the lengths of contact pins, the star gauge could be easily adaptable to multiple guns.","A pair of coupled star gauges can be combined with the ability to expand simultaneously. The camera or laser can be attached to the star gauges to produce a bore sight capable of centering itself within the bore of a gun. Due to the reliability placed on the star gauges ability to accurately measure inner bore diameters to within ten-thousandths of an inch, this design was considered to be precise and a feasible design. This particular configuration is discarded for these purposes due to design complicity and resultant time needed for manufacture.","Various exemplary embodiments provide Step-Collet Bore Riders with a Couple. Artisans of ordinary skill will recognize that a collet constitutes a holding device\u2014specifically, a subtype of chuck\u2014that forms a collar around the object to be held and exerts a strong clamping force on the object when tightened via a tapered outer collar to hold a workpiece or a tool. Generally, a collet chuck, considered as a unit, includes a tapered receiving sleeve (often integral with the machine spindle), the collet proper (usually composed of spring steel), which is inserted into the receiving sleeve, and (often) a cap that screws over the collet, clamping it via another taper.","Typically in shop-floor terminology, the terms \u201ccollet\u201d and \u201cchuck\u201d are used in contradistinction; users describe holding a workpiece or tool with either a collet or a chuck. This usage refers to the same distinction as does a collet chuck or alternatively another type of chuck (scroll chuck, independent-jaw chuck, etc.). The terms collet and chuck are substantially interchangeable. The principle difference involves conceiving the overall chain of connection between the machine spindle and the item being attached thereto (workpiece or tool). Generally, the overall system of holding constitutes a chuck, but practically, the receiving sleeve for a collet is often integral with the machine spindle, and from the point of view of naming the parts that are added on to the spindle, they are either a collet (with or without a cap) or a chuck (such as a scroll chuck).","Components from various exemplary embodiments of the universal bore sight can be examined at  in isometric exploded views .  shows the exploded view looking somewhat aft from the fore.  shows the exploded view looking somewhat forward from the rear. A camera assembly  at the fore includes a 100 mm lens , a 2\u00d7 magnification lens , an XC-555 camera .

Artisans of ordinary skill will recognize that the camera  can be replaced with a laser-sight without departing from the scope of the invention.","The bore sight assembly also includes a wedge rod , a fore bore-rider , a rider coupler , an aft bore-rider , a helical spring , a spring pin  and a tapered wedge nut .  shows an elevation cross-sectional view of a universal bore sight assembly .

Collets are used in a metal lathe to hold irregularly sized objects while being turned in the lathe. Typically, these are made from relatively soft metal allowing for them to be machined fitting the desired size of the irregularly dimensioned object. The collets also have the unique ability to clasp objects by the partial separation into three sections. This allows the collets outer diameter to increase or decrease to some limited amount. This feature enables the collet's rim to match any diameter of the bore, while being moved throughout the gun.","By coupling two collets in tandem, end to end, provides the bore-riders sufficient support for concentric fit in the gun barrel. Also, staying within the dimensional boundary conditions of the straightness gauge, ensures the bore-riders fit throughout the bore length. This design takes advantage of cost off the shelf items, significantly reducing the cost of fabricating the exemplary designs. Commercially available collets can be purchased in a variety of sizes, enabling the device to be adaptable to multiple bore sizes.","Collets can be purchased in a variety of outer diameter sizes, allowing them to fit most guns, which gives the bore sight adaptability. The collets incorporated for the bore-riders ,  are standard items from the auto industry at about $37 apiece, and as originally purchased have rims  with 3-inch outer diameter. The exemplary bore-riders ,  were obtained by modification of Lyndex 550-003 step collets. These can be obtained from Lyndex-Nikken, Inc., 1468 Armour Blvd., Mundelein, Ill. 60060, Tel: 800-543-6237, Fax: 847-367-4815. The original outer diameter of 3.00-inch for the rim  was machined down to 2.983-inch for the 76 mm bore to be tested. Machining of the collets was accomplished by a lathe using a \u00bd-inch dowel for insertion in the channel  to inhibit rim deflection.","The distal slits  terminate prior to farthest extent of the threads , which are set to 1.238-inch male. The coupling  is configured to correspond with female threads . The coupling  includes an external rim  having an outer diameter, a distal inner diameter (both ends) terminating in the flat shoulder  perpendicular to longitudinal axis, and the annular chamber  of \u00bd-inch diameter to enable the rod  to slide through. The rod  terminates at the fore with the flare  and the button protrusion . The rod  terminates at the aft end with the lateral orifice  to receive the pin  (to adjust spring tension) and an elongated threaded extension for the nut  with a radial 5\u00b0 wedge. The nut  unscrews to remove the rod  from the assembly of bore-riders ,  and couple .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","395","810","810","815","265","275","270","820","215","445","265","830","215","830","250","835","440","360","260","820","445","265","410","450","850","855"]},"Loop cable portions  and  join together through a slit  of the aft bore-rider  extending rearward to a rear control cable .

The front cable  follows the assembly package  through the barrel , and terminates at the handle . An operator at the breech  of the gun controls the rear cable , enabling the operator to pull the assembly package  through the gun bore during installation of the assembly package  by pulling the handle , and subsequently apply tensile force  to the cables  and  when removing the assembly package .","The tensile force  applied to the rear cable  can be used to secure the bore-rider assembly  in position from the handle , while the front cable  applies an opposite tensile force  to the module assembly  from the handle , which dislodges the aft-facing wedges from their respective channels  of the corresponding bore-riders , . Once dislodged, the rims  of the bore-riders ,  relieve to their initial diameter and for extraction of the assembly package  from the gun bore. The front and module cables ,  loop around aft of the module assembly , following the assembly package  into the gun bore during installation.","An operator at the muzzle  can subsequently pull the assembly package  out of the barrel . Alternatively, the operator can disengage the bore riders ,  by pulling the module assembly  away from the bore-rider assembly , while maintaining the assembly package  within the barrel . The camera module cable  also follows the assembly package  through the muzzle  as a precautionary measure to enable additional force being applied for removing the assembly package  from the barrel .","Pulling the breech cable handle  rearward away from the breech , enables the assembly package  to traverse the bore from the muzzle  to the origin  of gun. Pulling either muzzle cable handle  or  forward away from the muzzle  (from forward of the gun) enables the assembly package  to traverse the bore towards the gun's muzzle . Engaging the bore-rider rims  against the bore requires the breech cable handle  be held in tension.","The muzzle cable handle  pulls until module assembly  separates from the bore-rider assembly . The spring  contacting the center of the inner shoulder  of the couple  inhibits further motion of the muzzle cable handle , which releases in response to achieve the spring-loaded position, thereby causing the module assembly  to spring back into the bore-rider assembly . This action forces the flare  and the nut  against the channels , thereby radially expanding the rims  to conform to and fit against the bore.","The bore-rider assembly  secures and aligns the assembly package  within the barrel  by expanding their outer rims  until tightly pressed radially against the bore. This is accomplished by pressing the bore-riders  and  axially by the flare  and nut , respectively at the fore and aft of the rod . The nut  secures to the aft end of the rod  by a threaded connection, thereby enabling the nut  to self-align along the longitudinal axis of the bore sight as the male screw threads  of the aft bore rider  rotates into female screw threads  of the couple . This process ensures that the both the flare  on the rod  and the nut  together contact the corresponding channels  on their respective bore-riders ,  concurrently. Maintaining simultaneous contact with bore-riders ,  ensures equal expansion and concentric fit within the bore of the barrel .","Removal of the secured bore-riders ,  from the channel , requires the forces applied by the nut  and the flare  be displaced from their interference-fit positions merely by pulling the rod  out away from the bore-rider assembly . Within the barrel , this task can be accomplished with the two control cables  and , the rear cable  looped around the aft bore-rider  and the forward cable  looped around the fore bore-rider  past the aft portion of the module assembly .","The rear cable  attached to bore-rider  provides a resistive force as the module assembly  pulls away from the bore-rider assembly , therefore displacing the rod , relieving pressure against the bore-rider assembly . Upon release, the outer rims  of the bore-riders ,  return to their original diameter (neutral state) to provide sufficient clearance for smooth removal of the bore sight assembly  from the bore of the gun barrel . The nut  secures to the rod  with a 0.375-16-2B--readily being screwed on or off.","The muzzle terminals of entry for a bore sight device determines facility for traversing through the bore. Depending on the gun design, entering from the breech  requires only a short distance to be traveled before final position is reached at the origin  of bore. There, the bore-riders ,  only encounter a small portion of rifling; extremely tight tolerances may be used without the possibility of the device jamming due to fowling of the barrel  from fired rounds. However, installing the bore-sight assembly  from the breech  requires extruding video and power cables through the complicated machinery used to operate the gun. In many cases, to access the breech  of a gun is impractical for operational applications.","Therefore, considering the design of the universal bore sight, insertion from the muzzle  is the most accessible choice of entry, involving less time to integrate the device within the origin  of bore. However, inner diameter changes along the length of the barrel , which introduces altering tight tolerance for the bore-rider through the inconsistencies of the bore. Although, moving the bore sight device through the muzzle  may be difficult, this represents the only practical point of entry to the origin  of bore.","Due to the accessibility of 76 mm barrels, an analysis of bore diameters was accomplished using data obtained from the star gauge, showing that a newly manufactured barrel changes one-thousandths of an inch from the muzzle  to the origin  of bore. In addition, naval regulations permit some increase in bore diameter at the muzzle . From these data, the bore-riders ,  can be adapted to a variety of bore diameters to ensure concentricity and accurate gun alignment.","Placement of the bore sight at the origin  of bore depends on whether barrel droop extent suffices to introduce unacceptable error into tests. The error occurs under conditions of the bore sight mounted at the muzzle aligns the gun lower than the gun's actual aim point. A straightness gauge can be used to ensure that barrel droop remains within appropriate limits. The straightness gauge used for a 76 mm gun has the diameter of 75.92\u00b10.03 mm, length of 330.2 mm, and straightness of \u00b10.03 mm. The bore-riders ,  are designed within those limits to ensure uninterrupted movement of the bore sight throughout the bore of the 76 mm gun.","The flare  provides the compression to slam against the assembly to expand the rims  and wedge them in the barrel  of the gun being aligned. The flare  contacts the fore bore-rider . To set the assembly package  into position, the rod  is pulled forward and released \u2014the spring  provides the tension force to ram the rod  rearward so that the flare  engages the edge of the channel  of the fore bore-rider . The force is provided by the cables ,  connected to fore bore-rider  behind the module assembly . The rear cable  prevents the assembly package  from being pulled out of the bore, while the fore cable  provides tensile force. Upon relieving tensile force on the front cable , the rod  springs back into bore-rider assembly .","The exemplary couple  secures the bore-riders ,  in tandem. Due to the unique threads on select exemplary collets (as modified for the bore-riders), a specialized coupling  was designed and machined. The exemplary couple  incorporates tight 1.238\u2033\u00d720 right-hand (RH) internal threads and a perpendicular resting shoulder. These qualities ensured a tight and true alignment of the bore-riders ,  as they are joined by the couple  to form the bore-rider assembly . A precise \u00bd-inch hole for the annular chamber  drilled through the couple  provides secondary support for the rod , ensuring precise alignment for attachment to the module assembly .","The exemplary rod  at \u00bd-inch diameter extends through the half-inch channels  in both rims  of the bore-riders ,  and the annular chamber  of the coupling . The rod  has tapered wedges on each end: the flare  fixed at the fore and the detachable nut  at the rear. Upon translation, these wedges concurrently contact the respective collets ,  expanding the outer diameter of their rims .","The exemplary rod  includes a \u215c-inch threaded end that facilitates precise positioning of the nut  to adjust its axial position on the rod . The rod  can be precisely machined to ensure perfect concentric fit and alignment between the flare  and module assembly . The fore button  has an axial \u00bc-inch hole  tapped in the tip  allowing for the rod  and module assembly  to be bolted together. A \u215b-inch hole can be drilled through the aft end of the rod  just ahead of the threads, enabling insertion of the spring pin , which secures the spring  that applies constant force on the rod  to maintain integration within the bore-rider assembly .","The exemplary module assembly  includes an aluminum tube  with a length of six-and-one-half inches and an outer diameter of two inches. The lenses employed for this bore sight enable the module assembly  to contain only the camera  and a partial lip of the lens . The module assembly  attaches to the wedge rod  through a concentric \u00bd-inch hole. To ensure precise alignment, the fit between both parts can be an interference fit, held together by the bolt  and washer . To ensure precise alignment of the camera and bore-riders, eight set screws  are disposed around the camera tube ; enabling fine calibration of the optical assembly.","Camera and laser analysis have been employed to select the most appropriate sensor size for providing a clear view of distant targets. Research indicated that a charge-couple device (CCD) camera provided the best video signal due to pixel's charge conversion to voltage, which can be buffered and transferred through a single node as an analog signal. Another aspect of the camera  to be determined was the sensing area and number of pixels needed for a quality picture. The smallest camera currently available with standard sensing and pixel specifications yielded a sensing area of 6.4 mm\u00d74.8 mm and pixels 768\u00d7494. Selection led to the Sony XC-555 Color CCD camera being the preferred available and cost-effective option.","The desired field of view necessary for current range testing required the camera  to view a target at 300 yards with considerable accuracy. To obtain the desired field-of-view, camera characteristics include accounting for pixel count and sensing area. Utilizing a 100 mm lens and a 2\u00d7 fixed focal length lens extender that increases the lens power to 200 mm provides a field of view of 31-feet\u00d731-feet. This enables the camera  adequate view power to observe an object \u00be-inch\u00d71.5-inch in size, which satisfies the desired field-of-view for the camera bore sight. Consequently, the outer diameter of the 100 mm lens being used is 1.927-inch, so the smallest muzzle the bore sight can be inserted into corresponds to a 57 mm gun. This gives the bore sight an adaptable range of 57 mm to a 155 mm gun barrel range. However, this range could be lowered depending on the outer diameter of the optic or laser being used.","With many lasers available on the market, selecting a preference involves small size with ability to be mounted concentrically. A tube-mounted laser facilitates calibration for mounting on a bore sight device. Helium-neon and diode lasers are the prominent choice because of their concentric placement within a tube. Due to extended range operations the laser may be preferred, necessitating a beam expander on the laser. The specific type of beam expander may be a Galilean beam expander using a Plano-Concave lens and an achromatic lens to collimate the beam for reducing the laser spot size at a given distance.","Depending on the type, both gas and diode laser presumably perform comparably in range and accuracy. With the helium-neon laser averaging \u00b11.0 mrad parallel to outer cylinder and a beam divergence of \u00b11.2 mrad. The diode laser averaging beam versus housing alignment >3 mrad and a beam divergence of >3 mrad. Although gas lasers may perform slightly better than diode lasers, there are some draw backs with their use in bore sight application. Gas lasers are considerably larger than the diode lasers, averaging around ten-inches in length by 1.74-inch in diameter. A gas laser's operational life span may also be considerably less than that of a diode lasers; averaging around 40,000 hours compared to a diode's life of 50 hours to 100,000 hours of operation. Incorporating high-performance structured light laser diode modules represents the preferred selection for adapting a laser to any bore sight device.","The camera bore sight assembly package  includes two major sections: the aft portion including the bore-riders and the fore portion that houses the sight-mount. The aft portion with the bore-rider assembly  includes bore-riders ,  that are assembled by joining two collets end-to-end in tandem with a steel couple . The fore portion consists of the module assembly  and the camera assembly . The two sections join by the center wedge rod  bolted to the module assembly .","To ensure both sections remain intact, a spring  is disposed within the extensions  of collets to secure the rod  to the coupling . The joining of both sections by the spring  provides a force to pull the module assembly  into the fore bore-rider . The spring  engages the wedges as the flare  and the nut  in corresponding channels  of their respective bore-riders , . Upon completion of the assembly package , the bore sight is ready for integration within the desired gun.","Integration process of the bore sight assembly package  to within the origin  of bore employs cables , ,  of 3\/16-inch diameter that span the length of the gun barrel . The process of integration begins by pulling the rear cable  through the barrel  by the retraction of an extendable tape measure attached to the rear handle . The rear cable  can then be secured around the aft bore-rider , with which to pull the assembly package  through the barrel . The front cable  attaches to the front handle  and around the fore bore-rider , providing bidirectional control in the barrel  for the bore sight. The module cable  can be wrapped around the module assembly  at the flare , enabling control to withdraw the bore-rider assembly  from the barrel .","To secure the bore sight within the barrel , the assembly package  is pulled to the origin  of bore and held in place by the cables , , . The camera module cable  is then pulled, separating the module assembly  from the bore-riders ,  by several inches. The module cable  is then released, causing the module assembly  to spring back lodging the wedges (flare  and nut ) into the channels  by the rod  snapping back due to the spring . This fixes the bore sight within the barrel . In the secure configuration, the gun can either be sighted in or used for target tracking.","Removing the bore sight can be accomplished by pulling the camera module cable , which separates the wedges from the channels , relieving their force. This collapses the rims  to reduce their relaxed outer diameters, returning mobility of the assembly package  within the barrel . In the release configuration, the bore sight can be readily removed from the barrel , completing the integration process.","Hardware associated with camera and laser can be translated with the bore sight along the barrel  from the muzzle  during installation. Electrical power and video-signal cables can extend from the point of entry at the muzzle  to the bore sight. Cables can be attached to exterior surfaces of the gun, enabling the gun to slue about without concern of damaging any connection that may exist between video monitors and bore sight.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1010","1020","1030","1010","1040","1050","1060","1040"]},"Testing was conducted in order to determine the alignment of the bore-riders within the bore of the 76 mm gun. This involved mounting the mirror  on the front face of the bore-riders and measuring concentricity with the autocollimator , which constitutes an optical instrument used to measure angles by projecting a reticle on a surface of the mirror  and measuring the displacement of the return image.","The experimental setup included the 76 mm barrel , mirror mount , mirror , bore riders, and autocollimator . The bore-riders were disposed within the muzzle of the 76 mm barrel , the mirror  mounted on the front face of the bore-riders with a screw, and then aligning the autocollimator's image on the mirror . After alignment, the return image was viewable from the optical objective on the rear side of the autocollimator . To determine alignment, the bore-riders remained not engaged, leaving two-thousandths of an inch clearance between the bore-riders and the bore. The clearance permitted free rotation, which revealed an area-of-run out between the two reticles. Further testing was conducted by sliding the bore-riders down the entire length of the 76 mm gun barrel  to identify any error that might occur throughout the barrel.","Test results indicated a one-arc-minute displacement, as the bore-riders were being rotated, and no displacement as the bore-riders were translated (without rotation) throughout the bore length. This indicates that for the gun to be sighted in on a target at 300 yards, there would be a three-inch misalignment on the target. However, the displacement is expected to significantly diminish upon engagement of the bore-riders, which centers them within the bore. Further testing may include mounting the camera in the bore sight and measuring alignment with a similar process as mentioned previously.","Various embodiments described configure the initially fabricated bore sight for use with a camera. However, future adaptabilities include mounting a laser in lieu of the camera for quick target alignment. Other prospects include mounting a wide-angle lens on the camera to enable the bore sight to be transformed into a bore scope.","This would provide gun crews the ability to quickly inspect the bore for any indications of wear on the lands or chrome lining. The bore sight can also be adapted to smaller guns depending on the size of lens needed for target alignment. Artisans of ordinary skill will recognize that these represent only exemplary embodiments for modifications, and that others can be envisioned without departing from the scope of the claims to enable the bore sight adaptability to various guns by precise and interchangeable bore riders.","Various exemplary embodiments provide an adaptable bore sight capable of fitting at any linear position within multiple sized gun bores. The device has the capability of mounting either a laser or camera for target alignment. The incentive for such a design developed from the error introduced in conventional muzzle-mounted bore sights. Due to barrel droop, muzzle mounted bore sights align the gun to fire higher than intended. Disposal of the bore sight at the origin of bore rather than the muzzle reduces error associated with barrel droop, thereby drastically improving gun alignment on targets.","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is, therefore, to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and various other features and aspects of various exemplary embodiments will be readily understood with reference to the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like or similar numbers are used throughout, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A and 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
