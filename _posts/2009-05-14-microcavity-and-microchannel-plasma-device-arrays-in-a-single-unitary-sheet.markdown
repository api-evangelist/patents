title: Microcavity and microchannel plasma device arrays in a single, unitary sheet
abstract: An array of microcavity plasma devices is formed in a unitary sheet of oxide with embedded microcavities or microchannels and encapsulated metal driving electrodes isolated by oxide from the microcavities or microchannels and arranged so as to generate sustain a plasma in the embedded microcavities or microchannels upon application of time-varying voltage when a plasma medium is contained in the microcavities or microchannels.

No. 61\/127,559, filed May 14, 2008.","This invention was made with government support under contract no. FA9550-07-1-003 awarded by Air Force Office of Scientific Research. The government has certain rights in the invention.","A field of the invention is microcavity plasma devices. Another field of the invention is microchannel plasma devices.","Microcavity plasma devices produce a nonequilibrium, low temperature plasma within, and essentially confined to, a cavity having a characteristic dimension d below approximately 500 \u03bcm, and preferably substantially smaller, down to about 10 \u03bcm (at present). Such microplasma devices provide properties that differ substantially from those of conventional, macroscopic plasma sources. Because of their small physical dimensions, microplasmas normally operate at gas (or vapor) pressures considerably higher than those accessible to macroscopic devices. For example, microplasma devices with a cylindrical microcavity having a diameter of 200-300 \u03bcm (or less) are capable of operation at rare gas (as well as Nand other gases tested to date) pressures up to and beyond one atmosphere.","Such high pressure operation is advantageous. An example advantage is that, at these higher pressures, plasma chemistry favors the formation of several families of electronically-excited molecules, including the rare gas dimers (Xe, Kr, Ar, . . . ) and the rare gas-halides (such as XeCl, ArF, and KrF) that are known to be efficient emitters of ultraviolet (UV), vacuum ultraviolet (VUV), and visible radiation. This characteristic, in combination with the ability of microplasma devices to operate in a wide range of gases or vapors (and combinations thereof), offers emission wavelengths extending over a broad spectral range. Furthermore, operation of the plasma in the vicinity of atmospheric pressure minimizes the pressure differential across the packaging material when a microplasma device or array is sealed. Operation at atmospheric pressure also allows for arrays of microplasmas to serve as microchemical reactors not requiring the use of vacuum pumps or associated hardware.","Research by the present inventors and colleagues at the University of Illinois has resulted in new microcavity and microchannel plasma device structures as well as applications. Recent work has resulted in microcavity and microchannel plasma devices that are easily and inexpensively formed in metal\/metal oxide (e.g., Al\/AlO) structures by simple anodization processes. Large-scale manufacturing of microplasma device arrays benefits from structures and fabrication methods that reduce cost and increase reliability. Of particular interest in this regard are the electrical interconnections between devices in a large array as well as the reproducible formation of electrodes having a precisely-controlled geometry.","The metal-metal oxide microplasma device arrays developed prior to the present invention have been formed by joining at least two sheets. Each separate sheet, e.g. a foil or screen, contains one of the two required driving electrodes for generating plasmas. These prior arrays work very well, but having two sheets typically requires alignment and bonding of the two pieces, and especially so if addressable arrays are to be formed. Precision alignment becomes challenging and potentially costly when the alignment error must be a small fraction of the microcavity cross-sectional dimension (typically 10-200 \u03bcm). Also, the bonding of separate electrode sheets can reduce the array lifetime because bonding increases the probability for electrical breakdown along the surface of one of the electrode.","An embodiment of the invention is an array of microcavity plasma devices formed in a unitary sheet of oxide with embedded microcavities or microchannels and encapsulated metal driving electrodes isolated by oxide from the microcavities or microchannels and arranged so as to generate and sustain a plasma in the embedded microcavities or microchannels upon application of time-varying voltage when a plasma medium is contained in the microcavities or microchannels.","Embodiments of the invention provide arrays of metal\/metal oxide microplasma devices, including both microcavity and microchannel devices, that integrate complete driving (sustain) electrodes, electrical connections and microcavities and\/or microchannels in a single, unitary sheet. Arrays of the invention can be fabricated by a simple and inexpensive wet chemical process. With complete microcavities\/microchannels, driving electrodes, and interconnects in a unitary sheet, the difficulty of precisely aligning two separate sheets is eliminated, thereby simplifying the fabrication process. Large arrays of microplasma devices of the invention can be formed, and are suitable for many applications, such as lighting, displays, photomedicine, sterilization, and UV curing.","An embodiment of the invention is an array of microcavity plasma devices formed in a unitary sheet of oxide with embedded microcavities or microchannels and encapsulated metal driving electrodes isolated by oxide from the microcavities or microchannels and arranged so as to generate sustain a plasma in the embedded microcavities or microchannels upon application of time-varying voltage when a plasma medium (gase(es) or vapor(s) is contained in the microcavities or microchannels.","Embodiments of the invention provide monolithic sheets including arrays of micoplasma devices in which the electric field lines do not pass through a sheet-sheet interface to the second electrode. Arrays of the invention exhibit enhanced reliability and lifetime.","Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be discussed with respect to the drawings.

Features may be exaggerated in the drawings for emphasis, and features may not be to scale.

As noted above, the electrodes appear in  as a thin, crescent moon-shaped region lying below each barrier \u201crib\u201d between the microchannels. These thin electrodes are able to drive microplasmas in the microchannels. In preferred methods of fabrication, the electrodes automatically form with a taper at the edges. This taper advantageously minimizes edge effects, thereby lowering the possibility for electrical breakdown of the dielectric and damaging of the arrays.","The  array  can be addressed by driving pairs of electrodes separately. This has been demonstrated in prototype microchannel devices. A voltage V is applied across the electrodes associated with (lying adjacent to) a given microchannel  to excite a plasma in that microchannel. In the experimental microchannel arrays, electrodes  of  extend out (are \u201crun out\u201d to the opposite sides of the array) to facilitate electrical connection. The applied voltage V is time-varying and can be, for example, sinusoidal, triangular, or pulsed (unipolar or bipolar). Example prototype addressable arrays of microchannel plasma devices have been operated in several hundred Torr of Ne as well as other rare gases. Addressability of these arrays has also been demonstrated\u2014if the two electrodes associated with a particular channel are not energized, no plasma is formed with that channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3H","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3C","FIG. 3C","FIG. 3D","FIG. 3E","FIG. 3F","FIG. 3G","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 3H"],"b":["20","20","14","20","14","24","20","20","10","14","12","10","14","10","12"],"i":"a.
