{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates generally to mobile devices, and, more particularly, to systems, methods, and apparatus to measure mobile device usage.","Usage of multiple devices with multimedia capabilities, such as smartphones, has significantly increased over the past several years. According to eMarketer, \u201cIn 2011, 68.2% of US Internet users, or 158.1 million people, will be watching video online at least once a month. By 2015, 76% of the Internet audience, or 195.5 million people, will be viewing video regularly online . . . . For 2011, eMarketer estimates that the group with the highest level of online video penetration will be the 25-to-34-year-old segment, at 19.5% of this population. Penetration will be almost as high among younger adults ages 18 to 24 (15.7%) and those 35 to 44 and 45 to 54 (16.7% and 15.7%, respectively). Among internet users\u2014the part of the population naturally most interested in online video\u2014the video viewing audience is young: 82% of teen internet users and 87% of young adults ages 18 to 24 currently watch online video at least once a month. Growth will continue among all age groups through 2015, to reach 93% of all young adult internet users and 42% of all seniors\u201d (Reese, Stephanie. \u201cStat of the Day: 68.2% of US Internet Audience Are Online Video Viewers.\u201d eMarketer. http:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/blog\/index.php\/stat-day-682-internet-audience-online-video-viewers\/.2011-02-18).","Modern mobile device operating systems, such as Android\u2122, iOS\u00ae, and Windows Phone\u2122 7, enable users to listen to music, watch videos, surf the Internet, communicate via voice calls, and otherwise obtain and\/or consume information. Much of this content is offered free to the user in exchange for the user agreeing to be exposed to advertisements on the mobile device. As used herein, \u201conline information\u201d refers collectively and\/or individually to content and\/or advertising. Monitoring such exposure to online information enables advertisers to better understand the needs of consumers and to provide more relevant advertising. Known methods of monitoring usage of mobile devices may be difficult to implement on certain types of devices due to strict controls on the types of software that can be installed on such devices. Additionally or alternatively, known methods of monitoring usage may be prohibitively expensive to implement due to the many different types of models of devices now available and in development. Further, known methods of monitoring usage of mobile activities may be difficult or impossible on some or all mobile devices due to the lack of a public application programming interface (API) with which to interact with the mobile devices and the attendant adaptation required to monitor such a wide range of device types.","Example systems, methods, and apparatus disclosed herein overcome deficiencies of the prior art by using a first mobile device application to filter a debug log file stored on a mobile device to obtain debug file entries, and using filtered debug file entries to determine usage of the mobile device. In some examples, the debug log file is updated by at least one of an operating system of the mobile device or a second mobile device application different from the first mobile device application.","In some examples, the mobile device sends the filtered debug log file to a server. The server receives filtered log files for a plurality of mobile devices, such as the mobile devices of users statistically selected for a mobile device monitoring panel.","In some examples, the mobile device sends a debug log file to a server. In some such examples, the mobile device does not filter the debug log file and, instead, sends the debug log file in its entirety. The server determines usage information from debug messages in the debug log file and writes the usage information to a usage information file.","In some other examples, a central processing server receives debug log files from at least a first mobile device of a first type and a second mobile device of a second type different from the first type. The central processing server processes the debug log files to do one or more of: determine one or more of usage patterns for one or more of the devices and\/or device types; assign audience characteristics to one or more of the types of mobile devices; map audience compositions to content and\/or advertisements; and\/or assign ratings to websites.","While example systems, methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture are discussed herein with reference to mobile devices such as smartphones, the example systems, methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture may also be used to monitor devices that use similar operating systems and\/or similar debug mechanisms. For example, the systems, methods, apparatus, and\/or articles of manufacture disclosed herein may be used to monitor DVD players, CD players, digital video recorders, televisions, Blu-ray players, gaming consoles, personal video recorders, set top boxes, Internet appliances, digital media players (e.g., MP3 players), tablet computers, and\/or combinations thereof, running the Android or other mobile operating systems and\/or that use similar debug mechanisms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","102","104","106","110","102","104","108","106","110","108"]},"The example mobile device  of  includes a processor  and a storage device . The example processor  may be any type of mobile processor, such as mobile processors available from ARM, Intel\u00ae, Samsung\u00ae, Apple\u00ae, Qualcomm\u00ae, and\/or others. The example storage device  of  is a mobile storage device, such as NAND flash memory or another type of solid state storage device that may be used on a mobile device.","The example processor  of  executes an operating system  and one or more applications . The operating system  of  is the Android mobile operating system, although other operating systems may alternatively be used. The example applications  may be downloaded to the example mobile device  from, for example, an application store (also referred to as \u201capp stores,\u201d \u201capp markets,\u201d etc.) and\/or one or more of the applications  may be included and\/or integrated with the operating system .","During operation (e.g., code execution), the example operating system  and the example applications  store messages to a debug log file  stored in the storage device . For example, some developers choose to add debug code that causes the applications  to generate and store the debug messages, which can facilitate later improvement of the applications . As used herein, the term \u201cdebug message\u201d refers to messages stored in any type of debug log and does not necessarily refer to any particular level or priority of message (e.g., it may include but is not limited to the DEBUG level as used in the Android operating system). Instead, the term \u201cdebug message\u201d may refer to any level or priority (or no level or priority) of message stored in a debug log or a log having a similar design and\/or purpose on a mobile device. A \u201cdebug log\u201d is a log intended to store messages and\/or information which may be used to review device and\/or software performance (e.g., to diagnose errors and\/or other problems in a device, its hardware, its firmware, and\/or its software).","The example processor  of the illustrated example also executes instructions to implement a mobile device monitor . The example mobile device monitor  of the illustrated example monitors user interactions with the mobile device . Example interactions that may be identified by the mobile device monitor  include watching videos, listening to music, web browsing, exposure to advertisements, and\/or playing games, although other interactions may also be monitored. To monitor these and\/or other interactions, the example mobile device monitor  accesses the debug log file , into which the operating system  and one or more applications  have stored debug messages.","In the illustrated example, the mobile device monitor  is downloaded or otherwise provided to the mobile device  when a user of the mobile device  elects or is selected to participate in an audience measurement panel. An audience measurement panel includes a statistically selected group of individuals and\/or families who have agreed to participate in the panel by providing, for example, media and\/or advertisement exposure data. In the example of , panelist members have agreed to provide their demographic information and to have their mobile device activities, usage, and\/or interactions monitored. In some examples, when individuals join a panel, they provide detailed information concerning their identity and demographics (e.g., gender, race, income, home location, occupation, etc) to an audience measurement entity (e.g., central processing server ) tracking that panel.","In the example of , the mobile device monitor  periodically, aperiodically, on request, and\/or in response to a condition being present (or absent), filters the debug messages in the example debug log file  to identify debug messages of interest, and transmits the debug messages of interest to a central data processing facility, such as the central processing server , for further processing and\/or aggregation with usage information from other mobile devices . Examples of debug messages of interest include debug messages that are stored by music applications, video and\/or movie applications, games, browser applications, and\/or operating system functions such as activating or deactivating a phone speaker on the mobile device . However, different debug messages than the previously-referenced messages may additionally or alternatively be used to determine user interaction information. Additionally, debug messages may be used alone or in combination with other messages to infer user interactions with the mobile device .","In some examples, the debug log file  is a persistent file stored on the storage device . In some such examples, the operating system  does not purge or clear messages from the debug log file  or purges messages after a substantial amount of time has passed. Such infrequent purging of the debug log file  may cause the mobile device monitor  to process the same messages multiple times. Filtering and\/or transmitting the same debug messages in the persistent debug log file  multiple times could cause data inaccuracies and\/or substantially slow the performance of the mobile device monitor  (and, thus, the mobile device ). The mobile device monitor  avoids duplication of filtering by, for example, storing an indication of which messages in the debug log file  have been previously filtered and\/or transmitted. Example indications may include storing an indication in the debug log file  or storing an indication in another location. The example indication may indicate the most recently-processed message and\/or a timestamp of the most recent processing performed by the mobile device monitor . The indication may be, for example, a debug message.","The example mobile device  of  further includes one or more wireless interface(s) . The example processor , the example operating system , the example applications , and\/or the example mobile device monitor  of  use the example wireless interface(s)  to communicate with other devices and systems. For example, the wireless interface(s)  may include a cellular radio in the mobile device, a wireless local area network (WLAN) connection (e.g., a WiFi connection), a Bluetooth connection, a near field communications (NFC) connection, and\/or any other past, present, or future wireless communications interface. Further, the example mobile device  may include a wired interface  such as a universal serial bus (USB) port, an IEEE 1394 (e.g., FireWire) port, and\/or other wired interfaces. Other components of the example mobile device  have been omitted from  for brevity or they are not germane to the present disclosure.","The example mobile device monitor  of  determines which debug messages in the debug log file  are messages of interest based on message definitions  stored in the example storage device . The message definitions  provide a framework (e.g., prototype, pattern, etc.) for each type of message that may provide information of interest (e.g., user interaction information). The message definitions  of  are periodically updated to reflect changes in debug messages stored by applications  and\/or the mobile device operating system , and\/or to include additional debug messages for applications  that are newly available (for a particular device or in general). The example message definitions  may be downloaded by the example mobile device monitor  via a data connection with a definition update server  via the example network  and the example wireless interface  or the wired interface  of . In some other examples, the message definitions  are included in the code of the mobile device monitor  and\/or are updated when the mobile device monitor  application is updated.","The example central processing server  of  receives filtered debug logs from multiple mobile devices , . The central processing server  aggregates the filtered debug logs and generates report(s) . For example, a requester may want to know how particular mobile devices (e.g., certain models) are used, how users of mobile devices that fit into particular demographics use their mobile devices, what types of mobile devices are used the most for particular activities, and\/or any other combination of usage information. The report(s)  may be based on a request and\/or based on one or more predetermined and\/or standard queries.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["122","202","204","202","120","120","122"]},"The example log filter  of  filters the debug log file  to identify debug messages of interest. For example, a message definition may be a pattern with which the example log filter  parses and\/or examines one or more debug messages in the debug log file . The example log filter  provides debug messages of interest (e.g., messages that conform to one or more message definitions) to the filtered log reporter  and discards (e.g., does not provide to the filtered log reporter ) other debug messages. The filtered log reporter  transmits one or more files of the debug messages of interest as filtered log files  to a central processor (e.g., the central processing server  of ). For example, the filtered log reporter  may establish a voice connection or a data connection with the server  via wired and\/or wireless communications interface (e.g., the wireless interface  of ). On establishing a connection with the server , the example filtered log reporter  uploads the filtered log file  including the debug messages filtered by the log filter .","In some examples, the log filter  and the filtered log reporter  filter the debug log messages and\/or transmit the filtered log(s)  in response to the passage of a threshold amount of time. In some other examples, the log filter  and the filtered log reporter  filter the debug log messages and\/or transmit the filtered log(s)  when the debug log file  and\/or the filtered log file  achieve a threshold size.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 9","FIG. 6"],"b":["106","106","900"]},"The example server  of  includes a log file aggregator , a log parser , one or more storage devices , and a report generator . The server  receives multiple filtered log files , , from one or more mobile devices (e.g., the mobile devices ,  of ). The example filtered log files -may include filtered log files from a single mobile device covering mobile device usage during multiple intervals and\/or may include filtered log files from multiple mobile devices covering mobile device usage during identical, substantially identical, overlapping, and\/or distinct, non-overlapping intervals.","The example log file aggregator  of  receives the filtered log files -(e.g., via the network  of ) and aggregates the filtered log files -into one or more aggregated log files . The aggregated log files  are stored on the storage device(s) . In some examples, the log file aggregator  generates and\/or maintains a single (e.g., master) aggregated log file . Additionally or alternatively, the log file aggregator  maintains different aggregated log files , which may be organized by device type, time interval, activity, debug message type, and\/or any other organization scheme. Further, the contents of different aggregated log files  may overlap.","The example log parser  of  parses the debug messages in the aggregated log file(s)  stored in the storage device(s)  to, for example, determine usage information from the debug messages. The log parser  of the illustrated example extracts the usage information from the debug messages. In the example of , extracted usage information is more concise and clear than complete debug message(s) from which the information is extracted. For example, the log parser  may parse the following debug message:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"\u201c05-26 18:43:29.991: INFO\/MediaPlayer(3731): URL is:"},{"entry":"http:\/\/v21.lscache5.googlevideo.com\/videoplayback?app=youtube_gdata&clie"},{"entry":"nt=mvapp-android-"},{"entry":"verizon&devKey=ATEU_r3RX2afGwq_gCqiS2UO88HsQjpE1a8d1GxQnGD"},{"entry":"m&el=standard&expire=1309045275&id=72889325bafd9b4e&ip=0.0.0.0&ip"},{"entry":"bits=0&itag=18&key=yta1&signature=8FA065AC595B07B60722686BC0D8"},{"entry":"C2073029EA5F.7C2224F5D5E3D7ACD2DBA67BF3724A1FF9BAF4A8&s"},{"entry":"params=id,itag,uaopt,ip,ipbits,expire&uaopt=no-save\u201d"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"05:26:11\/18:43:29.991","YouTube","Device10231"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The example entry provided above lists the extracted timestamp for the debug message (05:26:11\/18:43:29.991), the application (YouTube), and an assigned and\/or arbitrary device identifier (Device10231) to identify from which of a plurality of mobile devices ,  a particular debug messages was received. In some examples, the log parser  is provided with decryption information (e.g., a decryption key) to decrypt information in a URL so that the log parser  may further determine, from the debug message, a title or other information for content that was logged as accessed (or requested) by the application.
