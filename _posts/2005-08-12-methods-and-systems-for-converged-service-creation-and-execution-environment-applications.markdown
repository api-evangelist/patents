No. 6,981,263 entitled METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR CONVERGED SERVICE CREATION AND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT APPLICATIONS and is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to integrated data networks. More particularly, embodiments of the present invention relate to methods and systems for converged service creation environment applications.","A known communications system architecture is described in the Telecommunications Information Networking Architecture Consortium (\u201cTINA-C\u201d) document entitled \u201cOverall Concepts and Principles of TINA,\u201d version 1.0, issued Feb. 17, 1995 (hereinafter the \u201cTINA overview\u201d). The overall TINA architecture can include a service architecture having a session model, a network architecture related to transport networks, and a computing architecture having a distributed processing environment (DPE) architecture.","The TINA overview describes a service session concept, where the \u201csession\u201d is defined as representing \u201ca temporal period during which activities are carried out with the purpose of achieving a goal.\u201d Four types of sessions are identified: (i) a service session that represents a single activation of a service, (ii) a user session that represents a single user's interaction with a service session; (iii) a communications session that represents the connections associated with a service session; and (iv) an access session that represents a user's attachment to a system and the user's involvement in services.","A service session, as described by the TINA overview, is a single activation of a service that relates users of the service together so that they can interact. The TINA service session can be controlled at least in part by a TINA service session manager, which offers two types of operational interfaces: (a) a generic session control interface that allows users to join and leave a service session; and (b) service specific operations that are dictated by the capabilities offered by service logic of the service session.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["21","22","31","32","100","110","11","12","51","52","31","21","21","21","100","11","21","100","100","22","22","22","32","32","100","100","12","100","100","110","111","51","52","111","100","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["220","230","270","260","260","240","260","250","220","240","240","250","220","220","250","240"]},"Application server  can be coupled to softswitches  to provide a service creation platform. Examples of services that can be created and managed by application server  include Internet call waiting, a multimedia conferencing, click-to-dial, and so forth. A media server  can also be coupled to application server  and to network  to provide audio announcements with respect to service applications. For example, a media server  can provide announcements to users in setting up a conference bridge for a conference call. Media server  can also send audio and\/or video streams to one or more users and\/or IP endpoints. In an embodiment, the signaling between softswitch  and signaling gateway  can be ISUP (integrated services digital network user part) signaling, TALI (transport adaptive layer interface) signaling, SIGTRAN (signaling transport) signaling, and so on. Media gateway  can be a Media Gateway Control Protocol (\u201cMGCP\u201d or \u201cMegaco\u201d) compliant gateway, and signaling between softswitch  and media gateway  can be MGCP\/Megaco signaling. Communications between data network  and media server  or media gateways  can be RTP (realtime transport protocol) communications. Communications between application server  and softswitches  can be according to the Session Initiation Protocol (\u201cSIP\u201d).","The AIN\/SS7 service creation and execution environment (\u201cSCE\u201d) illustrated in , however, is not adequate for broadband and hybrid messaging services. A softswitch  is a voice-oriented call processing engine. Softswitch  can behave as a PSTN\/IP service creation bridge that allows narrowband service creation (e.g., with IP connectivity via the protocol adaption layer). For converged broadband and\/or hybrid messaging services, a softswitch call model is not adequate. Also, converged services with flexible billing (e.g., bill by the minute, bill based on throughput, etc.) and\/or user-specified Quality of Service (\u201cQoS\u201d) can not be adequately provided by the softswitch call model. Moreover, a softswitch does not provide session control at the service level, and softswitch vendors typically have different architectures and proprietary Application Programming Interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d). A large base of hybrid services exist in the IP domain currently, and that base is increasing. Converged service creation, user-specified QoS, and flexible billing can become key service differentiators for communications service providers (e.g., regional communications service providers, data communications service providers, long-distance communications service providers, and so on). In view of the foregoing, it can be appreciated that a substantial need exists for methods and systems for converged service creation environment applications.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to methods and systems for converged service creation environment applications. According to an embodiment of the present invention, a system includes an application server, where the application server is coupled to an application. One or more open application programming interfaces are coupled to the application server, and service session management logic is also coupled to the application server.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, methods and systems provide for a converged service creation environment (\u201cCSCE\u201d) applications. The integrated data network can include an ATM network, an IP network, an MPLS network or a combination thereof. The integrated data network can include and\/or be coupled to a PSTN network that includes an AIN\/SS7 signaling network. CSCE processes can provide a vendor independent service creation and execution framework. In an embodiment, new network functional components can be easy to add, and upgrading technology without a major impact to service creation and execution can be easy. AIN service creation infrastructure can be interfaced with the CSCE infrastructure, and a service session control mechanism can facilitate converged service creation and execution. The CSCE system and processes can provide a modular, scalable and extensible architecture.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","305","300","305","320","310","305"]},"In an embodiment, the NGN service control complex  can establish a common converged service creation and execution platform. It can provide open APIs to support third party e-commerce applications. Support for traditional class 4\/5 services and value-added narrowband services can also be supported. In an embodiment, the NGN service control complex  interacts with application service servers (e.g., network resource service servers) that provide broadband services and can control end user CPEs\/IADs (customer premises equipment\/integrated access devices) that receive network services. The NGN service control complex , in an embodiment, can coordinate network service components and allow component level service interactions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["260","270"]},"AIN\/SS7 signaling network  can be coupled to and\/or include a Service Control Point (\u201cSCP\u201d) . SCP  includes a database and supplies the translation and routing data needed to deliver advanced network services. AIN\/SS7 signaling network  can also be coupled to Service Switching Point (\u201cSSP\u201d) . In an embodiment, SSP  is a PSTN switch that can recognize intelligent network (\u201cIN\u201d) calls and route and connect the calls under the direction of an SCP. PSTN  can also be coupled to Service Node . A plurality of AIN services - can be provided via SCP . Examples of AIN services include intelligent call routing, privacy management, call-screening, and so on.","A wireless communications device  (e.g., a wireless phone, a cellular phone, wireless messaging device, and so on) can be coupled to PSTN  via base station . PSTN  can also be coupled to a telephone . A trunking gateway , a line gateway , and an H.323 gateway  can bridge the PSTN  to the data network . Communications between data network  and gateways - can be RTP communications, RTCP (real time control protocol) communications, and so forth. Trunking gateway  can be coupled to the PSTN via a trunk such as an intermachine trunk (\u201cIMT\u201d). Line gateway  can be coupled to the PSTN via an interface such as a primary rate interface (\u201cPRI\u201d) and\/or a plain old telephone service (\u201cPOTS\u201d) interface. H.323 gateway  can be coupled to the PSTN via a PRI.","Data network  can be coupled to a subscriber premises via a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (\u201cDSLAM\u201d)  and a residential gateway . Residential gateway (\u201cRGW\u201d)  can be a MGCP\/Megaco compliant gateway. In an embodiment, the subscriber premises can include a home networking system  (e.g., a Home Phoneline Networking Alliance (\u201cHPNA\u201d) network, an Ethernet network, a wireless network, etc.) coupled to residential gateway . Data network  can also be coupled to a subscriber premises via the Internet  and an IP telephony system . The IP telephony system can communicate using an H.323 standard or SIP.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to data communications via one or more networks. The data communications can be carried by communications channels of the one or more networks. A network can include wired communication links (e.g., coaxial cable, copper wires, optical fibers, and so on), wireless communication links (e.g., satellite communication links, terrestrial wireless communication links, wireless LANs, and so on), or a combination thereof.","Softswitch  can include an Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) , which can be a Java Telephony API (\u201cJTAPI\u201d), a SIP API, a Java AIN API (\u201cJAIN\u201d), a combination thereof, and so on. Softswitch  can also include a one or more protocol stacks such as an SS7 protocol stack , a MCGP\/Megaco protocol stack , an H.323 protocol stack , a SIP protocol stack , and so on. Using the one or more protocol stacks, the softswitch  can perform generalized call processing for each of the protocol stacks, and calls and services can be delivered to a POTS telephone using the SS7 protocol stack, to an H.323 device using the H.323 protocol stack, to a SIP phone using the SIP protocol stack, and so on.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a converged service creation environment is provided. Known softswitches typically include a call processing engine that is based largely on a PSTN domain call processing engine and that handles only narrow band services. For example, PSTN domain call processing includes sending signaling messages on one or more SSPS, circuit creation and determining whether there is a call reject, no response, busy indication, etc. In an embodiment of the present invention, signaling for converged services creation is provided. For example, to deliver a movie via a broadband network to a home networking environment, the signaling involved can include notifying two parties such as the source of the movie and the destination of the movie, determining the IP address of the movie source, determining the IP address of the movie destination, and allocating of resources to stream the movie from the source to the destination.","To provide a converged services creation environment, softswitch  can be coupled to a service session manager  via a converged services creation and execution environment (\u201cCSCE\u201d) messaging bus . CSCE messaging bus  can be a Common Object Request Broker Architecture (\u201cCORBA\u201d) bus, Remote Method Invocation (\u201cRMI\u201d) bus, a JINI bus, a combination thereof, and so on. The service session manager  can be part of a converged service creation and execution platform that includes one or more open APIs  and an Application Server . Application Server  can be a UNIX-based server, a Microsoft Windowst\u00ae NT server, and so on. In an embodiment, the service session manager  is coupled via the CSCE bus  to a server farm including one or more service servers. For example, the server farm can include one or more of a third party information server , a Wireless Application Protocol (\u201cWAP\u201d) server , a home networking server , an e-mail server , a messaging server , a directory server , an Operation Administration Maintenance and Provisioning (\u201cOAMP\u201d)\/billing server , a voice recognition server , a text-to-speech server , a facsimile (\u201cfax\u201d) mail server , a voice mail server , a conference server , a media server , a Quality-of-Service (\u201cQoS\u201d)\/Policy server , a combination thereof, and so forth. The service servers of the server farm can also be coupled to the data network  and communicate with the data network  using RTP communications, RTCP communications, and so forth.","In an embodiment, a server (e.g., an application server, a service server, an application service server, a network resource server) includes a processor and a memory. A processor can be, for example, an Intel Pentium\u00ae IV processor, manufactured by Intel Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif. As another example, the processor can be an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). A server can be, for example, a UNIX server from Sun Microsystems, Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif. Memory may be a random access memory (RAM), a dynamic RAM (DRAM), a static RAM (SRAM), a volatile memory, a non-volatile memory, a flash RAM, a cache memory, a hard disk drive, a magnetic storage device, an optical storage device, a magneto-optical storage device, or a combination thereof. The memory of the server can store a plurality of instructions adapted to be executed by the processor.","Servers of the server farm can be application service provider (\u201cASP\u201d) servers that at least in part can provide services to users (e.g., subscribers, customers, etc.). The servers of the server farm can also include applications that, for example, manage aspects of delivery of services to the users. Thus, a QoS\/Policy server  can include an application that manages providing a quality of service for delivery of an application such as a media application from media server . As another example, OAMP\/billing server  can provide a billing application that manages billing related to delivery of an application such as e-mail from e-mail server , messages from messaging server , voice mail from voice mail server , conference services from conference server , and so on.","A customer profile database  and a service profile database  can also be coupled to the CSCE bus . The customer profile database  can store customer profile information such as customer name, customer service delivery information (e.g., mobile phone number, landline phone number, IP phone IP address, home networking IP address, and so forth), customer billing information, and services to which the customer has subscribed. The service profile database  can store service profile information about the various services to which a customer can subscribe. For example, the customer profile database can include a data record corresponding to a customer, where the data record identifies the customer as a subscriber of a media service and includes the customer's IP address for delivery of media application. The service profile database  can include information about the media service to which the customer has subscribed, such as information that identifies media applications of media server  to which the customer has subscribed.","Each of customer profile database  and service profile database  can be accessed by application server  of the service session manager . Application server  can store applications that interface with customers to manage delivery of application services provided at least in part by one or more of the service servers of the server farm. For example, application server  can include a generic media delivery application that can be accessed by a customer to specify delivery of one or more media services. The generic media delivery application can include specific interfaces that interface with the media applications of media server .","The service session manager  of application server  thereby provides for a modularized converged services creation and execution environment. A modularized environment can allow a service provider greater latitude in assembling a converged services creation and execution environment. Known providers of applications typically provide a unified application solution, i.e., an integrated application solution. For example, Cisco Systems of San Jose, Calif. can provide service providers with a unified messaging solution. Unified application solutions, however, are typically a proprietary solution aimed at a broad range of service providers and are not particularly designed for any particular service provider. Thus, while a service provider may ultimately select a unified application solution as the best amongst a plurality of unified application solutions, that unified application solution may not be optimized for the service provider's environment. Modularizing the delivery of application services in a converged services creation and execution environment can allow a service provider to implement discrete application solutions instead of implementing a service provider's unified application solution.","In an embodiment of the present invention, service session manager  can also include an open API  that can provide one or more open application programming interfaces to one or more web-based applications , which a customer can access via a portal . Examples of web-based applications  can include click-to-dial, click-to-show, click-to-conference, and so on. In another example, a web-based service providing the subscriber services management application can allow a subscriber to select and configure services provided by the service provider. A customer can access the portal via a network (e.g., the Internet) and can subscribe to a personal call management service that can include fax messaging, e-mail messaging, call messaging, and so on. The fax messaging service can allow a customer to indicate that a fax received from a particular fax number should be converted to an e-mail attachment and e-mailed to a particular e-mail address. As another example, the subscriber might specify to the call messaging service that a call received during a certain time period and\/or from a certain telephone number should be blocked, or forwarded to a voice mail messaging system, or forwarded to a mobile telephone number, and so on. A further example can include specifying that an e-mail message from a particular sender and\/or regarding a certain topic should be forwarded to a mobile phone number after a text-to-speech application has converted the e-mail message to a spoken message. In a still further example, a voice mail message can be converted to a text message and included in an e-mail to be sent to a specified e-mail address. These examples are merely illustrative of the types of applications that can be provided via a portal coupled to a CSCE.","In another embodiment of the present invention, open API  of service session manager  can include one or more open application programming interfaces to one or more E-center service applications  of an e-Center . For example, an e-Center  can include a call center that handles customer service calls and data processing. In an embodiment, an e-Center  can handle voice calls, voice mail messages, messaging, video calls, and other types of customer service communications.","Service session manager , in an embodiment, can manage delivery of services to and from network devices (e.g., customer data devices) coupled to a home networking system . Examples of network devices coupled to home networking system  include IP appliances (i.e., IP devices) such as an IP telephone , an IP-based refrigerator, an IP-based audio entertainment system, an IP-based microwave, an IP-based home theater, IP-based home security devices, IP-based video monitoring (e.g., babysitting monitoring, nanny monitoring, child monitoring, etc.), and so on. The home networking system can include a residential gateway  that can communicate with service session manager  for delivery of services. Operation of the IP appliances can be configured directly via the respective IP appliance or indirectly via the residential gateway . For example, operation of an IP-based alarm system can be configured to notify not only an alarm company (e.g., a monitoring center) and\/or a law enforcement authority, but also an owner and\/or resident of the alarmed property via an e-mail address, a voice mail message, a text message, and so on. The owner and\/or resident of the alarmed property can configure operation of the IP-based alarm system with respect to delivery of status information (e.g., alarms, operational status, and so on).","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the network appliances that can communicate with the service session manager  for the delivery of services can include an embedded local agent that communicates with service session manager . The embedded local agent can be a user applet that is downloaded to an IP device. In another embodiment, the embedded local agent can be downloaded to a residential gateway that is coupled to an IP device. In a further embodiment, the embedded local agent can be downloaded to a PC.","The service session manager , in an embodiment, can behave as a service broker among application servers, client devices (e.g., IP appliances), and converged services. Traditionally disjointed front-end systems (e.g., Web, call center, e-mail, fax, etc.) can be integrated by the service session manager . The service session manager  can present a unified infrastructure for customer-centric service creation and execution. Service session management and control is provided by the service session manager , and the service session manager  can include a common API to allow converged service creation and execution. The service session manager  can also provide capability controls for application servers and client devices (e.g., IP devices) and provide a portability layer to insulate the converged service creation environment form vendor-specific APIs. The softswitch  can act as a voice-oriented communication server and bridge PSTN and IP domains for call processing. In an embodiment, the softswitch  can provide connectivity control for IP devices to access network resources and services.","The server farm (e.g., one or more servers -) coupled to the service session manager  via the CSCE messaging bus  can include network resource servers. For example, messaging server  can be a network resource server. As another example, media server  can be a network resource server. The network resource servers can include self-contained service modules which register themselves with the service session manager . The network resource servers can make services available to the CSCE via COBRA, RMI or JINI technology and can be technologically transparent to the CSCE. In an embodiment of the present invention, the AIN service creation and execution platform (e.g., SCP ) is able to interact with the CSCE via TCP\/IP or other suitable communications protocols.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["400","411","412","413","530","531","530","531","400","440","530","531","441","443","45","447","452","54"]},"The service session manager  can also communicate with customer IP devices . A customer IP device  can be a PC, a residential gateway, an IP appliance, and so forth. A customer IP device  can include a user applet  and a user agent . A user applet  can be downloaded from a web-based application server (e.g., after delivery of a service has been ordered, during a setup of customer IP device , etc.). The user applet  can interact with an end user to collect the end user's service request, pass the service request to the service manager, and display the result of the service request processing to the end user.","User agent  can manage delivery of an application service to the customer IP device . For example, when the IP device  is an audio-video device, the user agent  can manage receipt of audio-video data and instructions. Examples of other user agents  include an instant messaging user agent, a unified messaging user agent, an always-on user agent, and so on.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["510","466","411","510","511","510","512","512","400","400","453","454","440","453","454","400","512","510","511","411","566","511","411","465","510","453"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["510","466","412","510","511","510","512","512","400","400","530","531","440","530","400","512","510","511","412","466","511","412","465","263","510"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["510","466","413","510","511","510","512","512","400","400","445","444","443","440","445","444","443","400","512","510","511","413","466","511","413","465","445","444","443","510"]},"In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, a CSCE environment can be a fully distributed architecture which bridges applications, network resource servers, and end-user devices. It can provide a common service control platform to allow an application to control network resource servers and end user integrated access devices (\u201cIADs\u201d) (e.g., a residential gateway, an ADSL modem; etc.) for converged services delivery through open APIs. Commercial off-the-shelf (\u201cCOTS\u201d) server technology can be used to allow growing server farms quickly, evolving server technology smoothly, and providing converged services in a seamless manner. A plurality of extensible open APIs can be utilized where each extensible open API can target a different service characteristic (e.g., broadband, narrowband, messaging, and so forth). In an embodiment, an internal API for controlling resource servers and user agents can be embedded in an IAD or a residential gateway.

Service providers and\/or subscribers can modify services (e.g., subscribe, unsubscribe) via a web interface by specifying messaging resources. For example, a service provider and\/or subscriber can use a web-based service logic definition interface to define and\/or modify a service logic on-line for each individual messaging resource.
