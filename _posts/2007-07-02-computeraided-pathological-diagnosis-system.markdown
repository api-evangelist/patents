The Government thus has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates to the field of medicine. More specifically, this invention relates a computer-aided pathological diagnosis system designed for biomarker assessment, differentiation of cancer biomarkers and identification of cancer cells in tissue based upon an image of a specimen.","Clinical lung cancer diagnosis depends upon the pathologist's interpretation of morphological features of histological and cytological specimens. These interpretations may be assisted by detection of cancer cell related moleculars to improve sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic techniques.","Molecular methods, including application of cancer-specific markers, may prove to be complementary to cytology diagnosis. Quantitative evaluation of lung carcinomas with cytoplasmic markers has been successfully investigated. Imaging technology provides an objective way for the quantitative analysis of tumor cells morphology. Current imaging practices are mostly manual, time-consuming, and tedious, yielding subjective and imprecise results. In order to improve the situation, many methods for computer-aided diagnosis of cell images have been designed. The methods including common commercial tools for computer aided morphologic image analysis utilizing region-based methods and threshold based methods. Region-based methods separate the object from the background by region growing, region splitting, and merging of regions to segment the image. Threshold-based segmentation is a simpler method based on single pixel classification. In threshold-based segmentation, a feature value such as gray level is associated with each pixel and this value is compared to the threshold to classify a pixel as an object or background. Determination of the threshold is critical; a simple method is to select the threshold as determined by a histogram. More sophisticated versions of threshold-based segmentation are also known in the art. The problem with these approaches is that they employ only local (single pixel) information.","Cellular images share the following characteristics:\n\n","Accordingly, what is needed in the art is an improved computer-aided pathological diagnosis system and method for the classification of cancer cells in a tissue specimen that overcomes the deficiencies of the prior art systems and methods.","In accordance with the present invention is provided, a computer-aided pathological diagnosis method for the classification of cancer cells in a tissue specimen based on a digital cellular image of the tissue specimen. The method of the present invention includes the steps of, extracting the histological characteristic features of the cellular image using preprocessing algorithms having adaptive strategies to enhance the cellular image, declustering the extracted histological characteristic features of the cellular image to isolate the individual cells and the nuclei inside the cells, segmenting the declustered cellular image, labeling the segmented cellular image and classifying the cells in the labeled cellular image as cancer cells or non-cancer cells.","In a specific embodiment of the present invention, the preprocessing algorithms having adaptive strategies are selected from the group of algorithms consisting of adaptive fragmentary window filtering (AFWF), adaptive tree-structured nonlinear filtering (TSF), directional wavelet transform (DWT) and tree-structured wavelet transform (TSWT).","In the present invention, the adaptive fragmentary window filtering (AFWF) algorithm may further include the step of analyzing the edge gradient of all pixels within a predetermined size window of the digital cellular image. Additionally, the predetermined size window is chosen to be at least as large as the smallest cells to be detected.","In an additional embodiment, utilizing the adaptive tree-structured nonlinear filtering (TSF) algorithm may further include the steps of using an adaptive technique for automatic parameter selection for the TSF and employing an adaptive method for selecting the filter window size for the TSF, the filter window size being dependent upon requirements for image detail preservation.","Declustering of the extracted histological characteristic features of the cellular image to isolate the individual cells and the nuclei inside the cells further includes declustering the features of the cellular image using a distance-transform that yields the minimal distance to the boundary of an object for every pixel in the cellular image. In addition, segmenting the declustered cellular image further includes segmenting the declustered cellular image using an unsupervised Hopfield neural network.","The segmented cellular image is then labeled based on chromaticity features and histogram analysis of the RGB color space components of the digital cellular image and, in a particular embodiment, the cells are classified using a Kalman filtering neural network, such as that designed for lung cancer cell diagnosis.","In an additional embodiment, a computer-aided pathological diagnosis system for the classification of cancer cells in a tissue specimen based on a digital cellular image of the tissue specimen is provided including a computer-readable storage device containing a set of instructions that causes a computer to perform the steps of, extracting the histological characteristic features of the cellular image using preprocessing algorithms having adaptive strategies to enhance the cellular image, declustering the extracted histological characteristic features of the cellular image to isolate the individual cells and the nuclei inside the cells, segmenting the declustered cellular image, labeling the segmented cellular image and classifying the cells in the labeled cellular image as cancer cells or non-cancer cells.","The computer-aided cytology diagnosis (CACD) system in accordance with the present invention accurately identifies cell features by adjusting the parameters of CACD modules based on an advanced adaptive strategy and muti-resolution\/multi-orientation techniques. These features of the present invention provide for an improved computer-aided pathological diagnosis system and method for the classification of cancer cells in a tissue specimen that overcomes the deficiencies of the prior art systems and methods.","With reference to , the present invention is provides a computer-aided pathological diagnosis method for the classification of cancer cells in a tissue specimen based on a digital cellular image of the tissue specimen . The method of the present invention includes the steps of, extracting the histological characteristic features of the cellular image using preprocessing algorithms having adaptive strategies to enhance the cellular image , declustering the extracted histological characteristic features of the cellular image to isolate the individual cells and the nuclei inside the cells , segmenting the declustered cellular image , labeling the segmented cellular image  and classifying the cells in the labeled cellular image as cancer cells or non-cancer cells .","In a particular embodiment, the present invention is a Computer-Aided Pathological Diagnosis (CAPD) system designed for biomarker assessment, to differentiate lung cancer biomarkers and to identify cancer cells in the tissue based on a specimen's images. In accordance with the present invention, a novel APD system is trained to recognize expression of the cancer biomarkers in lung cancer cells. The accuracy of the system of the present invention to distinguish resected lung cancer from pre-neoplastic and normal tissues is also tested. The computer-aided cytological diagnosis (CAPD) system with a set of computerized analysis modules in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention includes:\n\n","Additionally, the performance evaluation and optimization of CAPD system are presented in support of the usefulness of the invention.","The major characteristics of the above modules of the present invention are to adapt detection parameters according to cellular image contents. The novel wavelet transform of the present invention is able to adaptively select different resolution and orientation features based on image content requirements.","The CAPD system in accordance with the present invention provides cellular feature enhancement, segmentation and classification, which are very important in distinguishing the benign lesion from a malignant lesion. The clearly benign lesions usually have smooth nuclear surfaces and exhibit homogeneous chromatin staining intensity. The CAPD system in accordance with the present invention can minimize the rate of false-positive or false-negative diagnosis resulting in better cytology\/pathology evaluations and patient management.","It is necessary to train the CACD system of the present invention to assess features of lung cancer cells. In accordance with a particular embodiment of the present invention, the CACD system was trained to assess features of lung cancer cells by evaluating the morphologic features of culture lung cancer cells. In this particular embodiment, the lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. The other cell lines were established from primary culture of resected lung cancer. Cells were grown in RPMI media supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (R10), 1 mM glutamine and antibiotics, and passaged weekly at subconfluence after trypsinisation. RPMI 1640, trypsin and sera were obtained from Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, Va. Cultures were maintained in humidified incubators at 37\u00b0 C. in an atmosphere of 5% COin air. For morphology and immunohistochemistry studies, adherent cells were trypsinized and then preserved in PreservCyt (CYTYC Corp., Boxborough, Mass.), and fixed cytospin preparations were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and for \u03b3-H2AX staining with PX technique (as described below).","For the immunohistochemistry studies in accordance with this embodiment, formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue from adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung were obtained from the Moffitt Tissue Procurement Core and cut into 3 \u03bcm sections. Standard IHC with antigen retrieval was performed using a primary antibody to \u03b3-H2AX (Rabbit, polyclonal IgG from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, N.Y.) applied at 1:700 dilution, overnight at 4\u00b0 C. in a humidity chamber. IHC was completed on the DAKO autostainer using VectorElite\u2014PX Rabbit detection and DAB chromogen.","Defining the differences between normal cells and cancer cells at three levels: (1) histology, (2) individual cell, and (3) nuclear of cells, the computational features and corresponding pathological description can be summarized as shown in Table I.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0041"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE I"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Difference between Normal Cells and Cancer Cells"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Features","Pathological Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Shape: measured","Cancer cells usually have rounded up shape and "]},{"entry":["by area, curvature,","can maintain their rough spherical surface."]},{"entry":["boundary, first and",{}]},{"entry":["second deviations.",{}]},{"entry":["Confluence:","Normal cells usually aligned in the same "]},{"entry":["measured by","direction, and highly confluent with only"]},{"entry":["contrast, affined","a few gaps between the cells.

The AFWF is known in the art to detect circular patterns in a digitized radiographic image. In accordance with a particular embodiment of the present invention, the AFWF is modified to detect digital cellular images in a histological section by analyzing the edge gradient of all pixels within a small window. This window is chosen to be at least as large as the smallest cells to be detected. Since the majority of cells display circular geometry, analysis of the edge gradients allows identification of the cells center as the locus of a sufficient (chosen) number of edge gradient vectors. The nodule boundaries are found by employing a circularity template, which is a cross-correlation of the individual normalized vector components. The measuring of locality is used to isolate the nodule by eliminating detected gradient vectors with components that are unequal beyond a chosen threshold. This threshold allows the detection of nodules that depart from strict circularity. Finally, the resulting image is then subjected to a spatial and multi-scale analysis to isolate suspicious areas as local intensity maxims. The circularity is also a useful feature to identify normal and cancer cells. As such, in accordance with the present invention, the AFWF was modified to aid the cytological diagnosis.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, an adaptive TSF module is presented. The advantage of the current tree-structured nonlinear filtering (TSF) for image noise suppression known in the art is that its application does not require a priori knowledge of the local statistics within the filter window; i.e., it is nonadaptive and therefore computationally efficient. Although the TSF has already demonstrated good performance, the present invention employs adaptive methods as an optimization strategy for tree-structured nonlinear filtering. The adaptive methods for TSF in accordance with the present invention include: (1) develop an adaptive technique for automatic parameter selection for the TSF, i.e., parameters K, Kand Kas defined in Equations 7-10 presented in W. Qian, L. P. Clarke, M. Kallergi, R. A. Clark, \u201cTree-structured nonlinear filters in digital mammography,\u201d IEEE Trans. Med. Imag., vol. 13(1), 25-36, 1994, which is incorporated herein by reference, and (2) develop an adaptive method for selecting the filter window sizes (i.e., from 3\u00d73 to 7\u00d77) depending on requirements for image detail preservation. The initial physical performance of the adaptive filter will initially be evaluated by standard signal processing criteria: (1) localized metrics for noise evaluation such as the normalized mean square error (NMSE) and difference images to show structured noise, and (2) inclusion of the effect of the application of the directional wavelet transform (DWT) module to the same simulated images to evaluate possible artifact generation.","In accordance with the present invention, the DWT module has been adapted for optimum perfomance. The DWT module is designed as a bank of wavelet filters implemented by using adaptive combiners with different weight factors as described in more detail in L. Li, W. Qian and L. P. Clarke, \u201cDigital mammography: CAD method for mass detection using multiresolution and multiorientation wavelet. transforms,\u201d Academic Radiology, 1997; 4:724-731, which is herein incorporated by reference. As such, the DWT module can be uniquely modified for higher order N directional filters. For example, a higher order wavelet orientation (N=16) was recently implemented, affecting the direction angle Q, i.e., the directional bandwidth of the wavelet functions to allow more selective extraction of directional features. Further improvements in robustness may be achieved through adaptivity of the weights Wapplied to the directional features, as further detailed in L. Li, W. Qian and L. P. Clarke, \u201cDigital mammography: CAD method for mass detection using multiresolution and multiorientation wavelet. transforms,\u201d Academic Radiology, 1997; 4:724-731 and W. Qian, L. P. Clarke, L. Li, et. al., \u201cComputer Assisted Diagnostic (CAD) Methods for X-ray Imaging and Teleradiology,\u201d Proceedings of the 26th AIPR Workshop, Cosmos Club, D.C., Oct. 15-17, 1997, which are herein incorporated by reference. The present invention performed an initial evaluation of N=16 and found that it improves preservation of the shape of segmented cell areas. In addition, adaptive criteria for the DWT module are proposed, wherein adaptive selection of N for each pixel point is employed to match these changes. By adaptively selecting N, the sampling problem is potentially improved for detection of morphology of cell shapes. Alternatively, for the higher order N, an improvement in the signal\/noise ratio for detection of morphology of cell shapes is evidenced. The range of N, which influences the angular bandwidth frequency and directional sensitivity, is adaptively selected within 4-32, which corresponds to a 45\u00b0-5.63\u00b0 arc width and provides higher sampling and more mathematically rigorous method. The physical performance of the adaptive method in accordance with the present invention is evaluated by using the different cell examples, which contain linear and other structures, to determine if appropriate structures are identified or any artifacts generated.","The present invention additionally employs declustering for the isolation of touching cells and nuclei. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a newly developed distance-transform is proposed for separating a cluster of cytological cells into individual cells with clear contours of cells' boundaries which also serves to locate and describe the nuclei inside the cells. The distance-transform yields the minimal distance to the boundary of the object for every pixel in the transform's input image I(x; y) as represented in Eq. 1 and shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0047"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"Y","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["x","y"],"mo":","}}},{"mo":["{","}"],"mrow":{"munder":{"mi":["min","Vk"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["\uf605","\uf606"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["x","y"],"mo":","}},{"mi":"\u03b7","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["x","k"]},{"mi":["y","k"]}],"mo":","}}}],"mo":"-"}}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"with the result of the distance-transform Y(x; y), the coordinate of every pixel x=(x; y) in a uniform area (x; y)\u03b5 A. \u03b7(x; y) is the surrounding curve of the area. The distance transform can be approximated using a 5\u00d75 structuring element in an iterative algorithm as shown in . The area A (e.g. a cell cluster) which is obtained as a two-level grey-image is initialized such that pixels x\u03b5 A are assigned the value 1 and background pixels are set to zero. Next, the structuring element given in  is moved over the whole image I(x; y). If all elements in the image below the structuring element take values i(x; y)\u2267a (with a=1 in the first step) then the point below the center of the structuring element is incremented (on the same image). Finally, a in incremented and the process is repeated. The distance-transformed image is then thresholded as shown with reference to .","In a particular embodiment, the region growing algorithm is used, which must be controlled by a condition preventing regions from growing into each other (e.g. the regions given in  would grow together without such a condition). To ensure that the region growing stops at the boundary of the cell, we first label the thresholded distance-transform image and label the cluster and background. As such, the area of the clustered object is labeled with a value \u03be, and the background is labeled 0. For the initial areas Awe obtain (the subscript denotes the label-index of the area, the superscript gives the iteration step), V(x;y) is the labeled thresholded distance-transformed image as illustrated with reference to  and , which consists of regions denoted by the labels i.

(2)) and by introducing results which were already obtained into the source-image X(x; y) as follows (see Eq.

In this embodiment, 5-fold cross validation is run on the data set. More specifically, the data set is divided into five subsets of similar size, where the proportion of different classes in each subset is similar to that in the original data set. Then each experiment is run for five times, each time using the union of four subsets as the training set to train the lung cancer cell identification module named Kalman filtering Neural Network, and using the remaining subset as a test set to test the trained module to see how well it works.","As described above, the cell lines, immunohistochemistry, and corresponding cell computational features are used and implemented in accordance with the present invention.

Table II, the results are based on three different cell images: normal (Adeno NBrochEpi 2005 pH2AX_Nuclei), pre-malignant lesion (Adeno AAH 2005 pH2AX 40\u00d7_Nuclei), and cancer (Adeno 2005 pH2AX 40\u00d7_Nuclei). The results are the test of the feasibility of using the CACD system of the present invention to identify nuclear features for differentiating the three kinds of cells. From this table, we can see that all the selected features are differentiable (there are distinct differences among the feature measurements of different kind of cells). As such, the CACD system in accordance with the present invention provides an improved system and method to identify different kinds of cells.","The CACD system of the present invention provides for cellular feature enhancement, segmentation and classification, which are very useful in distinguishing a benign lesion from a malignant lesion. The clearly benign lesions usually have smooth nuclear surface and homogeneous chromatin staining intensity. In contrast, carcinomas displayed remarkably different features in morphology, including: irregular nuclear surface; marked nuclear pleomorphism (irregular, angulated and indented shape of nuclear volume); irregular and coarse chromatin texture and chaotic arrangement of tumor cell nuclei. In conclusion, nuclear structure with morphologic image analysis by using the CACD system of the present invention provides a useful research diagnostic tool in cytology. Additionally, in clinical practice, the dense hyperchromatic cell groups are considered common diagnostic problems in cytopathological evaluations. Cytological evaluations of the dense hyperchromatic groups in cervicovaginal smear outcome high rates of false-positive or false negative diagnosis. The key element is to automatically differentiate among the dense hyperchromatic groups and to appropriately classify, based on strict morphologic criteria. As such, the CACD system of the present invention is a useful tool to be employed for the diagnosis of dense hyperchromatic cell groups.","The automatic extraction of the cancerous nuclei and assess biomarker expression on sub-cellular level in lung pathological color images can segment the images based on chromaticity features and histogram analysis of the RGB color space components of the raw image. The ideal cytomorphometric analysis should differentiate between the ambiguous or suspicious groups of dense hyperchromatic cells. Ultimately, the CACD system of the present invention can minimize the rate of false-positive or false-negative diagnosis resulting in better cytology\/pathology evaluations and patient management.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":["Dillon, D.
