{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application was filed under 35 U.S.C. 371 as a national stage of PCT\/EP2006\/061557, filed Apr. 12, 2006.","The invention relates to the use of Roflumilast, its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, its N-Oxide and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the latter for the preventive or curative treatment of pulmonary hypertension.","The invention furthermore relates to combinations of Roflumilast, its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, its N-Oxide and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the latter with PDE5 inhibitors; as well as to pharmaceutical compositions, combination products and kits containing these combinations and the use of such combinations in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.","In the international patent application WO9837894 the combination of phosphodiesterase inhibitors with adenylate cyclase agonists or guanylate cyclase agonists is disclosed for the treatment of inter alia pulmonary hypertension. In the international patent application WO9509636 a method for treating pulmonary hypertension is disclosed which comprises administering endotracheally or endobronchially to a subject an effective amount of a drug selected from the group consisting of cyclic nucleotides, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, nitric oxide precursors, nitric oxide donors and nitric oxide analogs, thereby decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance. In Cardiovasc. Rev & Rep 2002; 23, pp 274-279 Martin R. Wilkins et al review the use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. In Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 288: L103-L115, 2005 it is described that cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors potentiate effects of prostacyclin analogs in hypoxic pulmonary vascular remodelling. In Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs 2005 6(3), pp 283-288 Wang D et al describe novel approaches to use PDE4 inhibitors for antihypertensive therapy. In Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs 2002 3(8) Reid P describes that Roflumilast is metabolized in vivo to Roflumilast-N-oxide and that the both compounds behave in a similar manner in most test conditions. In the international patent application WO03070279 oral dosage forms containing a PDE4 inhibitor\u2014exemplified exclusively by compositions comprising Roflumilast\u2014for the treatment and prevention of all diseases regarded as treatable or preventable through the use of PDE4 inhibitors, including COPD are disclosed.","Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is defined by a mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) >25 mm Hg at rest or >30 mg Hg with exercise. According to current guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension released by the European Society of Cardiology in 2004 (Eur Heart J 25: 2243-2278; 2004) clinical forms of PH are classified as (1) pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), (2) PH associated with left heart diseases, (3) PH associated with lung respiratory diseases and\/or hypoxia, (4) PH due to chronic thrombotic and\/or embolic disease, (5) PH of other origin (e.g. sarcoidosis). Group (1) is comprising e.g. idiopathic and familial PAH as well as PAH in the context of connective tissue disease (e.g. scleroderma, CREST), congenital systemic to pulmonary shunts, portal hypertension, HIV, intake of drugs and toxins (e.g. anorexigens). PH occurring in COPD was assigned to group (3). Muscularization of small (less than 500 \u03bcm diameter) pulmonary arterioles is widely accepted as a common pathological denominator of PAH (Group 1), however it may also occur in other forms of PH such as based on COPD or thrombotic and\/or thrombembolic disease. Other pathoanatomical features in PH are thickening of the intima based on migration and proliferation of (myo)fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells and excessive generation of extracellular matrix, endothelial injury and\/or proliferation and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrates. Together, remodelling of distal pulmonary arterial vasculature results in augmented pulmonary vascular resistance, consecutive right heart failure and death. Whilst background therapy and more general measures such as oral anticoagulants, diuretics, digoxin or oxygen supply are still listed by current guidelines these remedies are not expected to interfere with causes or mechanisms of pulmonary arterial remodelling. Some patients with PAH may also benefit from Ca-antagonists in particular those with acute response to vasodilators. Innovative therapeutic approaches developed over the past decade considered molecular aberrations in particular enhanced endothelin-1 formation, reduced prostacyclin (PGI) generation and impaired eNOS activity in PAH vasculature. Endothelin-1 acting via ET-receptors is mitogenic for pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells and triggers acute vasoconstriction. The oral ET\/ET-antagonist Bosentan has recently been approved in the EU and United States for treatment of PAH after the compound demonstrated improvements in clinical endpoints such as mean PAP, PVR or 6 min walking test. However, Bosentan augmented liver enzymes and regular liver tests are mandatory. Currently selective ETantagonists such as sitaxsentan or ambrisentan are under scrutiny.","As another strategy in management of PAH replacement of deficient prostacyclin by PGIanalogues such as epoprostenol, treprostinil, oral beraprost or iloprost emerged. Prostacyclin serves as a brake to excessive mitogenesis of vascular smooth muscle cells acting to augment cAMP generation. Intravenous prostacyclin (epoprostenol) significantly improved survival rates in idiopathic pulmonary hypertension as well as exercise capacity and was approved in North America and some European countries in the mid-1990s. However, owing to its short half-life epoprostenol has to be administered via continuous intravenous infusion that\u2014whilst feasible\u2014is uncomfortable, complicate and expensive. In addition, adverse events due to systemic effects of prostacyclin are frequent. Alternative prostacyclin analogues are treprostinil, recently approved in the United States for PAH treatment and delivered via continuous subcutaneous infusion and beraprost, the first biologically stable and orally active PGIanalogue, which has been approved for treatment of PAH in Japan. Its therapeutic profile appeared more favourable in patients with idiopathic PAH compared to other forms of pulmonary hypertension and side effects linked to systemic vasodilation following beraprost administration and local pain at the infusion site under treprostinil treatment are frequent. Administration of the prostacyclin analogue iloprost via the inhalative route was recently approved in Europe. Its beneficial effects on exercise capacity and haemodynamic parameters are to be balanced to a rather high dosing frequency comprising 6-12 courses of inhalation per day from appropriate devices.","Functional consequences of impaired endothelial nitric oxide formation as reported in pulmonary arterial hypertension may be overcome by selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) that is expressed in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Consequently, the selective PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil was demonstrated to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and exercise capacity in PAH.","Most of these novel treatments primarily address smooth muscle cells function, however, in addition pulmonary vascular fibroblasts, endothelial cells but also perivascular macrophages and T-lymphocytes are considered to contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension.","In spite of the different therapeutic approaches mentioned above the medical need to alleviate the disease burden in pulmonary hypertension is high. It is therefore an object of the present invention to make available pharmaceutical compositions for the preventive or curative treatment of pulmonary hypertension, which overcome some or all of the abovementioned disadvantages.","Treatment of pulmonary hypertension can surprisingly be achieved by the use of a compound of formula 1.1",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"36.66mm","wi":"65.96mm","file":"US08648100-20140211-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and\/or a compound of formula 1.2",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"36.66mm","wi":"68.66mm","file":"US08648100-20140211-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.","The compound of formula 1.1 has the international nonproprietary name (INN) Roflumilast [3-cyclopropyl-methoxy-4-difluoromethoxy-N-(3,5-dichloropyrid-4-yl)benzamide].","The compound of formula 1.2 is Roflumilast-N-Oxide [3-cyclopropylmethoxy-4-difluoromethoxy-N-(3,5-dichloro-1-oxido-pyridin-4-yl)benzamide].","The preparation of Roflumilast, its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and its N-Oxide as well as the use of these compounds as PDE4 inhibitors is described in the international patent application WO9501338.","Salts encompassed within the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salts\u201d of compounds of formulae 1.1 and 1.2 refer to non-toxic salts of these compounds which are generally prepared by reacting a free base with a suitable organic or inorganic acid or by reacting an acid with a suitable organic or inorganic base.

Hypoxia- or MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats represent widely accepted animal models to study the potential of investigative drugs to reverse chronic pulmonary hypertension based on pulmonary vascular remodelling. In the MCT setting Roflumilast was administered both in preventive and curative paradigms.","Animals","Experiments were performed with adult male Wistar rats (200-250 g) according to institutional guidelines abiding to national and international regulations.","Chronic Hypoxic Pulmonary Hypertension","Rats were exposed to chronic hypoxia (10% O) in a ventilated chamber (500-liter volume, Flufrance, Cachan, France). To establish the hypoxic environment, the chamber was flushed with a mixture of room air and nitrogen, and the gas was recirculated. The environment within the chamber was monitored using an oxygen analyzer (Oxiquant M, EnviTeC\u2014Wismar, Germany). Carbon dioxide was removed by self-indicating soda lime granules. Excess humidity was prevented by cooling of the recirculation circuit. The chamber temperature was maintained at 22-24\u00b0 C. The chamber was opened every other day for 1 hour to clean the cages and replenish food and water supplies. Normoxic control rats were kept in the same room with identical light-dark cycle. Rats exposed to chronic hypoxia were randomly assigned to three groups (8-10 animals per group): the first group received Roflumilast at 0.5 mg kgd, the second group received Roflumilast at 1.5 mg kgd, the third group received vehicle (methocel). A group not exposed to hypoxia served as control. Roflumilast or vehicle were administered once daily by gavage over 15 days of exposure to hypoxia.","Monocrotaline (MCT)-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension","Rats were randomly assigned to three groups (8-10 animals in each group): two groups received Roflumilast 0.5 and 1.5 mg kgd, respectively; and one group received vehicle. In the preventive treatment paradigm Roflumilast or vehicle were given once daily by gavage for 21 days starting immediately after a single subcutaneous injection of MCT (60 mg kg). A group not receiving MCT served as control. In a curative approach rats were left untreated for 21 days following MCT (60 mg\/kg s.c.) and than randomly divided into two groups, one received roflumilast (1.5 mg\/kg\/d) p.o. and the other vehicle, from day 21 to day 42.","Assessment of Pulmonary Hypertension","At the end of the treatment period rats were anaethesized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg\/kg, i.p.). A polyvinyl catheter was introduced into the right jugular vein and pushed through the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery. Another polyethylene catheter was inserted into the right carotid artery. After measurement of pulmonary (PAP) and systemic arterial pressures (SAP), the thorax was opened and the left lung immediately removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The heart was dissected and weighed for calculation of the right ventricular hypertrophy index (ratio of right ventricular free wall weight over sum of septum plus left ventricular free wall weight; RV\/LV+S). The right lung was fixed in the distended state with formalin buffer. After routine processing and paraffin embedding, multiple sections from each lobe were stained with haemotoxylin and eosin. In each rat, 60 intraacinar arteries were analyzed and categorized as muscular (fully or partially) or nonmuscular to assess the degree of muscularization. In addition, intraacinar fully muscularized arteries were evaluated for measurements of medial wall thickness which was calculated and expressed as follows: index (%)=(External diameter\u2212internal diameter)\/External diameter\u00d7100%.","Statistical Analyses","The data are expressed as means\u00b1SEM. A nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used for comparisons between two groups. Comparisons of data at various times after MCT injection or of various treatment groups were performed using a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's test when significant. To compare the degree of pulmonary vessels muscularization between groups, we used a non parametric Mann-Whitney or a Kruskal-Wallis test after ordinal classification of the vessels as non muscular, partially muscular, or fully muscular.","Results","Effects of Roflumilast on the Development of Chronic Hypoxic Pulmonary Hypertension","Rats exposed over 15 days to chronic hypoxia developed pulmonary hypertension associated with right ventricular hypertrophy reflected by an increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure (mean PAP) and RV\/LV+S ratio. The selective PDE4 inhibitor Roflumilast reduced mean PAP augmented by chronic hypoxia at both 0.5 mg kgdand 1.5 mg kgd(p<0.05 vs vehicle) in a dose dependent manner (Table 3).

However, treatment with Roflumilast from day 21 reduced PAP and RV\/LV+S ratio at day 42 even beyond the values at day 21. These haemodynamic findings may have been caused by a distinct reduction of muscularization of the distal pulmonary arteries with Roflumilast. More specifically, \u02dc70% of these arterioles were fully muscularized at day 21 as well as on day 42 of the vehicle group. Roflumilast from day 21 significantly reduced the proportion of fully muscularized arterioles by >50% at day 42.

In the curative approach the survival rate was significantly improved by Roflumilast (1.5 mg\/kg\/d). Whereas 21 of 39 (54%) of the rats in the vehicle group survived up to day 42, from the 24 rats in the Roflumilast group 17 (71%) animals were alive at day 42.
