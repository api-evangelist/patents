{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of the filing date of a provisional application entitled, \u201cA Cloud-based Application Trust-Listing Security Service that Prevents Unauthorized Programs From Running on Users' Computer Systems and Devices Using a Social Media Network for Crowd-Sourcing of Application Trust\u201d Ser. No. 61\/868,047, filed Aug. 20, 2013, assigned to the assignee of the present application, and herein incorporated by reference.","The claimed subject matter relates generally to computing systems and, more specifically, to techniques for preventing untrusted or unauthorized applications from gaining access to protected information or misusing computing resources.","Today, computing, or \u2018processing,\u201d systems are involved in almost every technical device produced. Processing systems may come in the form of, for example, laptops, tablets, iPads and desktops. In addition, processors may be found in smart phones, SCADA, process control systems, Point-of-Sale terminals, kiosks, ATMs, Casino Gaming equipment, medical equipment, embedded systems, network appliances, cloud and data center servers and automated self-driving cars. Unfortunately, any processing system may be the target an unauthorized access attempt, even systems with required security updates or without known security holes.","Hackers and other unauthorized computer and device users can run unknown, unfrosted or unauthorized applications on computer systems and devices to gain access to protected information or misuse computing resources. Two current techniques for protecting computing systems and devices are white lists and black lists. A white list (or whitelist) is a list or register of applications that are being provided a particular privilege, service, mobility, access or recognition. In other words, applications or processes on a white list are accepted, approved or recognized as being legitimate applications or processes. A blacklist (or black list) is a list or register of entities or people who, for one reason or another, are denied a particular privilege, service, mobility, access or recognition.","Currently, white lists are primarily based upon application or process names, which may be spoofed, upon signing certifications which can be forged using stolen signing certificate keys or upon cryptographic hashes or simple checksums. Blacklists are primarily based upon a signature which identifies a code sequence pattern, the examination of file formats and code statistics on the frequency of interrupt vectors and code used (or the absence of use) or a behavioral profile of computer resource misuse determined with dynamic heuristics where programs execution is emulated in a closed environment.","Provided are techniques for preventing untrusted or unauthorized applications from gaining access to protected information or misusing computing resources. Techniques include: 1) a cloud-based application fingerprint database submission and subscription process; 2) an HTTP or DNS protocol for application identification fingerprint queries; 3) optional organization specific application control zones; 4) zone based application control of dynamically connected mobile devices; 5) IP Gap technology; and 6) a trust-listing endpoint management as a service technology to provide just-in-time application fingerprint verification to prevent unauthorized programs from running on users computer systems and devices. Protected endpoints check the fingerprints of programs and executable components that try to execute against a fingerprint database in the service to determine if that program or executable component is authorized to run on that endpoint at that time and, optionally, in a particular zone. Unauthorized programs are not allowed to execute. This protects users information and resources from unauthorized access and use.","A Trust-listing's just-in-time verification does not require a scan of a system before protection can begin. In addition, a crowd-sourcing community may validate which programs and executable components can be trusted. Unsophisticated users using a social media community can choose to follow highly rated experts or groups of experts who provide trust-listing signatures, or fingerprints. The trust-listing system does not require any highly complex trusted-change technology. When applications are found to be vulnerable or malware, they can then be disabled from execution with a single user button click. When followed experts or groups of experts are found to be untrustworthy, their recommendations of trust can be disabled from execution with a single user button click.","Provided are techniques for controlling access to computing resources comprising generating a first fingerprint corresponding to a first executable file; storing the fingerprint in a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium; receiving a request to execute a second executable file on a computing system; generating a second fingerprint corresponding to the second executable file; determining whether or not the first fingerprint matches the second fingerprint; and, in response to determining that the first and second fingerprints match, executing the executable file on the computing system; and, in response to determining that the first and second fingerprints do not match, preventing the executable file from executing on the computing system.","This summary is not intended as a comprehensive description of the claimed subject matter but, rather, is intended to provide a brief overview of some of the functionality associated therewith. Other systems, methods, functionality, features and advantages of the claimed subject matter will be or will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description.","Although described with particular reference to a cloud computing environment, the claimed subject matter can be implemented in any information technology (IT) system in which the protections of computers and computing resources is desirable. Is should also be noted that, although described with reference to \u201capplications,\u201d \u201cprocesses\u201d and \u201cdlls,\u201d the claimed subject matter is also applicable to any executable logic. Those with skill in the computing arts will recognize that the disclosed embodiments have relevance to a wide variety of computing environments in addition to those described below. In addition, the methods of the disclosed technology can be implemented in software, hardware, or a combination of software and hardware. The hardware portion can be implemented using specialized logic; the software portion can be stored in a memory and executed by a suitable instruction execution system such as a microprocessor, personal computer (PC) or mainframe.","In the context of this document, a \u201cmemory\u201d or \u201crecording medium\u201d can be any means that contains, stores, communicates, propagates, or transports the program and\/or data for use by or in conjunction with an instruction execution system, apparatus or device. Memory and recording medium can be, but are not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic or semiconductor system, apparatus or device. Memory and recording medium also includes, but is not limited to, for example the following: a portable computer diskette, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or flash memory), and a portable compact disk read-only memory or another suitable medium upon which a program and\/or data may be stored.","As the Inventors herein have realized, one problem with the use of a white list is that white lists, or white listing services, may include malware in their scan of a newly installed endpoint, an endpoint typically being a connection point where a particular service may be accessed. In addition, a white-listing system may require complex and non-bounded trusted-change technologies to ensure that updated programs are able to run in the white-listed environment. Further, when a new end-point is white-listed, if malware or unauthorized software is already installed, the malware or unauthorized software may be mistakenly added to the white list and allowed to run. Administrators' or users' settings in policy that allow applications to execute on protected systems cannot be easily disabled because of the complexity of the policies they may be buried therein.","Although vendors typically update their white list when software manufacturers update applications, this creates a labor intensive effort as software manufacturers use various different techniques to update their software, sometime even changing the method on a single application from one version to the next. Further, software manufacturers have been increasing the rate at which they update their applications. This creates an unbounded problem that white-listing providers cannot solve with any known uniform and all-encompassing technique.","The following is a list of individual components or elements that make up one embodiment of the claimed subject matter:\n\n","Turning now to the figures,  is a block diagram of a cloud computing architecture  that may implement the disclosed technology. A computing system , used as an example of a system that may be protected in accordance with the claimed subject matter, includes a central processing unit (CPU) , coupled to a monitor , a keyboard  and a pointing device, or \u201cmouse,\u201d , which together facilitate human interaction with elements of cloud computing architecture  and computing system . IT should be understood that a computing system may be configured in many different ways. For example, rather than a keyboard and mouse, computing system  may have a touchscreen or may have no human interaction at all.","Also included in computing system  and attached to CPU  is a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium (CRSM) , which may either be incorporated into computing system  i.e. an internal device, or attached externally to CPU  by means of various, commonly available connection devices such as but not limited to, a universal serial bus (USB) port (not shown). CRSM  is illustrated storing logic associated with an End Point Driver (EPD) . In short, EPD  applies trust-listing signatures to control application and process execution on computing system . EPD  accesses a scalable trust-listing management interface of WCS server  in cloud computing environment  to manage when and where applications can run. EPD  is explained in more detail below in conjunction with . It should be noted that a typical computing system would include more elements, but for the sake of simplicity only ones necessary to describe the claimed subject matter are shown.","Computing system  is communicatively coupled to a cloud computing environment, or simply the \u201ccloud\u201d . As should be familiar to those with skill in the relevant arts and as defined by Wikipedia, cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service rather than a product, whereby shared resources, software, and information are provided to computers and other devices as a utility (like the electricity grid) over a network (typically the Internet). Clouds can be classified as public, private or hybrid. Also communicatively coupled to cloud  is a mobile device , which may for example a mobile computer, a tablet computer or a telephone. Mobile device  is merely used as an example of a device other than a computing system such as computing system  that may employ the claimed subject matter for security. Although in this example, computing system  and cloud  are communicatively coupled via the Internet (not shown), they could also be coupled through any number of communication mediums such as, but not limited to, a local area network (LAN) (notshown), direct wire and wireless connections. In the alternative, Cloud Computing Environment  might also be implemented as a \u201ccloud\u201d instance of standalone individual components via a single software appliance without the redundant resources found in a typical cloud environment deployment.","In this example, aspects of the claimed subject matter are provided by a White Cloud Security (WCS) server , a Fingerprint Database Service (FDS)  and Third Party Trust Providers (TPTPs) . In addition, aspects of the claimed subject matter may be provided in part by security professionals , developers , trust-listing experts , administrators  and application, or \u201capp,\u201d vendors . FDS  stores fingerprints of applications and processes and well as crowd-sourcing community and social media information. The crowd-sourcing of application identification fingerprints provides a high degree of information about the trust-worthiness of running an application on a user's computer system or device. PTPs  stores the application trust selections, recommendations and information provided by security professionals , developers , trust-listing experts , administrators  and app vendors . Although not illustrated, WCS server  would typically include a CPU and CRSM any might include a monitor, keyboard and mouse.","It should be understood that, throughout the specification, the term \u201csignature\u201d is used interchangeably with the term \u201cfingerprint.\u201d While a signature, e.g., on a check, may be forged, a fingerprint typically may not. In other words, the terms \u201csignature\u201d and \u201cfingerprint\u201d are used as to describe a characteristic of a process or application that is determined by examining the process or application and which typically cannot be forged or spoofed.","The function of EPD , WCS server , FDS , TPTPs  and the roles played by parties such as parties , , ,  and  are explained in more detail below in conjunction with . Further, it should be noted there are many possible cloud computing architecture configurations, of which cloud computing architecture  is only one simple example. For example, FDS  and TPTPs  may be incorporated into WCS server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["124","124","140","142","144","146","148","150","124","122","122","122","100","124","140","142","144","146","148","150","100"]},"I\/O module  handles any communication FDS  has with other components of FDS  and architecture . Data module  is a data repository for information, including data, that FDS  requires during normal operation. Examples of the types of information stored in data module  include client data , application data , social media data , policy data  and operating parameter .","Client data  stores information relating to clients, or users, that take advantage of the service provided by FDS  and the related elements. In addition, the term \u201cclients\u201d may include experts and administrators that contribute to and manage the system, respectively. In one model, users may subscribe to the service and pay a set price for each application fingerprint query (see , ). In an alternative model, a subscription may be based upon a flat fee for a specified period of time. Information may also be stored on trust-listing providers. For example, when an expert is fund to have been untrustworthy, they can be marked as untrusted with a single button click which automatically disallows all trust recommendations from any application trust they have provided. The basis for trust for those applications then falls on any other experts that are providing trust recommendations for them or upon the user's own application trust selections.","Application data  stores the signatures, or fingerprints, of application and processes that have been approved for execution. In addition, information corresponding to applications or process, e.g., malware or vulnerable applications, that should not be permitted to execute may also be stored. Fingerprints for applications and processes may be generated based upon a \u201chash\u201d of the corresponding application or process. As should be familiar to those with skill in the relevant arts, there are several hashing technologies that may produce a fingerprint (signature) such as, but not limited to, MD5, CRC32, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512 and to file length (element size). An application or process (or executable component) may be identified by its file length (element size) combined with one or more of the fingerprints from the hashes generated for that file. Combining the file length (element size) and one fingerprint hash helps avoid hash collisions. Combining multiple fingerprints (e.g. SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512) with the file length (element size) dramatically reduce to nearly zero the possibility of hash collisions which an attacker might attempt to use to misidentify their malware as a valid trusted application. Further, each fingerprint may also be correlated with particular users, computing systems and\/or zones to provide \u201czone control,\u201d which is described in more detail below. Signatures may be queried using protocols such as, but not limited to, HTTP and HTTPS or queried by FISs (see ,  and , ).","Social media data , provides information relating to crowd-sourced and expert provided information on the quality of applications, fingerprints and fingerprint providers. Social media data  enables experts to provide recommendations and provide security alerts and enables users to follow selected users for their contributed signatures, application trust selections, recommendations and security alerts. In addition, social media data  may provide information for the implementation of a security community ecosystem that pays signature, recommendation and alert contributors.","Policy data  stores information on administrative policies of FDS  including, but not limited to, the actual implementation of payments and zone control. Operating parameters  stores information on various administrative preferences that have been set, including but not limited to the look and feel of GUI .","ZMS , also referred to as a Fingerprint Identification Service (FIS), provides for organizational control of computers and devices. In other words, provides application and process control, i.e., control of where and when an application or process can run, of dynamically connected computing devices such as, but not limited to, laptops, notebooks and mobile devices. When user's computer systems and devices move onto an organization's protected zone, a FIS provides a set of signature (fingerprint) policies that control which applications are allowed to run on the users system\/device and under what conditions they are allow to run. DHCP or other similar logon technologies direct the dynamically connected devices to use the FIS DNS-based fingerprint Identification Service. Although illustrated as part of FDS , ZMS may also be independent modules located in the corresponding computer, devices and zones being controlled (see , , , ). With multiple FISs, Fingerprints may be provided as just-in-time trust query execution in real-time using currently available DNS distributes data server model techniques.","EMP  provides the ability to manage endpoints associated with FDS . Each endpoint's EPD connects to a specific FDS for management and application trust validation. AFCU  provides for the collection and uploading of signatures, or Fingerprints, of new or modified applications and processes. As previously explained, fingerprints may be provided by security professionals  (), developers , trust-listing experts  (), administrators  () and application, or \u201capp,\u201d vendors  (). Fingerprints may be collected by a variety of techniques, including, but not limited to, crowd-sourcing and tools associated with social media (see ) and other cloud-based submission and subscription processes. In addition to fingerprints, app vendors  () and trusted developers (not shown) may simply provide executables in the form of applications, processes or dynamically linked libraries (DLLs), which are then processed by AFCU  to generate corresponding fingerprints (see , ).","GUI component  enables administrators  () and users of FDS  to interact with and to define the desired functionality of FDS . For example, GUI  may provide manager\/parental control of application and process authorization, typically by uploading and setting information into data module . Further, GUI  may provide access to security professionals  (), developers  () trust-listing experts  (). GUI  may also provide a social media interface to rate applications, signatures, and experts, allowing experts to be followed for their signatures, application trust selections, application recommendations, and security alerts, and allow users to submit signatures for identification and definition by the community, and to pay signature contributors who collect and upload application signatures and provide application trust recommendations. In this manner, users can choose which experts to trust and follow for signatures, application trust selections, application recommendations, and security alerts. Elements , , , , , , , ,  and  are described in more detail below in conjunction with .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","100","200","114","120","124","202","138","204","124","142","148","114","124","218","124","206"]},"A FIS  (see ZMS , ) and a corresponding cache  provide zone control for cloud computing environment  based upon a fingerprint block (FB)  or a FB  provided by FDS , relayed via FIS \/cache  or API , respectively. Zone control may be applied, for example to, dynamically connected laptops, notebooks and mobile devices in an organization's network. It should be noted that FBs  and  may be individual signatures sent by  or API  as needed, i.e., \u201cjust-in-time,\u201d far verification of a particular application or process or a block of signatures transmitted periodically and stored in cache  for FIS operations to be used as needed. In other words, FISs may each store their own signature database that is periodically updated. FIS  is illustrated as separated by an air, or IP, gap  and serviced by a DNS zone transfer (Xfer)  of fingerprint data. A FB  is also transmitted to EPD  for use in computing system  (). Additional FISs, i.e., a FIS  and a FIS  provide zone control for other protected zones, organizations or computing devices. Like FIS , FIS  includes a cache . In this example, a potential application execution on computing system  triggers a Request (see , ) from EPD  to FDS , which is responsible for transmitting as Go\/No GO decision  to EPD  (see , ). FIS  and the corresponding lines represent an alternative path for this exchange. (see , ).","A White Cloud Java Script (WCJS)  provides administrators with Profile Management (PMGT)  via a management user interface (Mgt. UI)  (see GUI , ). In this manner, an administrator or other user, such as administrators  (), may manage application fingerprint lists (FLIST)  to be uploaded, deleted or marked as malware, an untrusted application or application to be denied execution. In addition, PMGT , as well as FISs ,  and , enables managers\/parents to control the authorization of applications in a secure cloud environment with automatic scaling to disable application execution (see , ). PMGT  also provides a sealable trust-listing management interface to manage the conditions under which an application can run. PMGT  enables user to disable application execution and may provide email notifications in the event an application needs approval to execute.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","122","122","300","206","207","300","102","122","102"]},"Process  starts at a \u201cBegin Operate WCS\u201d block  and proceeds immediately to a \u201cConfigure WCS . During processing associated with block , data necessary for the operation of process  is retrieved (see , ). Once process  has been configured, control proceeds to a \u201cWait for Request\u201d block  during which process  waits for a request from an endpoint driver such as EPD  () on to whether or not to allow a particular application or process to execute on, in this example, computing system  (). A request may be transmitted in a number of ways including but not limited to, HTTP, HTTPS or DNS (see , , , ). During an \u201cEvaluate Request\u201d block , the request received during processing associated with block  is evaluated. The evaluation typically involves matching the length and one or more hashes of the executable file to produce a fingerprint of the particular application or process and comparing the fingerprint to fingerprints stored in a database (see , ) associated with FDS . Trust selection information associated with fingerprints is also checked by FDS  to provide a basis for a decision on whether or not an application is authorized (see , ) and a subsequent GO\/No GO decision (see , , ). Any specific fingerprint may be listed as acceptable, not acceptable or simply not listed.","During processing associated with a \u201cApplication (App.) Authorized?\u201d block , a determination is made as to whether or not the application is approved for execution, i.e., listed, or not approved, i.e., not listed or specified as a non-approved application or process. If the application or process is approved, control proceeds to a \u201cTransmit GO\u201d block  during which the approval is recorded in client data  of FDS . During, processing associated with block , a signal is transmitted to EPD  that the application may execute on computing system  and the application or process is then allowed to do so.","If, during processing associated with block , a determination is made that the application or process is not, approved, control proceeds to a \u201cTransmit Application Fingerprint Condition (AppFig. Con.)\u201d block . During processing associated with block , the fingerprint associated with the application or process that was not authorized is transmitted to EPD  and to FDS  for appropriate action and is recorded in client data  of FDS . Such action may include, but is not limited to, reevaluating the application or process and listing the corresponding fingerprint on either a GO or NO GO list for transmission to appropriate EDPs and FISs. Once an application or process has been determined to be either malware, vulnerable to attack or had its trust recommendations removed, the application or process ma be marked accordingly in FDS  and will no longer be allowed to run on an endpoint unless an administrator specifically allows that specific version of the application to run using his trust recommendation. This provides a facility to disallow an administrators' trust override recommendations with the removal of trust from the administrator.","During processing associated with a \u201cTransmit NO GO\u201d block , a signal is transmitted to EPD  that the corresponding application or process should not be allowed to execute. Queries for fingerprints that do not result in known trusted fingerprints causes EPD  to block the application's execution which protects the user from unauthorized access to their information or misuse of their computer resources.","During processing associated with a \u201cPolicy Change?\u201d block , a determination is made as to whether or not the failure of the application to be approved necessitates a change in policy (see , ). If so, control proceeds to an \u201cUpdate Policy\u201d block . During processing associated with block , the appropriate policy is updated in client data  of FDS . Once policy has been updated, or, if, during processing associated with block , a determination is made that policy does not need to be updated, control returns to Wait for Request\u201d block , process waits for the next request and processing continues as described above.","Finally, process  is halted by means of a termination interrupt , which passes control to an \u201cEnd Operate WCS\u201d block  in which process  is complete.
