{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention relates to a decoder for a digital audiovisual transmission system, the decoder comprising a processor means for decompressing and displaying compressed digital picture data and a memory means.","Broadcast transmission of digital data is well-known in the field of pay TV systems, where scrambled audiovisual information is sent, usually by a satellite or satellite\/cable link, to a number of subscribers, each subscriber possessing a decoder capable of descrambling the transmitted program for subsequent viewing. Terrestrial digital broadcast systems are also known. Recent systems have used the broadcast link to transmit other data, in addition to or as well as audiovisual data, such as computer programs or interactive applications.","In the most basic level of functionality of such systems, digital audio and video data relating to the televised program is transmitted in a compressed format, for example, in accordance with the MPEG-2 compression standard. The decoder receives and decompresses this data in order to regenerate the televised program.","In addition to simple televised program data, it is becoming increasingly common for the decoder to be required to handle other compressed image or graphic data. For example, in the case where the decoder includes web browser capabilities, the processor of the decoder may be required to receive and decompress downloaded digital picture data, for example, still video pictures, graphic icons etc. This picture information may be displayed over the normal televised program images.","Such still or moving picture data may be typically received in one of any number of compressed formats that are currently used in the context of PC based web browsers. For example, a picture may be formatted and compressed according to the well-known GIF or PNG standards, where an image is described by a colour look-up table defining a table of colours and a matrix of pixel values referring to this table, the matrix data being compressed according to a known compression procedure to prepare the GIF\/PNG picture. Alternatively, the picture may be formatted and compressed as a still MPEG or JPEG image, in which each pixel is directly associated with a red\/green\/blue colour value.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a means of efficiently handling such downloaded still picture files.","According to the present invention, there is provided a decoder for a digital audiovisual transmission system, the decoder including a processor for decompressing and displaying compressed still picture data and a memory, characterised in that the memory comprises a storage memory allocated to receive from the processor decompressed data representing a plurality of still picture images, and at least one display memory adapted to hold data representing multiple still picture images readable by the processor prior to display, the data representing the plurality of still picture images being copied from the storage memory to the display memory for subsequent display.","This division of the memory into a storage and display memory areas introduces a degree of flexibility into the display of still image data, in particular by permitting data representing a given still picture image to be held at the same time in both the storage and display means. Data representing one or more still pictures may be held indefinitely in the storage memory as long as there is a possible requirement for this data, even after the picture has been removed from the screen by deletion of the data from the display memory.","In some instances, decompressed image data may simply be copied \u201cas is\u201d into the display memory. However, in some cases, the digital image data copied from the storage memory into the display memory is modified or duplicated during the copying step, for example, in order to resize the digital image or to copy the same image a number of times into the display memory.","Preferably, the processor means is adapted to process image data in the display memory as one layer amongst a plurality of layers superimposed one over the other when displayed.","As discussed above, picture data may be superimposed in a higher layer over, for example, audiovisual information representing normal televised images. However, in one embodiment, the image data in the display memory may be displayed in a layer normally used by the processor means to display broadcast audiovisual information. This may be the case, for example, where the decoder switches from a \u201ctelevision\u201d mode, in which a broadcast emission is displayed, to a \u201cweb browser\u201d mode, in which downloaded picture data from the internet is displayed in place of normal televised programmes.","Advantageously, the memory comprises a second display memory readable by the graphic processor means and corresponding to a second layer of displayed image data, data being copied from the storage memory to the second display memory for subsequent display in the second layer of image data.","Again, as before, the digital image data copied from the storage memory to the second display memory may be modified during the copying step.","In one embodiment, for example, where the decoder switches between a television and browser mode, the image data in the second display memory may be displayed in the lowermost background layer normally used by the processor means to display broadcast still audiovisual information.","Preferably, partial image data is copied from the storage memory to a display memory under the control of an application running within the decoder so as to permit display of part of an image. This may be desirable, for example, where the decompression and downloading of an image into the storage memory by the processor proceeds in a number of stages.","In one embodiment, image data is copied from the storage memory into a first or second display memory under control of a high level application running in the processor. Alternatively, this process may be handled automatically by a lower level application associated for example with the general handling of received image data.","Compressed digital picture data is preferably stored in a buffer memory prior to decompression by the processor. It is not necessary that this buffer means be a single integral block of memory particularly if the data arrives in a number of blocks of information. In particular, in one embodiment, the buffer comprises a plurality of buffer memory elements. Each memory element may correspond, for example to a block of data downloaded in the decoder.","Preferably, the decompression and transfer of image data from the buffer memory elements to the storage memory, and from the storage memory to a display memory, is controlled by the processor such that image information present in the storage memory is transferred to the display memory at the end of the decompression of the contents of each buffer element.","It may be the case, for example, that information corresponding to one image will be spread over a number of buffer elements. As each buffer is emptied and decompressed, the information ready for display is transferred immediately to the display memory, enabling a partial display of the complete image.","In addition, or alternatively, the decompression and transfer of a group of images in a single image file from the buffer memory to the storage memory, and from the storage memory to a display memory, is controlled by the processor such that image information is transferred from the storage memory to the display memory at the end of the decompression of each image in the image file.","As discussed above, image data may be sent in any number of formats. In one embodiment, the processor is adapted to decompress picture data sent in a compression standard, such as GIF or PNG, that uses a colour look-up table.","In addition or alternatively, the processor is adapted to decompress picture data sent in a compression standard, such MPEG or JPEG, that uses a red\/blue\/green colour value associated with each pixel.","All functions of decompression, display etc. may be integrated in a single processor. Alternatively, the processor in the decoder need not necessarily be embodied in a single chip but may be divided, for example, into a general processor handling data decompression and a graphic processor for preparing the decompressed data for display.","Similarly, whilst the application may refer to a storage memory, a display memory etc. it is to be understood that these need not correspond to physically separate memory devices (RAM, ROM, FLASH, etc.) but may correspond to one or more areas allocated for this purpose by a controlling application and divided between one or more physical memory devices.","The present invention has been discussed above in relation to a decoder apparatus. The present invention equally extends to a method of digital image processing within a decoder, corresponding to the general and preferred aspects of the invention discussed above.","In the context of the present application the term \u201cdigital audiovisual transmission system\u201d refers to all transmission systems for transmitting or broadcasting primarily audiovisual or multimedia digital data. Whilst the present invention is particularly applicable to a broadcast digital television system, the present invention may equally be used in filtering data sent by a fixed telecommunications network for multimedia internet applications etc.","Similarly, the term \u201cdecoder\u201d is used to apply to an integrated receiver\/decoder for receiving and decrypting an encrypted transmission, the receiver and decoder elements of such a system as considered separately, as well as to a receiver capable of receiving non-encrypted broadcasts. The term equally covers decoders including additional functions, such as web browsers, together with decoders integrated with other devices, for example, integrated VHS\/decoder devices, digital televisions, or the like.","The term MPEG refers to the data transmission standards developed by the International Standards Organisation working group \u201cMotion Pictures Expert Group\u201d and notably the MPEG-2 standard developed for digital television applications and set out in the documents ISO 13818-1, ISO 13818-2, ISO 13818-3, and ISO 13818-4. In the context of the present patent application, the term includes all variants, modifications or developments of the basic MPEG formats applicable to the field of digital data transmission.","An overview of a digital television system  according to the present invention is shown in . The invention includes a mostly conventional digital television system  that uses the known MPEG-2 compression system to transmit compressed digital signals. In more detail, MPEG-2 compressor  in a broadcast centre receives a digital signal stream (typically a stream of video signals). The compressor  is connected to a multiplexer and scrambler  by linkage .","The multiplexer  receives a plurality of further input signals, assembles the transport stream and transmits compressed digital signals to a transmitter  of the broadcast centre via linkage , which can of course take a wide variety of forms including telecommunications links. The transmitter  transmits electromagnetic signals via uplink  towards a satellite transponder , where they are electronically processed and broadcast via notional downlink  to earth receiver , conventionally in the form of a dish owned or rented by the end user. The signals received by receiver  are transmitted to an integrated receiver\/decoder  owned or rented by the end user and connected to the end user's television set . The receiver\/decoder  decodes the compressed MPEG-2 signal into a television signal for the television set .","Other transport channels for transmission of the data are of course possible, such as terrestrial broadcast, cable transmission, combined satellite\/cable links, telephone networks etc.","In a multichannel system, the multiplexer  handles audio and video information received from a number of parallel sources and interacts with the transmitter  to broadcast the information along a corresponding number of channels. In addition to audiovisual information, messages or applications or any other sort of digital data may be introduced in some or all of these channels interlaced with the transmitted digital audio and video information.","A conditional access system  is connected to the multiplexer  and the receiver\/decoder , and is located partly in the broadcast centre and partly in the decoder. It enables the end user to access digital television broadcasts from one or more broadcast suppliers. A smartcard, capable of deciphering messages relating to commercial offers (that is, one or several television programmes sold by the broadcast supplier), can be inserted into the receiver\/decoder . Using the decoder  and smartcard, the end user may purchase commercial offers in either a subscription mode or a pay-per-view mode.","As mentioned above, programmes transmitted by the system are scrambled at the multiplexer , the conditions and encryption keys applied to a given transmission being determined by the access control system . Transmission of scrambled data in this way is well known in the field of pay TV systems. Typically, scrambled data is transmitted together with a control word for descrambling of the data, the control word itself being encrypted by a so-called exploitation key and transmitted in encrypted form.","The scrambled data and encrypted control word are then received by the decoder  having access to an equivalent of the exploitation key stored on a smart card inserted in the decoder to decrypt the encrypted control word and thereafter descramble the transmitted data. A paid-up subscriber will receive, for example, in a broadcast monthly ECM (Entitlement Control Message) the exploitation key necessary to decrypt the encrypted control word so as to permit viewing of the transmission.","An interactive system , also connected to the multiplexer  and the receiver\/decoder  and again located partly in the broadcast centre and partly in the decoder, enables the end user to interact with various applications via a modem back channel . The modem back channel may also be used for communications used in the conditional access system . An interactive system may be used, for example, to enable the viewer to communicate immediately with the transmission centre to demand authorisation to watch a particular event, download an application etc.","Referring to , the elements of the receiver\/decoder  or set-top box adapted to be used in the present invention will now be described. The elements shown in this figure will be described in terms of functional blocks.","The decoder  comprises a central processor  including associated memory elements and adapted to receive input data from a serial interface , a parallel interface , a modem  (connected to the modem back channel  of ), and switch contacts  on the front panel of the decoder.","The decoder is additionally adapted to receive inputs from an infra-red remote control  via a control unit  and also possesses two smartcard readers ,  adapted to read bank or subscription smartcards ,  respectively. The subscription smartcard reader  engages with an inserted subscription card  and with a conditional access unit  to supply the necessary control word to a demultiplexer\/descrambler  to enable the encrypted broadcast signal to be descrambled. The decoder also includes a conventional tuner  and demodulator  to receive and demodulate the satellite transmission before being filtered and demultiplexed by the unit .","Processing of data within the decoder is generally handled by the central processor . The software architecture of the central processor corresponds to a virtual machine interacting via an interface layer with a lower level operating system implemented in the hardware components of the decoder. This will now be described with reference to .","For the purposes of this description, an application is a piece of computer code for controlling high level functions of the receiver\/decoder . For example, when the end user positions the focus of a remote controller on a button object seen on the screen of the television set and presses a validation key, the instruction sequence associated with the button is run.","An interactive application proposes menus and executes commands at the request of the end user and provides data related to the purpose of the application. Applications may be either resident applications, that is, stored in the ROM (or FLASH or other non-volatile memory) of the receiver\/decoder , or broadcast and downloaded into the RAM or FLASH memory of the receiver\/decoder .","Applications are stored in memory locations in the receiver\/decoder  and represented as resource files. The resource files comprise graphic object description unit files, variables block unit files, instruction sequence files, application files and data files.","The receiver\/decoder contains memory divided into a RAM volume, a FLASH volume and a ROM volume, but this physical organization is distinct from the logical organization. The memory may further be divided into memory volumes associated with the various interfaces. From one point of view, the memory can be regarded as part of the hardware; from another point of view, the memory can be regarded as supporting or containing the whole of the system shown apart from the hardware.","Referring to , the computer system can be regarded as centred on a run time engine  forming part of a virtual machine . This is coupled to applications on one side (the \u201chigh level\u201d side), and, on the other side (the \u201clow level\u201d side), via various intermediate logical units discussed below, to the receiver\/decoder hardware . The receiver\/decoder hardware can be regarded as including various ports corresponding to the functional blocks discussed in relation to  (the interface  for the handset , the MPEG stream interface , the serial interface , the parallel interface , the interfaces to the card readers , , and the interface  to the modemmed back channel ).","Various applications  are coupled to the virtual machine . Some of the more commonly used applications may be more or less permanently resident in the system, as indicated at , while others will be downloaded into the system, eg from the MPEG data stream or from other ports as required.","The virtual machine  includes, in addition to the run time engine , some resident library functions  which include a toolbox . The library contains miscellaneous functions in C language used by the engine . These include data manipulation such as compression, expansion or comparison of data structures, line drawing, etc. The library  also includes information about device drivers  in the firmware of the receiver\/decoder, such as hardware and software version numbers and available RAM space, and a function used when downloading a new device . Functions can be downloaded into the library and stored in FLASH or RAM memory.","The run time engine  is coupled to a device manager  which is coupled to a set of devices  which are coupled to device drivers  which are in turn coupled to the ports or interfaces. In broad terms, a device driver can be regarded as defining a logical interface, so that two different device drivers may be coupled to a common physical port. A device will normally be coupled to more than one device driver; if a device is coupled to a single device driver, the device will normally be designed to incorporate the full functionality required for communication, so that the need for a separate device driver is obviated. Certain devices may communicate among themselves.","As will be described below, there are three forms of communication from the devices  up to the run time engine: by means of variables, buffers, and events which are passed to a set of event queues.","Each function of the receiver\/decoder is represented as a device . Devices can be either local or remote. Local devices include smartcards, SCART connector signals, modems, serial and parallel interfaces, a MPEG video and audio player and an MPEG section and table extractor. Remote devices executed in a remote location, differ from local devices in that a port and procedure must be defined by the system authority or designer, rather than by a device and device driver provided and designated by the receiver\/decoder manufacturer.","The run time engine  runs under the control of the microprocessor and a common application programming interface. They are installed in every receiver\/decoder so that all receiver\/decoders are identical from the application point of view.","The engine  runs applications  on the receiver\/decoder. It executes interactive applications and receives events from outside the receiver\/decoder, displays graphics and text, calls devices for services and uses functions of the library  connected to the engine  for specific computation.","The run time engine  is an executable code installed in each receiver\/decoder, and includes an interpreter for interpreting and running applications. The engine is adaptable to any operating system, including a single task operating system (such as MS-DOS). The engine is based on process sequencer units (which take various events such as a key press, to carry out various actions), and contains its own scheduler to manage event queues from the different hardware interfaces. It also handles the display of graphics and text. A process sequencer unit comprises a set of action-groups. Each event causes the process sequencer unit to move from its current action-group to another action-group in dependence on the character of the event, and to execute the actions of the new action-group.","The engine  comprises a code loader to load and download applications  into the receiver\/decoder memory. Only the necessary code is loaded into the RAM or FLASH memory, in order to ensure optimal use. The downloaded data is verified by an authentication mechanism to prevent any modification of an application  or the execution of any unauthorized application. The engine  further comprises a decompressor. As the application code (a form of intermediate code) is compressed for space saving and fast downloading from the MPEG stream or via a built-in receiver\/decoder mode, the code must be decompressed before loading it into the RAM. The engine  also comprises an interpreter to interpret the application code to update various variable values and determine status changes, and an error checker.","Before using the services of any device , a program (such as an application instruction sequence) has to be declared as a \u201cclient\u201d, that is, a logical access-way to the device  or the device manager . The manager gives the client a client number which is referred to in all accesses to the device. A device  can have several clients, the number of clients for each device  being specified depending on the type of device. A client is introduced to the device  by a procedure \u201cdevice: Open Channel\u201d. This procedure assigns a client number to the client. A client can be taken out of the device manager  client list by a procedure \u201cDevice: Close Channel\u201d.","The access to devices  provided by the device manager  can be either synchronous or asynchronous. For synchronous access, a procedure \u201cDevice: Call\u201d is used. This is a means of accessing data which is immediately available or a functionality which does not involve waiting for the desired response. For asynchronous access, a procedure \u201cDevice: I\/O\u201d is used. This is a means of accessing data which involves waiting for a response, for example scanning tuner frequencies to find a multiplex or getting back a table from the MPEG stream. When the requested result is available, an event is put in the queue of the engine to signal its arrival. A further procedure \u201cDevice. Event\u201d provides a means of managing unexpected events.","As noted above, the main loop of the run time engine is coupled to a variety of process sequencer units, and when the main loop encounters an appropriate event, control is temporarily transferred to one of the process sequencer units.","Thus, it can be seen that the computer system implemented in the processor  provides a platform having considerable flexibility in enabling an application to communicate with a variety of devices.","Returning to , the processing of sound and image data by each of the associated processors will now be described in detail. In the case of received audio and video signals, the MPEG packets containing these signals will be demultiplexed and filtered so as to pass real time audio and video data in the form of a packetised elementary stream (PES) of audio and video data to dedicated audio and video processors or decoders , . The converted output from the audio processor  passes to a preamplifier  and thereafter via the audio output of the receiver\/decoder. The converted output from the video processor  passes via a graphic processor  and PAL\/SECAM encoder  to the video output of the receiver\/decoder. The video processor may be of a conventional type, such as the ST 3520 A of SGS Thomson.","The graphic processor  additionally receives graphic data for display (such as generated images etc) from the central processor  and combines this information with information received from the video processor  to generate a screen display combining moving images together with overlaid text or other images. An example of a graphic processor adapted to carry out this sort of operation is the CL 9310 of C-CUBE.","In the case of received teletext and\/or subtitle data, the conversion of the real time PES data to generate the appropriate images may also be handled by dedicated processors. However, in most conventional systems, this is handled by the general processor .","In point of fact, many of functions associated with the elements such as the graphic processor , video decoder , central processor  etc. may be combined or divided out in a number of ways, e.g. to integrate the central and graphic processors to form a single processor means etc.","Referring now to , the functionality of the graphic processor  will now be described. As discussed above, the graphic processor receives and processes real time video data from the video decoder  together with graphic data received from the general processor  in order to generate an overlaid screen display.","As shown in , the graphic processor  is adapted to process input data divided into four distinct layers; a background layer , an MPEG layer , a graphic layer  and a cursor layer . As will be understood, the background layer  corresponds to the lowest layer of the screen display, the other layers being progressively superimposed with varying degrees of translucency or opacity over this layer.","In the case where the decoder is configured to display a broadcast video signal, the background and MPEG layers ,  correspond to the stream of data received from the video decoder , the layer  corresponding to MPEG still pictures received from the decoder  and the layer  corresponding to a moving video MPEG signal received from the decoder. The division of a video signal into a fixed and a changing part is a known characteristic of MPEG compression. Other configurations of the decoder are possible, for example, where the background and MPEG layers ,  are completed by picture data in any number of formats received from the processor . For example, in the case where the decoder is acting in web browser configuration, the processor  may supply still and\/or moving picture data to complete the layers , . The layer  may equally correspond, for example, to a background colour and the layer  to one or more windows displayed over the background and containing, for example, information, moving icons or the like. The operation of the system in handling picture data will be discussed in more below with reference to .","Still and moving image data from the background and MPEG layers ,  are mixed together by the graphic processor , as represented by the element , and a combined output provided. Mixing of the MPEG layer information  over the background layer  by the graphic processor may carried out using a so-called alpha blending factor to permit a greater or lesser degree of translucency of the pixels in the MPEG layer image. In the case of a moving video image received from the video decoder , the same blending factor is used for all pixels within the video sequence. In the case of picture data from the central processor , the value of the blending factor for the layer  may be different for different parts of the screen.","The graphic layer  is used for texts, shapes, icons etc that will be displayed on the screen over the images taken from the layers , , for example, to permit display of a moving icon or the like generated by the processor  over a real-time video sequence taken from the video decoder .","In a similar manner to the blending carried out for the layers , , the element  carries out a blending of the graphic layer  with the combined output of the layers , . Different regions within the graphic layer  may be assigned a different blending factor and a corresponding different level of translucency depending on the characteristics of the data within each region.","A final layer, the cursor layer, is shown at  and represents an opaque cursor image, generated by hardware under control of the central processor  and superimposed over all the previous layers. As shown at , this layer is combined with the summed output from the combination of all previous layers to generate a final combined output  sent to the encoder  for subsequent display. Unlike the previous layers, the cursor presents a continuously opaque appearance and is superimposed over the combined layers without any blending.","Referring to , the operation of a device  of the kind shown in  and adapted to decompress and display downloaded picture images in the MPEG layer  will now be described. In the following description, the term picture is used to describe a compressed digital image. Typically, the sorts of picture formats used may include MPEG still picture, JPEG format picture, PNG format picture, GIF format picture, etc.","Whilst the following description will concentrate on the processing and display of a single picture, a sequence of still pictures may be displayed one after the other in order to generate a moving image sequence.","Referring to , downloaded compressed picture data , ,  is initially stored in a buffer section of the RAM memory of the decoder indicated at . This buffer memory may be of a type initialised and managed by a high level application  responsible for decoding and displaying images, or an area of memory handled by the device manager  shown in .","Each type of picture file or group of picture files includes a header indicating the picture file format (GIF, MPEG, etc.) as well as the information needed to decompress the picture file. For example, a GIF format file  comprising more than one picture has a global header describing the size of the overall area where the two decompressed images will be displayed and a specific header for each picture describing its size and location coordinates within the overall area.","Following downloading of a compressed picture into the buffer section  of the memory, a decompression of the picture data will be effected by the device in response to a command PICTURE_DECOMPRESS received from the application. The subsequently decompressed image data , ,  is stocked in a separate storage section of the RAM memory indicated at  and reserved for image data eventually to be displayed in the MPEG layer. Each decompressed image or image sequence is given an image identity reference Id, Id, Id by the device, this ID value being supplied to the high level application and used for all subsequent operations to be carried out on this data.","Unlike the compressed picture data temporarily held in the application buffer , the decompressed image data , ,  may be held indefinitely in the storage memory  until such time as the application decides to delete the information.","The storage of decompressed image data in a distinct assigned memory area permits the data to be manipulated in a number of ways prior to display. For example, a resizing of the image may be carried out, either by the device itself, the device manager or by a higher level application. Equally, the image may be duplicated in order to be displayed at a number of positions on the screen. Conversion of colour data associated the image, for example to compensate for limitations in the functionality of the graphic processor, may also be carried out on the image.","Modified or unmodified data stored in the memory  is passed, in response to a command PICTURE_DISPLAY from the application, into a separate RAM memory section  assigned for images to be displayed in the MPEG layer  (see ). The size of the display memory  corresponds to the screen area. As shown, the images Id and Id are displayed at  and , whilst the image or sequence of images Id is duplicated and displayed at the positions , . The information in the memory section  is fed to the graphic processor  in order to create the MPEG layer , as shown in .","In addition to the transfer of image information between the storage area  and display area , a second transfer may also be carried out to copy information held in the storage area  into a memory area (not shown) associated with the display of images in the background layer  of . For example, a single image may be replicated and displayed a number of times in the background layer in order to cover the screen in a tiling manner. The information stored in the memory area associated with the background layer is accessed by the graphic processor in the same manner as the MPEG display area .","As will be understood, the memory sections , ,  do not need to physically correspond to uninterrupted memory zones in a single RAM or other memory element. In particular, the memory area  may be divided between a number of buffers.  shows the steps associated with the decompression of a file  containing two compressed pictures ,  previously downloaded into four associated buffer elements or lists of buffers , , , .","Each buffer list corresponds to the buffer areas in which a block of data has been downloaded from the MPEG stream. The buffer list itself may designate a number of separate buffer areas depending on availability as the information is downloaded.","At step , the application sends a PICTURE_DECOMPRESS command  to start the decompression process. The device allocates a group image Id and starts read the buffers. Once the start of a picture is found at step , the device assigns an image Id and starts decompression of the image. At step , the end of the first buffer list is reached and the application sends a PICTUREADD_DATA command at step  to command the device to read the next buffer list in the series.","At this point, only part of the image of the first picture  has been decompressed and stored in the memory storage area . The application may nevertheless decide to immediately transfer the partial image to the display memory area .","The decompression of the remaining part of the picture  then continues until the start of the next picture is found at . At this point, the whole of the first picture  has been decompressed and stored in the memory area . The application may then update the contents of the display memory area  by copying the complete image into the display area . In this way, the whole of the first picture  may be displayed before the second picture has been decompressed.","At step , the device informs the application of the end of the second buffer list  and the application sends a second PICTURE_ADD_DATA command  to start the reading of the next buffer list . The process is repeated at the end of the third buffer list  and beginning of the fourth buffer list  by the steps , . Again, each time the end of a buffer is reached at , , the application may copy the data that has already been decompressed from the storage area  into the display area .","At step , the end of the file is reached and both the pictures ,  have been decompressed and loaded into the storage memory . At this point, the device informs the application of the successful decompression of the whole file and the application again copies the contents of the storage memory  into the display memory  to display the complete set of pictures."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"p":["There will now be described, by way of example only, a preferred embodiment of the present invention, with reference to the attached figures, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
