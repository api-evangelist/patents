No. 10\/038,026 entitled \u201cMETHOD OF ENABLING THE TRANSMISSION OF DATA IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION NETWORK\u201d (TC00151), and","U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/038,433 entitled \u201cMETHOD OF SELECTING A COMMUNICATION INTERFACE TO TRANSMIT DATA IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION NETWORK\u201d (TC00152).","This invention relates generally to communication systems, and in particular, to a method of optimizing the transmission of data in a wireless communication network.","There is an ever increasing demand for wireless communications. Wireless subscribers desire to have access to information at any time and at any place. One of the fastest growing markets for providing wireless services is known as \u201ctelematics\u201d and entails delivering a wide spectrum of information via wireless links to vehicle-based subscribers. The information can originate from multiple sources, such as the Internet and other public, private, and\/or government computer-based networks; wireless telecommunications such as cellular, Personal Communication Service (PCS), satellite, land-mobile, and the like; terrestrial and satellite direct broadcasts including traditional AM\/FM bands, broadband, television, video, geolocation and navigation via a global position system (GPS), and the like; concierge services providing roadside assistance, emergency calling, remote-door unlocking, accident reporting, travel conditions, vehicle security, stolen vehicle recovery, remote vehicle diagnostics, and the like; advertising services identifying names and locations of businesses such as gas stations, restaurants, hotels, stores, and offices, and the like; tourist services such as points of interest, directions, hours of access, and the like; and many other sources that can provide information of any type. Many of the above services are not universally available, but rather they are transient in both the time and geoposition domains.","Information can be communicated to telematics devices over relatively long wireless links, such as from a satellite or terrestrial node, or from relatively short wireless or wired links, such as from in-vehicle equipment or from hand-held devices like PDAs, portable computers, cellular phones, and the like. The services provided by telematics systems are not restricted to vehicle-based subscribers, and they can also be provided to subscribers at home, at work, or elsewhere.","As telematics communication systems continue to evolve, a telematics communication unit of a vehicle will have a greater number of communication interfaces. However, as for any wireless communication device which is mobile, the device could move in and out of areas which are covered by various wireless communication networks. Further, the various wireless communication networks which may be available to a telematics communication unit of a vehicle have different communication capabilities and characteristics, such as bandwidth, or bit rate, error rate, latency, etc. These different communication networks may also have different costs associated with the transmission of data. Accordingly, there is a need for a method of optimizing the transmission of data in a wireless communication network in order to provide services at an efficient cost.","Turning first to , an exemplary information appliance system , according to one embodiment of the invention, is shown. Shown in  are examples of components of the information appliance system , which comprises a plurality of servers  coupled to a regional node , and a plurality of local nodes  coupled to the regional node .

The regional node  can be coupled to a network, such as the Internet , and to any number of concierge services .","Servers , while illustrated as coupled to regional node , could be implemented at any hierarchical level(s) within information appliance system . For example, servers  could also be implemented within one or more local nodes , concierge service , and Internet . Without limitation, local node  can be a kiosk, cell site, local area network (LAN), telephone company, cable company, satellite, or any other information service, structure, or entity that can transmit, receive, and\/or communicate information.

User nodes  can also transmit and\/or receive data to and from devices and services other than local node . For example, user nodes  can transmit and receive data to and from a satellite .","The information appliance system  including the user nodes  is preferably capable of utilizing audio data in any number of encoding methods from any number of sources that include, but are not limited to, ADPCM (adaptive differential pulse-code modulation); CD-DA (compact disc\u2014digital audio) digital audio specification; and ITU (International Telecommunications Union) Standards G.711,G.722,G.723 & G.728.

The client platform software comprises three general layers: applications , foundation software  upon which the applications  are supported, and platform-specific software . In one embodiment, the upper two layers are implemented in the Java\u2122 programming language, available from various suppliers, including Sun Microsystems, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif. One advantage of the Java\u2122 programming language is the support of code distribution in a platform-independent manner.","The lowest layer, i.e. the platform-specific software , comprises a real-time operating system , a virtual machine platform (such as the Java\u2122 2 Virtual Machine, available from Sun Microsystems, Inc.) and associated classes , and a native library interface .","Referring to , applications  can comprise an extremely wide variety of informational, safety, query, communications, entertainment, and other applications, for example navigation , weather , stocks , traffic , news , and others  of any type.

It allows physical buttons to be referenced by logical names. It manages different sets of buttons, such as preset buttons, application buttons, and so on.","Personal information manager (PIM) service  supports functions to enhance user productivity, such as an address book, a calendar, a memo management capability, and so forth. The address book can comprise information that is up-loaded from a PDA, entered by voice or by keys from the user, downloaded from the Internet, and so forth.","Trip plan service  provides a variety of trip-planning functions, such as route and map retrieval, route-planning, determination of route distance, etc.","Position service  provides abstract positioning application programming interfaces (API) to support a variety of position-determining mechanisms, such as GPS, differential GPS, in-road transmitters, cellular base stations, etc.","Profile service  provides server-based profiles for users, devices, vehicles, etc. It assists in the application configuration.

Additional information regarding client platform  as well as a service platform can be found in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/662,441, (TC00033) entitled \u201cService Framework with Hidden Services\u201d, filed on Sep. 15, 2000 and having a common inventor as the inventor of the present application, which application is incorporated in its entirety by reference.","Finally, connection manager  manages connection(s) of the client platform  to one or more networks, such as geographically distributed cellular and server networks. It ensures continuity of sessions across physical and\/or logical network interfaces. It can require security (e.g. authentication, encryption, etc.) as a precondition to a connection. It can ensure that low bandwidth connections are used efficiently. More specifically, the connection manager manages multiple interfaces and reports concurrent use of more than one interface, either by the same or different applications. The connection manager also enables an interface to be used for both streams and datagrams at the same time. In particular, the transport layer enables the flow of data between two hosts for an application. Streams are transmitted by the connection oriented transmission control protocol (TCP) which enables the reliable flow between two hosts by dividing data into blocks and receiving acknowledgments when the data is received. In contrast, datagrams are transmitted by the less reliable user datagram protocol (UDP), which is also well known in the art.","Turning now to , a flow chart shows a method of optimizing the transmission of data in a wireless communication network according to the present invention. In particular, a first communication interface to transmit data of a first application is acquired for a first period of time at a step . The first communication interface could be any wireless communication interface, such as a cellular, satellite, land mobile, paging, or other wireless communication device provided by extra vehicular interface transmitter\/receiver  or intra-vehicle interface  of FIG. . The user node  of the vehicle could acquire the first communication interface for a predetermined time, such as a predetermined number of minutes. The user node  of the vehicle then transmits a first block of data for a second period of time which is less than the first period of time at a step . That is, the user node  transmits data associated with a first application on the first communication interface for a period of time which is less than the first period of time for which it acquired the communication interface. The wireless communication device of the vehicle then transmits a second block of data associated with a second application for a portion of a first period of time on the first communication interface at a step . Accordingly, the remaining portion of the first period of time which is not used for transmitting data related to a first application can be used to transmit data related to a second application.","Turning now to , a flow chart shows a method for optimizing the transmission of data in a wireless communication network according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention. A first communication interface is acquired for a first period of time at a step . The first communication interface could be provided by any wireless communication interface associated with the user node  described in reference to FIG. . For example, the communication interface could enable wireless communications on any cellular, paging, satellite or other wireless communication network. A first block of data associated with a first application is transmitted on the first communication interface for a period of time less than the first period of time at a step . It is then determined whether additional data associated with a second application is available to be sent at a step . If there is additional data associated with a second application to be sent, it is then determined whether the additional data can be sent on the first communication interface at a step . That is, assuming that the user node  is within range of the wireless communication network associated with the communication interfaces, it is determined whether the available bandwidth, latency bit, rate, error rate, cost or other channel parameters are acceptable to transmit data associated with the second application. If the additional data can be sent, a block of data is associated with the second application transmitted on the remaining time of the first period of time at a step .","The method of  finds particular application when capacity on a wireless communication is sold in a block of time, such as a predetermined number of minutes. Because the user has already been charged for the entire first period of time, any use of the remaining portion of time is financially beneficial to the subscriber of the telematics communication services having the user node . Although the cost of transmitting data on the first communication interface may be greater than the desired cost associated with the second application, it is still financially beneficial to utilize the remaining portion of the first period of time on the first communication interface to transmit data for the second application. Preferably, the transmission of data on the second application would be \u201cbilled\u201d or allocated to the second application at the normal or desired rate for the second application, which may be less than the normal rate for the first communication interface.","Turning now to , a flow chart shows a method of enabling transmission of data in a wireless communication network according to the present invention. In particular, an application, such as one of the applications described in reference to , requests notification of the availability of a communication interface at a step . For example, an application of  could request that the connection manager  notify it when a communication interface meeting certain criteria becomes available. The communication interface could be any communication interface described in reference to FIG. . It should be noted that the applications may have varying requirements which could be met by different interfaces, while a number of different communication interfaces may be acceptable for a given application.","It is determined that a communication interface of a plurality of communication interfaces has become available at a step . An application is then informed that a desirable communication interface has become available at a step . The application then provides data to be transmitted on the communication interface at a step . Accordingly, an application is informed of the availability of a communication interface and can determine whether it desires to make data available for transmission when a particular communication interface is available.","Turning now to , a method for enabling the transmission of data in a wireless communication network according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention is shown. A plurality of communication interfaces of a wireless communication device are monitored at a step . It is then determined whether a first communication interface has become available at a step . At least one application is then informed, for example, by the connection manager , that the first communication interface has become available at a step . Information related to the first communication interface is then provided to the application at a step . For example, information related to the characteristics of the communication interface are provided to the application to enable the application to determine whether the communication interface is acceptable for transmitting data. Alternatively, the application could be informed that a particular communication interface is available only if the communication interface is known to be acceptable for the application.","It is then determined whether an application has data to be sent at a step . If the application has additional data to be sent and the first communication interface is appropriate for the application, the application provides the data to be transmitted by the communication interface at a step . Accordingly, by informing the application that a particular communication interface is available, an application can determine whether it is desirable to transmit data on the available communication interface.","Turning now to , a flow chart shows a method of selecting a communication interface to transmit data in a wireless communication network according to the present invention. In particular, a plurality of communication interfaces, such as the communication interface related to user node  and described in reference to , are provided for a wireless communication device, such as user node , at a step . At least one communication interface of the plurality of communication interfaces is polled by an application, such as an application described in reference to , to determine if it is available at a step . It is then determined that the at least one communication interface has become available at a step . By enabling the application to poll the communication interfaces, the application can acquire a desirable communication interface to transmit data according to the present invention.","Turning now to , a flow chart shows a method for selecting a communication interface to transmit data in a wireless communication network according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention.

At least one communication interface is then polled by an application, such as an application described in reference to , at a step . It is then determined whether the at least one communication interface is available at a step . For example, assuming that the wireless communication device is within range of the communication network associated with an acceptable communication interface, it is determined whether the communication interface is already in use by another application. If the at least one communication interface is available, the at least one communication interface is acquired at a step  and data is transmitted on the communication interface at a step .","It can therefore be appreciated that a new and novel method of optimizing the transmission of data in a wireless communication network has been described. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, given the teaching herein, numerous alternatives and equivalent will be seen to exist which incorporate the disclosed invention.
