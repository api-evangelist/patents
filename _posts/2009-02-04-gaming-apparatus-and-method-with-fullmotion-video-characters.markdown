Apparatus  can generally be a game of chance and can include a multitude of graphic images (e.g., screen shots, video shots, pictures, etc.) or representations thereof. A player pays money (or some other form of credits) to play the game, which includes a circuit configured in one or more modules (e.g., software and\/or hardware) and to rotate or otherwise jumble the graphics. If the graphic images line up in some predetermined pattern, the player wins. According to an exemplary embodiment, gaming apparatus  includes a user interface  and a display . Gaming apparatus  may include a slot to receive coins and\/or tokens or a magnetic reader to accept credit cards or other items with a magnetic strip. Gaming apparatus  can also include an account login feature that allows a user to log into gaming apparatus  with account information (e.g., a username and password) to access pre-stored money or credits (e.g., a player's club account, a credit card associated with a hotel room, etc.).","User interface  allows a player to start and otherwise control gaming apparatus  and select various options (e.g., number of credits to wager, the gender of the model or character, etc.). As shown in , interface  includes a multitude of buttons provided below display . According to other exemplary embodiments, user interface  may include a traditional lever, or any other suitable tactile input device. User interface  may be integrated with display  (e.g., a touch screen) or may be provided separately from display  as shown in . User interface  can be a single user interface element (e.g., a single lever or button) or include a plurality of user interface elements.","According to an exemplary embodiment, gaming apparatus  operates as a video slot machine and display  is configured to show graphical representations of three or more \u201creels\u201d (e.g., screen portions, screens, etc.). As described below, display  changes depending on whether the machine is idle, in use, or in play. While most slot machines include reels with various symbols such as images of fruits or simple shapes such as bells, diamonds, or hearts, gaming apparatus  includes images of models or other characters. The models can be clothed in various sets of clothing. Gaming apparatus  can be configured to allow a player to win by completing a set of clothing.","Referring also to , in an idle mode, when no one is playing, display  shows static images or video of a model  (e.g., video of a real person) in a bathrobe or other clothing. Model  may stand still, dance, shift his or her weight, look bored, or may otherwise be moving or stationary. Audio may be periodically played through an audio system  to encourage a user to play. The audio may match the static images or video of model . Model  may be one of several male or female models that a user can choose from when playing gaming apparatus . The choice regarding model  can be made at the beginning of a user's gaming session, between tries at the game, or otherwise, based on inputs received from user input device . According to an exemplary embodiment, different models are associated with different bets. In yet other exemplary embodiments, different models are associated with different potential pay-outs or odds of winning.","As shown in , display  enters a selection mode when a player begins playing. The selection mode may be triggered, for example, by a player inserting coins or tokens into the machine, a player sitting down at the machine (e.g., based on a signal from a human detection sensor, such as a seat contract switch, capacitive sensor, etc.), or a player pushing any button on interface . In the selection mode, display  shows more information than in the idle mode.","A portion of display , for example, the top of display , displays a menu  of available characters based on character data retrieved from a memory device. According to an exemplary embodiment, menu  includes a multitude of headshots for the various models a user may play with. A user may select a model with a touch screen interface or additional buttons provided proximate to menu . Menu  may include more models than can be shown on display  at once and scroll buttons  may be provided to allow a user to view additional models. According to one exemplary embodiment, one model  in menu  (e.g., the model located in the center of the menu) is highlighted. The highlighted model  corresponds to the model  shown on a center portion of display . By scrolling through menu , a user changes the highlighted model  and is able to preview the various models before choosing a model with which to play the game.","A portion of display , for example, the sides of display , shows a multitude of winning combinations . According to an exemplary embodiment, winning combinations  are matching sets of three pieces of clothing (e.g., cowboy\/cowgirl costumes, beach\/swim wear, sport wear, formal wear, lingerie, etc.). Prize values (e.g., the number of coins or credits a player can win) may be displayed along with each of the matching sets of clothing. The winning combinations  are configured to be distinct from each other (e.g., displayed separately) such that a user can easily determine whether a winning combination  has been achieved during play. The possible pieces of clothing may have a similar theme for both male and female models or may be provided for only the male or female models.","A central portion of display  shows a model  in a bathrobe or other clothing, similar to the idle mode. According to an exemplary embodiment, the central portion of display  is divided to include a first portion , a second portion , a third portion , and a fourth portion . In an alternative embodiment, only one portion, a plurality of portions, or more than five portions may be provided for variable or interchangeable display at each portion. A dividing line (e.g., a dotted line, etc.) or other graphical boundary may be shown between the portions, or the divisions may become clear only when the portions begin changing. According to yet other exemplary embodiments, a division between the portions is not visible or does not exist. The first portion , second portion , third portion , and fourth portion  are configured to align with the image of the model such that first portion  shows the model's lower legs and feet, second portion  shows the model's mid-section, third portion  shows the model's upper torso, and fourth portion  shows the model's head. Each of the first , second , and third  portions correspond with one of the three pieces of clothing in the matched sets  that are revealed and\/or varied when gaming apparatus  is played. It should be noted that more or fewer portions may be provided, according to various exemplary embodiments.","As shown in , when a user begins play the game (e.g., after using user interface  to select the model and\/or to otherwise trigger the beginning of the game), display  enters a play mode. The user begins play by selecting a model and pressing a spin button or otherwise activating a user interface element (e.g., by pulling a lever, by touching a touch-screen area, etc.). Once play is begun, a curtain  or other obstruction can cover or obscure menu  (e.g., menu  can be removed from the screen), such as by displaying a curtain or other obstruction instead of the portion of the character to create the impression of being covered. Curtains -can also cover first portion , second portion , and third portion  of the model, leaving fourth portion  uncovered. Curtains -may be animated to move across the central portion of display  horizontally and\/or vertically such that first portion , second portion , and third portion  correspond to the reels on traditional slot machines. Alternative animation schemes are possible (e.g., spinning cubes, spinning shapes, morphing shapes, morphing images, vertical shades, blinds, etc.).  shows display  with curtain retracted to reveal an image of the model's upper torso with a first piece of clothing in third portion .  shows display  with curtain retracted to reveal an image of the model's mid-section with a second piece of clothing in second portion .  shows display  with curtain retracted to reveal an image of the model's legs with a third piece of clothing in first portion . As curtains -are displayed and moving, the model may offer words of encouragement to the user via a speaker and\/or corresponding video or images.","It should be noted that each portion of the display that shows one or more body portions of the one or more characters may be full-motion video of an actual human actor. The full-motion video may be stopped or paused during one or more activities of the system in response to one or more events. According to an exemplary embodiment, the full-motion video may continue throughout all or most stages or activities of the gaming apparatus so that playing the game appears to be a simulation of interaction with a real human. For example, when the curtains are moved over the character, full-motion video of the character appearing to change behind the curtains (e.g., throwing her robe over the curtain, etc.) may continue to play. It should be appreciated that in some embodiments the curtains may not be provided and that full motion video of a character changing from a robe into a matched (or mismatched) outfit may be provided as a part of the game (e.g., in response to a pull of the lever to start the game, etc.).","In one embodiment, curtains , , and are \u201cretracted\u201d in order (e.g., by displaying a portion of the model with the clothing data (e.g., video, images) received from a randomizer or jumbling module). Alternatively, a preset order or random order may be utilized. Curtains , , and may be revealed simultaneously or sequentially. In one embodiment, the user can select with a button which curtain is revealed.","If the images (e.g., videos) revealed by curtains -are a matched set shown as one of the winning combinations  on display , the user wins the amount listed for that winning combination . A control circuit is configured to calculate a credit for the user and to store the credit in memory. Credits can be added by the control circuit to a user's account card, a user's account on a network, or otherwise added to an account. A control circuit can also be configured to cause the dispensing of coins that have collected in the machine or by any other mechanism. Further, the model  may celebrate and perform an action that is appropriate for the theme of the clothing. For example if the matched set of clothing is a cowboy\/cowgirl costume, the model may slap his or her boot or if the matched set of clothing is swim\/beach wear, the model may put on sunglasses. The celebration may be relatively short in duration (e.g., less than thirty seconds, less than fifteen seconds, less than give second, etc.) to minimize the amount of non-gaming action for gaming apparatus . In other exemplary embodiments, the model may perform an activity or celebration that rewards the user and is longer in duration (e.g., perform an entertaining dance, which may be more than fifteen seconds, thirty seconds, sixty seconds, etc.).","As shown in , if a user is able to obtain a winning combination  (e.g., one time or several times in a row), they may \u201cpress the bet\u201d to win more credits by having the model perform some activity that is related to the matched set of clothing . For example, a model in a cowboy\/cowgirl costume may ride a bull or a model in swim\/beach wear may ride a wave on a surfboard. The duration of time the model performs the action determines the amount of additional winnings the user collects. The gaming apparatus can be configured to automatically conduct this activity upon revealing a winning combination  or the user may control this activity (e.g., the user selects a button that says \u201cride the wave for a bonus and bet again!\u201d).","To help promote the slot machines and attract new models, gaming apparatus  may be configured to tabulate (e.g., by storing statistics in memory) the number of times each model's image is used to play a game by a user. The model may then receive a royalty payment for use of their likeness.","Referring now to , a block diagram of gaming apparatus  is shown, according to an exemplary embodiment. Gaming apparatus  includes processing circuit  configured to provide output to and to receive input from electronic display  (e.g., electronic display  being a touch screen).

For example, storage unit  may be configured to store images (e.g., image files, video files, digital video, etc.). In some embodiments, storage unit  can store a first set of first images  associated with a first body portion  in a plurality of costumes, a second set of second images  associated with a second body portion  in the plurality of costumes, and a third set of third images  associated with a third body portion  in the plurality of costumes. The set of images - are stored for each model or character. Each of the images or video may be captured video or images of real items and\/or characters, and\/or may be computer-generated video or images (e.g., cartoon images, three-dimensional renderings, etc.), or a combination thereof.","Referring still to , processing circuit  can be configured to control electronic display  and to cause the electronic display  to display a graphical scene. In other words, processing circuit  can be configured to control the gaming apparatus and electronic display  in particular to conduct each of the activities described herein (e.g., with reference to ). The graphical scene can have a first portion including a first image corresponding to a first body portion of one of a number of characters, a second portion including a second image corresponding to a second body portion of one of the number of characters, and a third portion including a third image corresponding to a third body portion of one of the number of characters. Processor  can be an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a general purpose processor, a specific purpose processor, more than one processors configured to work together, or any other suitable processing part. Processing circuit  can be integrated on a printed circuit board, implemented on multiple circuit boards, formed over a network (e.g., the storage unit being remote from the processor) or otherwise implemented. According to an exemplary embodiment, storage unit  stores computer code for executing and\/or facilitating the steps described herein and processor  is configured to execute the computer code stored in storage unit . Accordingly, the activities described herein can be implemented in software so that when the computer code is executed the gaming apparatus is configured to conduct the specific activities.","According to an exemplary embodiment, processing circuit  can include a number of software and\/or hardware modules configured to execute and\/or facilitate the execution of the activities described herein. In , modules - are shown in memory . Modules - may be computer code, object code, script code, an executable, and\/or any other software or hardware that configures processing circuit  to conduct one or more activities. It should be noted that memory  may be the same or different than storage unit . For example, storage unit  may be disk storage while memory  is solid state memory. Referring to modules -, randomizer  may be configured to randomize, jumble, or otherwise vary the video and\/or images provided to electronic display  while the game is active. Randomizer  may include a random number generator (e.g., providing a truly random outcome) or different outcomes can be varied based on a weighted function or another algorithm that provides a quasi-random outcome. The output from the randomizer may be used to select one or more first, second, third sets of video\/images from storage unit . Display module  may be configured to drive and\/or otherwise control electronic display  (e.g., to expose application programming interfaces or other functions of electronic display  to the other modules or components of processing circuit ). Video decoder  may include decoding logic for the playback of video and\/or images stored in storage unit . For example, the video stored in storage unit  may be compressed using, for example, an MPEG4 or DIVX format and video decoder  may be configured to decompress and otherwise decode for playback the video. Account module  can be configured to track a user account, access a user account, or otherwise manage one or more user accounts relative to gaming apparatus . User input module  can be configured to process signals and\/or data received from user input elements (e.g., a lever, buttons, etc.) of the gaming apparatus. Gameplay logic module  may be configured to command the sequences of user and gaming apparatus activities during one or more games. For example, gameplay logic module  can be configured to cause the display to prompt a user for a bet, begin the randomizer, use the output of the randomizer to select one or more sets of video or images for playback on electronic display , check for one or more winning conditions, enter a winning mode when the one or more winning conditions are met, utilize an account module to associate a game outcome with a certain user, and the like. Gameplay module may also report bets and game outcomes to credit\/debit module  which can be configured to debit (or credit) a user's account depending on the outcome of the game. Input received at card reader  (e.g., magnetic card reader, near-field communication reader, etc.) can be used to add or remove credits via credit\/debit module . Credit\/debit module  can also cause coin dispenser to dispense an appropriate winning for a user when a win state is entered. Audio system  can be controlled by processing circuit  (e.g., provided audio by video decoder ) when video is played back or otherwise (e.g., to \u201cring\u201d when a winning state is entered).","It should be noted that, according to various exemplary embodiments, the gaming apparatus (e.g., gaming device, slot machine, etc.) connected to a display includes any circuit configured to cause a character to be displayed on the display wearing multiple pieces of clothing, the circuit being configured to vary the pieces of clothing shown on the character when a game is played. In other words, it should be noted that while different portions and different images may be cycled through (e.g., randomized, jumbled, spun, etc.) the gaming apparatus may be configured to \u201cland on\u201d or otherwise select one video (which may be a winning video) for playback on the display. For example, rather than the cycle of different portions, a user may pull the lever and the character may begin dressing (or undressing) to reveal a winning (or losing) combination of pieces of clothing in full-motion video. Accordingly, processor  may be configured to determine if a user wins or not immediately (near immediately) when the user pulls a lever or otherwise activates the system. Depending on whether the user has won (and what the user has won), processor  will begin playing a video involving the character that will reveal (e.g., via what the character ends up wearing) whether the user has won. Accordingly, processor  may be configured to enter a winning state (e.g., a winning routine, which may include video playback, calculating a winning, showing the winning to the user, ringing bells, etc.), for the game when the pieces of clothing shown on the character match once the varying of the pieces of clothing is discontinued. In other embodiments the winning state may be entered when the user plays the game, with the display changing to make the user feel as if they are watching the determination in real time (e.g., even though it has already been determined). It should be noted that the winning state may be controlled by gameplay logic module  as shown with reference to  or may be controlled by one or more other logic modules (e.g., routines, computer code functions, etc.) in memory  of processing circuit . For example, gameplay logic module  may utilize randomizer  results, account module , and\/or any number of other modules or calculations to determine if one or more conditions for entering a winning state exists. When the conditions for entering a winning state exist (e.g., when the video shown in the first, second, and third portions of a graphical scene are associated with the same character wearing matching clothing), gameplay logic module  may store data regarding the win state in memory (e.g., update one or more variables stored in memory), trigger one or more functions (e.g., a function to cause the display of a winning video, a function to calculate a user's winnings, a function to sound an alarm and flash lights on the slot machine, etc.). In other exemplary embodiments, entering a win state may trigger other parts of the game (e.g., a \u201cbonus round,\u201d a multiplier routine, allow the user to \u201cdouble-down\u201d or otherwise increase his or her bet, or the like). In yet other embodiments, a winning state is entered whenever the conditions for a game win are determined by a processing circuit of the gaming apparatus.","The gaming apparatus as shown in the various exemplary embodiments is illustrative only. Although only a few embodiments have been described in detail in this disclosure, many modifications are possible. The position of elements may be reversed or otherwise varied and the nature or number of discrete elements or positions may be altered or varied. All such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the present disclosure. The order or sequence of any process or method steps may be varied or re-sequenced according to alternative embodiments. Also two or more steps may be performed concurrently or with partial concurrence. Such variation will depend on the software and hardware systems chosen and on designer choice. All such variations are within the scope of the disclosure. Likewise, software implementations could be accomplished with standard programming techniques with rule based logic and other logic to accomplish the various connection steps, processing steps, comparison steps and decision steps. Other substitutions, modifications, changes, and omissions may be made in the design, operating conditions and arrangement of the exemplary embodiments without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","Embodiments within the scope of the present application include program products comprising machine-readable media for carrying or having machine-executable instructions or data structures stored thereon. Such machine-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer or other machine with a processor.
