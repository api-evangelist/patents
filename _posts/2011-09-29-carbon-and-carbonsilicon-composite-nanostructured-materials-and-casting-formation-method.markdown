No. 61\/378,566, which was filed on Sep. 29, 2010.","This invention was made with government support under DMR-0806859 awarded by National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention.","A field of the invention is carbon fiber composites and sensors, free-standing carbon nanostructures, carbon photonic sensors and fabrication methods for composite and free-standing nanostructured carbon. Example applications of composite and free standing nanostructured carbon include remote chemical sensing, air quality monitoring, water quality monitoring, biosensors, pre-concentrators, electrode materials (e.g., for Li-ion batteries or supercapacitors), field-emission arrays, electromagnetic shielding components.","Previous generations of sensors for chemical or biological compounds based on porous silicon photonic crystals possess surface functionality that only weakly interacts with non-polar organic compounds. For example, freshly prepared porous silicon possesses a silicon hydride terminated surface; however, this surface is not environmentally stable and it does not provide strong adsorption sites for many organic molecules. Oxidation of the silicon matrix yields hydrophilic surfaces with strong adsorption properties for alcohols and water, but not for non-polar organic compounds. These adsorption characteristics place a fundamental limit on the sensitivity of the device. Previously reported chemical modification reactions for porous silicon surfaces suffer from incomplete coverage and poor thermal or environmental stability.","Previous methods of templated nanowire and nanotube formation have used anodized aluminum oxide and etched polymer templates. See, Martin, C. \u201cNanomaterials: A Membrane-Based Synthetic Approach,\u201d Science, Vol. 266, no. 5193, pp. 1961-66 (1994). The membranes in Martin's work contained cylindrical pores of uniform diameter, and were used to prepare polymers, metals, semiconductors, and other materials on a nanoscopic scale. This initial work was extended by others to produce nanowires and nanotubes of metals, metal oxides, conjugated polymers, inorganic salts, proteins, and metal chalcogen semiconductors. See, e.g., Nishizawa, M.; Menon, V. P.; Martin, C. R. \u201cMetal Nanotubule Membranes with Electrochemically Switchable Ion-Transport Selectivity,\u201d Science, 268, 700-702 (1995); F. Zhang, Y. Mao, T.-J. Park and S. S. Wong, \u201cGreen Synthesis and Property of Single-crystalline Alkaline Earth Metal Fluoride Nanowires,\u201d Adv. Mater. 18, 1895-1899 (2006).","The invention provides nanostructured composite porous silicon and carbon materials, and also provides carbon nanofiber arrays having a photonic response in the form of films or particles. Composite materials or carbon nanofiber arrays of the invention are produced by a templating method of the invention, and the resultant nanomaterials have a predetermined photonic response determined by the pattern in the porous silicon template, which is determined by etching conditions for forming the porous silicon. Example nanostructures include rugate filters, single layer structures and double layer structures. In a preferred method of the invention, a carbon precursor is introduced into the pores of a porous silicon film. Carbon is then formed from the carbon precursor. In a preferred method of the invention, liquid carbon-containing polymer precursor is introduced into the pores of an porous silicon film. The precursor is thermally polymerized to form a carbon-containing polymer in the pores of the porous silicon film, which is then thermally carbonized to produce the nanostructured composite material. A carbon nanofiber array is obtained by dissolving the porous silicon. A carbon nanofiber array can be maintained as a film in liquid, and particles can be formed by drying the material.","Preferred embodiment nanostructured materials of the invention include nanostructured carbon\/silicon composites and carbon nanofiber arrays. Composites and carbon material of the invention can include photonic structures. Preferred embodiments methods of the invention synthesize nanostructured carbon inside the pores of a porous silicon template by a polymerization and carbonization procedure. In particular preferred embodiments, the porous silicon template is oxidized prior to the polymerization and carbonization procedure, though those procedures can also be conducted on freshly etched porous silicon. Free-standing nanofiber structured carbon can be obtained by dissolution of the porous silicon template. The carbon nanofibers adopt the shape and morphology of the porous silicon template, and can provide a photonic nanostructured material that is stable in liquid. Particles of nanostructured carbon are formed by drying the film. Carbon\/silicon composite particles can also be formed by fracturing a composite film of the invention.","In preferred embodiments, the nanoporous template is nanoporous silicon having a predetermined porous nanostructure including an arbitrary, user-defined pore shapes with porous silicon. This is achieved by control of the etching conditions and the formation of multi-layer porous silicon structures. In an example formation method, by controlling porous silicon etching to make undulating pores, the ability to make undulated carbon nanowires within the pores has been demonstrated because the porous silicon system allows the generation of undulated pores. Such a process permits the fabrication, for example, of optical filters out of carbon nanowire structures.","Carbon\/porous silicon composites are robust, surviving repeated thermal and organic vapor adsorption cycles. The carbon nanocasting approach creates surfaces that: (a) have increased affinity for non-polar organic molecules leading to 10\u00d7 improvement in sensor sensitivity; (b) have increased surface area relative to the template leading to greater adsorbing capacity; (c) are very stable; and, (d) uniformly cover the underlying silicon layer. carbon nanostructured materials of the invention are stable as films in liquid, and form particles when removed from liquid. The particles retain the nanostructure, and can be used as carbon photonic sensors.","Additional examples of control of the porous silicon structures can be found, e.g., in Li et al. U.S. Pat. No. 7,713,778; Sailor U.S. Patent Publication No. 2007-0148695, published on Jun. 28, 2007; Sailor U.S. Patent Publication, 2005-0042764, published on Feb. 24, 2005; Sailor U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008-0145513, published on Jun. 19, 2008; & Sailor U.S. Patent Publication 2007-0051815, published on Mar. 8, 2007. Complex structures are available through fabrication methods in these patents and published applications, including multi-layer structures, Bragg stacks, rugate filters, and periodic structures, as in these named patents and published applications. Methods of the invention provide carbonized silicon\/carbon composites in which the carbon fills pores, including pores throughout the depth of films and particles base upon such complex porous silicon nanostructures.","Preferred applications for the carbon\/silicon composite include optical-based chemical\/biological sensors, pre-concentrators for chemical\/biological species in air\/water samples, electrode materials (e.g., for Li-ion batteries, supercapacitors, or active information display elements) and optical components. The formed carbon can also be released to leave free-standing carbon nanofiber films in liquid and particles when removed from liquid that maintain characteristics of the composite template from which the array was released. Preferred applications for the freestanding carbon include field-emission arrays, electromagnetic shielding components, and porous electrode materials. An additional preferred application is for an end-of life sensor for an activated carbon respirator. A nanostructured silicon\/carbon composite or carbon material has adsorption properties that are closely matched to the activated carbon in an activated carbon respirator, permitting the nanostructured material of the invention, to serve as an accurate end-of life indicator.","An advantage of using a porous silicon template to form a composite or a freestanding carbon nanofiber array is that the templates can be prepared with well-defined optical spectra (e.g., one-dimensional photonic crystals) and the resulting carbon materials take on photonic aspects of the structured template. Such a free-standing photonic carbon, nanofiber composite material forms an embodiment of the invention.","In preferred methods of formation, synthesis of structured carbon inside the pores of a porous silicon template is by the carbonization of a poly(furfuryl alcohol) precursor. The carbon adopts the shape and morphology of the porous silicon template. Synthesis of free-standing nanofiber arrays is accomplished by dissolution of the porous silicon template and the released carbon coalesces into carbon nanofiber arrays.","Porous silicon\/carbon nanofiber composites of the invention behave as a sensitive, robust sensor for volatile organic compounds. Experiments showed a limit of detection (LOD) for toluene and isopropanol of 1 ppmv and 3 ppmv, respectively. These are lower detection limits than those obtained for either freshly etched porous silicon (LOD=21 ppmv, LOD=9 ppmv) or ozone-oxidized (LOD=11 ppmv, LOD=3 ppmv) control samples. The composite sensor is capable of being thermally refreshed by heating above 100\u00b0 C. in an analyte-free atmosphere.","Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be discussed with respect to the drawings and with respect to experiments that have demonstrated preferred embodiments of the invention. The drawings may include schematic representations, which will be understood by artisans in view of the general knowledge in the art and the description that follows. Features may be exaggerated in the drawings for emphasis, and features may not be to scale. Artisans will appreciate broader aspects of the invention from the following discussion of experiments and specific embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A-1D","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1D","FIG. 1D"],"b":["10","12","12","14","10","12","10","12","16","18","20","10"]},"In example experimental formation methods, porous silicon optical rugate filters were electrochemically etched by the application of a sinusoidally varying current density to highly doped (\u03c1=0.9-1.0 m\u03a9cm), p-type, (100)-oriented silicon wafers. The etching solution was 3:1 HF:EtOH (v\/v) electrolyte solution. The porous silicon films were approximately \u02dc35 \u03bcm thick. The thickness was determined by cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy measurements. The porous silicon films were oxidized by exposure to a stream of ozone for 20 min. This oxidation treatment provides a porous silicon oxide surface with a high percentage of terminal silanol functionality.","Pores in experiments were filled with a solution of oxalic acid in furfuryl alcohol (5 mg mL) as polymer precursors. This was accomplished by immersing the oxidized porous silicon template in the solution. Excess solution was wiped away from the top prior to thermal polymerization. The furfuryl alcohol was then thermally polymerized at 70\u00b0 C. for 16 h. Carbonization of the poly(furfuryl alcohol) resin (PFA) is then carbonized at 700\u00b0 C. for 5 h under flowing (1.2 SLPM) nitrogen. The furnace was purged with nitrogen for 30 minutes, and then heated to 700\u00b0 C. Samples were cooled to room temperature under flowing nitrogen. After cooling, samples were rinsed by immersion in a bath of anhydrous ethanol. This yields the porous silicon\/carbon composite. Free-standing carbon nanofiber arrays can be liberated from the template by soaking in a solution of 4:1:1(v\/v) dimethylsulfoxide:concentrated (49%) aqueous hydrofluoric acid:ethanol for 4 h to dissolve the silicon matrix. The freed carbon nanofiber array film is stable in liquid, and cracks into particles when dried.","Experiments have shown that the carbon\/silicon nanostructure material has greatly enhanced sensitivity compared to porous silicon for volatile organic contaminants. The reflectance spectra (from bottom to top) of the freshly etched, oxidized, PFA-infiltrated, and carbon infiltrated composite films are shown in . Reflectance spectra were acquired using a tungsten lamp (Ocean Optics LS-1) and spectrometer (Ocean Optics USB4000) attached to a bifurcated fiber optic cable. The spectra were referenced to a front-surface silver mirror with Rs\u226796%. The freshly etched porous silicon sample displays a broad, rectangular stop band from the optical rugate filter centered at 770 nm. While the position of the stop band shifts upon both oxidation and PFA infiltration, due to changes in the effective refractive index (n) of the film, the intensity of the band is relatively constant (approaching 100% reflectance). After carbonization, the line shape of the stop band is significantly altered, its intensity is reduced to \u02dc10% and Fabry-P\u00e9rot interference fringes are no longer visible in the reflectance spectrum. For optical sensing using the silicon-carbon composite film, the photonic stop band is used because there is no interference pattern. These spectral changes are attributed to the high absorption cross-section of the carbon present in the film. The fact that the interference fringes are no longer visible implies that the incident light is either reflected or absorbed before it can reach the film\/substrate interface and produce an interfering wave to generate the Fabry-P\u00e9rot interference pattern.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B"],"sup":["2 ","\u22121","2 ","\u22122","2 ","\u22122","2 ","\u22122","\u22121","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3D","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIGS. 3C and 3D","FIGS. 3A and 3B"],"b":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3B","FIG. 3B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIGS. 3C-3D","FIG. 3C","FIG. 3D"]},"Experiments were also conducted to verify the formation of carbon nanostructured material by dissolution of the silicon matrix. In the experiments, this was accomplished by immersion of the carbon-silicon composite in a 4:1:1 solution of DMSO:HF:EtOH. These precursors form glassy carbon. Other precursor materials known to artisans could provide graphitic carbon or amorphous carbon. Synthetic production of graphite is well known. The hydrofluoric acid dissolves the thin oxide layer formed during the ozonation process, and the ethanol reduces the surface tension of the mixture to ensure the penetration of the acid into the film. Dimethylsulfoxide acts as a mild oxidant for the remaining silicon in the film, converting it to silicon oxide and liberating dimethylsulfide. This oxide layer is then dissolved by the hydrofluoric acid. The dissolution of the silicon template was verified by energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (m\u02dc5%). Once the template is removed, the remaining carbon film is very brittle and fragments into particles. However, if the sample is kept immersed in liquid, the carbon membrane remains intact. The carbon film and particles were \u02dc35 \u03bcm thick, in good agreement with the thickness of the porous silicon template, and demonstrates that the carbon penetrated throughout the thickness of the porous silicon template.","The intact membrane retains the pattern of the carbon porous silicon composite film. carbon particles also retain the nanostructure of the composite film. In experiments, a carbon photonic film was produced in liquid from a rugate filter carbon porous silicon composite. The resultant nanostructured carbon film had the periodic structure of an optical rugate filter. With the rugate filter template, the resultant carbon particles and film appear to consist of aligned carbon fibers (d\u02dc100 nm) of sinusoidally oscillating thickness. The period of this banded structure in the resultant carbon particles and films (T=210\u00b130 nm) is the same, within error, of that of the porous silicon template (T=260\u00b120 nm), indicating the high degree of fidelity with which the carbon replicates the structure of the template.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","sub":["MeOH=","EtOH","hexanes","toluene"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 4B-4D","FIG. 4E"]},"Carbon was also templated in other porous silicon structures, such as single and double layers. Electron microscopy images of the resultant carbon nanofiber array formed from a single layer of uniform diameter (\u02dc7 nm) pores do not show any of the horizontal banding observed in the rugate-templated particles, clearly demonstrating that the oscillating diameter of the templated carbon nanofibers in  is attributable to the periodic structure of the rugate porous silicon template, and that the structure of carbon nanostructured materials can be changed.  shows an image of one the single layer structure, which was produced using a porous silicon template formed from a constant etching current of 55 mA cmfor 1200 seconds. Carbon nanofiber arrays were also synthesized in a two layer template structure consisting of a thick layer of large to diameter pores on top of a thin layer of smaller pores. The demarcation line of the two layers is clearly visible in the resultant carbon nanowire array, as seen in . Thus, the porous silicon template provides direct control over the structure of carbon nanowire carbon material that is produced, providing the ability to produce a predetermined nanostructured carbon with extremely high structural fidelity.","The porous silicon films in the experimented demonstrated the ability of methods of the invention to utilize the films as template the formation of carbon nanostructures. The carbon surfaces behave as highly efficient adsorbents for volatile organic compounds such as toluene. When combined with the signal transduction capabilities of a porous photonic crystal, the films act as sensitive optical vapor sensors. While the films crack upon removal of the template removal and drying, the carbon nanofiber arrays can be handled while wet. The user-definable control of diameter exhibited by this synthetic route opens new applications of carbon fibers as nanostructural, nanoelectronic, or energy storage components.","While specific embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it should be understood that other modifications, substitutions and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications, substitutions and alternatives can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which should be determined from the appended claims.","Various features of the invention are set forth in the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1-1D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3D","FIGS. 3A & 3B","FIGS. 3C and 3D"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIGS. 4B-4D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4G"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
