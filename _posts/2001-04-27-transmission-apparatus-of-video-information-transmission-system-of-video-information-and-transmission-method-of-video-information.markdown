The RAM  is a scratch region at the time when the level information of each pixel is generated, by utilizing the video information decoder . The VRAM  is a dual port RAM for video display which has a port that can randomly access an arbitrary address so as to carry out write in and read out (address is designated by a write in\/read out address register ) and a port that can read out data of each address at high speed and in a constant order (address is designated by a read out address register ). The level information (level information of each of the sub-pixels, RGB), attribute data and the like are stored in the VRAM .","The CPU  and the like set an address in the write in\/read out address register . Information is written into this address through the internal bus  and information is read out from this address through the internal bus .","The clock generator  sets a read out address register . The set value of the address register  is generally incremented at an extremely high rate. The information of the address designated by the address register  is read out and is forwarded to the parallel\/serial conversion part . The parallel\/serial conversion part  converts the inputted information of each address (level information of each pixel) into serial data, which are then outputted.","An output signal from the parallel\/serial conversion part  is transmitted to an LCD driving part  and is converted to a signal for driving an LCD (liquid crystal display).

The display  displays video by driving each pixel in accordance with the display data.","In a conventional computer which has a first terminal apparatus and a second terminal apparatus, however, information flow between the first terminal apparatus and the second terminal apparatus is carried out with video change instructions which are described in a software language. Therefore, data cannot be transmitted or received between the first terminal apparatus and the second terminal apparatus in which different OSs are installed. In particular, the user who has a plurality of first terminal apparatus in which plural and different OSs are installed must utilize, through precise differentiation, a first terminal apparatus and a second terminal apparatus in which a first OS is installed as well as a first terminal apparatus and a second terminal apparatus in which a second OS is installed, and, in this regard, mistakes may easily occur. For example, the case wherein the user brings the first terminal apparatus in which the first OS is installed and the second terminal apparatus in which the second OS is installed on a distant trip, results in the apparatus being unusable. Therefore, a data transmission system between a first terminal apparatus and a second terminal apparatus that does not depend on an OS is requested by users who have a plurality of first terminal apparatus in which plural and different OSs are installed.","There is also the idea of transmitting the output signal from the parallel\/serial conversion part  to the second terminal apparatus  without change. However, in the case that a full color display with RGB consisting, respectively, of 8 bits is implemented on a UXGA screen (1600\u00d71200 pixels), the output signal of the parallel\/serial conversion part exceeds 46 Mbps.
