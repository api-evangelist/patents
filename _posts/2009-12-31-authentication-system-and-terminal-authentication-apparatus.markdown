title: Authentication system and terminal authentication apparatus
abstract: After checking a receiving message appearing on an output device, a network administrator inputs an authentication result to a setting terminal using an input device, such as a keyboard. Upon receiving the authentication result from the network administrator, the setting terminal registers, if the received authentication result is permission to access a network device, a MAC address of a traveling employee's terminal that is the sender of the authentication request in the network device as an access permitted terminal. After the registering in the network device is completed, the setting terminal sends the authentication result indicative of permission to access the network device to the employee's terminal, i.e., the sender of the authentication request.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT\/JP2007\/063852, filed on Jul. 11, 2007, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The embodiments discussed herein are directed to an authentication system and a terminal authentication device.","Technologies have been used, in network access or processing corresponding to a request received via a network, that determine whether a user is authentic, give, if the user is authentic, permission to access the network, and perform required processing corresponding to the request received via the network (see, for example, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2005-85090).","To improve usability of network access in an intra-corporate system, some technologies allow an employee to access a network at each company location.","For example, as illustrated in , with a conventional technology, a sub-network administrator at a given branch writes a MAC address of an employee from a different branch who comes to the given branch on a business trip (hereinafter, \u201ctraveling employee\u201d) to a MAC-address filter table stored in a switching hub (switch) or a list of MAC addresses stored in a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) server using a setting terminal so that the travelling employee can access the network at the given branch. When the travelling employee goes back to his\/her actual branch, the sub-network administrator deletes the MAC address of the traveling employee from the network device, such as the switch or the DHCP server, so that the temporary permission to access the network is cancelled.","There is a problem in that the above-described conventional technology increases the workload of the sub-network administrator leads to the sub-network administrator having a large workload. The sub-network administrator has to manually write\/delete the MAC address of each traveling employee who comes to the branch to\/from the network device, such as the switch or the DHCP server. Therefore, the workload of the administrator increases as the number of the traveling employees increases.","An increase of the number of the administrators can deal with the increase of the workload; however, this solution will not be practical because skilled persons are required for network configuration.","According to an aspect of an embodiment of the invention, an authentication system includes a terminal device that is used to access a network device and a terminal authentication device that determines whether a user of the terminal device is authentic and can therefore access the network device. The terminal device and the terminal authentication device are connected to each other via a network. The terminal device includes a first input unit by which an IP address of the terminal authentication device is input; an authentication-request sending unit that sends an authentication request concerning whether access to the network device is permissible to the terminal authentication device using an authentication-request frame including a gratuitous ARP request in which the input IP address of the terminal authentication device is set as a sender IP address; an authentication-result receiving unit that receives a response frame from the terminal authentication device as an authentication result, the response frame responding to the authentication-request frame; an authentication-result output\/display unit that outputs\/displays a message indicating that the response frame is received when the response frame is received; and a network-access-information acquiring unit that acquires, from the network device, an IP address to access the network device, in response to an instruction to acquire the IP address from the first input unit. The terminal authentication device includes an authentication-request receiving unit that receives the authentication-request frame from the terminal device; an authentication-request output\/display unit that outputs\/displays a message indicating that the authentication-request frame is received when the authentication-request frame is received; a second input unit by which an authentication result indicating whether access to the network device is permissible is input; an information registering unit that registers, in the network device, if the input authentication result indicates permission to access the network device, a MAC address of the terminal device which is the sender of the authentication request as an access permitted terminal; and an authentication-result sending unit that sends the input authentication result to the terminal device which is the sender of the authentication request, after registering the MAC address in the network device is completed.","The object and advantages of the embodiment will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the claims.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are not restrictive of the embodiment, as claimed.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explained with reference to accompanying drawings. In the following section, a first embodiment according to the present invention will be described, followed by some other embodiments according to the present invention.","[a] First Embodiment","In the description of the first embodiment, the outline and features of an authentication system according to the first embodiment, the configuration of the authentication system, and the processing performed by the authentication system are described in the order they appear in this sentence. After that, the effects of the first embodiment will be described.","Outline and Features of Authentication System","First Embodiment","First of all, the outline and features of the authentication system according to the first embodiment are described below with reference to .  is a schematic diagram illustrating the outline and features of the authentication system according to the first embodiment.  is a schematic diagram illustrating the outline of processes that use a conventional technology.","In brief, the authentication system according to the first embodiment determines, when a user tries to access a network device using a terminal device, whether the user is authentic and can therefore access the network device. For example, the authentication system enables a relevant staff member (or a network administrator in charge of, for example, a sub-network) to allow a travelling employee to access a network, as if the traveling employee were in his\/her own office, via a network. The main features of the authentication system according to the first embodiment are to facilitate authentication for temporary permission within the network and automatically perform the network device settings required when permission to access the network is given. With this configuration, the authentication system according to the first embodiment can reduce the workload of the network administrator.","The main features are described in details below. As illustrated in , the authentication system according to the first embodiment includes a travelling employee's terminal that the traveling employee uses to access the network device and a setting terminal that determines whether the user of the travelling employee's terminal, i.e., the traveling employee, is authentic and therefore can access the network device. The travelling employee's terminal and the setting terminal are connected to each other via a network.","The network administrator (or the relevant stuff member), who is the user of the setting terminal used in the authentication system according to the first embodiment, verbally gives the traveling employee information about the address of the setting terminal (IP-B) as authentication information in advance so that the travelling employee can access a LAN at the business trip destination.","The travelling employee's terminal sends an authentication request to the setting terminal using a frame including information about the address of the setting terminal, which is given by the network administrator in advance, as the authentication information for accessing the network device. The network device, herein, is a switching hub or a DHCP server within the network.","More particularly, the travelling employee opens an Internet protocol (IP) setting screen on the travelling employee's terminal and inputs \u201cIP-B\u201d using a keyboard. Upon receiving an input of \u201cIP-B\u201d from the traveling employee, the travelling employee's terminal sends, by the function of the operating system (OS), the authentication request to the setting terminal using a frame (gratuitous ARP frame) including the destination IP \u201cIP-B\u201d. The gratuitous ARP frame is a frame that is sent, by a predetermined function of the OS, when an IP address is set on the terminal so as to check whether a terminal having an identical IP address is present within the network.","Upon receiving the authentication request from the travelling employee's terminal, the setting terminal displays a request receiving message indicating that the authentication request has been received on an output device (e.g., a display or a monitor). More particularly, if the destination IP address contained in the received frame is equal to \u201cIP-B\u201d, which is verbally given to the user of the travelling employee's terminal as authentication information, the setting terminal determines the received frame to be the authentication request and displays the request receiving message on the output device. The request receiving message, for example, includes information, such as the authentication request, the source MAC address, and the receiving time, and it appears in such a manner that the network administrator understands the information at first glance. Any request receiving message can be used as long as it notifies the network administrator that the authentication request has been received.","After checking the request receiving message appearing on the output device, the network administrator inputs the result of authentication to the setting terminal using an input device, such as a keyboard. If the network administrator determines that the sender of the authentication request is the authentic user (traveling employee) by the timing when the authentication request has been received and the identical \u201cIP-B\u201d, which is given as the authentication information, the network administrator inputs the authentication result indicative of permission to access the network device. If the network administrator determines that the sender of the authentication request is not the authentic user (traveling employee), the network administrator inputs the authentication result indicative of denial of access to the network device.","If it receives the authentication result indicative of permission to access the network device from the network administrator, the setting terminal registers the MAC address of the travelling employee's terminal, i.e., the sender of the authentication request, in the network device as an access permitted terminal.","After the registration in the network device is completed, the setting terminal sends the authentication result indicative of permission to access the network device to the travelling employee's terminal or the sender of the authentication request. If it receives the authentication result indicative of denial of access to the network device, the setting terminal sends the received authentication result to the travelling employee's terminal or the sender of the authentication request.","Upon receiving the authentication result from the setting terminal, the travelling employee's terminal displays a result receiving message indicating that the authentication result has been received on an output device (e.g., a display or a monitor). If the result receiving message appearing on the output device is checked and it is found that the user is permitted to access the network device, the traveling employee inputs an IP acquisition instruction to the travelling employee's terminal using the keyboard. The travelling employee's terminal sends an IP acquisition request to the network device (DHCP server) to acquire an IP that allows access to the network device and then receives the IP from the network device. The traveling employee then starts data communications using the received IP.","When it is required to cancel the permission for the traveling employee to access the network device, the network administrator inputs a cancel instruction to the setting terminal using the input device, such as the keyboard, so as to deny access by the traveling-employee's terminal to the network device. Upon receiving the cancel instruction from the network administrator, the setting terminal deletes information about the address of the target terminal device from a list of addresses of access permitted terminals stored in the network device.","It is clear from the above description that, with the authentication system according to the first embodiment, almost all the processes are automatically performed except for the input of the authentication result by the network administrator to the setting terminal. The conventional system illustrated in , which performs processes almost the same as those in the authentication system according to the first embodiment, has seven steps that require manual operation by the network administrator (or the relevant staff member) and no automatic steps. The authentication system according to the first embodiment illustrated in  has, in contrast, two steps that require manual operation by the network administrator (or the relevant staff member) and six automatic steps. That is, the number of steps that require manual operation by the network administrator (or the relevant staff member) is significantly reduced.","As has been mentioned above, the authentication system according to the first embodiment facilitates authentication for temporary permission to access a network and automatically performs network device settings required when permission to access the network device is given, which reduces the workload of the network administrator.","Configuration of Authentication System First Embodiment)","The authentication system according to the first embodiment is described below with reference to .  is a block diagram of the configuration of the authentication system according to the first embodiment. As illustrated in , the authentication system according to the first embodiment includes a request sender terminal  that is used to access the network device and a request receiver terminal  that determines whether the user of the request sender terminal is authentic and can therefore access a network device . Both terminals are connected to each other via a network .","The request sender terminal  includes an input device , an authentication-request sending unit , an authentication-response receiving unit , an output device , and an IP acquiring unit . The authentication-response receiving unit may be referred to as the \u201cauthentication-result receiving unit\u201d. The output device may be referred to as the \u201cauthentication-result output\/display unit\u201d. The IP acquiring unit may be referred to as the \u201cnetwork-access-information acquiring unit\u201d.","The input device receives various setting inputs, such as an input of information about the address of the request receiver terminal  (e.g., \u201cIP-B\u201d) as the authentication information, from the user who opens the IP setting screen. The input device is, for example, a keyboard or a mouse.","Upon receiving a setting input of information about the address of the request receiver terminal  (e.g., \u201cIP-B\u201d) as the authentication information via the input device , the authentication-request sending unit sends, by the function of the OS, an authentication request to the request receiver terminal  using a frame (gratuitous ARP frame) including the destination IP \u201cIP-B\u201d.","The gratuitous ARP frame is a frame that is sent, by a predetermined function of the OS, when an IP address is set on the terminal so as to check whether a terminal having an identical IP address is present within the network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["10","30","10","30","30","10"]},"The authentication-response receiving unit receives an authentication result from the request receiver terminal  as a response to the authentication request and causes the output device to output a result receiving message indicating that the authentication result has been received.","The output device displays thereon the result receiving message. The output device is, for example, a display or a monitor that displays the result receiving message or a printer that prints out the result receiving message.","Upon receiving an IP acquisition instruction from the user via the input device , the IP acquiring unit sends an IP acquisition request to the network device  (e.g., DHCP server) to acquire an IP address that allows access to the network device  and then receives the IP address from the network device .","The network device  is, for example, a switching hub or a DHCP server within the network .","The request receiver terminal  includes an permission-status-information storage unit , an authentication-request receiving unit , an output device , an input device , an authentication-result receiving unit , a source-MAC permitting unit , an authentication-response sending unit , a cancel-instruction receiving unit , and a source-MAC denying unit ","The permission-status-information storage unit may be referred to as the \u201caccess-permission-status storage unit\u201d. The output device may be referred to as the \u201cauthentication-request output\/display unit\u201d. The source-MAC permitting unit may be referred to as the \u201cinformation registering unit\u201d. The authentication-response sending unit may be referred to as the \u201cauthentication-result sending unit\u201d. The source-MAC denying unit may be referred to as the \u201caccess-permission canceling unit\u201d.","Upon receiving the authentication request, the permission-status-information storage unit stores therein both information about the address (e.g., source MAC address) of the request sender terminal , i.e., the sender of the authentication request, and information about access permission status indicating whether the request sender terminal  is permitted to access the network device  in an associated manner.","The source MAC address is a value indicative of the sender's MAC address and is contained in the field \u201cSource MAC Address\u201d or \u201cSender Ethernet Address\u201d. The information about the access permission status includes, for example, receiving time of the authentication request and permission status as to whether access by the request sender terminal  is permitted (e.g., \u201cunder authentication\u201d, \u201cauthentic and permitted\u201d, \u201cpermission denied\u201d, etc). The permission status is updatable by each processing unit.","The authentication-request receiving unit receives the authentication request from the request sender terminal  and causes the output device to output a request receiving message indicating that the authentication request has been received. More particularly, if the destination IP address that is contained in the received frame is the same as the address of the request receiver terminal  (e.g., \u201cIP-B\u201d), which is verbally given to the user of the request sender terminal  as the authentication information, the authentication-request receiving unit determines the received frame to be the authentication request and displays the request receiving message on the output device . The authentication-request receiving unit then stores in the permission-status-information storage unit the permission status \u201cunder authentication\u201d associated with the MAC address of the request sender terminal , i.e., the sender of the authentication request.","The output device displays thereon the request receiving message. The output device is, for example, a display or a monitor that displays the request receiving message or a printer that prints out the request receiving message. The request receiving message, for example, includes information, such as the authentication request, the source MAC address, and the receiving time, and it appears in such a manner that the network administrator understands the information at first glance. Any request receiving message can be used as long as it notifies the network administrator that the authentication request has been received.","The input device receives various inputs from the user when, for example, the user checks the request receiving message appearing on the output device and then inputs an authentication result.","The authentication-result receiving unit receives, from the user via the input device , an authentication result indicating that the request sender terminal  is permitted to access the network device  or an authentication result indicative of denial of access to the network device . If the authentication result indicative of permission to access the network device  is received, the authentication-result receiving unit instructs the source-MAC permitting unit to register the MAC address of the request sender terminal , i.e., the sender of the authentication request in the network device , as an access permitted terminal.","The source-MAC permitting unit receives the instruction from the authentication-result receiving unit and registers the MAC address of the request sender terminal , i.e., the sender of the authentication request in the network device , as an access permitted terminal. The source-MAC permitting unit updates the permission status of the MAC address of the request sender terminal , i.e., the sender of the authentication request that is present in the permission-status-information storage unit (e.g., updates from \u201cunder authentication\u201d to \u201cauthentic and permitted\u201d).","After the registration by the source-MAC permitting unit in the network device  is completed, the authentication-response sending unit sends the authentication result received by the authentication-result receiving unit , i.e., the authentication result indicating that the request sender terminal  is permitted to access the network device , to the request sender terminal  using the same frame as that received from the request sender terminal . The MAC address of the request sender terminal  is received from the authentication-request receiving unit via the authentication-result receiving unit . Conversely, if the authentication result indicative of denial of access to the network device  is received, the authentication-response sending unit sends the authentication result indicative of access denial to the request sender terminal , i.e., the sender of the authentication request. Alternatively, it is allowable to configure the authentication-response sending unit to send no response when an authentication result is received that is indicative of denial of access to the network device .","The cancel-instruction receiving unit receives an input of a cancel instruction from the user via the input device to cancel the permission for the request sender terminal  to access the network device . The cancel-instruction receiving unit then instructs the source-MAC denying unit to cancel the permission.","The source-MAC denying unit receives the cancel instruction from the cancel-instruction receiving unit and deletes the MAC address of the request sender terminal , which is the target address specified by the received cancel instruction, from the list of addresses of access permitted terminals that is stored in the network device . The source-MAC denying unit updates the permission status of the MAC address of the request sender terminal , which is the target address specified by the received cancel instruction, that is present in the permission-status-information storage unit (e.g., updates from \u201cauthentic and permitted\u201d to \u201cpermission denied\u201d).","The request receiver terminal  is equipped with a setting input unit supporting a certain setting interface that is used to register the IP address of the network device  and the MAC addresses of some other devices in the network device  and has input information in advance.","The request sender terminal  and the request receiver terminal  can be implemented by adding the above-described functions to well-known information processing devices, such as personal computers or workstations.","Processing Performed by Authentication System","(First Embodiment)","Processing performed by the authentication system according to the first embodiment is described below with reference to .  is a sequence diagram of the processes performed by the authentication system according to the first embodiment.  is a flowchart of processes performed by the request sender terminal according to the first embodiment.  is a flowchart of an access-permission registering process performed by the request receiver terminal according to the first embodiment.  is a flowchart of an access-permission cancelling process performed by the request receiver terminal according to the first embodiment.","Processing Performed by Request Sender Terminal","The processing performed by the request sender terminal according to the first embodiment is described with reference to . As illustrated in , upon receiving, via the input device , an authentication-request sending instruction, i.e., a setting input of information about the address of the request receiver terminal  (e.g., \u201cIP-B\u201d) as the authentication information (Yes at Step S), the authentication-request sending unit sends, by the function of the OS, an authentication request to the request receiver terminal  using a frame (gratuitous ARP frame) that includes the destination IP \u201cIP-B\u201d (Step S, see A- of ).","Upon receiving an authentication result as a response to the authentication request from the request receiver terminal  (Yes at Step S, see A- of ), the authentication-response receiving unit causes the output device to output a result receiving message indicating that the authentication result has been received (Step S, see A- of ).","After that, upon receiving an IP acquisition instruction via the input device , the IP acquiring unit sends an IP acquisition request to the network device  (e.g., DHCP server) to acquire an IP that allows access to the network device  by using the DHCP client function and then receives the IP from the network device  (Step S, see A- of ). The request sender terminal  starts data communications using the received IP (Step S).","Access-Permission Registering Process Performed by Request Receiving Terminal (First Embodiment)","The access-permission registering process performed by the request receiver terminal according to the first embodiment is described below with reference to . As illustrated in , upon receiving the authentication request from the request sender terminal  (Yes at Step S, see B- of ), the authentication-request receiving unit causes the output device to output a request receiving message indicating that the authentication request has been received (Step S, see B- of ).","After that, the authentication-result receiving unit receives an input of either an authentication result indicating that the request sender terminal  is permitted to access the network device  or an authentication result indicative of denial of access to the network device  from the user via the input device (Yes at Step S, see B- of ). If the authentication result indicative of permission to access the network device is received, the authentication-result receiving unit instructs the source-MAC permitting unit to register the MAC address of the request sender terminal , which is the sender of the authentication request, in the network device  as an access permitted terminal.","The source-MAC permitting unit receives the instruction from the authentication-result receiving unit and registers the MAC address of the request sender terminal , which is the sender of the authentication request, in the network device  as an access permitted terminal (Step S, see B- of ).","After the registration by the source-MAC permitting unit in the network device  is completed, the authentication-response sending unit sends the authentication result received by the authentication-result receiving unit , i.e., the authentication result indicative of permission to access the network device , to the request sender terminal  (Step S, see B- of ).","Access-Permission Canceling Process Performed by Request Receiving Terminal (First Embodiment)","The access-permission canceling process performed by the request receiver terminal according to the first embodiment is described below with reference to . As illustrated in , upon receiving an input of a cancel instruction from the user via the input device to cancel the permission for the request sender terminal  to access the network device  (Yes at Step S, see B- of ), the cancel-instruction receiving unit instructs the source-MAC denying unit to cancel the permission.","The source-MAC denying unit receives the cancel instruction from the cancel-instruction receiving unit and then deletes the MAC address of the request sender terminal , which is the target address specified by the received cancel instruction, from a list of address data of terminal devices able to access the network device  (Step S, see B- of ).","Advantage of First Embodiment","As mentioned above, in the authentication system according to the first embodiment that includes a terminal device (the request sender terminal ) that is used to access a network device and a terminal authentication device (the request receiver terminal ) that determines whether the terminal device is authentic and can therefore access the network device , where both the terminal device and the terminal authentication device are connected to each other via a network, the terminal device sends an authentication request to the terminal authentication device to access the network device, receives an authentication result from the terminal authentication device as a response to the authentication request, outputs\/displays the received authentication result, and acquires network access information that allows access to the network device from the network device depending on the received authentication result, while the terminal authentication device receives the authentication request from the terminal device, outputs\/displays the received authentication request, receives the authentication result indicating whether access to the network device is permissible, registers, if the authentication result indicative of permission to access the network device is received, information about the address of the terminal device, which is the sender of the authentication request, in the network device as an access permitted terminal, and sends, after the registration in the network device is completed, the authentication result to the terminal device, which is the sender of the authentication request. With this configuration, easy authentication for temporary permission to access the network is implemented and the network device settings required when permission to access the network device is given are automatically performed, which significantly reduces the workload of the network administrator.","Moreover, upon receiving the authentication request, the request receiver terminal  in the first embodiment stores therein information about the address (e.g., the MAC address) of the request sender terminal , which is the sender of the authentication request, and information about the access permission status (including, for example, the receiving time of the authentication request and the permission status) in an associated manner. Therefore, the administrator of the request receiver terminal  can check the permission status of the request sender terminal  if required.","Furthermore, to send\/receive the authentication request to the authentication result to\/from the request sender terminal  or the request receiver terminal  in the first embodiment, existing frames (e.g., gratuitous ARP frames), which have already been implemented by each device, are used. Therefore, the sending\/receiving of the authentication request or the authentication result is implemented using the existing function without adding a new function or the like to the devices.","Although the authentication-response sending unit in the above-described first embodiment sends the authentication result, which is received by the authentication-result receiving unit , to the request sender terminal  after the registration in the network device  is completed, the present invention is not limited thereto. It is allowable to send the authentication result before the completion of the registration at a predetermined timing that is determined taking the time required for the registration into consideration.","Although the IP acquiring unit in the above-described first embodiment sends, by the DHCP client function or the like, an IP acquisition request to the network device  and receives an IP address that allows access to the network device  from the network device , the present invention is not limited thereto. Alternatively, for example, the request receiver terminal  sends the authentication result in the form of a frame including the IP address allocated to the request sender terminal . The request sender terminal  then uses the IP address included in the received frame.","Although the request receiver terminal  in the above-described first embodiment performs the MAC settings on the network device , the present invention is not limited thereto. Alternatively, for example, the source-MAC permitting unit and the source-MAC denying unit send an instruction for an MAC to be permitted\/denied to the network device . Upon receiving the instruction, the existing network management device actually performs the settings. In this case, because the request receiver terminal  inputs commands supported only by the API of the network management device instead of various commands each supported by the corresponding API, the request receiver terminal  can be implemented more easily.","[b] Second Embodiment","The example has been mentioned in the above first embodiment in which the authentication request or the authentication result is sent\/received using a frame (gratuitous ARP frame) that is supported by the function of the OS. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. It is allowable to send\/receive the authentication request or the authentication result using a predetermined dedicated frame. An authentication system according to a second embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to .  is a block diagram of the configuration of the authentication system according to the second embodiment.  is a schematic diagram of exemplary data structures of frame formats according to the second embodiment.","As illustrated in , the authentication system according to the second embodiment has basically the same configuration as the authentication system according to the first embodiment except for the following points.","The authentication-request sending unit of the request sender terminal  sends an authentication request to the request receiver terminal  using a frame dedicated to the authentication. The format of the dedicated frame include various fields, such as \u201cEthernet (trademark) Type\u201d, \u201cDestination IP address\u201d, and \u201cRequest\/Response Type\u201d as illustrated in . A predetermined value is store in the field of \u201cEthernet (trademark) Type\u201d. The switches are set to allow a frame to pass through that includes the predetermined value of the field of \u201cEthernet (trademark) Type\u201d. If an authentication request is sent from the request sender terminal , a value representing \u201cRequest\u201d is stored in the field of \u201cRequest\/Response Type\u201d. If an authentication result is sent from the request receiver terminal , a value representing \u201cResponse\u201d is stored in the field of \u201cRequest\/Response Type\u201d.","Upon receiving the authentication result from the request receiver terminal  using the dedicated frame, the authentication-response receiving unit of the request sender terminal  checks contents of the received authentication result. If it is determined, as a result of the check, that the authentication result is permission to access the network device , the authentication-response receiving unit instructs the IP acquiring unit to acquire the IP address. Upon receiving the instruction from the authentication-response receiving unit , the IP acquiring unit sends an IP acquisition request to the network device  (e.g., DHCP server) to acquire the IP address that allows access to the network device  and then receives the IP address from the network device .","The other processes performed by the request sender terminal  are the same as those of the above-described first embodiment.","If the frame received from the request sender terminal  includes the destination IP address the same as the address of the request receiver terminal  (e.g., \u201cIP-B\u201d), information of which has been verbally given to the user of the request sender terminal , and the value in the field of \u201cEthernet (trademark) Type\u201d indicating that the frame is dedicated to the authentication, the authentication-request receiving unit of the request receiver terminal  determines the received frame to be the authentication request and displays a request receiving message on the output device ","The other processes performed by the request receiver terminal  are the same as those of the above-described first embodiment.","As mentioned above, because the request sender terminal  and the request receiver terminal  in the second embodiment send\/receive an authentication request or an authentication result using a frame dedicated to the authentication, the sending\/receiving of an authentication request or an authentication result is implemented using the dedicated frame different from existing frames, so that the existing frames, which have been implemented by each device, can be used for their original purposes.","The above-described data structure in the second embodiment is an example. Any format can be used as long as the format includes, at least, \u201cEthernet (trademark) Type\u201d, \u201cSource IP address\u201d, and \u201cRequest\/Response Type\u201d.","[c] Third Embodiment","Although it has been mentioned in the above embodiments that the address of the request receiver terminal  (e.g., IP address \u201cIP-B\u201d) is used as the authentication information, some other types of information, such as information about an address dedicated to the authentication, can be used instead of the IP address. The configuration of an authentication system according to a third embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to .  is a block diagram of the configuration of the authentication system according to the third embodiment.","As illustrated in , the authentication system according to the third embodiment has basically the same configuration as those of the above embodiments except that the request receiver terminal  further includes an authentication-IP setting unit ","The authentication-IP setting unit has a virtual authentication MAC address different from the MAC address used for communications in the normal situations. The authentication-IP setting unit requests a DHCP server  for an IP address corresponding to the virtual MAC address and then receives the IP address from the DHCP server . The user of the request receiver terminal  notifies the user of the request sender terminal  of the information about the address acquired in the above manner so that the information about the address can be used as the authentication information.","The authentication-IP setting unit can be designed to have a user interface using which a user manually sets an IP different from the IP that is used for communications in the normal situations.","As mentioned above, the request receiver terminal  in the third embodiment acquires an authentication address different from the address that has been allocated thereto, which prevents a leak of information about the address that is used for communications in the normal situations via the network.","[d] Fourth Embodiment","In the second embodiment, it is allowable to design, as illustrated in , the dedicated frame to have a field to store therein information for identifying the sender of the authentication request (user ID) and send the authentication request using the dedicated format including the user ID of the sender.  is a schematic diagram of exemplary data structures of frame formats according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention.","The outline of an authentication system according to the fourth embodiment is described below. When, for example, the user inserts an employee card to the request sender terminal , the request sender terminal  receives a setting input of information about the address of the request receiver terminal  (e.g., \u201cIP-B\u201d) as the authentication information via the input device . The authentication-request sending unit then reads the employee number from the inserted employee card, stores the employee number in the field \u201cuser ID\u201d of the dedicated frame, and sends the authentication request to the request receiver terminal .","If the frame received from the request sender terminal  includes the destination IP address the same as the address of the request receiver terminal  (e.g., \u201cIP-B\u201d), information of which has been verbally given to the user of the request sender terminal , and the value in the field of \u201cEthernet (trademark) Type\u201d indicating that the frame is dedicated to the authentication, the authentication-request receiving unit of the request receiver terminal  determines the received frame to be the authentication request and displays a request receiving message on the output device . The employee number that is stored in the field \u201cuser ID\u201d of the frame appears on the request receiving message so that the user of the request receiver terminal  performs the authentication using the employee number.","The other processes performed by the request sender terminal  and the request receiver terminal  are the same as those in the above embodiments.","As mentioned above, the request sender terminal  sends the authentication request using the frame including the user ID (e.g., employee number) for identifying the user of the request sender terminal  so that the request receiver terminal  performs the authentication using the user identifier in addition to the authentication information, which allows more accurate authentication.","[e] Fifth Embodiment","If the authentication system according to the second embodiment includes a plurality of request receiver terminals  that determine whether the user of the request sender terminal  is authentic and can therefore access the network device , it is allowable to design the dedicated frame to have a plurality of fields of destinations (e.g., \u201cFirst Destination IP\u201d, \u201cSecond Destination IP\u201d, and \u201cThird Destination IP\u201d) as illustrated in  so as to send the authentication request to the plural request receiver terminals .  is a schematic diagram of data structures of frame formats according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention.","The outline of an authentication system according to the fifth embodiment is described in brief with reference to .  is a schematic diagram of the outline of the authentication system according to the fifth embodiment. A terminal A illustrated in  corresponds to the \u201crequest sender terminal\u201d of the above-described embodiments. Each of terminals B to B corresponds to the \u201crequest receiver terminal\u201d.","Acknowledgers B to B are users of the terminals B to B, respectively. The acknowledgers B to B verbally notify a traveling employee A, who is the user of the terminal A, of \u201cIP-B\u201d, \u201cIP-B\u201d, and \u201cIP-B\u201d, respectively.","The traveling employee A, who is the user of the terminal A, inputs \u201cIP-B\u201d, \u201cIP-B\u201d, and \u201cIP-B\u201d in the fields of destinations of the dedicate frame. Upon receiving the setting input from the user, the terminal A sends the authentication request to each of the terminals B to B.","Each of the acknowledgers B to B, who are the users of the terminals B to B, checks contents of the authentication request appearing on the display device and inputs an authentication result to the corresponding terminal. Upon receiving the input of the authentication result, each of the terminals B to B sends the authentication result to the terminal A. Even if, for example, the acknowledgers B and B are absent and only the acknowledger B is present, the traveling employee A can quickly receive the authentication result from the acknowledger B.","The other processes performed by the terminal A and the terminals B to B are basically the same as those performed by the request sender terminal  and the request receiver terminal  in the above-described embodiments.","As mentioned above, in the fifth embodiment, if a system includes a plurality of terminals (e.g., the terminals B to B) that determine whether the user of a terminal (e.g., terminal A) is authentic and can therefore access the network device  (switching hub or DHCP server), the authentication request is sent to each of the terminals B to B. Therefore, any of the terminals B to B can perform the authentication, which reduces a response time that it takes until sending of the authentication result.","In the above-described example of the fifth embodiment, the case where the traveling employee A, who is the user of the terminal A, inputs \u201cIP-B\u201d, \u201cIP-B\u201d, and \u201cIP-B\u201d in the fields of destinations of the dedicated frame and the terminal A then sends the authentication request to each of the terminals B to B using the dedicated frame. However, some other manners can be taken in the present invention. It is allowable to use a dedicated frame including a single multicast address so as to send the authentication request to a plurality of destinations (e.g., the terminals B to B).","[f] Sixth Embodiment","If the system according to the above-described fifth embodiment further includes a plurality of request sender terminals , which are used to access the network device , in addition to a plurality of request receiver terminals , which determine whether the user of the request sender terminal  is authentic and can therefore access the network device , and if the number of received authentication requests has increased to an upper limit and therefore the request receiver terminal  cannot receive a new authentication request, it is allowable to forward the new authentication request to another request receiver terminal . The outline of an authentication system according to a sixth embodiment is described below with reference to . Each of terminals A to A illustrated in  corresponds to the \u201crequest sender terminal\u201d of the above-described embodiments. Each of the terminals B to B corresponds to the \u201crequest receiver terminal\u201d, as is described in the fifth embodiment.","As illustrated in , each of the terminals A to A sends the authentication request to each of the terminals B to B, in the same manner as in the fifth embodiment. Upon receiving the authentication request (new authentication request), the terminal B, for example, determines whether the number of received authentication requests has increased to a predetermined upper limit. If it is determined that the number of received authentication requests has increased to the upper limit, the terminal B forwards the new authentication request to another terminal (e.g., the terminal B or the terminal B).","The processes performed by the terminals A to A and the terminals B to B are the same as those performed by the request sender terminal  and the request receiver terminal  described in the above embodiments.","As mentioned above, in the system that includes a plurality of terminals (e.g., the terminals A to A) that are used to access the network device  (a switching hub or a DHCP server) and a plurality of terminals (e.g., the terminals B to B) that determine whether the user of the terminal is authentic and can therefore access the network device, if the terminals A to A send an authentication request to each of the terminals B to B and the terminal B, for example, receives the authentication request, the terminal B determines whether the number of received authentication requests has increased to the predetermined upper limit. If it is determined that the number of received authentication requests has increased to the upper limit, the terminal B forwards the new authentication request to another terminal (e.g., the terminal B or the terminal B). Therefore, the processing load will be distributed among the terminals B to B.","The upper limit can be an administrator setting value or a fixed and program hard-coded value. Suppose there is a case where the terminal B further forwards the received authentication request to the terminal B because of the number of received authentication requests being the upper limit, and the terminal B determines that the number of received authentication requests at the terminal B being the upper limit. In this case, the terminal B determines that there is no terminal that can receive the authentication request. The terminal B discards the authentication request or returns a notification indicating that all the request receiver terminals are in busy, and the process control goes to end.","[g] Seventh Embodiment","In the above embodiments, the request sender terminal  can be configured to check whether the authentication result has been received at fixed time intervals and send, if no authentication result has been received, the authentication request again by using the authentication-request sending unit.","For example, as soon as the authentication-request sending unit sends the authentication request, the authentication-response receiving unit of the request sender terminal  starts a timer. The authentication-response receiving unit checks whether the authentication result has been received at fixed time intervals and instructs, if no authentication result has been received, the authentication-request sending unit to send the authentication request again. It is allowable to set an upper limit of the number of checks whether the authentication result has been received.","As mentioned above, the request sender terminal  according to the seventh embodiment checks whether the authentication result has been received at fixed time intervals and sends, if no authentication result has been received, the authentication request again. Therefore, the request sender terminal  can deal with a case where the authentication request is deleted from the network.","[h] Eighth Embodiment","In the above embodiments, it is allowable to record a log each time of registering or updating the permission status stored in the permission-status-information storage unit . The configuration of an authentication system according to an eighth embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to .  is a block diagram of the configuration of the authentication system according to the eighth embodiment.","As illustrated in , the authentication system according to the eighth embodiment has basically the same configuration as the authentication system according to the above-described embodiments except that the request receiver terminal  further includes a permission-information recording unit ","The permission-information recording unit monitors whether new information is registered in the permission-status-information storage unit or the permission state stored in the permission-status-information storage unit is updated. The permission-information recording unit records a log of information stored in the request receiver terminal  each time of registering or updating of the permission status (each time, for example, the authentication-request receiving unit registers the permission status or the source-MAC permitting unit and the source-MAC denying unit updates the permission status).","As mentioned above, the request receiver terminal  according to the eighth embodiment records a log of registering or updating of the permission status each time of registering or updating of information about the permission status. Therefore, the user of the request receiver terminal  can check the history concerning access permission for the request sender terminal  if required.","The log of information about the permission status can be stored in not only the own terminal but also another device. In the latter case, information about the permission status is, for example, sent to the device by an existing network control tool or an application programming interface (API) having a log tool.","[i] Ninth Embodiment","If the system includes a plurality of request receiver terminals  that determine whether the user of the request sender terminal  is authentic and can therefore access the network device  as in the cases described in the fifth embodiment or the sixth embodiment, it is allowable to aggregate the authentication result from each of the request receiver terminals . The configuration of an authentication system according to a ninth embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to .  is a block diagram of the configuration of the authentication system according to the ninth embodiment.","As illustrated in , the authentication system according to the ninth embodiment has basically the same configuration as the authentication system according to the above-described embodiments except for further including request receiver terminals  and  and an authentication-result aggregating units  and .","Upon receiving the authentication request from the request sender terminal , each of the request receiver terminals  and  determines that the first destination terminal that is stored in the first one of the fields of destinations of the received frame (see ) to be a terminal that aggregates the authentication results (hereinafter, \u201caggregating terminal\u201d). The aggregating terminal is not limited to the destination terminal stored in the first field. Any one of destination terminals can be determined to be the aggregating terminal.","If the aggregating terminal is, for example, the request receiver terminal , the authentication-result aggregating unit  of the request receiver terminal  notifies the authentication-result aggregating unit  of the request receiver terminal  of the authentication result received from the user. The authentication-result aggregating unit  of the request receiver terminal  aggregates the authentication results received from the request receiver terminal  and the request receiver terminal . If the both authentication results are permission to access the network device , the authentication-result aggregating unit  instructs a source-MAC permitting unit to register the MAC address of the request sender terminal , which is the sender of the authentication request, in the network device  as an access permitted terminal and instructs an authentication-response sending unit to send the authentication result to the request sender terminal .","The determination whether the request sender terminal  is permissible to access the network device  can be made by some references other than whether all the authentication results of the request receiver terminals are access permission. For example, a percentage of the number of the authentication results indicative of access permission for the request sender terminal (relative value) or whether the number of authentication results indicative of access permission is larger than a threshold (absolute value) can be used to determine whether access by the request sender terminal  is permissible.","As mentioned above, upon receiving the authentication request having a plurality of destinations representing request receiver terminals, the request receiver terminal according to the ninth embodiment (e.g., the request receiver terminal  or ) aggregates the authentication results received from all the request receiver terminals including the own terminal and registers, if it is determined using a result of the aggregation that access to the network device  is permissible, information about the address of the terminal device, which is the sender of the authentication request, in the network device  as an access permitted terminal. This improves the security level compared with the case where a single request receiver terminal performs the authentication. If there are two or more request receiver terminals, for example, it can be configured to register information about the address of the terminal device, which is the sender of the authentication request, in the network device  as an access permitted terminal only when two of the request receiver terminals or more determine that access by the request sender terminal is permissible.","[j] Tenth Embodiment","In the above embodiments, the IP address, which is used as the authentication information of the request sender terminal , can be changed dramatically depending on various triggers. The outline of an authentication system according to a tenth embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to .  are block diagrams of the configuration of the authentication system according to the tenth embodiment.","As illustrated in , the authentication system according to the tenth embodiment has basically the same configuration as the authentication system according to the above-described embodiments except that the request receiver terminal  further includes an IP dynamic changing unit ","The IP dynamic changing unit changes the IP address, which is used as the authentication information, at, for example, terminal setup as a trigger. As illustrated in , upon detecting setup of the request receiver terminal , the IP dynamic changing unit requests the DHCP server  for an IP address and then receives the IP address from the DHCP server . If the received IP address is the same as the previous IP address, the IP dynamic changing unit releases the received IP address, requests the DHCP server  for a new IP address different from the received IP address, and receives the new address from the DHCP server .","The IP dynamic changing unit can be configured to change the IP address that is used as the authentication information at the completion of the registration of permission for the request sender terminal  to access the network device  as a trigger. In other words, as illustrated in , when the IP dynamic changing unit detects that the authentication result has been sent by the authentication-response sending unit after the completion of the registration of permission for the request sender terminal  to access the network device , the IP dynamic changing unit releases the current IP address, requests the DHCP server  for a new IP address, and then receives the new IP address from the DHCP server . If the received IP address is the same as the previous IP address, the IP dynamic changing unit releases the received IP address, requests the DHCP server  for a new IP address different from the received IP address, and receives the new address from the DHCP server  in the same manner as described above.","Once an IP is sent to a given terminal, a typical DHCP server stores therein the MAC of the given terminal and the sent IP as a pair and sends, if receiving an IP acquisition request with the same MAC address within a predetermined period, the same IP to the given terminal. To acquire an IP address different from that acquired at the previous startup, the request receiver terminal, for example, activates itself using an MAC address different from that used at the previous setup or explicitly requests for a different IP using a DHCP Offer message.","As mentioned above, when the authentication information is acquired again at the startup or the completion of the authentication and it is determined that the acquired authentication information is the same as that used in the previous time, the request receiver terminal according to the tenth embodiment acquires different authentication information. Therefore, the same authentication information cannot be used repeatedly, which improves the security level.","The authentication information can be changed without requesting the DHCP server  for an IP address. Some other manners can be used in the present invention, such as a manner of acquiring an IP using a PPP over Ethernet (PPoE) or a manner of storing some IP addresses in the request receiver terminal , selecting by the request receiver terminal  an appropriate IP address different from the IP address that is used at the previous time, and using the selected IP address as the authentication information.","[k] Eleventh Embodiment","In the above embodiments, the permission for the request sender terminal  to access the network device  can be cancelled in response to various triggers. An authentication system according to an eleventh embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to .  is a block diagram of the configuration of the authentication system according to the eleventh embodiment.","As illustrated in , the authentication system according to the eleventh embodiment has basically the same configuration as the authentication system according to the above-described embodiments except that the request receiver terminal  further includes a permission-canceling-trigger detecting unit ","The permission-canceling-trigger detecting unit detects terminal shutdown, shift to a suspend status, and change in the usage status, such as terminal logoff, as a trigger for deregistration. The permission-canceling-trigger detecting unit starts a built-in timer when the registration of the request sender terminal  in the network device  as an access permitted terminal is completed and then detects that the trigger for deregistration is set on a predetermined period after the completion of the registration. Moreover, the permission-canceling-trigger detecting unit detects change in the application usage status as the trigger for deregistration, such as end or logoff of an application that is used for a conference by both the request sender terminal  and the request receiver terminal . When the permission-canceling-trigger detecting unit detects the above-described triggers for deregistration, the permission-canceling-trigger detecting unit instructs the cancel-instruction receiving unit to delete the information about the address of the request sender terminal  from a list of access permitted terminals stored in the network device .","As mentioned above, the request receiver terminal  in the eleventh embodiment detects change in the usage status and deletes, if change in the usage status has been detected, the information about the address of the request sender terminal  from a list of access permitted terminals stored in the network device . The access permission for the request sender terminal  can be cancelled in response to, for example, change in the usage status such as shut-down, shift to the suspend status, and logoff of the request receiver terminal , as a trigger. With this configuration, the authentication system can deal with a case where the user is away from the request receiver terminal , which improves the security level.","Moreover, in the eleventh embodiment, the information about the address of the request sender terminal  is deleted from a list of access permitted terminals stored in the network device  a predetermined period after the registration of the information of the address of the terminal device. This avoids a risk that the user of the request receiver terminal  forgets performing the canceling process and therefore improves the security level.","Furthermore, in the eleventh embodiment, when change in the application usage status of the request receiver terminal  is detected, the information about the address of the request sender terminal  is deleted from a list of access permitted terminals stored in the network device . The access permission for the request sender terminal  is cancelled in response to, for example, end of an application that is used for a conference by both the request sender terminal  and the request receiver terminal  as a trigger. This avoids a risk of illegal access to the network device  after the original purpose has been achieved and therefore improves the security level.","[l] Twelfth Embodiment","The present invention can be implemented by other embodiments in addition to the above-described various embodiments. In the following section, other embodiments included in the present invention will be described.","(1) Device Configuration, Etc.","The constituent elements of the request receiver terminal  illustrated in  are merely conceptual, and need not be physically configured as illustrated.

A part of the authentication processing program can be stored in a storage unit of another computer that is connected to the computer  via a network if required.","When the CPU  reads the authentication processing program from the HDD  and then loads the authentication processing program on the RAM , the authentication processing program works as an authentication process as illustrated in . The authentication process reads the input data , etc., from the HDD , loads the obtained data on an area of the RAM  allocated thereto, and executes various processes using the loaded data, etc. The authentication process corresponds to the authentication-request receiving unit , the authentication-result receiving unit , the source-MAC permitting unit , the authentication-response sending unit , the cancel-instruction receiving unit , and the source-MAC denying unit of the request receiver terminal  illustrated in .","It is not necessary to prestore the above-described authentication processing program in the HDD .
