{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates to incorporating game mechanics into a web site, mobile site, and\/or app using an automated access, self-serve platform.","Gamification is the use of game play mechanics for non-game applications, particularly consumer-oriented web and mobile sites, as well as apps, in order to encourage people to adopt the applications. Game mechanics are constructs intended to produce enjoyable gameplay. Put another way, game mechanics include elements of a game that allow for a fun and engaging user experience, such as, for example goals; points; collecting badges, awards, trophies, and\/or other collectable items; rankings and leaderboards; levels; exchange of virtual and\/or real goods and currencies; and feedback loops. The game mechanics are the building blocks that can be applied and combined to \u201cgamify\u201d any non-game context.","Gamification strives to encourage users to engage in desired behaviors in connection with the applications. Gamification works by making technology more engaging, and by encouraging desired behaviors, taking advantage of humans' psychological predisposition to engage in gaming. By implementing game mechanics in sites and\/or apps, users may be encouraged to perform tasks that they ordinarily might consider boring, such as completing surveys, shopping, or reading web sites. Typically, in order to gamify a web or mobile site, a publisher must manually implement game mechanics with the site and\/or app.","Implementations of the present technology provide a self-serve approach for incorporating game mechanics with an existing or new web site, mobile site, and\/or app using an automated access, self-serve platform. Game mechanics may be incorporated into a web site, mobile site, and\/or app using a self-serve application programming interface (API) tool, in accordance with some implementations. At a gamification server, a user interface may be generated for a user visiting a site and\/or utilizing an app provided by a site server. In some implementations, a widget and\/or other graphical control element may be generated that is configured to serve as such a user interface. The user interface may be configured to be incorporated with the site and\/or app. The gamification server may be separate and distinct from the site server. An economy may be defined at the gamification server that governs game mechanics associated with the user interface. The economy may be based on and\/or include business rules and\/or logic. The user interface may be provided for integration with the site and\/or app. Integration of the user interface with the site and\/or app may provide the game mechanics to the site and\/or app. In some implementations, the user interface may be generated based on input provided by or on behalf of a publisher of a site and\/or app.","One aspect of the disclosure relates to a system for incorporating game mechanics with a web site, mobile site, and\/or app using a self-serve application programming interface (API) tool, in accordance with one or more implementations. The system may include at least one end-user computing platform, a site server, external resources, a gamification server, and\/or other components, all being in communication via a network.","The site server may be configured to host a web site, mobile site, and\/or app accessible by the end-user computing platform. Such a site and\/or app may facilitate online commerce, media presentation, and\/or other functions associated with web sites, mobile sites, and\/or apps. The site server may be configured to provide one or more apps accessible and\/or executable by the end-user computing platform. The term \u201capp\u201d may generically describe a web-based application tailored to specific client computing platform form factors and user interfaces.","The gamification server may be configured to provide a self-serve application programming interface that allows a publisher of a web site, mobile site, and\/or app to incorporate game mechanics with the site(s) and\/or app(s). The gamification server may be configured to execute a gamification program. The gamification program may be configured to provide a self-serve application programming interface tool that allows a publisher of a web site, mobile site, and\/or app to incorporate game mechanics with the site(s) and\/or app(s). The gamification program may be configured to operate in concert with the site server and\/or with sites and\/or apps provided by the site server.","According to some implementations, a publisher of a site (e.g., a web site and\/or a mobile site) and\/or an app provided by the site server may access the gamification server via the network to manipulate one or more modules of the gamification program. The gamification server may provide a site and\/or app to facilitate interactions between the publisher and the gamification program. Actions performed by the publisher with the gamification program may affect one or more game mechanics and\/or other features of the site and\/or app in real time, near-real time, and\/or at another time. In some implementations, the gamification program may provide a live representation of the site and\/or app to the publisher so changes and\/or modifications made to the game mechanics of the site and\/or app are viewable in real time.","The gamification program may include one or more computer program modules and\/or instructions that may be executed by the processor(s). The one or more computer program modules may include one or more of user interface configuration modules, economy configuration modules, analytics modules, and\/or other modules. The user interface configuration modules may include one or more of a profile module, a check-in module, a sharing module, an achievements module, a leaderboard module, a logo module, and\/or other modules. The economy configuration modules may include one or more of a currency module, an achievements editing module, a transaction module, a level groups module, an award groups module, a good groups module, a URL module, an attributes module, and\/or other modules. The analytics modules may include one or more of temporal reports module, an API reports module, an awards reports module, a goods reports module, a level reports module, a points reports module, a user reports module, and\/or other modules.","The user interface configuration modules may be configured to generate and maintain a user interface that can be incorporated with a site (e.g., a web site and\/or a mobile site) and\/or app provided by the site server. The user interface may serve as a graphical interface for a user visiting the site or utilizing the app. For example, the user interface may allow the user to track progress and\/or other aspects of associated with the game mechanics offered by the site and\/or app. Once the user interface is generated at the gamification server, the user interface may be provided for integration with the site and\/or app. Integration of the user interface with the site and\/or app may provide game mechanics to the site and\/or app. According to some implementations, providing the user interface for integration with the site and\/or app may include providing, to the publisher, code corresponding to the user interface for insertion into code for the site and\/or app. In some embodiments, API calls may be authenticated by one or more of the user interface configuration modules. Such authentication may be performed via one or more encrypted communication channels associated with the gamification server, the site server, and\/or other components of the system.","The profile module may be configured to allow users to sign into the user interface and\/or site and\/or app via a third-party account. By way of non-limiting example, a user may sign into the user interface via their Facebook\u2122 account using a Facebook\u2122 Connect feature associated with the gamification server. The profile module may be configured to provide, for presentation to a user, analytics associated with the game mechanics of the site and\/or app. The profile module may allow the publisher may select one or more achievement representations that are viewable from the user interface. Achievement representations are described in further detail in connection with the achievements editing module. The profile module may allow the publisher may select a count to be viewable from the user interface for individual ones of viewable achievement representations.","The check-in module may be configured to allow the publisher of the site and\/or app to select whether to enable the user interface to reward users that check in to the user interface and\/or the site and\/or app. The check-in module may be configured to allow users, by checking in, to show that they have visited the site and\/or utilized the app. Visiting the site may allow users to earn points for repeat visits and\/or utilizations.","The sharing module may be configured to allow the publisher of the site and\/or app to select whether to enable the user interface from rewarding users that share content. The sharing module may be configured to allow users to earn points for sharing content and\/or links to pages on the site and\/or app. In some implementations, the sharing module may be configured to allow users to earn points for visitors that visit the site and\/or app by following shared links.","The achievements module may be configured to allow the publisher to select whether to enable the user interface from displaying representations of which achievements a user has earned and\/or which available achievements the user has not earned. The achievements module may be configured to provide a button, icon, and\/or other selectable graphic that allows a user to display one or more available achievements.","The leaderboard module may be configured to allow the publisher and\/or a user to select whether to enable the user interface from displaying a leaderboard. A leaderboard may be a board or list on which the currencies, points, and\/or scores of one or more leading users are displayed. The leaderboard module may be configured to allow the publisher and\/or a user to select one or more metrics reflected by the leaderboard. Examples of such metrics may include counters associated with achievements and\/or other statistics associated with the game mechanics of the site and\/or app. The leaderboard module may be configured to allow the publisher and\/or a user to select a type of leaderboard to be displayed by the user interface. Types of leaderboards may include a \u201ctop-ten\u201d leaderboard, a leaderboard relative to a user, and\/or other formats for leaderboards. According to some implementations, a top ten leaderboard may display the top users, while a relative-to-user leaderboard may display a given user's current rank and three users above and six users below the given user's current rank.","The logo module may be configured to allow the publisher of the site and\/or app to select a logo and\/or other graphics to be displayed by the user interface. In some implementations, the publisher can upload a graphic and\/or provide a URL to a graphic. The logo module may be configured to scale graphics provided by the publisher so that the graphics display in a predetermined space within the user interface. A logo and\/or other graphic may include a hyperlink to various content and\/or sites.","The economy configuration modules may be configured to define and\/or modify an economy governing the game mechanics of the site and\/or app. The economy includes the exchange and consumption of virtual goods and services using currency and loyalty points by utilizing game mechanics. In exemplary implementations, this may create user engagement, incentivize virality, and\/or enable user monetization.","The currency module may be configured to define one or more aspects of one or more currencies used in conjunction with the site and\/or app. In some implementations, currency and \u201cpoints\u201d may be one and the same. A currency may operate as a counter that counts user actions, a point system, a true virtual currency for purchase transactions, and\/or a tracking system for other actions in the economy. Examples of aspects of a currency that may be defined by the currency module include a currency title, currency type, a currency description, an exchange rate, and\/or other aspects of the currency. The currency title may be the name of the currency as determined by the publisher. The currency description may include a textual description for the currency as provided by the publisher. The currency exchange rate may be a ratio at which a unit of currency defined by the currency module can be exchanged for real currency (e.g., U.S. dollars).","The currency type of a given currency may include redeemable, non-redeemable, purchase, hybrid, reward, \u00fcber, experience, social, skill, and\/or another type of currency. The currency type may be selected based on how the currency is utilized by the site and\/or app. With redeemable-type currencies, users will be able to exchange the currency for virtual gifts and goods, content access, and\/other virtual and real items and services. With non-redeemable-type currencies, points associated with a user may be added or deducted, but the currency will not be exchangeable for virtual or real items and\/or services. With purchase-type currencies, users are only able to gain the currency by buying it with real money. The exchange rate may be established by the publisher via the currency module. With hybrid-type currencies, users may be rewarded with the currency as well as purchase it with real money. With reward-type currencies, the currency is given away to users who perform actions valued by the publisher of the site and\/or app. With \u00fcber-type currencies, the currency is purchases with real money and can span multiple web sites, mobile sites, and\/or apps, beyond those provided by the site server. These currencies can be exchanged and\/or used in cross-publisher implementations. With experience-type currencies, experience points may be used for measuring a user's overall participation. According to some implementations, experience-type currencies do not decrease for a given user. With social-type currencies, social points may be used for measuring and rewarding community impact, such as reputation or influence. With skill-type currencies, skill points are used as a measure of a user's proficiency at some action associated with the site and\/or app. In some implementations, multiple currency types may be associated with a given action. For example, when a user shares something, they may receive ten redeemable reward points (adding to their balance of points to use in a virtual gift store), one tracking point (to keep track of the number of times they share), and fifteen non-redeemable experience points (for their overall activity score).","In some implementations, the currency module may be configured to define unique-token-based support for idempotency. This may prevent a given API request by a given user from being replayed. In some implementations, a unique value (e.g., a globally unique identifier (GUID)) may be included in an API request signature. After that API request has succeeded, additional replays of the same API request may be disallowed.","The transaction module may be configured to define transactions of currency that occur responsive to user actions. The transaction module may be configured to allow the publisher of the site and\/or app to specify a transaction title, a transaction description, a currency type for a given transaction, a default transaction amount, and\/or other information associated with transactions. In accordance with some implementations, the transaction module may be configured to group defined transactions together so that multiple transactions are made responsive to a single user action.","According to some implementations, the transaction module may be configured to assign one or more nested transactions to a transaction group. Individual ones of the one or more nested transactions may be associated with one or more different currencies corresponding to a common user action. By way of non-limiting example, a given transaction group executed when a user leaves a comment on a website may include three nested transactions, which may be to provide comment points to the user, to provide participation points to the user, and to provide community impact points to the user. Thus, when a given user leaves a comment on the website, the entire transaction group is executed so that that user is provided comment points, participation points, and community impact points. In accordance with some implementations, individual nested transactions of a transaction group can be added, subtracted, and\/or modified on-the-fly.","In some implementations, the entire transaction group may fail responsive to failure of one or more of the nested transactions assigned to the transaction group. To illustrate, by way of non-limiting example, a given transaction group executed when a user purchases a virtual good for another user may include three nested transactions, which may be to deduct ten virtual bucks from the user's account, to provide share points to the user, and to provide gift points to the user. If the user only has eight virtual bucks in his account, the entire transaction group may fail such that the user does not receive share points or virtual points because the first nested transaction failed due to insufficient funds in the user's account.","The transaction module may be configured to an end-user-cap and a time interval associated with individual transaction groups, according to some implementations. An end-user-cap may be a maximum number of times a given transaction group is valid for a given user within a corresponding time interval. The time interval may include an amount of time. In some implementations, the time interval may be infinite such that the end-user-cap is an absolute maximum number of times a given transaction group is valid for a given user.","The achievements editing module may be configured to create and\/or edit achievements associated with the site and\/or app. Achievements may be shown graphically by achievement representations. Achievement representations may include a distinctive badge, virtual token, emblem, and\/or other graphic. Achievement representations may be displayed as an insignia of rank, office, and\/or membership in an organization. The achievements editing module may be configured to allow the publisher to define one or more aspects of a given achievement. Exemplary aspects of achievements may include an achievement title, an achievement description, and\/or other aspects of an achievement. By way of non-limiting example, achievements may be utilized to indicate stages of progress for a profile being completed, a level of accomplishment for any particular activity on a site and\/or app, and\/or other accomplishments of a user. The achievements editing module may be configured to determine an appearance of given achievement representations. In some implementations, images and\/or other graphics used as achievement representations may be specified and\/or uploaded by the publisher. Achievement representations may include a hyperlink to various content and\/or sites.","The level groups module may be configured to define levels associated with the game mechanics of the site and\/or app. Integration of levels into the site and\/or app may encourage users to return to complete tasks, to achieve goals, and\/or to perform other actions in the pursuit of the next level. The level groups module may be configured to allow the publisher to specify one or more aspects of individual levels. Exemplary aspects of a given level may include a level title, a level user title, a level description, a level user description, a currency associated with the given level, URLs associated with the given level, publisher defined attributes associated with the given level, and\/or other aspects associated with levels. A level title may include a name of a level. A level user title may include a name of a level that is displayed to a user of the site and\/or app. A level description may include a textual description of a level. A level user description may include a description of a level that is displayed to a user of the site and\/or app. URLs associated with a level may reference images, an error or success page, and\/or other information. Publisher defined attributes associated with a level may be used to classify analytics, drive logic, or filter objects.","In some implementations, the level groups module may be configured to define one or more quests, in accordance with some implementations. Individual ones of the one or more quests may include a set of tasks and\/or segments configured to unlock one or more achievements upon completion of a defined number of tasks and\/or segments. To illustrate, by way of non-limiting example, a site associated with a movie may have a quest including one or more tasks and\/or segments. Those tasks and\/or segments may include reading an article on the leading actor, reading an article on the leading actress, and completing a questionnaire associated with the movie. The tasks and\/or segments may be performed in a predetermined sequent or in any order, according to various implementations. Once a user has completed all of the tasks and\/or segments of the quest, a previously unavailable achievement may become available to or awarded to the user.","The award groups module may be configured to awards associated with the game mechanics of the site and\/or app. An award may include one or more items granted as merited or due. Users may be given awards in certain scenarios defined by the publisher. The award groups module may be configured to allow the publisher to specify one or more aspects of individual awards. Exemplary aspects of a given award may include an award title, an award user title, an award description, an award user description, URLs associated with the given award, and\/or other aspects associated with awards. An award title may include a name of an award. An award user title may include a name of an award that is displayed to a user of the site and\/or app. An award description may include a textual description of an award. An award user description may include a description of an award that is displayed to a user of the site and\/or app. URLs associated with an award may reference images, an error or success page, and\/or other information.","The good groups module may be configured to define one or more virtual goods associated with the site and\/or app. Virtual goods may include non-physical objects that are purchased, gifted, exchanged, and\/or otherwise transacted for use in virtual environments (e.g., online communities and\/or online games). Individual virtual goods may be assigned a relative weight for sorting or importance in relation to other virtual goods. The good groups module may be configured to allow the publisher to specify one or more aspects of individual virtual goods. Exemplary aspects of a given virtual good may include a good title, a good user title, a good description, a good user description, URLs associated with the given level, publisher defined attributes associated with the given level, and\/or other aspects associated with levels. A good title may include a name of a virtual good. A good user title may include a name of a virtual good that is displayed to a user of the site and\/or app. A good description may include a textual description of a virtual good. A good user description may include a description of a virtual good that is displayed to a user of the site and\/or app. URLs associated with a virtual good may reference images, an error or success page, and\/or other information. Publisher defined attributes associated with a virtual good may be used to classify analytics, drive logic, or filter objects.","The URL module may be configured to allow the publisher to define a URL associated with an object within the site and\/or app. An object within the site and\/or app may include an achievement and\/or achievement representation, a level, an award, a virtual good, and\/or other objects. The URL module may be configured to allow the publisher to specify whether a URL is associated with media. The URL module may be configured to allow the publisher to specify whether a URL is accessible by a user. The URL module may be configured to allow the publisher to specify one or more aspects of individual URLs. Exemplary aspects of a given URL may include URL title, URL user title, a URL description, a URL user description, publisher defined attributes associated with a URL, and\/or other aspects associated with a URL. A URL title may include a name of a URL. A URL user title may include a name of a URL that is displayed to a user of the site and\/or app. A URL description may include a textual description of a URL. A URL user description may include a description of a URL that is displayed to a user of the site and\/or app. Publisher defined attributes associated with a URL may be used to classify analytics, drive logic, or filter objects.","The attributes module may be configured to allow the publisher to define one or more publisher defined attributes associated with objects within the site and\/or app. Publisher defined attributes may be used as tags to allow the publisher to filter data associated with and\/or stored in an API. Publisher defined attributes may be used to classify analytics, drive logic, or filter objects. The attributes module may be configured to allow the publisher to specify one or more aspects of individual publisher defined attributes. Exemplary aspects of a given publisher defined attribute may include an attribute title, an attribute user title, an attribute description, an attribute user description, an attribute friendly ID, and\/or other aspects associated with an attribute. An attribute title may include a name of an attribute. An attribute user title may include a name of an attribute that is displayed to a user of the site and\/or app. An attribute description may include a textual description of an attribute. An attribute user description may include a description of an attribute that is displayed to a user of the site and\/or app. An attribute friendly ID may include a reference identification associated with an object that is distinguishable from the corresponding object title.","The analytics modules may be configured to provide various reports on analytics associated with the game mechanics of the site and\/or app. These reports may be utilized by the publisher to, among other things, track site and\/or app usage, make decisions on modifications to the game mechanics, and\/or to perform other maintenance and\/or development actions associated with the site and\/or app. The reports may include textual data, graphical data, and\/or other data representations. In some implementations, one or more of the analytics modules continuously and\/or periodically aggregates data associated with the publisher to generate new reports and\/or update existing reports.","The temporal reports module may be configured to provide reports on various analytics on a temporal basis (e.g., by day or by hour by day). The reports may include information indicative of points per time period, number of active users per time period, virtual goods transacted per time period, and\/or other information indicative of time-based analytics. The temporal reports module may be configured to specify a time period of interest, a currency, whether the analytics are from a source or a sink, and\/or other factors associated with time-based analytics of the game mechanics of the site and\/or app.","The API reports module may be configured to provide reports on analytics associated with API requests.

Individual ones of the one or more nested transactions may be associated with one or more different currencies corresponding to a common user action. By way of non-limiting example, a given transaction group executed when a user leaves a comment on a website may include three nested transactions, which may be to provide comment points to the user, to provide participation points to the user, and to provide community impact points to the user. Thus, when a given user leaves a comment on the website, the entire transaction group is executed so that that user is provided comment points, participation points, and community impact points. In accordance with some implementations, individual nested transactions of a transaction group can be added, subtracted, and\/or modified on-the-fly.","In some implementations, the entire transaction group may fail responsive to failure of one or more of the nested transactions assigned to the transaction group. To illustrate, by way of non-limiting example, a given transaction group executed when a user purchases a virtual good for another user may include three nested transactions, which may be to deduct ten virtual bucks from the user's account, to provide share points to the user, and to provide gift points to the user. If the user only has eight virtual bucks in his account, the entire transaction group may fail such that the user does not receive share points or virtual points because the first nested transaction failed due to insufficient funds in the user's account.","The transaction module  may be configured to an end-user-cap and a time interval associated with individual transaction groups, according to some implementations. An end-user-cap may be a maximum number of times a given transaction group is valid for a given user within a corresponding time interval. The time interval may include an amount of time.
