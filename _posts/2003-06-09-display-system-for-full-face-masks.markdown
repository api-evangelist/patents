{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","This invention relates to displays for full face masks. More particularly, this invention is to a display system and method for a full face mask that allows the operator (e.g. diver, firefighter) to see data from multiple sources at a single location regardless of environmental conditions and physical constraints upon the operator and without substantially obstructing the operator's field of view.","Tasks that need to be performed by personnel under hazardous conditions e.g., diving operations or fighting fires, frequently have the operators at least partially protected by life-supporting full face masks (FFM). These operators wearing FFMs are typically required to visually acquire and monitor information from numerous separate data sources (e.g. gauges, indicators, maps, technical drawings and other databases) that can be remotely located and normally not available for immediate viewing. Effective acquisition of data is essential for survival and effective performance of missions in the extremely dangerous environments associated with diving, firefighting, etc. These activities, even in ideal conditions, can be time consuming and distracting to cause inefficient and possibly unsafe actions. In extreme environments, where the data sources are not readable due to high turbidity, low light, smoke, etc. or access to the data sources is hampered by physical restrictions, the operator's safety and the mission's outcome can be doubtful.","One commercially available FFM that is widely used in diving (military, commercial, search & rescue, police) throughout the world is the DIVATOR MK II (previously known as the AGA FFM). Previous display systems that present data to the operator using this FFM have been large and bulky, and mounted externally to the FFM. Some of the prior art display systems used with this FFM severely compromise the operator's field of view, can be difficult or impossible to align for easy viewing, and can be easily knocked off the mask or become entangled.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for a display method and system for FFMs to allow clear and easy viewing of data without eye-strain by simply looking to an adjustable optical element inside the FFM that magnifies and focuses the data at a comfortable viewing distance under ambient conditions that would otherwise make this difficult or impossible.","An object of the invention is to provide a method and system for displaying inside an FFM for appraisal of data from several sources.","Another object of the invention is to provide a method and system for displaying in an FFM that places a small adjustable display module inside the mask to present the data the operator needs.","Another object of the invention is to provide a method and system for displaying in an FFM that provides easy access simply by glancing down at display optics in the FFM regardless of the environmental conditions and physical restrictions.","Another object of the invention is to provide a method and system for displaying in an FFM having a display control module located according to operator preference such that it does not interfere with operations yet is accessible for operator-control of the display module.","Another object of the invention is to provide a method and system for displaying in an FFM that can be added as a retro-fit to allow benefits of the invention for current users of the other FFM systems.","Another object of the invention is to provide a method and system for displaying in an FFM that is easily viewable and adjustable, has a compact display module placed in the corner of the mask, and lets the operator see the needed data regardless of environmental conditions, without sacrificing field of view, and without having a bulky module attached to the outside of the mask frame.","Another object of the invention is to provide a method and system for displaying in an FFM by a completely enclosed display module, and a low profile external display control module to reduce the possibility of snagging as compared to bulky, externally mounted display systems.","Another object of the invention is to provide a method and system for displaying in an FFM having an adjustable optical alignment capability for a display module to accommodate anthropometrical differences between operators [i.e. variety of face shapes and sizes which affect mask fit, as well as varying interpupillary distances for different operators].","Another object of the invention is to provide a method and system for displaying in an FFM having a display\/optical module of small size that is placed to minimally interfere with an operator's field of view.","Another object of the invention is to provide a method and system for displaying in an FFM using a remotely located display control module that can be mounted at different locations on an operator's head to best suit the operator's needs.","Another object of the invention is to provide a method and system for displaying in an FFM having a separate display control module to allow upgrade\/additions of sensors and data supplied to a display module without modification to the display module itself.","Another object of the invention is to provide a method and system for displaying in an FFM that avoids the use of mirrors and transparent sheets in the display optical path to reduce the problems associated with condensation (particularly in high humidity diving & firefighting environments) on such surfaces that might otherwise alter magnification and view-ability.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Accordingly, the present invention is to a method and system that displays information in a full face mask. A display module is mounted inside the full face mask on faceplate support structure outside of a forward viewing area of a faceplate portion. The display module is located to be free of interference with an operator's forward field of view through the forward viewing area. A display control module is externally mounted on outside components of the full face mask and has a waterproof housing, processing and display driving electronics, memory, internal sensors, external sensors, and battery. A power-data cable is connected to the display control module externally mounted on the full face mask and to the display module inside the full face mask via an accessory interface plate. A switch on the display control module can be accessed and selectably actuated by an operator to present data from the display control module on the display module.","Referring to  of the drawings, display system  of the invention can be interfaced to modify a full face mask (FFM) . FFM  can be any of several contemporary designs worn by divers and\/or firefighters that assure visibility and protection as they perform dangerous and demanding tasks.","Display system  includes a display module  and a display control module  that can provide essential data (or information) to an operator (e.g., diver or firefighter) regarding life support and other mission essential data. This data comes from multiple data sources and is shown at a single location on display module  located inside  of FFM . Display control module  of display system  also can be at a single location outside  of FFM  on outside components that include faceplate support structure  that has an elastomeric lip  that can combine with straps  and other compliant portions to rest and seal against bony contours around the facial area. Faceplate support structure  also positions a faceplate portion  in front of an operator's forward-viewing area  to allow an operator to see and perform tasks effectively. Faceplate support structure  of FFM  can be made of the same clear material as faceplate portion  or can be opaque rubber-like material that has sufficient strength to also support display module .","Display module  is mounted to extend through faceplate support structure . The place where display module  is located is below and off to the side or other convenient place on faceplate support structure  that is peripheral to the operator's forward viewing area . This peripheral location of display module  permits an operator to merely rotate the eyes to the side to see data from multiple sources in a single location in FFM  regardless of environmental conditions and the operator's physical constraints and without substantially obstructing the operator's forward field of view.","In accordance with this invention display system  can be used to upgrade other commercially available FFMs  of similar design that are used for diving and firefighting. For example display system  can be retro-fitted to the commercial off-the-shelf FFM  known as the DIVATOR MK II marketed by INTERSPIRO and sold and marketed by a number of companies, distributors, and manufacturer's representatives worldwide.","Referring also to , , and , display module  of display system  has a waterproof housing  mounted inside of FFM  by a mounting mechanism  that extends through the lower right front part of faceplate support structure . Mounting mechanism  has a threaded rod A that extends thru a hole B drilled in faceplate support structure with a securing nut C on the outside. Hole B can be sealed by mechanical means (i.e. an O-ring D) to prevent water leaking into the mask. Display module  can be detached by removing nut C and pulling display module  out of FFM  from the inside. The remaining hole B can be sealed using an appropriate mechanical sealing method. In this way the operator can add or remove display module  as needed.","Housing  of display module  contains optics , a micro-display\/electronics section  having a micro-screen , and optical alignment-adjustment mechanism  on mounting mechanism . Typically, adjustment-alignment mechanism  can be a \u2018ball-and-socket\u2019 swivel mount, sometimes called a \u2018gimble-mount\u2019 in the industry. These components are arranged in a compact water-tight package that allows an operator wearing FFM  to easily view a magnified virtual image of data on micro-display\/electronics section . Since display module  is peripherally located inside the lower right (or left) corner on faceplate support structure  of FFM , the data presented on micro-screen  of micro-display\/electronics section  is free of interference with an operator's forward field of view through forward viewing area  in face plate portion .","The type of micro-screen  of micro-display\/electronics section  that is used is dependent on the data required by the operator or available for a job at hand. A custom segmental liquid crystal display (LCD) could be selected or a monochrome or color 1\/4 VGA, VGA. In this context, the term VGA refers to an industry standard display resolution of 640\u00d7480 pixels (horizontal and vertical); 1\/4 VGA refers to a 320\u00d7240 display resolution format; SVGA refers to 800\u00d7600 pixel resolution. In addition, the display of data is not limited to liquid crystal Display (LCD) technology but could also be light emitting diode (LED) or electro-luminescent (EL) or video display as well. Optics  can include several lenses that make micro-screen  appear highly magnified at an apparent distance of typically ten to twelve inches from the operator's eye. Digital alpha-numeric characters typically appear to be about one-half inch in height which is easily readable even when reading glasses are worn, see characters \u201c1 B \u201d on as they appear from micro-screen  through optics  in . Micro-screen  can be illuminated (back-lighted); however if LCD, LED or EL displays are used, no additional backlighting is needed. Alignment mechanism  of display module  is accessible from inside  of FFM  by the operator to allow corrections of optical alignment with the operator's right eye.","The data, or information presented for viewing by display module  is supplied by a display control module  that can be remotely located on the operator's head at various locations on the outside components of FFM  as shown in ,  and . These outside components of FFM  include faceplate support structure , mask straps , and compliant portions including an elastomeric lip .  shows control display module  with control switch  strapped and\/or adhered on the outside component of strap  on the right side of the head;  shows control display module  with control switch  adhered to the outside component of elastomeric lip  and associated compliant structure above the forehead; and  shows display control module  with control switch  strapped and\/or adhered on faceplate support structure , elastomeric lip  and strap  on the right side of the head. Display control module  can be located anywhere within arms reach on FFM  to allow access to operator switch  on display control module .","From display control module  externally mounted on FFM  a power-data cable  is routed to display module  inside FFM  via an accessory interface plate  at the chin area of FFM . Accessory interface plate  has been modified to seal the pass-through by cable  against any differential pressure that might otherwise create leakage between interior  of FFM  and ambient water or air at exterior  outside of FFM . A second stage  of a SCUBA regulator interfaces FFM  at accessory interface plate .","Display control module  can include a waterproof housing , processing and display driving electronics , data storage or memory , internal sensors , electronic interface  to support wireless and hardwire links A, B to remote or external sensors , operator switch , a user replaceable battery  and display interface  to couple power and data to cable . Operator switch  on display control module  can be used to control on\/off of display system , on\/off and brightness of display module , content of display shown on micro-screen  of micro-display\/electronics display , and timing functions of displayed data.","Display control module  can supply display module  with display data from a number of sources as represented by internal sensors , memory , and external sensors . Data in the form of maps, schematics, detailed technical data, etc. can be pre-loaded by the operator and stored in local memory . Data can be provided from internal sensors  that can be used to monitor environmental parameters and status of display system  such as depth, temperature, magnetic field strength (for determining azimuth or compass heading), gas concentrations, battery status, operating time, etc. Data can also be provided from external sensors  used to monitor life support system parameters such as tank pressures of interconnected breathing gases, oxygen \u201cpartial pressure\u201d and data from operator tools (i.e. navigation systems, sonars, thermal imagers, cameras, GPS inputs, etc.). These different data can be connected to display control module  by hardwire and\/or wireless connection using a standard RF transmission electronics. Display control module  processes the data for presentation and selection by the operator by predetermined numbers of displacements, or actuations of push-button control switch  that initiates presentation of the selected data on micro-screen  in display module . The processing capabilities of display processor and driving electronics  of display control module  can also be used to take combinations of memory and\/or inputs from internal and external sensors ,  and calculate the display of other relevant data (i.e. compute diver decompression status from depth and time, or present the position of the operator using an internal map database and GPS inputs).","In light of the teachings disclosed herein, the components of display module  and display control module  of display system  and their interconnection can be fabricated by the exercise of ordinary skill by one having ordinary skill in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 6,447,115 shows a display system made as an integral part of a specifically designed face mask that partially covers a wearer's face. Another specifically made face mask shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,764,203 has a display that blocks-off a considerable frontal area and possibly interferes with a wearer's forward view. These masks, though noteworthy in some respects, are fabricated by procedures that create face mask platforms of two specific designs and do not suggest a procedure for modification of existing face masks with display module  and display control module  of display system  as disclosed herein.","Referring to , the method of displaying data of display system  in an existing FFM  requires internally mounting  display module  on inside  of FFM  in the lower right (or left) corner on faceplate support structure . The internally mounting  includes cutting  of hole B in faceplate support structure  at lower right (or left) corner of FFM  or any other part of FFM  outside of forward viewing area  of faceplate  where display module  is desired to be placed. Inserting  display module  to have threaded stem A of mounting mechanism  extend through cut hole B allows securing  of display module  to faceplate support structure  in FFM  by threaded nut C of mounting mechanism  tightened onto threaded stem A. Optionally, internally mounting  display module  in the lower right (or left) corner of FFM  can be done by adhering  display module  to faceplate support structure  by securely mount a permanent base (not shown) for display module  inside FFM . Display module  can then be mounted to or demounted from this base as required by the operator.","Externally mounting  display control module  on the outside of FFM  is on either of or a combination of outside components of FFM  including faceplate support structure , mask straps , and compliant portions including an elastomeric lip . Routing  cable  conveys data and power from display control module  to display module  inside of FFM  via accessory interface plate . This external mounting  provides for locating  of push-button switch  on externally mounted display control module  for convenient access by the operator.","Securing  FFM  on the head and face by straps  permits positioning  of FFM  on the operator's face like it would be during actual operations and adjusting  alignment of components of display module  for the best view of micro-display  and brightness of micro-display  via operator push-button switch . Actuating  push-button switch  by the operator transmits power and data to display module .","Selectively actuating  push-button switch  by the operator can cause data from different sources to be shown on micro-screen . These sources can include the stored data from internal memory  in display control module , internal data from internal sensors  in display control module  and external data from sensors outside display control module . Glancing  down and slightly to the right inside of FFM  by the operator to see and immediately appraise the information of the displayed data without detracting from observable phenomena through forward viewing area  of faceplate portion .","Having the teachings of this invention in mind, modifications and alternate embodiments of display system  may be adapted without departing from the scope of the invention. Display system  could have different combinations of sensor packages and communication systems as well as other navigational systems. Display system  provides a completely enclosed display module  and low profile external display control module  on FFM  that protect hardware and reduce chances of snagging as compared to contemporary bulky, externally mounted display systems. Display system  has an adjustable optical alignment feature of display module  to accommodate for anthropometrical differences between operators [i.e. variety of face shapes and sizes which affect mask fit, as well as varying interpupillary distances for different operators]. Display system  has a relatively small sized display module  peripherally placed inside  of FFM  to minimally interfere with an operator's field of view, and display control module  can be mounted in a variety of locations outside  of FFM  to best suit the needs of the operator. Display system  of the invention can be retrofitted to current state of the art FFMs or supplied as a kit to upgrade mask capabilities. Separate display control module  allows upgrade\/additions of sensors ,  and other stored data without modifications of display module .","The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein, all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Display system  provides an operator with viewable data in FFM  from multiple sources outside of FFM  and is free of interference with forward viewing to permit unimpeded observation for successful completion of tasks. Therefore, display system , as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting, but rather, is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.","It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
