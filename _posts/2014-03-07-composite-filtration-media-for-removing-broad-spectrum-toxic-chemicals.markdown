title: Composite filtration media for removing broad spectrum toxic chemicals
abstract: A composite filtration media for removing broad spectrum toxic chemicals from streams of air comprised of a physical mixture of a zirconium hydroxide analog material and a basic gas removal material is taught in which the composite filtration media is prepared by blending the zirconium hydroxide analog material in powder form with the basic gas removal material in powder form before pressing into pellets, tablets, briquettes, or the like. Subsequent grinding of the pressed material can be employed to produce a powder form of the composite filtration media. Cross-reaction of the composite components is reduced, thus prolonging the service life of the filtration media. Effectiveness in removing ammonia and sulfur dioxide are demonstrated for various compositions of the composite filtration media in both dry and humid conditions, including after aging for three weeks in humid conditions.

Technical Field","The present invention relates generally to filtration media for removing contaminants from streams of air that pass through the filtration media, and, more particularly, to a filtration media comprised of a zirconium hydroxide analog for removing acid gases and an acidified component for removing basic gases.","2. Description of the Related Art","Air purification is of major concern to the military, first responders, and industrial workers. Applications in the field of air purification are often classified into individual protection and collective protection. An example of individual protection is the filtration incorporated into respirators worn by an individual person. Examples of collective protection include air filtration that is incorporated into the air handling system of a space that may be occupied by more than one person, such as a room, vehicle, or building.","Many of the prior art filters contain activated, impregnated carbons to filter toxic chemicals. These impregnated carbons have limited service life after exposure to the operating environment. That is, the filtration performance in removing toxic gases from air passing through the impregnated carbons deteriorates to a point considered unsuitable such that the filter needs to be replaced. Service life is limited by physical adsorption life and reactive life of the impregnated carbons. Physical adsorption life is reduced by adsorption of air pollutants. Reactive life is typically reduced by temperature and amount of water adsorbed by the carbon bed, adsorption or reaction with air pollutants, and any cross-reaction that may occur between or among the media components.","Prior art materials used for military filters typically contain impregnated carbons with the impregnants used to provide protection against acidic or acid-forming gases. These filters typically lack sufficient removal capabilities against several basic or base-forming gases. The term \u201cbasic\u201d will be used hereinafter to refer to both basic gases and gases that are basic forming. Similarly, the term \u201cacidic\u201d will be used hereinafter to refer to both acidic gases and gases that are acid forming.","Examples of acidic gas contaminants include, but are not limited to, sulfur dioxide (SO), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), chlorine (Cl), hydrogen chloride (HCl) and fuming nitric acid (HNO). Examples of basic gases include, but are not limited to, ammonia (NH) and methylamine (CHNH).","Other prior art filters, such as those developed under standards employed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) for applications requiring Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) protection, contain impregnants for the removal of both acidic and basic gases. These materials provide substantial broad-spectrum removal capabilities, however, they also show aging due to interaction of the impregnants with one another within the carbon pore structure. That is, the reactive life of these filters is reduced not only by the temperature and amount of water adsorbed by the carbon bed due to the operating environment, but also due to a cross-reaction that occurs between or among the impregnants.","Related prior art filter media includes zirconium hydroxide as a component, which may be expressed as Zr(OH). Zirconium hydroxide with the addition of zinc and other metals, along with triethylenediamine (TEDA) has been used to provide removal capabilities against a wide range of toxic acidic and oxidizable gases, such as chlorine, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen cyanide, phosgene, cyanogen chloride, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and the like. One shortcoming of the material, however, is that it provides limited removal of basic forming chemicals such as ammonia, methyl amine, and ethylene oxide.","Other prior art approaches use non-carbon materials for removal of basic gases. This includes use of zirconium hydroxide as a substrate impregnated with sulfuric acid and oxalic acid for ammonia removal. Zeolite H-ZSM-5 also has shown promise as an ammonia and ethylene oxide removal material, and has been demonstrated for military application in the Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM) program.","Other materials showing promise against basic gases are metal-organic frameworks. Specifically, the metal-organic frameworks or MOFs known as CuBTC and M-MOF-74 (where M stands for cobalt, copper, magnesium, nickel, zinc and\/or other metals) have shown substantial removal capabilities. These metal-organic frameworks, however, are not effective at removing acidic gases.","In summary, prior art filtration media generally suffers in applications that require removal performance against a broad spectrum of acidic and basic gases, or the filtration media has a limited service life, or both broad-spectrum removal performance and service life are suboptimal.","Accordingly, there is a need for filtration media capable of removing a broad spectrum of contaminants from streams of air that pass through the filtration media with a satisfactory performance life when exposed to normal environmental conditions of humidity, temperature, and the possibility of cross-reaction within the filtration media.","In view of the foregoing, exemplary embodiments of a composite filtration media for removing broad spectrum toxic chemicals are provided along with test results. The present invention may be embodied in the form of filter media, a filter bed, or a filter component. The media may be in the form of powder, pellets, tablets, briquettes, or the like. The present invention may be used in individual protection applications such as respirators and in collective protection applications. These and other aspects of the present invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following descriptions, while indicating exemplary embodiments and numerous specific details thereof, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments herein without departing from the spirit thereof, and the present invention includes all such modifications.","The present invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. Descriptions of well-known materials and methods, such as powder preparation and mixing, are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments herein. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments herein may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the present invention. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention.","The term \u201ccomposite\u201d as used herein refers to the physical mixing of powdered materials, followed by pressing into a \u201csolid form\u201d such as pellets, tablets, briquettes, or the like. A powder is defined herein as particles less than approximately 100 micrometers in size. If desired for a given product formulation, the pressed pellets, tablets, briquettes, or the like (solid form) can be ground to a smaller size, such as a powder for some applications, or 12\u00d730 or 20\u00d740 mesh sizes, to name two examples, in other applications. Those with ordinary skill in the art to which the invention pertains will readily understand the processes of physical mixing of powdered materials, pressing, grinding, and mesh sizes used in filtration.","The advantage to physically mixing different materials in powder form followed by pressing, as opposed to impregnating materials with all moieties capable of removing acidic and basic gases, is that the impregnants are not in direct contact with one another, but are segregated onto different substrates. This segregation serves to minimize interactions between the dissimilar functional groups. By physically separating the different materials, albeit on a micro scale, service life can be improved.","In a first example of the invention as taught herein, zinc-zirconium hydroxide-TEDA (ZZT) and zirconium hydroxide impregnated with 10% sulfuric acid (SZ) was made into a composite by physically mixing the different materials in powder form followed by pressing. Three different composite configurations were investigated for ammonia and sulfur dioxide removal along with 100% ZZT as a baseline. The three compositions were 85% ZZT with 15% SZ; 75% ZZT with 25% SZ; and 50% ZZT with 50% SZ. (All composition percentages noted herein are based on weight.)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIGS. 1 and 2"},"As illustrated in this example, a composition of ZZT and SZ can be designed to effectively remove basic gases, as represented by the ammonia in these breakthrough tests, and to effectively remove acidic gases, as represented by the sulfur dioxide in these breakthrough tests. This is accomplished by adjusting the ratio of ZZT to SZ such that both basic and acidic gases are removed at the desired performance level. That is, as taught herein, a person with ordinary skill in the art is thus enabled to tune or adjust performance towards acidic gases or towards basic gases by changing the weight percentage of the composition.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Comparison of sulfur dioxide (SO) and ammonia (NH) break-"},{"entry":"through times for ZZT baseline and three compositions of ZZT and SZ."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"SOBreakthrough","NHBreakthrough"]},{"entry":["Sample","Time","Time"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["100% ZZT Baseline","106 ","min","17.0 min"]},{"entry":["85% ZZT with 15% SZ","96.5 ","min","21.5 min"]},{"entry":["75% ZZT with 25% SZ","88.0 ","min","28.0 min"]},{"entry":["50% ZZT with 50% SZ","62.5 ","min","42.5 min"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Additional toxic chemicals, such as hydrogen cyanide and cyanogen chloride, also were evaluated with similar results. That is, a similar trade-off occurred with 100% ZZT performing the best at removing hydrogen cyanide and cyanogen chloride, and such removal performance decreasing with increasing SZ content, but in a manner that allows for performance tuning towards the removal of acidic gases or towards the removal of basic gases by changing the weight percentage of the composition.","In a second example, composites were prepared from ZZT and zirconium hydroxide impregnated with 25% oxalic acid as well as ZZT and 25% H-ZSM-5. Also tested was a composition of 75% ZZT\/25% SZ sample. The composite filtration media were exposed to prolonged periods (24 hours) of moisture (80% relative humidity), followed by ammonia and sulfur dioxide breakthrough testing. Tables 2 and 3 summarize the results, which show good stability after moisture exposure. In particular, no significant degradation with humidity occurred and the three composite filtration media performed slightly better under most of the humid conditions tested. The one exception was 75% ZZT with 25% H-ZSM-5, which had a slightly shorter breakthrough time for sulfur dioxide under humid conditions, however, the 1-minute difference is not considered significant.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE
