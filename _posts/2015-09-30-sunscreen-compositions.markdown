{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED CASES","FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","EXAMPLES","Example 1","Example 2","Example 3","Example 4","Example 5"],"p":["This application is a continuation of, and claims priority to, U.S. Nonprovisional patent application Ser. No. 14\/260,775, filed on Mar. 24, 2014. The entirety of the aforementioned application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The invention relates generally to compositions and methods for protecting human integuments against damage from ultraviolet (UV) rays. More specifically, the invention relates to the use of a composition that boosts the sun protection factor (SPF) of an organic sunscreen.","It is now generally recognized that exposure to solar radiation can have adverse health consequences, sometimes not appearing until several years following exposure. Of course, the immediately appearing sunburn from an overexposure is painful and can itself be a serious acute health problem.","Products are available to reduce the amount of solar UV radiation received by the skin during exposure to the sun's rays. Typical product formulations are lotions, sprays, creams, ointments, or gels containing chemical and\/or physical barriers to ultraviolet transmission. These vary considerably in their abilities to protect the skin against the physical and biochemical effects of UV radiation.","Earlier sunscreen formulations were designed to protect against sunburn from a limited solar exposure period, while transmitting sufficient radiation to permit skin tanning. However, the current focus is on eliminating as much UV exposure as possible, it being recognized that skin tanning is an indication of tissue damage from overexposure to solar radiation. It is believed that any amount of unprotected exposure can lead to future health problems, such as skin carcinomas and other dermatological disorders. Sunscreens and UV filters are important components of skin care products generally to prevent the harmful rays of the sun from exacerbating or accelerating the aging process. These actives are typically present in an amount to provide a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) value of from 2 to about 50 or higher.","Many organic sunscreens are known in the art. Some examples include PABA, ethylhexyl-methoxycinnamate, homomethyl salicylate, octyl salicylate, and butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone), and the like. Not only are these ingredients costly, but many sunscreen products have undesirable aesthetic attributes which may limit their use.","It is therefore an object of the invention to provide compositions for boosting the SPF of an organic sunscreen. It is a further object of the invention to provide compositions that impart protection against UV rays while providing desirable aesthetics on the skin.","The foregoing discussion is presented solely to provide a better understanding of nature of the problems confronting the art and should not be construed in any way as an admission as to prior art nor should the citation of any reference herein be construed as an admission that such reference constitutes \u201cprior art\u201d to the instant application.","In accordance with the foregoing objectives and others, it has surprisingly been found that compositions comprising an organic sunscreen in combination with (i) nylon particles (e.g., porous nylon-6 particles treated with hydrogen dimethicone or non-porous nylon-12 particles), (ii) silica particles (e.g., spherical silica particles), and (iii) barium sulfate particles can provide an improvement in SPF as compared to an otherwise identical composition lacking any one of the three ingredients (i)-(iii). In some embodiments, the improvement is synergistic by which is meant that the improvement in SPF is more than additive of the improvement in SPF seen when components (i)-(iii) are employed individually. In some embodiments, the SPF of the composition is at least about 10% greater, at least about 20% greater, at least about 30% greater, at least about 40% greater, or at least 50% greater or more than the SPF of an otherwise identical composition lacking any one of components (i)-(iii).","The compositions of the invention typically comprises an organic sunscreen. In one embodiment, the composition may comprise ethylhexyl-methoxycinnamate (OMC), homosalate, octyl salicylate, Avobenzone, or any combination thereof. The amount of organic sunscreen may be, collectively or individually, from about 0.5% to about 50%, more typically from about 1% to about 20%, and more typically still from about 2.5% to about 15% by weight of the total composition. The composition may comprise nylon particles (e.g., porous nylon-6) in an amount from about 0.5% to about 20%, typically from about 1% to about 10%, or from about 2% to about 10%, or about 5% by weight of the total composition. The composition may comprise silica particles (e.g., spherical silica) in an amount from about 0.5% to about 20%, typically from about 1% to about 10%, or from about 1% to about 5%, or about 2.5% by weight of the total composition. The composition may comprise barium sulfate particles in an amount from about 0.5% to about 20%, typically from about 1% to about 10%, or from about 2% to about 10%, or about 5% by weight of the total composition. The weight ratio of nylon to silica to barium sulfate may be, for example, from about 5 to about 15 parts of nylon to from about 1 to about 10 parts of silica to from about 5 to about 15 parts of barium sulfate. In one embodiment, the weight ratio of nylon to silica to barium sulfate may be about 2:1:2. The composition may optionally comprise one or more colorants (e.g., pigments, lakes, dyes, etc.) In one embodiment the composition comprises iron oxide pigments (e.g., in an amount from about 0.1 to about 10% by weight). In another embodiment the composition comprises silica-coated iron oxide pigment particles (e.g., in an amount from about 0.1 to about 10% by weight). Also provided are methods for protecting a human integument against UV damage comprising applying a composition of the present invention to the human integument, including a keratinous surface such as skin or hair.","The compositions according to the invention advantageously provide high diffuse transmittance which contributes to a more natural appearance on the skin and also serves to blur fine lines and blemishes, contributing to an overall improvement in the appearance of human skin.","These and other aspects of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art after a reading of the following detailed description of the invention, including the appended claims.","All amounts provided in terms of weight percentage are relative to the entire composition (i.e., including solvent or vehicle) unless otherwise stated. It will be understood that the total of all weight percentages in a given composition will not exceed 100%.","The term \u201ckeratinous surface\u201d includes skin, hair, lashes, and nails. The term \u201cskin\u201d is intended to include skin of the face, neck, chest, arms, hands, lips, etc.","The term \u201cconsisting essentially of\u201d is intended to include only those components that do not materially alter the basic and novel features of the inventive compositions, including without limitation, the SPF and\/or diffuse transmittance\/soft focus of the cosmetic.","The compositions of the invention comprise a combination of particulates comprising polymeric particles (e.g., a polyamide such as porous nylon particles), silica particles (e.g., spherical silica particles), and barium sulfate particles (e.g., synthetic barium sulfate particles). The compositions further comprise an organic sunscreen (e.g., octyl methoxycinnamate, etc.).","One component of the present invention is a polymeric powder or particulate.
