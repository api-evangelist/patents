title: Data mining and reporting
abstract: An integrated system is described that allows a user to easily mine and report data maintained by a customer relationship management (CRM) application. In general, the system automates the process of creating electronic reports, such as an electronic worksheet, in a format that can be directly manipulated and viewed from spreadsheet application. In one embodiment, the report is automatically generated to include a pivot table for displaying the data. The system includes a database adapted to store the CRM data. First and second reporting modules execute within the CRM software application and the worksheet software application, respectively. The reporting modules cooperate in order to integrate CRM application and spreadsheet application, thereby automating the process of generating a worksheet based on the CRM database.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/738,639, filed on Dec. 15, 2000, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional patent application Ser. No. 60\/175,025, filed Jan. 27, 2000, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","Conventional Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software applications are used to manage all aspects of customer relations by integrating a company's sales force, processes, sales channels and customers into one environment. For example, FrontRange Solutions\u2122 of Colorado Springs, Colo., offers Goldmine\u2122, which is a suite of software applications for managing sales, marketing, service and support. Most CRM applications typically include a report generation module for viewing the customer information (CRM data) using a variety of predefined or custom reports. In addition, the applications may allow the user to export the CRM data to a spreadsheet software application for more detailed analysis. For example, a user may use Microsoft Excel provided by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. to manipulate and view the CRM data. Typically the CRM data is exported in a tab-delimited format that can be imported by the spreadsheet software application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["2","2","12","6"]},"CRM application  represents any conventional CRM environment that integrates customer-related business functions such as sales, marketing, service and support. CRM application  stores CRM data, such as sales and marketing information, within CRM database . In one configuration CRM database  is a relational database in which the data is organized according to a number of tables and relationships. Example of such databases include SQL Server\u2122 and Microsoft Access\u2122 provided by Microsoft Corporation, Oracle\u2122 provided by Oracle\u2122 Corporation of Redwood Shores, Calif., and dBase IV.","Spreadsheet application  represents any conventional spreadsheet data analysis software application such as Microsoft Excel provided by Microsoft Corporation, Quattro\u2122 Pro of Corel and Lotus 1-2-3\u2122 of Lotus Development Corporation. Using spreadsheet application , a user can view electronic worksheet , which may be one of a number of worksheets organized as a workbook.","Reporting modules  cooperate in order to integrate CRM application  and spreadsheet application , thereby automating the process of generating worksheet  based on CRM database . In particular, reporting modules  automatically generate multi-dimensional analysis table  within electronic worksheet  according to the CRM data within CRM database . Multi-dimensional analysis table  represents an analytical function, commonly referred to as a pivot table or as a \u201ccross-tab\u201d, supported by a variety of spreadsheet environments for displaying large amounts of data. Table  allows the user to quickly and easily summarizes or view large amounts of CRM data. For example, the user can rotate the rows and columns of table  to see different summaries of the CRM data, filter the data by displaying different pages, or display the details for area of interest.","As discussed in detail below, CRM reporting module A is \u201cinstalled\u201d within CRM application  and, when invoked by the user, examines the schema and data structures of CRM database , as well as customized settings like local field names within CRM application . Reporting module A then interacts with reporting module B installed within spreadsheet application  and reporting module C of worksheet  to create table  within worksheet . In this manner, the user can create a comprehensive multi-dimensional analysis table  by only entering a few parameters, thereby significantly reducing the skill normally required to generate multi-dimensional analysis tables. The process takes CRM data structures, both native and customized, into account to give the user simple yet powerful access to their CRM data in a context they can understand (i.e., using field names that they have set for their particular business). Reporting modules A and B may be executable files invoked by CRM application  or spreadsheet application  or, for example, may be \u201cplug-in\u201d modules executed by the respective applications.","System  includes one or more report toolkits  that include pre-defined report parameters  and one or more worksheet templates . Worksheet template  includes reporting component C for formatting table  once created, as described below.","CRM reporting module A may use an interprocess communication mechanism, or other suitable method, to communicate the parameters to worksheet application  and to invoke report modules B and C for formatting worksheet . For example, in one configuration reporting modules B and C are Visual Basic Application scripts that are directly callable by reporting component A. In this configuration reporting component A can comprise an executable program written in the Visual Basic language. Alternatively, other suitable means include Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), or Component Object Model (COM), which are interprocess communication mechanisms supported by various operating systems and allow applications to share data.","The availability of table , and its supported functions, vastly improves the user's ability to analyze the CRM data stored within CRM database . After table  is generated, the user can interact with spreadsheet application  to manipulate table  in order to analyze the captured CRM data and \u201cmine\u201d the data for important insights. Furthermore, after viewing the CRM data within the format of table , the user can select any amount of the CRM data and automatically invoke CRM application  to view the corresponding transactional records, such as a record of a sales call.","CRM application  and spreadsheet application  execute simultaneously on a computer having an operating system (e.g., the Windows\u00ae operating system from Microsoft Corporation), processor and random access memory (RAM).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["2","20","4","12","14","6","4"]},"First, the user interacts with CRM application  and requests the generation of electronic worksheet  and table  (). In response to the request, CRM application  invokes CRM reporting module A for interacting with the user to capture a number of report generation parameters and reporting module B loaded within spreadsheet application  ().","Next, as described in detail below, reporting module A constructs table  within worksheet , conforming to the format of spreadsheet application  and according to user-entered parameters combined with pre-defined report parameters  in toolkit  (). In particular, reporting module A uses captured user parameters to specify toolkit , and within toolkit , to specify predefined report parameters  and worksheet template . Reporting module A then invokes spreadsheet application  and directs it to create worksheet  as a copy of worksheet template , containing worksheet reporting module C. Reporting module A then generates table  within worksheet  according to report parameters  and the captured user parameters.","After generating table , reporting module A invokes and cooperates with reporting modules B and C to format and organize table  (). For example, reporting module A invokes and communicates the parameters to B and C for further formatting and organization of table . In one configuration, additional formatting procedures in reporting module C are invoked by spreadsheet application  the first time worksheet  is accessed.","After reporting module B generates electronic worksheet , spreadsheet application  displays the CRM data as table  that can easily be manipulated by the user (). In addition, worksheet  may contain a number of scripts that, in conjunction with reporting module B, enhance the functionality associated with table .","During the report generating process, reporting module A may display a screen that alerts the user to the steps in creating the report including, among others:","1, \u201cLoading templates . . . \u201d,","2. \u201cConstructing query . . . \u201d,","3. \u201cBuilding pivot tables . . . ,\u201d","4, \u201cAdding field labels and colors . . . ,\u201d","5, \u201cSetting CRM Item Aliases . . . ,\u201d","6. \u201cSetting User-defined Field Names . . . \u201d and","7. \u201cLoading Spreadsheet Report . . . \u201d","After analyzing the data within table , the user can select one or more entries within table  and request to view the underlying CRM data. The user may specify certain records within the underlying data thus displayed for further analysis. In response reporting module B interacts with CRM application  to display the corresponding CRM records within CRM application  (). In this manner, system  provides an integrated environment that automates the process of creating electronic reports and viewing the corresponding CRM records.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["4","30","6","12","14"]},"Upon receiving a request to generate an electronic worksheet in pivot table format, CRM application  invokes reporting module A for capturing a number of parameters from the user. Initially, the user selects one of a number of report sets that includes a number of predefined reports. For example, report sets may include a database manager's toolkit, a salesperson's toolkit, a sales manager toolkit and a CFO toolkit (). Upon selecting a toolkit, the user selects one of a number of predefined reports within the toolkit (). Based on the selected report, recording module BA analyzes the CRM database  and, based on the schema for database , identifies a number of tables and corresponding fields for inclusion in table .","Reporting module A presents the identified fields to the user () and allows the user to include or exclude individual fields from the report (). In addition, reporting module A allows the user to specify a level of detail such as, for example, level 1 to level 3, indicating the amount and type of data fields that he or she wishes to include in the report, taking hardware and speed limitations into account.","Upon receiving the field selections from a user (), reporting module A generates a suitable database query string for capturing the appropriate CRM data from CRM database  (). Reporting module A then presents the database query string to the user and allows the user to modify the query string as appropriate ().","In one configuration reporting module A allows the user to set a number of preferences and parameters to control the process of report and field selection. For example, the user may enable or disable a number of toolkits, elect to default to an expert mode for access to advance report definition functions, specify a default start date for the inclusion of historical data and specify a default path to store the resulting electronic reports.","After capturing the parameters from the user, as described above, reporting module A directs spreadsheet application  () to access and copy stored worksheet template  in toolkit  according to the particular report specified by the user, thus creating worksheet  in the newly created workbook ().","Reporting module A then creates table  within worksheet  by calling a function supported by spreadsheet application , which accesses CRM database  according to the received database query string ().
