abstract: Disclosed in a novel scheme to jointly reduce and trade-off Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and a Block Error Rate (BLER) using random network coding. To do this, the different representations of the input information block are generated using a special form of network coding matrices. Further, the encoded block puncturing is utilized to improve in the PAPR against a degradation in the BLER.

A multicarrier modulation, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), is a well-known modulation scheme that has proven its efficiency in reliable data communications. Like any other technique, the OFDM encounters some challenges, one of which is its high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). The High PAPR requires a large power back-off in the transmitting amplifier, which translates to low power efficiency. Another metric quantifying the same problem is a cubic metric (CM), which provides a better prediction of the power capability than the PAPR. The use of the CM, as an evaluation metric, is proposed and adopted in the 3GPP standards. The lower the value of the CM provides more efficient the power amplifier performance. Therefore, a reducing the PAPR or the CM is a critical issue in portable wireless devices.","Another important challenge in wireless networks is to reduce a transmission error rate to effectively maximize the achievable throughput, even when unpredictable and time-varying block errors exist.","In a conventional art, large spectrum of techniques and algorithms have been developed to reduce PAPR and BLER separately. In current OFDM based networks, the source blocks are generally passed through BLER reduction algorithms, then the resulting streams are applied to PAPR reduction methods. However, improved works still be needed for simultaneously reducing both the PAPR and the BLER.","Therefore, in order to simultaneously reduce both the PAPR and the BLER, this disclosure may propose an improved scheme that different representations of the input information block are generated using a special form of network coding matrices. Further, this disclosure may further propose an additional step to trade off a further improvement in PAPR against a degradation in BLER using encoded block puncturing.","To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, there is provided a method of transmitting data in wireless communication system, the method comprising: dividing an input bit stream into segments; adding error detection code into each segments of the divided input bit stream in order to generate a packet; dividing the generated packet into a plurality of blocks with fixed size; coding each of the plurality of block using a coefficient matrix in order to generate coded block bits, and transmitting the coded block bits.","To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, there is also provided A method of transmitting data in wireless communication system, the method comprising: dividing an input bit stream into segments; adding error detection code into each segments of the divided input bit stream in order to generate a packet; dividing the generated packet into a plurality of blocks with fixed size; coding the plurality of blocks using a random network coding in order to generate a plurality of coded blocks; puncturing at least one coded block among the plurality of coded blocks; and transmitting the plurality of coded blocks, wherein the at least one punctured coded block is mapped to at least one multi-carrier.","The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","One aspect of this disclosure relates to the recognition by the present inventors about the problems of the related art as described above, and further explained hereafter. Based upon this recognition, the features of this disclosure have been developed.","Although this disclosure is shown to be implemented in a specific mobile communication system, this disclosure may also be applied to other communication systems operating in conformity with different standards and specifications.","Hereinafter, description of structures and operations of the preferred embodiments according to the present invention will be given with reference to the accompanying drawings.","As described above, different PAPR reduction approaches had been studied, such as distortion techniques (e.g., a clipping, a companding) and distortionless techniques (e.g., a systematic coding, selective coding, partial transmit sequence, tone injection\/reservation, active constellation extension). Among others, the distortionless technique called selective mapping (SLM) has attracted much attention because of its effectiveness, strong PAPR reduction capabilities and low implementation complexities.","Also, forward error correction (FEC) techniques are employed as a solution for this problem to achieve reliable communications in wireless networks. In the physical layer, various FEC codes, such as convolutional codes, and turbo codes, can be employed. In current technology and its standards, data streams are divided into source blocks and each of these blocks is passed to an FEC processor to generate coded blocks that are more immune to channel errors. Thus, these coded blocks endure lower Block Error Rates (BLER) when transmitted over channels with unpredictable errors.","In another approach, a network coding has been originally proposed in information theory with the objective of maximizing network information flow, and has since emerged as one of the most promising information theoretic approaches for throughput improvement. The MAC layer Random Network Coding (MRNC) has been introduced to avoid the overhead problems incurred by a Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARM). In the MRNC, the some packets of a given data frame are linearly combined with random non-zero coefficients, and the resulting coded packets are transmitted. Conditions for the minimum packet error rate in wireless channels may be derived when network coding is employed for error resilience. There is a protocol for co-operative packet recovery using symbol-level random network coding, which performs opportunistic routing on groups of correctly received symbols in a packet.","Although a network coding (NC) has been extensively studied, and its capability on multicarrier system is anticipated, the idea of employing it for joint PAPR\/CM and BLER reduction has not yet been proposed. Consequently, this disclosure proposes a new scheme that employs NC to jointly reduce the PAPR\/CM and BLER in multicarrier systems. This disclosure may consist of generating different sets of N coded blocks from a set of K source blocks (K<N) using a special form of network coding matrices, thereby achieving the minimum BLER. After symbol mapping and inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) of all these different sets, the signal with the lowest PAPR\/CM may be selected. In other words, this disclosure may be viewed as a network coded. SLM (NC-SLM) scheme that employs specific network coding matrices, .instead of phase rotations, to generate different representations of the OFDM symbol, while minimizing the BLER. Consequently, this disclosure may be expected to achieve similar PAPR\/CM as the C-SLM, while achieving the optimal BLER. Also, the new scheme of the present disclosure is a more general and practically implementable version of previous work, where a joint reduction of PAPR and symbol loss rate was proposed in multicarrier system. In contrast to the physical modulation symbol-level NC, this disclosure proposes to use block-level network coding (NC) operation in order to overcome some limitations incurred by rigid structure using modulation symbol level operation. In this disclosure, a \u201cblock\u201d is referred as a group of bits that are much larger and independent of the modulation-level symbols employed in the physical layer.","As aforementioned, in order to further reduce the PAPR or the CM, this disclosure proposes an additional step that exploits the addition of redundant coded blocks by NC to puncture some of them. This additional step may consist of finding and puncturing the coded blocks that will result in the maximum PAPR\/CM reduction. This step may be referred as the block puncturing step. The execution of this step may achieve a better PAPR\/CM reduction, compared to C-SLM, at the cost of BLER performance degradation. Consequently, this step can be optionally used to further reduce the PAPR\/CM when the first step fails in achieving the target PAPR\/CM value.","A detailed description of the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) will be given as following.","Let s=[s, s, . . . , s] be a modulated data sequence of length F during the time interval [0, T], where s, is a symbol from a signal constellation, F is the number of OFDM data subcarriers and T is the OFDM symbol duration.

The C-SLM then may select to transmit the version that achieves the lowest PAPR among these U PAPRs.","A detailed description of the Symbol-Level vs Block-Level Network Coding will be given as following.","The Symbol-level NC is performed over symbols at the physical layer. In the present disclosure, the term \u201csymbol\u201d is used to describe the unit of data that is defined by the modulation scheme in the physical layer. For example, one symbol represents two bits if Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) is used, and four bits if 16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) is used. In some operation, symbol-level NC was performed on modulation symbols. In such operation, the size of the NC block is selected to be the same as the number of bits represented by the employed modulation level. Therefore, the coding operations are done using a finite field with dimension related to the employed modulation level. For example, in case of 16-QAM, Galois Field (GF(24)) is used for the encoding\/decoding operation and 4 bit block size is selected for efficient and simple finite field operation. One coded block, which represents one modulation symbol, is mapped to one subcarrier.","In the present disclosure, it is proposed to employ block-level NC operations instead of modulation symbol based operations. This may provide more flexibility and adaptability, while still taking the full benefits of modulation symbol based NC. The main advantages of block-level NC over symbol-level NC may be described as following:","Flexibility: Block and finite field sizes can be flexibly changed, since block partitioning can be performed irrespective of modulation. In symbol-level NC, when the modulation scheme is changed due to varying channel conditions, the block and finite field sizes should be changed which result in performance degradation because blocks encoded with different finite fields cannot be decoded.","Adaptability: Since the operating finite field and block size selection do not depend on a given modulation scheme, they can be adaptively selected with taking varying channel conditions into account.","A detailed description of a new scheme to jointly reduce PAPR\/CM and BLER according the present disclosure will be given as following.","The core of this new scheme may consist of a network coded SLM (NC-SLM) approach (instead of C-SLM), in which different NC matrices are used to generate different representations of the OFDM symbol. The employed coding matrices are designed so as to minimize the BLER. For further PAPR\/CM reduction, the present disclosure may introduce a block puncturing step, which reduces PAPR\/CM at the expense of some BLER performance degradation.  and  show an exemplary transmitting\/receiving side block diagram of an improved PAPR reduction scheme using block-level RNC according to a present invention.","A detailed description of a network coded block generation according to the present disclosure will be given as following.","At the physical layer, the transmitter divides the input bit stream into blocks with fixed size, each of which contains a certain number of physical layer symbols. Let .K be the number of blocks that can be transmitted over one OFDM symbol after block encoding, and u(i=1, 2, . . . ,K) as the i-th block in the OFDM symbol. Let u=[u, u, . . . , u] be the vector of original blocks in a single OFDM symbol.","After block partitioning, the original block vector  is passed to network coding units, each encoding the K blocks of  into N coded blocks (N>K). Let A=[a(i \u03b5 {1, . . . ,K }, j \u03b5 {1, . . . ,N}, m \u03b5 {1, . . . , U}) be the coding matrix of the m-th unit. The elements of Aare chosen from a Galois field (GF), whose size is determined by the number of bits per block (e.g. for a block of 8 bits, GF(2) should be used). Each coded block y, j \u03b5 {1, . . . ,N} can then be generated as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00005","num":"00005"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["y","j"],"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"m"}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"K"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["u","i"]},"mo":"\u2062","msubsup":{"mi":["a","ij"],"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"m"}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"7"}}]}}}}},"In other words, each coded block is a linear combination of a subset or all of the original data blocks. Consequently, the 1\u00d7K vector of original blocks is encoded into a 1\u00d7N vector of coded blocks in the m-th coding unit as:\n\n\u2003\u2003(8)\n","The code rate (r) of this process is r=K\/N. Any K of these coded blocks can be used at the receiver to decode the original K blocks by inverting the sub-matrix of coding coefficients corresponding to these K blocks.","Each generated coded block can be mapped to one or several modulation symbols. The required number of symbols for one coded block depends on the size of the coded block and the selected modulation scheme. For example, a coded block with a block size of 8 bits is mapped to four symbols for QPSK and two symbols for 16QAM. In the present disclosure, it is assumed that the number N of coded blocks and their size should be determined so that they are loaded on the subcarriers of one OFDM symbol using the employed modulation level. For example, assuming a code rate of \u00bd, 16-QAM, a block size of 8 bits, and 64 data subcarriers, the numbers of original and coded blocks should be set to N=32 and K=16, respectively. Thus, a 128-bit data segment is required to generate each original block vector.","In order to reduce the overhead of communicating coding coefficients between the transmitter and the receiver for each coded block, the coding coefficient matrices can be pre-generated and kept at the transmitter and the receiver. These pre-generated coding matrices should have the ability to minimize the BLER.","A detailed description of a coefficient Matrix generation according to the present disclosure will be given as following.","In order to design matrices that minimize the BLER, the following characteristic matrix is adapted:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00006","num":"00006"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"C","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"\ud835\udcb3","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"A"}},{"mo":"{","mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["c","ij"]},"mo":"=","mn":"1"}},{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"if","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["a","ij"]}},"mo":"\u2260","mn":"0"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["c","ij"]},"mo":"=","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"if","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["a","ij"]}},"mo":"=","mn":"0"}}]}]}}],"mo":":"}}}}},"where aand care the corresponding entries of matrices A and C, respectively.

The output of these U units is U different vectors of coded blocks, [, , . . . , ], each of size N blocks, from the original K blocks of . Each coded block vector is mapped to a modulation symbol vector =[ss, . . . , s], 1\u2266m\u2266U. The length of each symbol sis Q=log(M), where M is the employed modulation level. After IFFT of these U candidate symbol streams into U candidate transmit signals x(1\u2266m\u2266U), the transmitter selects the signal x* with the lowest PAPR or CM, for transmission or forwarding to the block puncturing step of the proposed scheme of the present disclosure.","The U different coding matrices, employed in the above process, may be pre-set and pre-stored in both the transmitter and the receiver. Consequently, the transmitter does not need to transmit the index of the selected coding matrix. Instead, the receiver tries to decode the received signal, after FFT and symbol de-mapping, using the pre-stored U different matrices. After decoding the incoming bit sequence using these pre-stored U different matrices, the Cyclic Redundancy Check's (CRC's) of the decoded frames are examined and the frame that passes the CRC check is selected as the correctly received frame. If none of the decoded frames using U different matrices passes the CRC check, then the frame is discarded at the physical layer without delivering it to upper layers because this frame has errors. A similar strategy may be employed for HARQ in various air interface standards including IEEE 802.16 WiMAX and 3GPP LTE.","The NC-SLM scheme may use U different coefficient matrices to generate symbol sequences, whereas the C-SLM may use U different phase sequences to generate symbol sequences. In order to compare complexity between the NC-SLM and the C-SLM, the differences between the two schemes should be investigated. The major difference is where multiplication operation takes place. For the NC-SLM, multiplication operations are done at the bit level before symbol mapping. However, the multiplication operations in the C-SLM takes place at symbol level after symbol mapping. Therefore, the complexity of the proposed NC-SLM scheme is the same as or less than the C-SLM.","The following is a context for the network coded selective mapping algorithm.

The block puncturing is equivalent to not loading the corresponding tones. For example, if the block size is 8 bits, and the first block is selected for puncturing in a 16QAM-64 OFDM system, the first two tones conveying the first block (two 16QAM symbols) are not loaded with the symbols corresponding to this block.","The block puncturing is possible due to the design of proposed NC-SLM scheme in the present disclosure. From the equation (7), each transmitted block is a linear combination of the original blocks, and any combination of K transmitted blocks can re-construct the original blocks.

The proposed scheme is able to work with both PAPR and CM. The proposed algorithm both satisfies the conditions required for achieving minimum BLER and reducing PAPR\/CM simultaneously. By utilizing a favorable randomization property of network coding, the proposed NC-SLM algorithm has been introduced. Moreover, it is proposed that an NC block puncturing step on top of the proposed NC-SLM scheme for further PAPR\/CM reduction.","As described above, simulation results confirmed that the NC-SLM scheme already achieves the same PAPR reduction performance as the C-SLM. Adding the NC block puncturing step to the NC-SLM scheme makes it outperform the C-SLM PAPR reduction scheme. The effect of block puncturing on the block error rates is also described. The Simulations also show that substantial PAPR\/CM reduction gains can be achieved with puncturing few blocks (as few as one block). Moreover, the present disclosure may provide a suggestion of the use of the NC block puncturing as a supplementary step, if the desired PAPR\/CM is not achieved by the NC-SLM.
