Stephen G. Kunin, Benefit of Prior-Filed Application, USPTO Official Gazette Mar. 18, 2003, available at http:\/\/www.uspto.gov\/web\/offices\/com\/sol\/og\/2003\/week11\/patbene.htm.

In addition to the foregoing, other computer program product aspects are described in the claims, drawings, and text forming a part of the present disclosure.","The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. In addition to the illustrative aspects, embodiments, and features described above, further aspects, embodiments, and features will become apparent by reference to the drawings and the following detailed description.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.","A recent trend that is becoming increasingly popular in the computing\/communication field is to electronically record one's feelings, thoughts, and other aspects of the person's everyday life onto an open diary. One place where such open diaries are maintained are at social networking sites commonly known as \u201cblogs\u201d where users may report or post their latest status, personal activities, and various other aspects of the users' everyday life. The process of reporting or posting blog entries is commonly referred to as blogging. Other social networking sites may allow users to update their personal information via, for example, social networking status reports in which a user may report or post for others to view their current status, activities, and\/or other aspects of the user.","A more recent development in social networking is the introduction and explosive growth of microblogs in which individuals or users (referred to as \u201cmicrobloggers\u201d) maintain open diaries at microblog websites (e.g., otherwise known as \u201ctwitters\u201d) by continuously or semi-continuously posting microblog entries. A microblog entry (e.g., \u201ctweet\u201d) is typically a short text message that is usually not more than 140 characters long. The microblog entries posted by a microblogger may report on any aspect of the microblogger's daily life. Typically, such microblog entries will describe the various \u201cevents\u201d associated with or are of interest to the microblogger that occurs during a course of a typical day. The microblog entries are often continuously posted during the course of a typical day, and thus, by the end of a normal day, a substantial number of events may have been reported and posted.","Each of the reported events that may be posted through microblog entries may be categorized into one of at least three possible categories. The first category of events that may be reported through microblog entries are \u201cobjective occurrences\u201d that may or may not be associated with the microblogger. Objective occurrences that are associated with a microblogger may be any characteristic, incident, happening, or any other event that occurs with respect to the microblogger or are of interest to the microblogger that can be objectively reported by the microblogger, a third party, or by a device. Such events would include, for example, intake of food, medicine, or nutraceutical, certain physical characteristics of the microblogger or by others such as blood sugar level or blood pressure that can be objectively measured, activities of the microblogger objectively observable by the microblogger, by others, or by a device, activities of others that may be objectively observed by the microblogger, by others, or by a device, external events such as performance of the stock market (which the microblogger may have an interest in), performance of a favorite sports team, and so forth.","In some cases, objective occurrences may not be at least directly associated with a microblogger. Examples of such objective occurrences include, for example, external events such as the local weather, activities of others (e.g., spouse or boss), the behavior or activities of a pet or livestock, the characteristics or performances of mechanical or electronic devices such as automobiles, appliances, and computing devices, and other events that may directly or indirectly affect the microblogger.","A second category of events that may be reported or posted through microblog entries include \u201csubjective user states\u201d of the microblogger. Subjective user states of a microblogger may include any subjective state or status associated with the microblogger that can only be typically reported by the microblogger (e.g., generally cannot be directly reported by a third party or by a device). Such states including, for example, the subjective mental state of the microblogger (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, tension, state of alertness, state of mental fatigue, jealousy, envy, and so forth), the subjective physical state of the microblogger (e.g., upset stomach, state of vision, state of hearing, pain, and so forth), and the subjective overall state of the microblogger (e.g., \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cbad,\u201d state of overall wellness, overall fatigue, and so forth). Note that the term \u201csubjective overall state\u201d as will be used herein refers to those subjective states that may not fit neatly into the other two categories of subjective user states described above (e.g., subjective mental states and subjective physical states).","A third category of events that may be reported or posted through microblog entries include \u201csubjective observations\u201d made by the microblogger. A subjective observation is similar to subjective user states and may be any subjective opinion, thought, or evaluation relating to any external incidence (e.g., outward looking instead of inward looking as in the case of subjective user states). Thus, the difference between subjective user states and subjective observations is that subjective user states relates to self-described subjective descriptions of the user states of one's self while subjective observations relates to subjective descriptions or opinions regarding external events. Examples of subjective observations include, for example, a microblogger's perception about the subjective user state of another person (e.g., \u201che seems tired\u201d), a microblogger's perception about another person's activities (e.g., \u201che drank too much yesterday\u201d), a microblogger's perception about an external event (e.g., \u201cit was a nice day today\u201d), and so forth. Although microblogs are being used to provide a wealth of personal information, thus far they have been primarily limited to their use as a means for providing commentaries and for maintaining open diaries.","Another potential source for valuable but not yet fully exploited data is the data provided by sensing devices that are used to sense and\/or monitor various aspects of everyday life. Currently there are a number of sensing devices that can detect and\/or monitor various user related and nonuser related events. For example, there are presently a number of sensing devices that can sense various physical or physiological characteristics of a person or an animal (e.g., a pet or a livestock). Examples of such devices include commonly known and used monitoring devices such as blood pressure devices, heart rate monitors, blood glucose sensors (e.g., glucometers), respiration sensor devices, temperature sensors, and so forth. Other examples of devices that can monitor physical or physiological characteristics include more exotic and sophisticated devices such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) device, functional Near Infrared (fNIR) devices, blood cell-sorting sensing device, and so forth. Many of these devices are becoming more compact and less expensive such that they are becoming increasingly accessible for purchase and\/or self-use by the general public.","Other sensing devices may be used in order to sense and monitor activities of a person or an animal. These would include, for example, global positioning systems (GPS), pedometers, accelerometers, and so forth. Such devices are compact and can even be incorporated into, for example, a mobile communication device such a cellular telephone or on the collar of a pet. Other sensing devices for monitoring activities of individuals (e.g., users) may be incorporated into larger machines and may be used in order to monitor the usage of the machines by the individuals. These would include, for example, sensors that are incorporated into exercise machines, automobiles, bicycles, and so forth. Today there are even toilet monitoring devices that are available to monitor the toilet usage of individuals.","Other sensing devices are also available that can monitor general environmental conditions such as environmental temperature sensor devices, humidity sensor devices, barometers, wind speed monitors, water monitoring sensors, air pollution sensor devices (e.g., devices that can measure the amount of particulates in the air such as pollen, those that measure COlevels, those that measure ozone levels, and so forth). Other sensing devices may be employed in order to monitor the performance or characteristics of mechanical and\/or electronic devices. All the above described sensing devices may provide useful data that may indicate objectively observable events (e.g., objective occurrences).","In accordance with various embodiments, robust methods, systems, and computer program products are provided to, among other things, acquiring events data indicating multiple events as originally reported by multiple sources including acquiring at least a first data indicating at least one reported event as originally reported by a user and a second data indicating at least a second reported event as originally reported by one or more sensing devices. The methods, systems, and computer program products may then develop a hypothesis based, at least in part, on the first data and the second data. In some embodiments, one or more actions may be executed based, at least in part, on the developed hypothesis. Examples of the types of actions that may be executed include, for example, the presentation of the developed hypothesis or advisories relating to the developed hypothesis. Other actions that may be executed include the prompting of mechanical and\/or electronic devices to execute one or more operations based, at least in part, on the developed hypothesis.","The robust methods, systems, and computer program products may be employed in a variety of environments including, for example, social networking environments, blogging or microblogging environments, instant messaging (IM) environments, or any other type of environment that allows a user to, for example, maintain a diary.","In various implementations, a \u201chypothesis,\u201d as referred to herein, may define one or more relationships or links between different types of events (i.e., event types) including at least a first event type (e.g., a type of event such as a particular type of subjective user state including, for example, a subjective mental state such as \u201chappy\u201d) and a second event type (e.g., another type of event such as a particular type of objective occurrence, for example, favorite sports team winning a game). In some cases, a hypothesis may be represented by an events pattern that may indicate spatial or sequential relationships between different event types (e.g., different types of events such as subjective user states and objective occurrences). In some embodiments, a hypothesis may be further defined by an indication of the soundness (e.g., strength) of the hypothesis.","Note that for ease of explanation and illustration, the following description will describe a hypothesis as defining, for example, the sequential or spatial relationship between two different event types, for example, a first event type and a second event type. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that such a hypothesis may also identify the relationships between three or more event types (e.g., a first event type, a second event type, a third event type, and so forth).","In some embodiments, a hypothesis may, at least in part, be defined or represented by an events pattern that indicates or suggests a spatial or a sequential (e.g., time\/temporal) relationship between different event types. Such a hypothesis, in some cases, may also indicate the strength or weakness of the link between the different event types. That is, the strength or weakness (e.g., soundness) of the correlation between different event types may depend upon, for example, whether the events pattern repeatedly occurs and\/or whether a contrasting events pattern has occurred that may contradict the hypothesis and therefore, weaken the hypothesis (e.g., an events pattern that indicates a person becoming tired after jogging for thirty minutes when a hypothesis suggests that a person will be energized after jogging for thirty minutes).","As briefly described above, a hypothesis may be represented by an events pattern that may indicate spatial or sequential (e.g., time or temporal) relationship or relationships between multiple event types. In some implementations, a hypothesis may merely indicate temporal sequential relationships between multiple event types that indicate the temporal relationships between multiple event types. In alternative implementations a hypothesis may indicate a more specific time relationship between multiple event types. For example, a sequential pattern may represent the specific pattern of events that occurs along a timeline that may indicate the specific time intervals between event types. In still other implementations, a hypothesis may indicate the spatial (e.g., geographical) relationships between multiple event types.","In various embodiments, the development of a hypothesis may be particularly useful to a user (e.g., a microblogger or a social networking user) that the hypothesis may or may not be directly associated with. That is, in some embodiments, a hypothesis may be developed that directly relates to a user. Such a hypothesis may relate to, for example, one or more subjective user states associated with the user, one or more activities associated with the user, or one or more characteristics associated with the user. In other embodiments, however, a hypothesis may be developed that may not be directly associated with a user. For example, a hypothesis may be developed that may be particularly associated with an acquaintance of the user, a pet, or a device operated or used by the user.","In some embodiments, the development of a hypothesis may assist a user in modifying his\/her future behavior, while in other embodiments, such a hypothesis may be useful to third parties such as other users or nonusers, or even to advertisers in order to assist the advertisers in developing a more targeted marketing scheme. In still other situations, the development of a hypothesis relating to a user may help in the treatment of ailments associated with the user.","In some embodiments, a hypothesis may be developed (e.g., creating and\/or further refinement of a hypothesis) by determining a pattern of reported events that repeatedly occurs and\/or to compare similar or dissimilar reported pattern of events. For example, if a user such as a microblogger reports repeatedly that after each visit to a particular restaurant, the user always has an upset stomach, then a hypothesis may be created and developed that suggests that the user will get an upset stomach after visiting the particular restaurant. Note that such events may be based on reported data originally provided by two different sources, the user who reports having a stomach ache, and a sensing device such as a GPS device that reports data that indicates the user's visit to the restaurant just prior to the user reporting the occurrence of the stomach ache.","If, on the other hand, after developing such a hypothesis, the GPS device reports data that indicates that the user visited the same restaurant again but after the second visit the user reports feeling fine, then the reported data provided by the GPS device and the data provided by the user during and\/or after the second visit may result in the weakening of the hypothesis (e.g., the second visit contradicts the hypothesis that a stomach ache is associated with visiting the restaurant). Alternatively, if after developing such a hypothesis, the GPS device and the user reports that in a subsequent visit to the restaurant, the user again got an upset stomach, then such reporting, as provided by both the user and the GPS device, may result in a confirmation of the soundness of the hypothesis.","In various embodiments, other types of hypothesis may be developed that may not be directly related to a user. For instance, a user (e.g., a person) and one or more sensing devices may report on the various characteristics, activities, and\/or behaviors of a friend, a spouse, a pet, or even a mechanical or electronic device that the user may have an interest in. Based on such reported data, one or more hypothesis may be developed that may not be directly related to the user.","Thus, in accordance with various embodiments, robust methods, systems, and computer program products are provided that may be designed to, among other things, acquire events data indicating multiple events as originally reported by multiple sources including at least a first data indicating at least one reported event as originally reported by a user and a second data indicating at least a second reported event originally reported by one or more sensing devices. Based on the at least one reported event as indicated by the acquired first data and the at least second reported event as indicated by the second data, a hypothesis may be developed. In various embodiments, such a hypothesis may be related to, for example, the user, a third party (e.g., another user or nonuser, or a nonhuman living organism such as a pet or livestock), a mechanical and\/or electronic device, the environment, or any other entity or item that may be relevant to the user. Note that the phrase \u201cas originally reported\u201d is used herein since the first data and the second data indicating the at least one reported event and the at least second reported event may be obtained from other sources other than their original sources (e.g., the user and the one or more sensing devices).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIGS. 1","FIG. 1"],"i":["a ","b ","b"],"b":["1","100","10","10","10","60","20","61","35","10","62","50","63","35"]},"Based at least on the reported events as indicated by the acquired first data  and the second data  (and in some cases, based further on the reported events indicated by the third data  and\/or the fourth data ), a hypothesis may be developed by the computing device .

Note that the word \u201cprompting\u201d does not require the immediate or real time execution of one or more actions. Instead, the one or more actions may be executed by the one or more devices at some later point in time from the point in time in which the one or more devices was directed or instructed to execute the one or more actions.","In some implementations, operation  may include an operation  for instructing the one or more devices to execute one or more actions as depicted in .

Those having skill in the art will appreciate that there are various vehicles by which processes and\/or systems and\/or other technologies described herein can be effected (e.g., hardware, software, and\/or firmware), and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the processes and\/or systems and\/or other technologies are deployed. For example, if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly hardware and\/or firmware vehicle; alternatively, if flexibility is paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation; or, yet again alternatively, the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware, software, and\/or firmware. Hence, there are several possible vehicles by which the processes and\/or devices and\/or other technologies described herein may be effected, none of which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific concerns (e.g., speed, flexibility, or predictability) of the implementer, any of which may vary. Those skilled in the art will recognize that optical aspects of implementations will typically employ optically-oriented hardware, software, and or firmware.","The foregoing detailed description has set forth various embodiments of the devices and\/or processes via the use of block diagrams, flowcharts, and\/or examples.

In one embodiment, several portions of the subject matter described herein may be implemented via Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), digital signal processors (DSPs), or other integrated formats. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that some aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein, in whole or in part, can be equivalently implemented in integrated circuits, as one or more computer programs running on one or more computers (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more computer systems), as one or more programs running on one or more processors (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more microprocessors), as firmware, or as virtually any combination thereof, and that designing the circuitry and\/or writing the code for the software and or firmware would be well within the skill of one of skill in the art in light of this disclosure. In addition, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanisms of the subject matter described herein are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, and that an illustrative embodiment of the subject matter described herein applies regardless of the particular type of signal bearing medium used to actually carry out the distribution. Examples of a signal bearing medium include, but are not limited to, the following: a recordable type medium such as a floppy disk, a hard disk drive, a Compact Disc (CD), a Digital Video Disk (DVD), a digital tape, a computer memory, etc.; and a transmission type medium such as a digital and\/or an analog communication medium (e.g., a fiber optic cable, a waveguide, a wired communications link, a wireless communication link, etc.).","In a general sense, those skilled in the art will recognize that the various aspects described herein which can be implemented, individually and\/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof can be viewed as being composed of various types of \u201celectrical circuitry.\u201d Consequently, as used herein \u201celectrical circuitry\u201d includes, but is not limited to, electrical circuitry having at least one discrete electrical circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one integrated circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one application specific integrated circuit, electrical circuitry forming a general purpose computing device configured by a computer program (e.g., a general purpose computer configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and\/or devices described herein, or a microprocessor configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and\/or devices described herein), electrical circuitry forming a memory device (e.g., forms of random access memory), and\/or electrical circuitry forming a communications device (e.g., a modem, communications switch, or optical-electrical equipment). Those having skill in the art will recognize that the subject matter described herein may be implemented in an analog or digital fashion or some combination thereof.","Those having skill in the art will recognize that it is common within the art to describe devices and\/or processes in the fashion set forth herein, and thereafter use engineering practices to integrate such described devices and\/or processes into data processing systems.

It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary, and that in fact many other architectures can be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively \u201cassociated\u201d such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as \u201cassociated with\u201d each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise, any two components so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably connected\u201d, or \u201coperably coupled\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably couplable\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and\/or physically interacting components and\/or wirelessly interactable and\/or wirelessly interacting components and\/or logically interacting and\/or logically interactable components.","While particular aspects of the present subject matter described herein have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, based upon the teachings herein, changes and modifications may be made without departing from the subject matter described herein and its broader aspects and, therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as are within the true spirit and scope of the subject matter described herein. Furthermore, it is to be understood that the invention is defined by the appended claims.","It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as \u201copen\u201d terms (e.g., the term \u201cincluding\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d the term \u201chaving\u201d should be interpreted as \u201chaving at least,\u201d the term \u201cincludes\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincludes but is not limited to,\u201d etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases \u201cat least one\u201d and \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca\u201d and\/or \u201can\u201d should typically be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations.","In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201ctwo recitations,\u201d without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, and C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, and C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.).","In those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, or C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, or C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and\/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase \u201cA or B\u201d will be understood to include the possibilities of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d or \u201cA and B.\u201d"],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIGS. 1","i":["a ","b "],"b":["1","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":["a ","b.
