For instance, an entity such as a business entity, organization, or the like would like to maximize the revenue that it earns on a product line, the profit that it earns on a product line, the number of products that it sells, etc. Alternatively, the entity may want to minimize the costs associated with selling products on a product line, minimize the number of employees working in a department of the entity, minimize the overhead associated with a particular product line, etc. In order to achieve each of these objectives, the entity may design one or more optimization functions.","A maximizing or minimizing objective function is subject to one or more constraints. For instance, the constraints imposed on the goal of maximizing revenue on a product line may be a limited budget, a limited number of sales channels, a limited time period for selling the product, etc.","An objective function depends on unknown variables whose values need to be determined in order to solve an optimization problem. In general, an optimization problem is an objective function that is subject to one or more input constraints. One type of an optimization problem is a binary programming (BP) problem. A BP problem is an instance where unknown variables of an objective function can take values of either 0 or 1. In general, BP problems are part of the class of IP (integer programming) problems. An IP problem is an instance where unknown variables of an optimization problem take integer values. When the population dataset is sufficiently large, the BP problem is an ELSBP (extra-large scale binary programming) problem which is part of the class of ELSIP (extra-large scale integer programming) problems.","In general, IP problems are NP-hard (non-deterministic polynomial-time hard) problems. In computational complexity theory, these problems are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP. A problem \u2018H\u2019 is NP-hard if and only if there is an NP-complete problem \u2018L\u2019 that is polynomial time Turing-reducible to \u2018H.\u2019 A problem \u2018L\u2019 is NP-complete if it has two properties: (1) it is in the set of NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) problems, i.e., any given solution to \u2018L\u2019 can be verified quickly (in polynomial time); and (2) it is also in the set of NP-hard problems, i.e., any NP problem can be converted into \u2018L\u2019 by a transformation of the inputs in polynomial time.","Current optimization systems do not have the ability to efficiently optimize output data associated with a population greater than 50,000 objects. Therefore, there is a need for a system that has the ability to optimize output data associated with populations greater or much greater than 50,000, such as a population of 10,000,000 or greater.","Current optimization systems or solver systems do not have the capacity to produce output data in a short period of time when the size or volume of the population becomes too large. Therefore, there is a need for a system that runs faster and has the ability to produce accurate output data associated with a large population in a short period of time.","Current optimization systems are also cumbersome to use. Therefore, there is a need for a system that is easier to use, i.e., more user-friendly. For instance, there is a need for a system that allows a user to more easily define or modify an optimization problem, allows a user to change input constraints upon which the optimization problem is solved, allows a user to define a range for each input constraint, allows a user to view output data from a plurality of output scenarios, etc.","The following presents a simplified summary of several embodiments of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of such embodiments. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated embodiments of the invention, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all embodiments, nor delineate the scope of any or all embodiments. Its purpose is to present some concepts of one or more embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","Embodiments of the present invention address the above needs and\/or achieve other advantages by providing apparatuses (e.g., a system, computer program product, and\/or other device), methods, or a combination of the foregoing for optimizing output data associated with a population based on one or more input constraints.","For example, some embodiments of the invention provide a method for optimizing output data for a population.

In some embodiments, the population may be very large, e.g., 10,000,000 objects.","Other embodiments provide an alternative method for optimizing output data for a population. The method includes allowing a user to define one or more output data for optimization, allowing a user to define one or more input constraints based on which the output data is to be optimized, and optimizing the output data for the population, subject to the input constraints, by selecting an object of the population based on a selection routine.

Additionally, the population is partitioned in a manner such that objects in each partition are similar.","In some embodiments, the method further includes partitioning the population into a second number of partitions, and optimizing output data for each partition by: selecting an object from each partition based on a second selection routine, wherein the second number of partitions is greater than the first number of partitions. In some embodiments of the method, the second selection routine comprises sorting each partition based at least in part on one or more parameters associated with objects in each partition, and based at least in part on the optimized output data for the population. Additionally, the population is partitioned in such a manner that objects in each partition are similar.","Additionally, in some embodiments, the output data for the population is defined as a function that comprises at least one variable. Here, the value of the variable is \u20181\u2019 for a selected object, and the value of the variable is \u20180\u2019 for an unselected object.","Additionally, in some embodiments, the output data for a partition is defined as a function that comprises at least one variable. Here, the value of the variable is greater than \u20180\u2019 but less than or equal to \u20181\u2019 for a selected partition, and the value of the variable is \u20180\u2019 for an unselected partition. The variable represents a portion of the partition to be selected.","In some embodiments, a selected object is an individual, entity, or the like who receives an offer to open an account at a financial institution. The selected object receives the offer via one or more communication methods, wherein the communication methods may be pre-specified by the selected objects. In some embodiments, the output data is the income collected from accounts opened by one or more selected objects.","In some embodiments, the population comprises at least 50,000 objects.

In accordance with embodiments described herein, an optimization problem may also be referred to as a mathematical programming problem, or simply a programming problem.","In accordance with embodiments described herein, a programming problem or an optimization problem is linear if it comprises a linear objective function along with a linear set of constraints. If either the objective function or the set of constraints are non-linear, then the programming problem or the optimization problem is non-linear. Both a binary programming problem and an integer programming problem could either be linear or non-linear programming problems. In some embodiments, a function is linear if it satisfies the following properties:\n\n(\u03c7+)=(\u03c7)+()\n\n(\u03b1\u03c7)=\u03b1(\u03c7)\n","However, in other embodiment, a function may have to satisfy other properties as well in order to be linear.","In accordance with embodiments described herein, the term \u201cmodule\u201d with respect to a system may refer to a hardware component of the system, a software component of the system, or a component of the system that comprises both hardware and software.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","50","20","12","55","12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["12","14","17","19","17"]},"The processor  may be an application-specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d), or other chipset, processor, logic circuit, or other data processing device.

As used herein, the offer identifier is an identifier associated with a financial institution's offer to an individual to open an account at the financial institution. In one embodiment, the offer may be from some party other than the financial institution to an individual to open an account at the financial institution. This offer identifier may include numbers, letters, symbols, or any combination thereof. Therefore, I may be comprised of (u, v).","The NCR (r) parameter represents the probability of a given individual to open an account at the financial institution. As used herein, the NCR parameter may also be referred to as a probability factor. This probability is based on a predictive statistical model, i.e., a model that that assigns a probability to an individual of the population based on several metrics associated with the individual, such as financial institution data metrics which are described later with respect to the RSK parameter. The NCR parameter is a product of the probability of an individual positively responding to an offer to open an account multiplied by the probability of an underwriter associated with the financial institution determining that the individual is qualified to open the account and agreeing to open the account at the financial institution. The probability is a number between 0 and 1, both inclusive.","The CPP (c) parameter represents the cost incurred by a financial institution in communicating with a selected individual an offer to open an account at a financial institution. As used herein, the CPP parameter may also be referred to as a cost factor. In one embodiment, the communication is established via a postal mail letter or mail piece. However, in other embodiments, the offer may be communicated via email, phone, text message (e.g., Short Message Service (SMS)), in-person communication (e.g., sending a representative of the financial institution to meet an individual), or the like. This cost may be expressed as a dollar figure, e.g., $0.15. In other embodiments, the cost may comprise not just the cost for each communication with a selected individual, but also the cost involved in opening the account for the selected individual, managing the individual's account including the predicted frequency and type of transactions that will be made by the individual over a pre-determined period of time, etc.","The CPP_T (e) parameter represents the CPP parameter after deducting any applicable taxes associated with the CPP parameter.","The PFT (p) parameter represents the profit associated with the individual provided the individual successfully opens an account at the financial institution. In some embodiments, this parameter may represent the profit for a certain period of time, e.g., the predicted profit for a period of 3 years following the opening of the account. The PFT parameter is based on a predictive statistical model, i.e., a model that that assigns a probability to an individual of the population based on several metrics associated with the individual, such as financial institution data metrics, which are described later with respect to the RSK parameter.","The GROSS_PFT (a) parameter represents the previously defined PFT after deducting any applicable taxes associated with the PFT parameter.","The RSK (d) parameter is a \u2018risk\u2019 factor and represents how likely the individual associated with the account will not be able to meet its repayment or delivery obligation under previously agreed upon terms and conditions with the financial institution. This RSK parameter is based on a predictive statistical model, i.e., a model that that assigns a probability to an individual of the population based on several metrics (discussed in more detail below) associated with the individual, such as financial institution data metrics and\/or non-financial institution data metrics. In one embodiment, the RSK parameter is a number between 0 and 1, both inclusive. In another embodiment, the RSK parameter may be a percentage. In this embodiment, the RSK parameter represents the probability that an individual will stop making payments on an account associated with a financial institution. If the predictive statistical model predicts delinquency for an individual, the RSK parameter may also consider the individual's predicted balance at the time when delinquency is predicted.","In another embodiment, the RSK parameter may be a risk score, wherein the score may be standardized on a fixed scale, such as a scale from 1 to 100. This score may also be represented as a percentage value. In another embodiment, the RSK parameter may be a risk rating, such that the risk rating is based on the risk score. For instance, a risk rating of \u20181\u2019 may correspond with risk scores from 70 to 100, a risk rating of \u20182\u2019 may correspond with risk scores from 30 to 70, and a risk rating of \u20183\u2019 may correspond with risk scores from 0 to 30. In one embodiment, a user may be able to change the risk score range that corresponds with a particular risk rating.","The RSK parameter may take into account various financial institution data metrics  and non-financial institution data metrics  associated with an individual of a population dataset. The financial institution data may include transactional level data, such as checking transactions, ATM transactions, and credit\/debit card transactions that allow for determination of an individual's transactional behaviors. Additionally, the financial institution data may include an individual's current account data, such as account balances and the like, and an individual's other data, such as personal data, profile data, demographics data, contact information, and the like. More specifically, the individual's financial institution data may include the ages of an individual's current accounts, payment history, payment terms, payment sizes of both current and past payments, payment sources of both current and past payments, payment due dates and whether the individual is meeting the payment due dates, the number of days overdue if a payment is overdue, whether any past payments have been returned for any reason other than error on part of the financial institution that holds the account, the type of loan product associated with the individual's current account, whether the loan product is unsecured or secured, the guarantors of the account, whether any risk patterns have been previously identified for the account, whether any risk mitigation actions have previously been executed on the account, payment history of other associated accounts, any remarks associated with the account or associated accounts, etc. In addition, data may be collected from non-financial institutions, such as consumer bureaus, business bureaus, retailers (online and brick & mortar) government agencies, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), telephone companies (Telcos), health care industry entities, and the like. The information obtained from consumer bureaus may include payment status on bills, payment status on accounts at other financial institutions, credit utilization ratios, length and variety of credit history, instances of credit inquiries, instances of charge-offs, instances of bankruptcy filings, instances of other delinquencies, or the like. If an object of the population is an entity rather than an individual, information may be obtained from business bureaus. The information from business bureaus may include bankruptcy filings, payment disputes with customers, payment of dues to business bureaus, information provided to business bureaus or the like. The non-financial institution data may provide additional transactional information regarding the entity, such as the type of business or operation that the entity is engaged in, the reputation of the entity, etc. If the account holder is an individual, the non-financial information may further include the type of items purchased by the individual and the like, behavioral data regarding the individual, such as purchasing or browsing behaviors, etc. The financial institution data and non-financial institution data may be captured in one or more risk databases that allow for analytics and\/or logic to be performed on the data for the purpose of generating the RSK parameter.","Now that a data structure has been established for each individual in the population, the next step is to define an optimization problem and the constraints within which the optimization problem should be solved (block ). The goal of an optimization problem is to determine the best solution from all feasible solutions, i.e., find an optimal solution.

By relaxing the original BP optimization problem to a continuous LP problem, each LP problem may be solved by software that has the ability to solve linear problems. The original BP problem cannot be solved by a regular LP solver. The solution to the LP problem is an approximation of the solution to the original binary programming optimization problem. The LP problem has polynomial complexity, where the number of variables in the polynomial linear programming (LP) function are equal to the number of partitions into which the population dataset is divided.","In some embodiments, the population dataset is partitioned into a plurality of smaller datasets, wherein the objects in each smaller dataset have similar attributes. The goal of partitioning the population dataset is to make each dataset as homogenous as possible. The advantage of doing so is that an average data metric for the partition may adequately represent the data metrics for each individual in the partition. For instance, in one embodiment, the individuals in a smaller dataset have similar attributes with respect to the constraints used in the optimization problem defined above. Therefore, the individuals in each smaller dataset may have similar PFT (p), NCR (r), and RSK (d) parameters. Therefore, an individual in a particular smaller dataset may have a PFT that is different from another individual's PFT in the same smaller dataset by a pre-determined maximum percentage as determined by a user of the system. Similarly, an individual in a particular smaller dataset may have a NCR or RSK that is different from another individual's NCR or RSK, respectively, in the same smaller dataset by a pre-determined maximum percentage as determined by a user of the system.","In some embodiments, the system may use a ranking procedure to gather individuals with similar attributes in the same smaller dataset. As part of such a ranking procedure, the system may order the individuals in the population dataset by PFT value in descending order.

Furthermore, each partition may comprise a different number of individuals.

Increasing the number of partitions may increase the total amount of processing time in producing the output data when compared to an embodiment where the population dataset is divided into fewer partitions.","The total number of output scenarios, or output partitions that may be analyzed by a user, is the product of the number of partitions in the sorted PFT list multiplied by the number of partitions in the sorted NCR list multiplied by the number of partitions in the sorted NCR list.

For instance, the system may order the individuals in the population dataset by PFT value in descending order. Within each value of PFT, the system sorts the individuals in the population dataset by their NCR value in descending order. Within each value of NCR, the system sorts the individuals in the population dataset by their RSK value in ascending order. The system then selects a first pre-determined number of individuals for the first partition. Subsequently, the system selects a second pre-determined number of individuals for the second partition, and so on. In some embodiments, the system may allow a user to specify these first and second pre-determined numbers. In other embodiments, the system may automatically determine these pre-determined numbers based on logic\/routines input into the system.

in a given partition and xis a continuous variable between 0 and 1. The product qxrepresents the number of individuals that are selected from a given partition (block ). If xis \u20181\u2019 for a given partition, then the system selects all the individuals of the given partition. If xis \u20180\u2019 for a given partition, then the system selects no individuals from the given partition. The selection criteria procedure that defines block  has been described previously.","Briefly, to summarize the previously described selection criteria, in some embodiments, the system may rank the individuals in each partition based on one or more parameters associated with the individuals and then select the first qxnumber of individuals (or select individuals whose P\/F flag is \u20181\u2019). In other embodiments, in deciding which individuals to select, the system (or the selection module of the system) may consider the optimization function defined by the user (or the output data to be optimized defined by the user), the constraints within which the optimization function is to be solved by one or more computing device processors, other parameters associated with each individual in the population dataset, etc. In some embodiments, the selection module may allow a user to select a pre-determined number of individuals for each partition based on the value of the continuous variable for each partition. Also as described previously, in some embodiments, rather than setting P\/F flags (i.e., selecting individuals when their P\/F flag is \u20181\u2019 and not selecting individuals when their P\/F flag is \u20180\u2019), the system may just compute the average value for each parameter associated with all the individuals (or less than all the individuals) in a particular partition.","Each inequality statement that describes an input constraint is similar to the corresponding inequality statement described previously with respect to the original BP problem.","In some embodiments where the population dataset is about 15,000,000, dividing the population dataset into approximately 1000 partitions produces a fair approximation, while not using excessive amounts of processing time. This means that the output data produced by solving the LP problem (block ) is fairly close to the output data produced by solving the original BP problem. For instance, in some embodiments, when solving the LP problem, a solution to each of the 1000 partitions is produced in roughly 3 seconds. Therefore, the overall processing time is approximately 50 minutes. Although, the number of partitions used can be much higher at this stage, e.g., 1,000,000 partitions, the gain in accuracy of the output data may be minimal, e.g., 1-2%, while greatly increasing the processing time involved in producing the output data, e.g., 10\u00d7 the amount of processing time. At this stage of the process, accuracy of the output data is not as important as producing output data in a short period of time. Therefore, in an embodiment, rather than dividing the population dataset into approximately 1,000,000 partitions, the population dataset is divided into approximately 1000 partitions. This may lead to a further reduction in the processing time to produce output data.","Subsequently, the system overlays these partitions, and rolls-up the population dataset to the partition level. As stated previously, in one embodiment, each parameter associated with a partition may be an average value for all the individuals in the partition, or one or more individuals in the partition.","Therefore, for each partition, the above-described linear programming problem is solved by one or more computing device processors based on the above-described constraints.","Therefore, the output data at the partition level may be as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0131","num":"0130"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00008","num":"00008"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"BD","NCR","RISK","ROI"]},{"entry":[{},"CEIL","FLR","CEIL","FLR."]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"N\/A","0","0.08","N\/A"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},"MAIL"]},{"entry":["NIBT","ROI","BD_USED","ACTS","PRFT_TOT","NCR","RSK","VOL"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["2.88M","0.145","3.0M","6512","2.55M","0.065%","0.08","8.78M"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Each column has been described previously with respect to the embodiment where the binary programming problem is solved by not partitioning the population dataset.

The value of the continuous variable for a particular partition is based on the previously determined selection criteria that resulted from analyzing the 10 partitions. In an embodiment, a selection module may determine the value of the continuous variable for a particular partition based on the previously determined selection criteria that resulted from analyzing the 10 partitions. In some embodiments, the selection module may allow a user to select a pre-determined number of individuals for each partition based on the value of the continuous variable for each partition.","In one embodiment, the system allows the user to select the number of increased partitions. In one embodiment, the system automatically selects the number of partitions based on a pre-defined algorithm that may be based on various parameters such as allowable processing time, allowable hardware resources to process the LP problem, parameters associated with each object of the dataset, number and type of input constraints defined by a user, or the like.","The LP solver now solves the polynomial LP function with the 1,000,000 decision variables (block ). For instance, where the population dataset N=15,000,000, the overall output after solving the linear programming problem with the increased number of partitions may be as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0148","num":"0147"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00010","num":"00010"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"BD","NCR","RISK","ROI"]},{"entry":[{},"CEIL","FLR","CEIL","FLR."]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"N\/A","0","0.08","N\/A"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},"MAIL"]},{"entry":["NIBT","ROI","BD_USED","ACTS","PRFT_TOT","NCR","RSK","VOL"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["2.91M","0.148","3.2M","6516","2.58M","0.065%","0.08","8.79M"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The above table shows the results produced by solving the linear programming problem with approximately 1,000,000 partitions are close to the results produced by solving by solving the linear programming problem with fewer partitions, e.g., 1000 partitions, at block  of  (reproduced below for easy comparison).
