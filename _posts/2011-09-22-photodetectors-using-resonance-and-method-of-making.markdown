No. 13\/082945 entitled \u201cPhotodetectors Using Resonance and Method of Making\u201d filed Apr. 8, 2011, which is a continuation-in-part and claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/543,121 entitled \u201cCorrugated-Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector with Reflective Sidewall and Method,\u201d both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and\/or licensed by or for the United States Government.","The present invention relates to quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) for infrared detection.","The quantum well infrared photodetector (QWIP) has emerged as a mainstream technology for long wavelength infrared detection. Quantum Well Infrared Photodetectors (QWIPs) are infrared detectors that are made of layers of quantum well (QW) materials. These QW materials have a unique property that they are sensitive to light only when the light is propagating parallel to these layers, with which one of the electric polarizations Eis pointing perpendicular to the layers. In other words, the QWIP material absorbs light only when the optical electric field is vertical to the material layers. The detector structure may be arranged in the form of large focal plane arrays (FPAs) of pixels.","Utilizing gallium arsenide material technology, QWIP focal plane array cameras are amenable for low cost and high volume production. QWIP cameras with resolution as high as 640\u00d7512 pixels are available in the commercial market. InGaAs\/AlGaAs materials have proved to be useful in Quantum Well Infrared Photodetectors (QWIPs). InGaAs\/AlGaAs materials have material properties that are highly reproducible and predictable by fundamental physical laws. For example, the observed material's absorption coefficient \u03b1 for parallel propagating light is found to be in precise agreement with that calculated from quantum mechanics. Free from extrinsic factors such as material imperfection and surface leakage, the observed dark current also obeys the well-known thermionic emission model. With this simple and well-behaved material system, QWIP technology could have been developed and applied in a rapid pace. Unfortunately, the unique requirement for vertically polarized light has greatly impeded its development. Being sensitive only to the vertical polarization, E, the quantum efficiency (QE) of the detector is dependent on the pixel geometry, apart from its material properties.","When the QWIP is detecting light from a target area, light from the target area enters into the detector pixels normally (i.e., at a 90\u00b0 angle). Because the QWIPs are sensitive to light only when the light is propagating parallel to the layers of the QWIPs, a reflective grating is conventionally placed on top of the pixels to scatter light, as shown in . In the presence of a grating with a particular period, the light with certain wavelengths will diffract at a large angle. Travelling at an oblique angle, the light can be partially absorbed by the material which generates photocurrent inside the pixel. The design of an optimal grating was described by J. Y. Anderson and L. Lundqvist in the article entitled \u201cGrating-coupled quantum-well infrared detectors: Theory and performance\u201d, J. Appl. Phys. vol. 71, pp. 3600-3610, 1992. Nevertheless, the general approach of using reflective gratings to couple light has achieved only very limited success so far, which precludes its application in demanding situations. To broaden its utility, a more efficient light coupling scheme is needed.","As reported in A. De Rossi et al., \u201cEffects of finite pixel size on optical coupling in QWIPs,\u201d Inf. Phys. and Tech., vol. 44, pp. 325-330, 2003, showed that when the pixel size is very small, diffraction from edges, rather than from the grating, dominates the optical coupling. The spectral response appears noticeably different from the ideal infinite grating, indicating a Fabry-Perot resonance between the pixel walls and between the grating and the air-substrate interface. Although large QE using the grating approach has been reported in J. Y. Andersson and L. Lundqvist, \u201cNear-unity quantum efficiency of AlGaAs\/GaAs quantum well infrared detectors using a waveguide with a doubly periodic grating coupler,\u201d Appl. Phys. Lett., vol. 59, pp. 857-859, (1991), there is little evidence that high performance can be achieved in the high density, small pixel FPAs.","To improve the optical coupling in QWIPs, corrugated-quantum well infrared photodetector (C-QWIP) have been developed, as described in C. J. Chen et al., \u201cCorrugated quantum well infrared photodetectors for normal incident light coupling,\u201d Appl. Phys. Lett., vol. 69, pp. 1446-1448, 1996; K. K. Choi et al., \u201cCorrugated quantum well infrared photodetectors for material characterization.\u201d J. Appl. Phys., vol. 88, pp. 1612-1623, 2000. The \u201ccorrugated\u201d terminology relates to using a number of V-grooves etched into the layered material to create angled mesa sidewalls for light coupling. Corrugated-QWIP utilizes optical reflections to change the direction of light inside the pixel. A C-QWIP pixel structure is shown in . In the C-QWIP structure shown in , the inclined sidewalls reflect normal incident light into large angle propagation. The inclined sidewalls reflect light into parallel propagation and create the vertical field. The detector has a constant coupling efficiency when the detector substrate is thick. See, for example L. Yan et al., \u201cElectromagnetic modeling of quantum-well photodetectors containing diffractive elements,\u201d IEEE J. Quantum Electron., vol. 35, pp. 1870.1877, 1999; K. K. Choi et al., \u201cLight coupling characteristics of corrugated quantum well infrared photodetectors,\u201d IEEE J. of Quan. Electr., vol. 40, pp. 130-142, 2004. Corrugated Quantum Well Infrared Photodetectors (C-QWIP) cameras, for example, can be made in higher resolution, in larger production volume, at a lower cost, in higher sensitivity, in broadband and multi-color detection. The structure was patented by Choi in U.S. Pat. No. 5,485,015, hereby incorporated by reference, entitled \u201cQuantum Grid Infrared Photodetector,\u201d which discloses a quantum grid infrared photodetector (QGIP) that includes a semiconductor substrate with a quantum well infrared photodetector (QWIP) mounted thereon. Moreover, U.S. Pat. No. 7,217,926, issued May 15, 2007, hereby incorporated by reference, discloses \u201cSystems involving voltage-tunable quantum-well infrared photodetectors.\u201d For example, when using GaAs, having a refractive index is 3.34, the critical angle will be 17.4\u00b0 when the GaAs material is in contact with air or vacuum. Since the sidewall angle is 50\u00b0, the angle of incidence for normal incident light will also be 50\u00b0, making it larger than the critical angle. The light will thus be totally internal reflected and be absorbed by the GaAs detector material.","By using C-QWIPs, because reflection is more effective in redirecting the light, the quantum efficiency (QE) is improved. Reflection is also independent of wavelength. This means that the detector will preserve the natural absorption spectrum of the material, which often can be much wider than the grating coupling bandwidth. Without the need for matching the material wavelength to the grating cavity modes in the detector, the same pixel geometry and production process are applicable to all QWIP material designs. This allows the simultaneous production of FPAs having a wide range of wavelength bands without jeopardizing QE. In the absence of the fine grating features, it also allows the use of standard photolithographic techniques for faster, less expensive and very large format production. However, there is a need for further improving QWIP technology in high-sensitivity and high-resolution imaging.","In accordance with the principles of the present invention the effect of resonance is used to enhance the detection capability. The principles are adaptable to a C-QWIP structure fabricated on top of a thin common contact layer with the wafer substrate substantially or entirely removed. This preferred embodiment structure enables the increase of the optical intensity inside the detector through optical coherent interference. Optionally, a thin composite layer may be placed external to the common contact layer to enhance or alter the resonances in the detector volume.","A preferred embodiment comprises a detector structure that is more sensitive than a regular C-QWIP because of resonance effects. As explained in above, the QWIP material does not absorb normal incident light. In contrast to commercial products that use gratings to diffract or scatter light inefficiently, resulting in low infrared absorption among other deficiencies, a C-QWIP utilizes total internal reflection to redirect light that leads to more sensitive, lower cost and higher definition products. However, C-QWIPs with thick substrates operate on incoherent light and any unabsorbed light will be lost to the surrounding after the first pass. In contrast, a preferred embodiment operates on, inter alia, coherent light, with which the light intensity can be intensified by resonances, with which the quantum efficiency can be larger across the spectrum. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the substrate depicted (for example) in , may be removed by using, for example, a simple selective etching step and the subsequent addition of a thin film coating is similar to applying an anti-reflection coating. By removal or fabrication without a substrate, a preferred embodiment improves the detector quantum efficiency without adding appreciable cost. This detector structure is thus ideal for many infrared applications, including infrared detection.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises apparatus and methodology for increasing substrate internal reflectivity and, therefore, efficiency of a quantum well infrared photodetector. A preferred embodiment may also incorporate the principles of the composite layer encapsulated corrugated quantum well infrared photodetectors (CLE C-QWIPs). A composite layer having high sidewall reflectivity ensures the high \u03b7 of the C-QWIP arrays, while the low leakage of a dielectric layer, which may be MgF, will not increase the detector dark current. For example, the reflective layer may comprise a high plasma energy layer of gold and the dielectric layer may comprises a material having low optical phonon energy such as MgFin order to provide a large wavelength window for high reflectivity of the film.","A preferred methodology comprises a method for determining the efficiency of a photodetector configuration using a three-dimensional finite element electromagnetic computer simulation comprising: determining a design configuration geometry, calculating the electromagnetic field distributions, determining a quantum efficiency spectrum at the desired wavelength or wavelength range; whereby to determine the optical effectiveness, a 3-dimensional finite element electromagnetic simulation is carried out to calculate the quantum efficiency of the detector configuration geometry.","The thin contact layer may be initially formed on a substrate which is subsequently removed or thinned using a mechanical thinning technique. The mechanical thinning technique may be, for example, lapping or diamond turning and the thickness of the substrate is within a range of 30 \u03bcm to 50 \u03bcm thick.","The infrared photodetector may comprise a plurality of reflective sidewalls such that the roundtrip optical pathlength of the unabsorbed light reflecting from the 30- to 50-\u03bcm substrate is larger than 20 wavelengths and almost all reflected light from the substrate is not coherent within the active layer so that optical interference effects are negligible whereby the efficiency may be determined by",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b7","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":["t","s"]},{"mi":["\u03b7","int"]}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"msub":{"mi":["t","s"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"p"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":"t","mo":"+","mrow":{"mfrac":{"msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"\u03b1"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"p"}},"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"\u03b1"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mi":["\u03b1","t"]}}}}}}}}}],"mo":"="}}}},"br":{},"sub":"s "},"The configuration of the surface of the absorption layer may be a series of circular discs, pyramidal, resembling a prism, or the like.

The terminology \u201cresonance\u201d or \u201cresonances\u201d is mentioned in various places in the following description. Fabry-Perot resonances are referenced in modulating the substrate transmission of the C-QWIP, and resonances associated with Fabry-Perot (FB) mechanism. Normally, FB resonances refer to the situation when the light bounces back and forth between two parallel plates. If the left-going light is in-phase with the right-going light, the light intensities add. If they are out of phase, the intensities interfere or subtract. In C-QWIPs, because of the 45 degree sidewalls, () the light incident on the left side of the corrugation will be reflected back by the substrate on the right after two 90 degree sidewall reflections. Therefore, the substrate on the left and right are analogous to the two parallel plates in the standard FB mechanism. Resonances do not need two parallel plates in general. As long as the light can return to the original place after a number of reflections inside a geometry, it can set up a resonance, and in this case, a standing wave is established (a wave just goes back and forth). Whenever the incident power can reinforce the later incident power and the process repeats, the energy or intensity in that localized region can build up to a large value; analogous to riding on a swing. The R-QWIP has many reflecting surfaces and due to diffraction effects, the angle of incident and the angle of reflection on any plane need not be the same. For some wavelengths, the light bouncing along the discs can trace out a circular path. Therefore, in complicated geometries, there are many standing wave patterns and it is hard to analyze these patterns analytically. FB resonances or the acoustic waves in flutes are standing waves in simple geometries. In general, a numerical method is needed to discover\/explore these resonance(s).","EM Modeling","To optimize an existing detector structure and to search for a new detector configuration, it is desirable to know the QE theoretically before expensive experimental resources are committed. However, there have been very few known attempts to construct a rigorous and flexible approach that can yield Equantitatively under any arbitrary detector configurations and even fewer attempts to compare it with experiment. In this application, a rigorous three-dimensional finite element electromagnetic (EM) approach is used in obtaining QE quantitatively and explicitly and compared the model with experiments. The experimental results tend to agree with the theoretical modeling to within experimental uncertainty. After creating a reliable approach, other more complicated and unconventional optical coupling schemes were explored, with which a new type of detector geometry is proposed.","To illustrate the coherent optical effects, a 3-dimensional (3D) finite element electromagnetic (EM) simulation is carried out to calculate the quantum efficiency (labeled as QE or \u03b7) of any detector geometry using Equation (1). For a given optical power Pincident normally on a detector area A, the absorption quantum efficiency, labeled as QE or \u03b7, is given by",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b7","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","msub":{"mi":"P","mn":"0"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mo":"\u222b","mi":"V"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.2em","height":"0.2ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":"\u2146","mrow":{"mi":"I","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mover":{"mi":"r","mo":"\u2192"}}}}}}},"mo":","}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","msub":{"mi":"P","mn":"0"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mo":"\u222b","mi":"V"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"\u03b1","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":[{"mi":"I","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mover":{"mi":"r","mo":"\u2192"}}},{"msup":{"mo":"\u2146","mn":"3"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"r"}]}}}},"mo":","}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"\u03b1","mrow":{"msubsup":[{"mi":"A","mn":"2","mrow":{"mi":"c","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":"\u025b","mn":"0"}}},{"mi":"E","mn":["0","2"]}],"mo":"\u2062"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mo":"\u222b","mi":"V"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"nc","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":"\u025b","mn":"0"}},"mn":"2"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["E","z"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mover":{"mi":"r","mo":"\u2192"}}}},"mn":"2"},"mrow":{"msup":{"mo":"\u2146","mn":"3"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"r"}}}}},"mo":","}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":["n","\u03b1"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"msubsup":{"mi":"AE","mn":["0","2"]}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mo":"\u222b","mi":"V"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["E","z"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mover":{"mi":"r","mo":"\u2192"}}}},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mo":"\u2146","mn":"3"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"r"}}}}},"mo":","}}}]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["z","z","z "],"b":"2","sup":"2 "},"Since E(the incident electric field in free space) and Eare linearly proportional to each other in Equation (1), Ecan be set arbitrarily, and the only input parameter in Equation (1) is the wavelength-dependent \u03b1(\u03bb).

Since light is a wave, it has both positive and negative components, depending on the phase at a particular instant (like the peaks and valleys in water or sine wave). For this reason, the areas of high intensity red are accompanied by areas of high intensity blue.

In interference , the incident beam rpartially transmits into the substrate as r. Through partial reflection at the other bottom side of the corrugation, the light makes a round trip inside the corrugation and interferes with the reflected beam r. If rand rinterfere destructively, the substrate reflection will be reduced and rwill be strengthened. Upon more round trip interferences, the substrate reflection will be completely suppressed and the internal intensity is greatly enhanced, analogous to the usual Fabry-Perot resonances in parallel planes. The analogy exists because all the incident light has the same path length of (2t+2h+w)=(2t+p) in the corrugation between the two substrate reflections, independent of the incident location. They differ only in that the corrugated structure possesses another interference set (#2), in which rinterferes with another beam rincident on the opposite sidewall.","Since there is a phase shift of \u03c0 upon 45\u00b0 internal reflection for the transverse magnetic (TM) mode, the optical E vector switches direction at the inclined surfaces as depicted in .

In the presence of extra interfaces in the actual C-QWIP pixels, which include the interfaces between QWIP\/MgF, MgF\/Au, QWIP\/thin film, and thin film\/Air, the exact resonant wavelengths will be more complicated and can only be obtained from finite element EM simulation. Nevertheless, Eqn. (7) is shown to provide a good estimate on these wavelengths and suggested that one can change either the common contact thickness or the remaining substrate thickness for a fixed p to design different resonant wavelengths.","Resonance also occurs in grating coupled detectors, but it has been overlooked generally. For example,  shows a grating coupled QWIP (GR-QWIP) geometry and  shows the associated Edistribution. The pixel area is 23\u00d723 \u03bcm. The material active layer is 1.5 \u03bcm-thick, and the common contact layer is 1.0 \u03bcm-thick. On top of the active layer, there is a reflective grating with period d of 3.0 \u03bcm and height h of 0.75 \u03bcm. The grating is covered entirely with a highly conductive metal such as gold. These period and height are optimized for an incident light with \u03bb=9.72 \u03bcm in free space. According to the standard grating formula, which is d sin \u03b8=\u03bb\/n, d should be chosen such that \u03b8=90\u00b0 for a given \u03bb. To eliminate the zeroth diffraction that reflects the light directly backward, h is chosen to satisfy h=\u03bb\/(4n).","In practice, such a grating structure will be placed on a material with the same peak absorption \u03bb but otherwise arbitrarily selected active layer thickness t, common contact layer thickness tand pixel size p. These material thicknesses and pixel dimensions are considered separately from that of the grating's based on factors such as material cost and readout circuit dimensions. However, based on the present EM modeling, the solid curve with circles in  shows that for the prescribed material thickness and pixel size, a significant peak indeed appears at \u02dc9.7 \u03bcM as the grating formula predicts. However, the magnitude of this peak varies with p and tfor the same t, and there are larger peaks at the shorter wavelengths that correspond to smaller values of \u03b8. Therefore, there are factors other than d and h affecting the grating efficiency, and the grating formula alone cannot provide a complete prescription for the detector design. With a finite pixel size, the detector volume is in fact a resonant cavity. When the incident light of a particular \u03bb enters into the detector pixel, it will be diffracted by the grating at a specific \u03b8. The diffracted light rays will reflect at the pixel sidewalls and substrate, and form an interference pattern. If this interference pattern constitutes to a large integrated intensity, the cavity is said to be in resonance. For a particular set of pixel dimensions, there will be a set of \u03b8 and a set of corresponding \u03bb that result in large intensities. However, for QWIPs, only the vertical component of the intensity results in absorption. Therefore, in order to obtain the absolute maximum QE, the dimensions of the pixel have to be adjusted such that one of the resonances occurs when \u03b8 is near 90\u00b0. Such an optimized structure will be referred to as one member of the resonator-QWIPs (R-QWIPs), and it will be labeled as RG-QWIP.

W. Lee, M. W. Devre, B. H. Reelfs, D. Johnson, J. N. Sasserath, F. Clayton, D. Hays, and S. J. Pearton, J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 18(4), pp. 1220-1224 (2000), hereby incorporated by reference. After the substrate is mechanically thinned to 40 \u03bcm, it can be loaded into an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etcher for selective etching. The gases flow into the etcher consists of 5 sccm (standard cubic centimeter per minute) BCl, 5 sccm SF, and 10 sccm helium. The ICP source power, which controls the plasma density, is set at 300 W and 2 MHz, and the rf chuck power, which controls the plasma collision energy and thus the etching rate, is set at 10 W and 13.56 MHz. The chamber pressure is set at 10 mTorr. Under such etching condition, the etching rate for GaAs is 0.37 \u03bcm\/min and the etching rate for AlGaAs is 9.2\u00d710\u03bcm\/min. The selectivity is thus 400:1. This selectivity will also be further increased by increasing the Al content. In this process, BClserves as an etchant to GaAs, and once the AlGaAs stop etch layer is exposed, the reaction of aluminum with SFforms the nonvolatile AlFcompounds and prevents further etching. The role of helium in the plasma is to assist the removal of chemical by-products on the material surface so that the GaAs etching rate is increased and the surface is smoother. As such, other inert gases can be used as a substitute for helium.","A PR-QWIP FPA based on the detector material in Box A has been characterized before and after the GaAs substrate was removed by the dry plasma etching process. No composite thin film was used. Preliminary data shows that the detector QE varies with wavelengths according to that shown in  after the substrate is removed. A preferred embodiment resonantly enhanced corrugated quantum well infrared photodetector (RE C-QWIP) has thus been shown to operate as the modeling predicted. A preferred embodiment RE C-QWIP provides a large QE for the FPA.","The preferred embodiment resonantly enhanced corrugated quantum well infrared photodetector (RE C-QWIP) will further increase the detector QE through coherent resonance effects. These can be achieved by removing the substrate and, subsequently, by adding an optional layer of composite thin film. The RE C-QWIP preserves the broadband advantages of a C-QWIP through multiple resonances, and yet intensified the light at those wavelengths. With the resulting higher QE, the target acquisition time will be shorter, which allows the cameras to track faster objects. With higher photocurrent, it allows the camera operating at higher temperatures with the same sensitivity. Higher temperature operation can reduce the readiness time and the cooling power consumption.","Grating coupled QWIP FPAs are expensive due to the low yield in grating fabrication, less sensitive due to inefficient, narrow band light coupling, lower in definition due to the larger pixel size. In contrast, C-QWIP FPAs are inexpensive due to the standard batch processing, higher in sensitive due to efficient broadband light coupling, and higher in definition due to the smaller pixel size in the one corrugation per pixel geometry. C-QWIP coupling is also suitable for multi-color detection due to its wavelength-independent light coupling mechanism.","RE C-QWIP FPAs further increases the C-QWIP quantum efficiency by several times and thus make the camera more sensitive.","A RE C-QWIP FPA camera can be used as an upgrade replacement for all grating coupled or C-QWIP cameras. In the past, a C-QWIP FPA was found to have the best performance in detecting unmanned aerial vehicles in a detection contest, which consisted of 12 sensing teams using different technologies. The cameras are also used in ballistic missile intercept observations, ground based mid-course defense and terminal high altitude air defense. C-QWIP cameras obtained the best and most detailed video missile intercept footages to date. In view of the broadband characteristics of C-QWIPs, NASA has revised the technology roadmap for its Landsat program. On board of the upcoming earth observing satellite, there will be a Thermal Imaging Infrared Sensor that requires broadband infrared detectors. NASA has designated C-QWIP FPAs to be the technology for this mission and proposed the structure for other planetary missions such as the Jupiter-Europa mission. The RE C-QWIPs will further improve this technology. Because of its ability in generating even larger photocurrent needed for high speed imaging, Army Night Vision Lab and L3, Inc. will be interested in developing RE C-QWIPs for the Objective Pilotage for Utility and Lift program.","RE C-QWIP FPAs can also be made in high resolutions such as 4 megapixels or 16 megapixels and into two- or multi-color FPAs. They will be the unique choice for many long wavelength applications in terms of availability, sensitivity, stability, reliability, resolution and cost. The applications include night vision, all weather navigation, infrared astronomy, space exploration, earth resources exploration, environmental protection, geological survey, homeland security, industrial quality control, maintenance and diagnostics, and medical imaging etc.","The invention utilizes the insight into the resonant mechanism, the Fabry-Perot oscillations, in conjunction with the inclined detector sidewalls, in producing intense optical fields polarized in the vertical direction. This insight devises a simple and cost effective solution in achieving high quantum efficiency and broadband infrared detection in QWIP materials. It is the first time for one to show that Fabry-Perot resonances exist in trapezoidal resonators, which include prisms, pyramids, and cones, in addition to the usual parallel plate etalon, and to utilize these resonances to produce large infrared absorption across a wide spectrum.","EM Modeling Solutions","With an exemplified \u03b1 of 0.22 \u03bcm,  show the QE of prism-shaped C-QWIPs (FIG.

Accordingly, a reliable approach to calculate QE of a detector with any material structure and pixel geometry has been described. This powerful capability is useful for detector applications. One will be able to design all the detector optical properties, without any empirical parameters, before the production begins. At the same time, the EM modeling is also extremely useful in developing a better optical coupling design. It not only provides an instant answer for each particular design but also calculates the corresponding EM field distributions. The field distribution can lead to important insights into the underlying light coupling mechanisms as in the grating coupling case. By treating each pixel as a resonator, one may be able to change the resonator's size and shape so that a different set of cavity eigen modes is created. The excitation of these eigen modes (and their superpositions if they are degenerate) by the incident light will determine the detector QE spectrum.","For example, to yield a broadband resonator, one approach is to construct an irregular resonator, with which a complex excitation spectrum can be generated. One can design a narrow band detector using a more regularly shaped resonator. In this case, the focus will be on designing a strong resonance in a particular wavelength.  shows an example of the resonator-QWIP design, which will be referred as the RS-QWIP. Specifically,  illustrates the Edistribution at the center plane of the QWIP active layer at incident wavelengths of 7.0, 8.0, 8.8 and 10.0 \u03bcm. The incident light is polarized along the diagonal of the pixel. The RS-QWIP contains 9 square rings with inner size of 2.4 \u03bcm\u00d72.4 \u03bcm and outer size of 5.4 \u03bcm\u00d75.4 \u03bcm and 0.62 \u03bcm in height that are made of GaAs. These ring resonators are fabricated on top of the 1.0 \u03bcm thick QWIP material with another 0.8 \u03bcm common contact layer. Their centers are 7.5 \u03bcm apart. All the top surfaces are covered with metal contact. The pixel size is 23 \u03bcm\u00d723 \u03bcm. The calculated spectrum has a large QE of 57% centered at 8.8 \u03bcm with a 0.6 \u03bcm bandwidth as shown in . These coupling characteristics are highly desirable for long wavelength detectors having a cutoff between 9-10 \u03bcm. Since this R-QWIP only needs a 1.0 \u25a1m-thick active material, it will have the same large gain as the typical grating QWIPs, but now with 10 times higher QE. At the same time, it can be operated at a bias lower than the C-QWIPs and thus more compatible with the usual readout circuits. If successfully demonstrated, this design will have an important impact on the QWIP technology.","To provide another example of optimized detector designs, the objective is to optimize the detector design for an array with 12-\u03bcm pixel pitch, and the detection is in the range of 8-9.2 \u03bcm. This pitch will be amenable for very high resolution imaging. The value of cc is assumed to be constant at 0.20 \u03bcm. For the RG-QWIP design, the pixel size is 10\u00d710 \u03bcm. In order to yield the first order diffraction peak at \u02dc8.7 \u03bcm, a grating period d=2.7 \u03bcm is first selected. With p=10 \u03bcm, a 4\u00d74 array of posts can be placed on top of the pixel. Other detector parameters, such as h=0.62 \u03bcm, t\u03bcm, and t\u03bcm are adjusted in the EM model to yield the largest QE possible within the detection range. We found that the QE spectrum and its magnitude are sensitively dependent on all of these parameters at the 0.02 \u03bcm level. The best result is shown in . With the proper choices of h, t, and t, a relatively constant QE with a peak value of 34% at 8.3 \u03bcM can be obtained in the detection range. This level of QE is similar to that in  despite the grating size is drastically reduced from 23 to 10 \u03bcm. This example shows the importance of proper grating design. Based on the same active layer thickness, the QE can be further increased by designing a more efficient resonant structure. For example, if the square post pattern of the grating is replaced by a single square ring with the dimension the same as that of  except h=0.54 \u03bcm instead of 0.62 \u03bcm, the QE can be increased to 46% at 8.7 \u03bcm as shown in . This example shows that EM modeling can open up to new detector designs.","A quantitative EM model in calculating QE of a QWIP pixel has been described, which provides an unambiguous answer to any detector geometry and thus it is highly versatile its accuracy and reliability, which has been verified through experiments and analytical classical solutions. Using this approach, one can now be able to ascertain the detector optical performance before construction. This approach not only yields the QE value but also gives the corresponding EM field distribution. This distribution can be used to determine the underlying coupling mechanism and thus is able to point to more efficient structures. The R-QWIP designed in this work is one example that may have significant advantages over the existing designs. In view of the fact that the R-QWIPs are designed with a computer using a few minutes of run time while the existing detectors are developed over the last two decades mostly through empirical means, the speed of achieving a better detector should be greatly accelerated in the future. It should be pointed out that the preferred embodiment designed R-QWIPs are only the first of the many possibilities that been investigated, and its structural parameter space has not been systematically explored. The current theoretical prediction should therefore be considered as the starting point and further improvement is expected. With the present approach, one can also incorporate other more complicated optical structures such as photonic crystals, plasmonic structures, nanomaterials, and meta-materials for QE enhancement. The EM model only requires the input of the appropriate optical constants of the constituent materials and the geometrical design. There are no obstacles in incorporating these and other optical effects into the detector modeling. In addition to advancing the infrared technology, the experimental effort on various optical structures will also shed light on these frontier optical effects and hence contributes to the advancement of basic sciences. The present research is by no means only relevant to QWIP research. By evaluating the total E field integral in Eqn. (1) instead of the Eintegral, one can apply the same formulism to detectors with isotropic absorption.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0184","num":"0183"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00013","num":"00013"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u03b7",{}],"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","msub":{"mi":"P","mn":"0"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mo":"\u222b","mi":"V"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":"\u2146","mrow":{"mi":"I","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mover":{"mi":"r","mo":"->"}}}}}}},"mo":","}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","msub":{"mi":"P","mn":"0"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mo":"\u222b","mi":"V"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"\u03b1","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":[{"mi":"I","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mover":{"mi":"r","mo":"->"}}},{"msup":{"mo":"\u2146","mn":"3"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"r"}]}}}},"mo":","}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"\u03b1","mrow":{"msubsup":[{"mi":"A","mn":"2","mrow":{"mi":"c","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":"\u025b","mn":"0"}}},{"mi":"E","mn":["0","2"]}],"mo":"\u2062"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mo":"\u222b","mi":"V"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"nc","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":"\u025b","mn":"0"}},"mn":"2"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["E","z"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mover":{"mi":"r","mo":"->"}}}},"mn":"2"},"mrow":{"msup":{"mo":"\u2146","mn":"3"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"r"}}}}},"mo":","}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":["n","\u03b1"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"msubsup":{"mi":"AE","mn":["0","2"]}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mo":"\u222b","mi":"V"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["E","z"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mover":{"mi":"r","mo":"->"}}}},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":{"msup":{"mo":"\u2146","mn":"3"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"r"},"mo":"."}}}}}}}]}}}},"Various resonating structures can then be designed to yield a large QE on thinner detector materials. These thinner materials will benefit all detector technologies especially for those with critical growth thicknesses and those with short carrier recombination lifetimes. To this end, the present advance in EM modeling may open a new chapter not only in the QWIP technology but also in other infrared technologies as well.","It is noted (from U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/543,121 that epoxy may be used between the detector and the other wafer. In order that the epoxy not reduce the absorption, a gold layer is utilized to isolate the epoxy from the sidewalls. The thickness of the gold layer may be as thin as 30 \u212b and may be as thick as 0.1 micron or more. Increasing the thickness of the layer beyond 0.1 micron provides no noticeable effect. Preferably, the gold layer has a thickness in the range of 500 \u212b to 1000 \u212b. When the gold layer is thin, R of the p-polarized light in  can be as low as 20%. A substantial amount of light in this case tunnels through the MgF\/Au layer and into the epoxy layer despite the incident angle is still larger than the critical angle. The small R is a case for the frustrated internal reflection. On the other hand, when the dielectric thickness is small, R reaches a minimum at \u03bb=0.54 \u03bcm due to the excitation of surface plasmon polaritons on the gold surfaces and is the case for the attenuated internal reflection. Between 0.7<\u03bb<15 \u03bcM, a small portion of the reflection is lost to ohmic heating in the metal. When \u03bb is near 16.2 \u03bcm, surface phonon polariton absorption along the dielectric\/gold interface is responsible for the R minimum. This surface effect is evident from the increased absorption at a small dielectric thickness.","It is further noted that a one-corrugation-per-pixel geometry may be adopted to increase the active detector volume and incorporate a composite cover layer to preserve the large sidewall reflectivity, which results in a large detector quantum efficiency. Also, the detector material structure may be optimized such as the final state energy, the doping density, and the number of quantum well periods to improve the FPA operation under the existing readout electronics. As a result, high FPA sensitivity has been achieved, having characteristics in agreement with the detector model. Based on this model, a systematic analysis on the FPA performance was performed with a wide range of detector and system parameters. C-QWIP FPAs are capable of high speed imaging especially for those with longer cutoff wavelengths.","Possible uses for the present invention include a number of focal plane array (FPA) cameras containing 1024\u00d71024 pixels with uses including detecting unmanned aerial vehicles, ballistic missile intercept observations, thermal imaging infrared sensors that requires broadband infrared detectors, night vision, infrared astronomy, natural resources exploration, industrial quality control, and medical imaging. C-QWIP coupling is also suitable for multi-color detection due to its wavelength-independent light coupling mechanism. As in the case of C-QWIPs, the resonantly enhanced QWIP FPAs may incorporate an epoxy backfill as it is necessary in mating the detector array to the supporting electronic readout circuits. FPAs can also be made into larger formats such as 4 megapixels or 16 megapixels and into two- or multi-color FPAs. Applications include night vision, all weather navigation, infrared astronomy, space exploration, earth resources exploration, environmental protection, geological survey, homeland security, industrial quality control, maintenance and diagnostics, and medical imaging etc. The preferred embodiment increases the quantum efficiency because of the resonance effect for improved performance.","Resonantly enhanced QWIP focal plane arrays (FPAs) are relatively inexpensive due to the standard batch processing, higher in sensitive due to efficient broadband light coupling, and higher in definition due to the smaller pixel size in pixel geometry.","Epoxy Backfill","As reported in U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/543,121, the C-QWIP detector is subject to adverse effects from its surroundings. Any material that comes into contact with the detector surfaces will change the sidewall reflectivity and thus the quantum efficiency (QE). In order to achieve high performance irrespective to the production process, a designated cover layer for sidewall encapsulation was invented as described in U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/543,121 and K. K. Choi, D. P. Forrai, D. W. Endres and J. Sun, IEEE J. Quant. Elect. vol. 45, No. 10, pp. 1255-1264 (2009), hereby incorporated by reference. The high reflectivity of the invented layer will ensure the high QE of the C-QWIP arrays, while the low leakage of the MgFlayer will not increase the detector dark current. The high plasmon energy of gold and the low optical phonon energy of MgFprovide a large wavelength window for high reflectivity of the film. The deposition of the MgF\/Au film is simple, fast and economical, which will not add cost to the array production.","To evaluate the effects of the epoxy materials, which can have a wide range of infrared absorption properties, the sidewall reflectivity is calculated as a function of the complex refractive index of the epoxy N=n+ik, where n is the real part of the refractive index and k is the extinction coefficient. While the typical n for epoxy is 1.5, k can vary within a wide range of values depending on the types of epoxy. For generality, FIG. 4 in U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/543,121 shows the calculated sidewall reflectivity R as a function of the extinction coefficient k. R can reduce from 100% to 25% at certain k for the p-polarized light, the polarization component that is responsible for C-QWIP infrared absorption. Therefore, the presence of epoxy can reduce the sidewall reflection by a factor of 4.","In the foregoing, electromagnetic field modeling was applied to calculate the external quantum efficiency of various QWIP pixel geometries with thinned substrates. It was found that for a 24\u00d724\u00d71.5 microncross grating-QWIP, the QE is peaked at 13.0, 11.0 and 8.4 microns, insensitive to the grating periods. These peaks are identified as the first three harmonic resonances associated with the pixel resonant cavity. For a material absorption coefficient of 0.15 \u03bcm, the corresponding QEs are 10.2, 12.2, and 3.6%, respectively. For a regular prism-shaped corrugated-QWIP with a 25 micron pitch, the QE oscillates about its classical value of 24.5% within the calculated wavelength range from 3 to 15 microns. A peaked value of 32% occurs at 9.1 microns. For pyramidal C-QWIPs, the maximum QE is 42% and for cone-shaped C-QWIPs, it is 35%. In the presence of an anti-reflection coating, the oscillation amplitude diminishes and the average values generally rise to near the peaks of the oscillations. The modeling results were compared with the experimental data for grating-QWIP FPAs and prism-shaped C-QWIP FPAs, and satisfactory agreements were achieved for both. After verifying this EM approach, other detector geometries were explored and a new type of resonator-QWIPs (R-QWIPs) was found that can provide 30% QE at certain wavelengths. The R-QWIPs only need a 1.5 \u03bcm thick active material and therefore have the same advantages as other thin layer detectors. Combining the high QE of a resonator and the high gain of a thin material layer, the new R-QWIPs will provide a conversion efficiency far higher than conventional QWIP detectors. The principles of this resonator approach may also be used with other detector technologies.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0193","num":"0192"},"figref":"FIG. 38"},"STEP \u2014Specify the detector material structure.","STEP \u2014Calculate Eigen functions & Eigen energies of material structure using quantum mechanics.","STEP \u2014Calculate absorption coefficient of material based on step .","STEP \u2014Design the detector physical geometry and construct computer aided design drawing using a computer aided design program such as COMSOL.","STEP \u2014Input parameters for all materials used in the EM model.","STEP \u2014Define material properties of all geometrical objects.","STEP \u2014Define physical relations among all geometrical boundaries.","STEP \u2014Define density of nodes for numerical computation.","STEP \u2014Define EM wave incident condition.","STEP \u2014Define numerical solver.","STEP \u2014Based on the output Edistribution, compute Eq.
