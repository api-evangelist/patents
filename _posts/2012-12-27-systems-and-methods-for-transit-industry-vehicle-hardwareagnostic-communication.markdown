Many TIVs have monitors that keep track of, and set, the status of such systems. A familiar technology solution is to have various inputs and outputs from the systems provided to a vehicle logic unit (VLU), such VLU remains on the vehicle in normal operation. Operators of the TIV often then interact with the VLU (and its data) via a mobile data terminal (MDT).","MDTs are continuously evolving and are varied, across hardware manufacturers and the transit agencies that purchase and deploy those MDTs in their fleets. As with other, general purpose, computing devices, the trend is for MDTs to become smaller, more powerful and flexible, and to communicate in many different ways.","VLUs, although typically less dynamic than MDTs, are also continuously evolving and frequently interact with newer systems, more systems, and different inputs\/outputs for those systems.","While VLUs typically reside and remain on vehicles until they are replaced, it may be desirable for MDTs to be removed from the TIV, for example by the operator, and employed on another TIV at a later time. Each VLU may thus interact with multiple MDTs, and the reverse.","Unfortunately, the applications running on these varied and evolving MDTs and VLUs have historically needed to be continuously changed\u2014both to operate on the devices, to communicate with each other, and to communicate with the systems on a TIV. This is undesirable, time-consuming, and expensive.","There thus remains a need for hardware-agnostic mobile data terminal communication.","There is a method for hardware-agnostic communication between one or more mobile data terminals (MDT) used for monitoring and controlling one or more TIV inputs or outputs (TIVIO) of transit industry vehicles, and one or more vehicle logic units (VLU) located on transit industry vehicles (TIV), that are capable of communicating with one or more TIVIO, comprising requesting, by an MDT application executed by a processor on a first MDT, communication with a first VLU on a first TIV, accepting, by a VLU application executed by a processor on the first VLU, the request to communicate from the first MDT, providing, by the VLU application executed by a processor on the first VLU, a first abstraction interface to the first MDT, processing, by the MDT application executed by a processor on the first MDT, the provided abstraction interface, and monitoring, by the MDT application executed by a processor on the first MDT, the first TIV.","The abstraction interface may comprise an XML file having one or more components, each component representative of one of one or more TIVIO of the first TIV and the processing may further comprise receiving the XML file, determining the first VLU's components, and adjusting an application on the first MDT, responsive to the results of determining.","The adjusting may further comprise adding, to a monitoring screen of the application, a user interface element for each one or more TIVIO that can be monitored by the first MDT, inserting, on a controlling screen of the application, a user interface element for each one or more TIVIO that can be controlled by the first MDT.","The accepting may further comprise granting an access level to the first MDT and the one or more components that can be monitored and the one or more components that can be controlled are based on the access level granted.","The providing may further comprise polling the TIV for TIVIO on the TIV, inserting a component into the XML file for each TIVIO on the TIV, and obtaining one or more TIVIO values for each component having at least one value.","The method may further comprise selecting a first MDT from one or more MDT hardware platforms, such hardware platforms comprising Blackberry\u2122, Android\u2122 or iPhone\u2122 smartphones and Windows\u2122 and iOS\u2122 computing devices.","There is further provided a method for hardware-agnostic communication between one or more mobile data terminals (MDT) used for monitoring and controlling one or more TIV inputs or outputs (TIVIO) of transit industry vehicles, and one or more vehicle logic units (VLU) located on transit industry vehicles (TIV), that are capable of communicating with one or more TIVIO, comprising requesting, by an MDT application executed by a processor on an MDT, communication with a VLU on a TIV, accepting, by a VLU application executed by a processor on the VLU, the request to communicate from the MDT, providing, by the VLU application executed by a processor on the VLU, an abstraction interface to the MDT, processing, by the MDT application executed by a processor on the MDT, the provided abstraction interface, and monitoring, by the MDT application executed by a processor on the MDT, the TIV.","The requesting, processing and monitoring may be done by a first MDT and the accepting and providing may be done by a first VLU.","The requesting, processing and monitoring may be done concurrently by a first MDT and a second MDT communicating with a first VLU, and the accepting and providing may be done by the first VLU.","The requesting, processing and monitoring may be done by a first MDT communicating with a first VLU and a second VLU, and the accepting and providing may both be done by both the first VLU and the second VLU.","There is further a system for hardware-agnostic communication between one or more mobile data terminals (MDT) used for monitoring and controlling one or more TIV inputs or outputs (TIVIO) of transit industry vehicles (TIV), and one or more vehicle logic units (VLU) located on TIVs, that are capable of communicating with one or more TIVIO, comprising a vehicle logic unit (VLU), further comprising one or more TIVIO jacks connected to one or more TIVIO, a VLU application, configured to poll the TIV for its one or more TIVIO and TIVIO values for each polled TIVIO and create an abstraction interface for communicating the TIVIO and TIVIO values to one or more MDTs upon receiving a communication request.","The system may further comprise one or more MDTs, further comprising an MDT application, configured to request communication with one or more VLUs, receive one or more abstraction interfaces from the one or more VLUs, processing the one or more abstraction interfaces, and monitoring the one or more TIVs.

TIV  may include buses, para-transit vehicles, maintenance vehicles, supervisory vehicles (such as cars or vans driven by supervisors) or a light rail\/TRAM vehicles. TIV  has many systems running thereon, as known in the art, such as engines, brakes, audio announcement technology, signage, passenger counting, and the like (each a \u201cTIV System\u201d, not shown).","Vehicle  includes TIVs  but also includes vehicles operated by anyone that may have an MDT . Exemplary vehicles may include police, emergency, and vehicles driven by operators (such as prior to or after a run, route or service.","Control center may be at a transit agency, and may have further systems that form part of the overall system enabling one or more forms of transportation for a transit agency. Control center may be considered an MDT , despite possibly having greater systems as well.","Vehicle  and control center may have MDTs  that are not physically connected to TIV . As such MDTs  are able to communicate wirelessly, as is WVLU , they may still perform control and monitoring functions for TIV .","MDT  is a computing device that may take user input (such as keystrokes, clicks, touch inputs, and the like) and provides the user interface to functionality relating to the provision of transit services. MDT  may often be located on TIV , but may be removable therefrom. Exemplary MDTs  include mobile phones, tablets, laptops (that may be running Windows\u2122 or iOS\u2122 operating systems, for example), ruggedized laptops, vendor specific MDTs (such as Android\u2122. Blackberry\u2122 or Apple\u2122 products). Each of these combinations of vendor and product type (laptop versus smartphone for example) may be considered a hardware platform for MDT  and each of these hardware platforms may be able to communicate and function with any VLU  using the abstraction interface. Operators of TIV , or supervisors, may be some of the primary users of MDTs .","VLU  is an embedded computing device in TIV  that communicates with VAN , one or more TIV IO , and MDT . Communication by VLU  may be via wireless or wired communication (such as via a serial port and\/or VGA connection), but has typically been wired between VLU  and MDT . An exemplary VLU is Trapeze's IVLU\u2122.","Wireless Vehicle Logic Unit (WVLU) is a type of VLU . WVLU is a computing device that communicates with one or more TIV I\/O , router  (which may be a VAN , or part of a VAN ) and further communicates with one or more MDTs  (optionally via VAN ). As such WVLU  may be referred to interchangeably herein as mobile platform . Communication between WVLU  and TIV I\/O  may be to read values from systems, or set values in systems. As described herein, exemplary communication may include reading a longitude and latitude from a GPS receiver, or to enable a passenger counting system to start counting passenger entries and exits. As described herein, exemplary communication between WVLU  and MDT  may include requesting information (by MDT  of one or more TIV I\/O ) or setting parameters or values in systems or WVLU  itself. TIV I\/O  may be plugged into \u201cjacks\u201d (not shown) on VLU . Each jack may be implemented using different hardware to accommodate different TIV I\/O , as would be known to those of skill in the art.","Communication between WVLU  and TIV I\/O , and between WVLU and MDT , may be wired (such as Ethernet, RS232 and the like) or wireless (such as infrared, Bluetooth\u2122, WLAN, cellular, and the like) and may be via VAN and\/or router . WVLU  communication may be accomplished via an abstraction interface, such as a REST interface, as described herein.","TIV IO  may be any inputs and\/or outputs that communicate with, or form part of, any systems that are part of, or incorporated with, TIV . TIV IO  are able to communicate with other systems and\/or computing devices, such as via wired or wireless communication paths or communication networks. TIV IO  may be wired into a VLU  or may communicate wirelessly to one or more VLU (WVLU ). Exemplary TIV IO  may include an odometer, GPS, modem (for TDMA or CDMA communications), engine controllers, automated passenger counters (APC), American Disability Act (ADA) signs and head signs, fare collection systems, traffic signal priority (TSP) systems, audio and video systems, or discrete inputs (that may or may not be part of one or more of the above TIV IO). Discrete inputs may require an \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d signal, such as limit switches, selector switches or relay contacts. TIV IO  may have values (numeric, discrete, etc) that may be polled by VLU  and may be set by VLU  (such as via MDT ).","Communication network  may be substantially any public or private network, wired or wireless, and may be substantially comprised of one or more networks that may be able to facilitate communication between themselves. VAN may be a form of communication network that exists on a vehicle. Other than being geographically restricted (as it may extend only a certain distance from where a vehicle may be at a particular time), VAN may be substantially similar to communication network . Router  may form part of VAN and may allow WVLU to communicate with it, so that communication can then continue. For example, router  may be a 4G router such that WVLU may then communicate as widely as any cellular device, including to control center or vehicle .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["22","208","214","210","14","14","202","204","212","206"],"i":"a "},"The term REST refers to REpresentational State Transfer, a type of software architecture for distributed systems, as known by those of skill in the art. REST allows remote procedure calls (RPC) via a web service interface from a WLAN, LAN or local connection between a client end point (such as MDT  in embodiments of the present invention) and a host mobile platform (such as VLU  or WVLU in embodiments of the present invention).","The REST interface, as contemplated in aspects of the present invention, comprises three parts, REST-H , which resides on VLU  and REST-C , which resides on one or more MDT , and REST client server interface (or abstraction client server interface or abstraction interface) (REST CSI) . REST-H  may act as a web server, allowing one or more REST-C connections to communicate with VLU , such as via TCP\/IP. REST-C  interacts with REST-H to communicate information between MDT  and VLU . With REST-H  on VLU  or WVLU , any MDT (with any underlying hardware, software or operating system) can communicate with WVLU \u2014providing REST-C  is present. As such (and because WVLU can accommodate multiple sessions), multiple MDTs  (such as , , and ) can all communicate with a particular WVLU ","REST CSI  facilitates and provides formatting and structure for communications within system . REST CSI  may be one or more files, data streams, or communications exchanged at various times or intervals between REST-C and REST-H. REST CSI  may be used to provide a standardized \u201cdata stream\u201d to provide communications (for example asynchronous communication) between MDT  and VLU . The file may be created and the entries may be populated with current status and\/or command information. Typically VLU  may create the file once and then update the data entries on a predetermined duty cycle, for example twice per second, and broadcast this at that same rate. This broadcast may allow one or more MDTs , that are interested, to receive REST IM  and use its contents to perform various functions. When MDT  issues a command to VLU , it may create an XML file for that transaction\/command, for example to display text data to an ADA sign inside TIV .","REST CSI  may be implemented, for example, via one or more XML interfaces\/files.

This may be determined, for example, by knowing what MDT  is making the request (such as by an MDT  identifier being provided, and VLU  determining whether it is valid), by receiving a user name and password from MDT , or other approaches as would be known to those of skill in the art.","Of course, it is to be understood that different MDTs  may have different access levels. For example, some may be able to read and write TIV IO  values. Others may only be able to read such values. Such abilities may relate to the user of MDT , for example, where a rider of TIV  may be allowed to read simple values (such as a GPS location), while operators of TIV , transit supervisors, or emergency crews may have different abilities. Other different access levels, or motivations therefore, are within the scope of the present invention.","If communication is rejected at  then method  may end.","If communication is accepted at  then method  continues at  where an interface may be provided to MDT  by VLU . This may substantially comprise, for example, VLU  providing REST IM  to MDT .","At  MDT  receives the interface and processes the interface. Processing may involve reading the interface to determine characteristics and information about VLU . For example, processing may include determining TIV IO  associated with VLU , determining attributes of TIV , and obtaining other features of VLU .","Processing may also involve \u201csetting up\u201d MDT  to an initial state\u2014such as a state that an operator may desire to be in prior to starting a run in TIV . This may involve reading certain values from TIV IO  so that MDT  can present an initial state to a user of MDT . This may further involve adding or removing user interface elements for monitoring or controlling the TIV IO  that are possible given the combination of the particular TIV  and user of MDT . User interface elements (not shown) may include text boxes, toggles, slides or bars, or other features as are known in the art to view and set parameters of software applications.","Determining such features and characteristics, or other processing at , may result in configuration changes to MDT  (and in particular MDT-A ) at . For example, if TIV  does not have a passenger counter system, then MDT-A  may disable or remove the feature that would allow a user of MDT-A  to query for the passenger count. Of course other adjustments to MDT-A  may occur, for example to match the route, driver, date, and other aspects of the present circumstance in which the particular MDT  is communicating with the particular VLU .","Method  proceeds to  where both MDT  and VLU  may wait for operational communication, as such operational communication is described herein.","It will be apparent to one of skill in the art that other configurations, hardware etc may be used in any of the foregoing embodiments of the products, methods, and systems of this invention. It will be understood that the specification is illustrative of the present invention and that other embodiments within the spirit and scope of the invention will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art.
