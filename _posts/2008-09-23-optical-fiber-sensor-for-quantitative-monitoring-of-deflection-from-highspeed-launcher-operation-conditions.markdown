title: Optical fiber sensor for quantitative monitoring of deflection from high-speed launcher operation conditions
abstract: A measurement system is provided to monitor a launcher assembly along a path along which to accelerate a projectile. This system includes an optical sensor, a light emitter, a light detector and a signal analyzer. The sensor is continuously disposed on (or integrated to) the assembly at a position on the path and has initial and terminus ends. The light emitter transmits an optical signal from the initial end. The light detector receives the optical signal from either the initial or terminus ends. The signal analyzer compares the optical signal from the detector to a quantifiable deflection of the assembly launcher. The signal analyzer issues an alarm indication in response to the quantifiable deflection exceeds a hazard-condition threshold. The sensor may be positioned either substantially parallel to or transverse at discrete points along the path and be disposed longitudinally along and/or wrapped helically around the launcher barrel.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy, and thus, the invention herein may be manufactured, used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates generally to monitoring systems for electromagnetic launcher axial components, and more particularly to such configurations that preferably can provide continuous condition measurements of launcher barrels from launching a projectile at high speed. Such conditions for measuring include dynamic deformation, temperature, strain and humidity.","An electromagnetic launcher (e.g., barrel accelerator) utilizes electromagnetic force to propel an electrically conductive payload. Electrically conductive rails may be disposed in a longitudinal launch direction from breech to muzzle ends of the launcher. Electric current flowing through the rails induces a magnetic field that produces a mutual repulsion Lorenz force between the rails and accelerates the payload (armature and projectile) along at least one of the rails. The armature pushes the projectile for release through the muzzle.","Laboratory railguns have demonstrated launch velocities of over 2 km\/s, considerably above those normally achieved in conventional propellant guns. Such velocities enable both increased range and elimination of energetic materials for propulsion. Physical and design constraints limit launch speeds and rail performance after firing multiple loads without structural or operational failure, which often necessitates post-mortem investigation of system fragments that have suffered damage from the intended operation.","Experiments with various high-speed accelerators reveal existence of critical speeds causing group resonance with significant localized bending and buckling in barrels. These result in high tensile stress, creation of gouges, pits and cracks along rails, delamination of insulators, possible arc generation with high localized temperatures.","Ideal sensors to monitor deformation and temperature should survive harsh field environment and to be immune to strong electromagnetic fields. Sensors should have high sampling rate, reasonably wide strain range, reasonably high resolution, short acquisition time, and several channels to duplicate data (in the case if one of the channels or one fiber fails). Sensors are often divided into two groups: (1) Point sensors such as Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, traditional foil strain gauges and accelerometers that can be used as point sensors for localized measurements and structural health monitoring.","These sensors are normally installed in \u201csuspicious\u201d or \u201cbest guess\u201d points. Longer barrel structures may employ many (from ten to one-hundred) point sensors to collect data along the whole length or area of a larger structure, which can be cost prohibitive. (2) Continuous distributed full-length or full-area sensors include embedded or wrapped continuous optical fibers to be used for the measurements and structural health monitoring of the whole structure. In the current invention the preferred embodiment is distributed optical fiber sensors.","Conventional barrel condition monitoring yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In contrast, various exemplary embodiments introduce fiber optic sensors into components for a launcher to monitor structural response to dynamic loading, including buckling and induced temperature (from frictional heating). Consequently, the launcher rails can be repaired and\/or replaced prior to onset of damage that can degrade acceleration performance of a payload. The operational life of the rails and launcher may be significantly extended thereby.","Additionally, continuous monitoring of strain and temperature of the launcher enables detection of excessive deformation and\/or temperature levels, thereby serving as a diagnostic tool with which to interrupt operation to avoid serious damage. In particular, the launcher provided for accelerating a projectile from an initial speed at a breech end to a launch speed at a muzzle end includes an electrically conductive rail equipped with fiber optic cable or fiber optic ribbon (an array of several parallel fibers encased in a matrix polymer) to measure transverse loads.","Various exemplary embodiments provide a system and a method for monitoring barrel deflection. This measurement system may be used to monitor a launcher assembly along a path along which to accelerate a projectile. This system includes an optical sensor, a light emitter, a light detector and a signal analyzer. The optical sensor is disposed in the barrel assembly at a position on the path and has initial and terminus ends.","The light emitter transmits an optical signal from the initial end. The light detector receives the optical signal from either the initial or terminus ends. The signal analyzer compares the optical signal from the detector to a quantifiable deformation and temperature in the barrel. For example, the signal analyzer may issue an alarm indication in response to a detectable deflection exceeding a hazard-condition threshold. The optical sensor preferably includes long multi-mode or single-mode fiber, or long fiber Bragg grating between the initial and terminus ends. The fiber may be disposed along or wrapped (in helical fashion) around the length of the critical barrel components.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention.

Multimode fibers are designed for short distance use; the higher attenuation at 850-nm is offset by the use of more affordable optical sources (the lower the wavelength, the less expensive the optics).

Alternate configurations can be envisioned by disposing the additional point sensors substantially at distinct locations. The system provides a foundation  to support a rail  onto which is disposed a fiber optic sensor  to measure rail deflection (and installed in a manner to avoid interference with the armature and\/or its payload to be accelerated) for example, in grooves cut into the supporting insulator.","For an open-loop configuration, a light emitter  (such as a laser) and a detector  are respectively disposed at initial and terminal ends of the fiber optic sensor . The emitter  transmits an optical signal  that travels along the fibers and received by the detector . Depending on the magnitude of transverse deflection of barrel components caused by the moving load and temperature, the fibers may also deform. In a preferred embodiment of the structural monitoring system, an analyzer  compares the received signal from the detector  against corresponding deflection conditions, as optionally stored in a database , and issues a warning indication in response to deflection that exceeds an acceptable threshold.","Microbending and macrobending represent the most common forms of deformation in fibers. Microbends are microscopic distortions along the length of a fiber, typically caused by pinching or squeezing the fiber (by adjacent surfaces of the barrel components). Microbends deform the fiber's core slightly, causing light to escape at these deflections. In single-mode fiber, microbending is wavelength-dependant, with microbend sensitivity increasing as you move to higher wavelengths like 1550-nm, and especially 1625-nm. In multimode fiber, microbend sensitivity is relatively constant across the wavelength spectrum, so that 50 \u03bcm multimode fiber has more microbend sensitivity than 62.5 \u03bcm fiber due to its smaller core diameter.","Macrobending occurs when a fiber is bent (i.e., transversely deflected) in a tight radius. The bend curvature creates an angle too sharp for the light to be reflected back into the core, and some of the light escapes through the fiber cladding, causing attenuation. This optical power loss increases rapidly as the radius decreases to an inch or less. Both macrobending and microbending induce localized strain in the fiber. This bending strain affects the refractive index and the critical angle of the light ray in that specific area.","Consequently, light traveling in the core refracts out, causing attenuation or reduction of optical signal. With the use of the common Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR), the macrobending and microbending signals are distinguished from each other and thus indicate location and type of bending along the length of the fiber. Major localized bending and buckling in the structural components of the launcher barrel can be examined from the OTDR image along the fiber length. In a number of applications including high electric-power launchers, presence of water in barrels or excessive humidity present operational hazards.","In addition to the deformation induced by loads and temperature, optical fibers sense presence of water molecules that degrade their material forming OH (hydroxyl radical) groups. In glass fibers, at the 950-nm, 1380-nm, and 2730-nm wavelengths, the presence of hydroxyl radicals causes substantial increase in attenuation. Exposure of fibers to water molecules for extended duration forms the hydroxyl (OH) ions that affect signal attenuation. Existing detection methods also include Rayleigh scattering (i.e., the scattering of light energy as it passes through the core of a fiber strand) due to the light wave electrons colliding with non-glass molecules, usually water.","In an addition embodiment, the signal analyzer uses Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD) caused by asymmetric distortions to the fiber from a perfect cylindrical geometry. At high bit rates, typically exceeding 5 Gbps, the PMD can be used to sense mechanical stress exerted upon the fiber due to extrinsically induced bends and contact forces. Single-mode optical fiber supports one fundamental mode, which consists of two orthogonal polarization modes. This asymmetry introduces small refractive index differences for the two polarization states known as birefringence that causes one polarization mode to travel faster than the other, resulting in a difference in the propagation time, called the differential group delay (DGD). This unit of DGD describes PMD, and DGD is typically measured in picoseconds.","A fiber that acquires birefringence causes a propagating pulse to lose the balance between the polarization components. This leads to different polarization components traveling at different velocities, creating a pulse spread. Other types of signal analysis, including more than one laser and loop configuration of the fiber sensors, can be used to monitor load induced and temperature induced deformations in high-speed launchers.","Such systems and methods enable real-time analysis of deflection during operation to accelerate the armature and projectile, rather than conduct diagnostic post-operation autopsy from expended materials that remain post-test. Thus, such arrangements enable more complete information to be obtained about test operations on accelerators and launchers to thereby facilitate analysis for developing mitigation techniques to reduce transverse deflection and resultant damage to the launcher's structure.","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art.
