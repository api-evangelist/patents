Head mounted displays with angled single partial reflecting beam splitter plates are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,969,714. While this approach provides excellent uniformity of brightness and color over the displayed field of view, the optical system is relatively thick due to the angled beam splitter plate.","Head mounted displays with arrays of partially reflecting surfaces to provide a thinner optical system are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,829,095 and 7,724,441 and shown in  wherein the array of partially reflecting surfaces  is used to provide image light  over a display field of view enabling a user to view displayed images combined with a view of the environment in front of the user. The image light  viewed by the user is comprised of the combined reflected light from each of the multiple partially reflecting surfaces . The light from the image source  has to pass through the multiple partially reflecting surfaces  where a portion of the light  is reflected toward the user's eye thereby providing image light . To provide a uniform image over the display field of view, the reflection characteristics of the partially reflecting surfaces  must be precisely controlled. The reflectivity of the partially reflective surfaces  must be lowest for surfaces that are closest to the image source and highest for surfaces that are farthest from the image source. Generally the reflectivity of the partially reflective surfaces  must increase linearly in relation to the distance from the image source. This presents a manufacturing and cost problem as the reflectivity of each partially reflective surface  is different from the neighboring surfaces and the reflectivity of each surface must be tightly controlled. As such, providing an image that is of uniform brightness and color over the entire display field of view is difficult with an array of partially reflective surfaces.","Alternately a diffractive grating is used to redirect the image light into and out of a waveguide to the display field of view as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,711,512. However, diffraction gratings are costly and subject to color aberrations.","Therefore, the need persists for a relatively thin optical system for a head mounted display that also provides good image uniformity of brightness and color overt the display field of view.","This disclosure also concerns a compact and lightweight frontlight that includes a wire grid polarizer film as a partially reflective surface to deflect the illumination light downwards to the reflective image source.","In a display with a reflective image source and a frontlight as shown in , illumination light  passes from an edge light source  and is deflected by the frontlight  to illuminate the reflective image source . The illumination light  then reflects from the reflective image source  turning into image light  which then passes back through the frontlight  and into the display optics. As such, the frontlight  simultaneously deflects illumination light  entering from the edge light source  and allows reflected image light  to pass through without being deflected so it can pass into the display optics, where the display optics can be dispersive when the display is a flat screen display or refractive or diffractive when the display is a near eye display. In this embodiment, the display optics may include diffusers.","For a reflective image source such as a liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) image source, the illumination light is polarized and the reflective image source includes a quarter wave retardation film that changes the polarization state during the reflection from the reflective image source. A polarizer is then included in the display optics which causes the polarization effects imparted by the liquid crystal to form an image as the image light passes through the display optics.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,163,330 describes a series of frontlights which include grooves in the upper surface of the frontlight to deflect light from the edge light source down to the reflective image source along with flat sections between the grooves to allow the reflected image light to pass into the display optics.  shows an illustration of the frontlight  with the grooves  and the flat sections . The illumination light  from the edge light source , reflects from the grooves  and is deflected downwards to illuminate the reflective image source . The image light  reflects from the reflective image source  and passes through the flat sections  of the frontlight . Linear and curved grooves  are described. However, for the grooves  to effectively deflect the illumination light , the grooves  must occupy a substantial area of the frontlight thereby limiting the area of the flat sections  and degrading the image quality provided to the display optics due to light scatter from the grooves as it passes back through the frontlight. Frontlights  are typically formed from a solid plate of material and as such can be relatively heavy.","In U.S. Pat. No. 7,545,571, a wearable display system is presented which includes a reflective image source  with a polarizing beam splitter  as a frontlight to deflect and polarize illumination light  supplied by an edge light source  onto the reflective image source  as shown in . The polarizing beam splitter  is an angled plane in a solid block with a separate curved reflector  associated with the edge light source . The curved reflector  can be a total internal reflection block  that is connected to the polarizing beam splitter . As such, the frontlight disclosed in this patent with the solid block of the polarizing beam splitter and the total internal reflection block provides a frontlight that is bulky and relatively heavy. Further,  also shows image light rays .","There remains a need to provide a frontlight for displays with reflective image sources that provides good image quality with little scattered light and is also compact and light in weight.","The disclosure also pertains to optically flat surfaces produced with optical films. More particularly, the disclosure provides a method for making an optically flat beam splitter using an optical film.","Optical films can be obtained for a variety of purposes including: beam splitters, polarizing beam splitters, holographic reflectors and mirrors. In imaging applications and particularly in reflective imaging applications, it is important to provide that the optical film be very flat to preserve the wavefront of the image. Some optical films are available with pressure sensitive adhesive on one side to allow the optical films to be attached to a substrate for structural support and to aid in keeping the optical film flat. However, optical films attached to substrates in this manner tend to have surfaces with small-scale undulations and pock marks known orange peel that prevent the surface from reaching optical flatness and as a result, reflected images are degraded.","In United States Patent Application 20090052030 a method for producing an optical film is provided wherein the optical film is a wire grid polarizer. However, techniques for providing the film with optical flatness are not provided.","In U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,537,739 and 4,643,789, methods are provided for attaching artwork to molded structures using a strip to carry the artwork to the mold. However, these methods do not anticipate the special requirements for optical films.","In United States Patent Application 20090261490 a method is provided for making simple optical articles is provided which includes optical films and molding. The method is directed at curved surfaces generated as the method includes limits between the ratio of the radius of curvature to the diameter to avoid wrinkles in the film due to deforming of the film during molding. The special requirements for producing an optically flat surface with an optical film are not addressed.","In U.S. Pat. No. 7,820,081, a method is provided for lamination of a functional film to a lens. The method uses a thermally cured adhesive to adhere a functional film to a lens. However, this process includes thermoforming the optical film while the lens is hot so that the optical film, the adhesive and the lens are deformed together during the bonding process. As such this method is not suited to making optically flat surfaces.","Therefore the need persists for a method to use optical films such that surfaces including optical films can be provided with optical flatness.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may include an internal software application running on an integrated multimedia computing facility that has been adapted for 3D augmented reality (AR) content display and interaction with the eyepiece. 3D AR software applications may be developed in conjunction with mobile applications and provided through application store(s), or as stand-alone applications specifically targeting the eyepiece as the end-use platform and through a dedicated 3D AR eyepiece store. Internal software applications may interface with inputs and output facilities provided by the eyepiece through facilities internal and external to the eyepiece, such as initiated from the surrounding environment, sensing devices, user action capture devices, internal processing facilities, internal multimedia processing facilities, other internal applications, camera, sensors, microphone, through a transceiver, through a tactile interface, from external computing facilities, external applications, event and\/or data feeds, external devices, third parties, and the like. Command and control modes operating in conjunction with the eyepiece may be initiated by sensing inputs through input devices, user action, external device interaction, reception of events and\/or data feeds, internal application execution, external application execution, and the like. In embodiments, there may be a series of steps included in the execution control as provided through the internal software application, including at least combinations of two of the following: events and\/or data feeds, sensing inputs and\/or sensing devices, user action capture inputs and\/or outputs, user movements and\/or actions for controlling and\/or initiating commands, command and\/or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs may be reflected, applications on the platform that may use commands to respond to inputs, communications and\/or connection from the on-platform interface to external systems and\/or devices, external devices, external applications, feedback to the user (such as related to external devices, external applications), and the like.","The disclosure also provides a method for providing a relatively thin optical system that provides an image with improved uniformity of brightness and color over the display field of view. The disclosure includes an integral array of narrow switchable mirrors over the display area, to provide a display field of view wherein the switchable mirrors are used sequentially to reflect portions of the light from an image source to present sequential portions of an image to a user. By rapidly switching the narrow switchable mirrors from transparent to reflective in a repeating sequence, the user perceives the portions of the image to be combined into the entire image as presented by the image source. Provided that each of the narrow switchable mirrors is switched at 60 Hz or greater, the user does not perceive flicker in portions of the image.","Various embodiments of the array of narrow switchable mirrors are presented. In one embodiment, the switchable mirrors are liquid crystal switchable mirrors. In another embodiment the switchable mirrors are moveable prism elements, which use an air gap to provide a switchable total internal reflective mirror.","In an alternate embodiment, not all the switchable mirrors are used in the sequence, instead the switchable mirrors are used in a selected group that varies based on the eye spacing of the user","The present disclosure further provides a compact and light weight frontlight that includes a wire grid polarizer film as a partially reflective surface to deflect the illumination light downwards to the reflective image source. The edge light source is polarized and the wire grid polarizer is oriented such that the illumination light is reflected and the image light is allowed to pass through to the display optics. By using a wire grid polarizer film that is flexible, the disclosure provides a partially reflective surface that can be curved to focus the illumination light onto the reflective image source thereby increasing efficiency and increasing uniformity of image brightness. The wire grid polarizer also has very low light scattering as the image light passes through the frontlight on the way to the display optics, so image quality is preserved. In addition, since the partially reflective surface is a wire grid polarizer film, the majority of the frontlight is comprised of air and as such the frontlight is much lighter in weight.","This disclosure further provides methods for producing surfaces with optical flatness when using an optical film. In embodiments of the disclosure the optical film can comprise a beam splitter, a polarizing beam splitter, a wire grid polarizer, a mirror, a partial mirror or a holographic film. The advantage provided by the disclosure is that the surface of the optical film is optically flat so that the wavefront of the light is preserved to provide improved image quality.","In some embodiments, the disclosure provides an image display system including an optically flat optical film. The optically flat optical film includes a substrate to hold the optical film optically flat in a display module housing with an image source and a viewing location. Wherein the image provided by the image source is reflected from the optical film to the viewing location and the substrate with the optical film is replaceable within the display module housing.","In other embodiments of the disclosure, the optical film is attached to a molded structure so the optical film is part of the display module housing.","In a prior art display  with a reflective image source  and a solid beam splitter cube frontlight  as shown in , light  passes from an light source  into a diffuser  where it is made more uniform to provide illumination light . The illumination light  is redirected by a partially reflective layer  to thereby illuminate the reflective image source . The illumination light  then reflects from the reflective image source  turning into image light  which then passes back through the partially reflective layer  and into the associated imaging optics (not shown) which present the image to a viewer. As such, the solid beam splitter cube  simultaneously redirects illumination light  and allows reflected image light  to pass through without being redirected so it can pass into the imaging optics, where the imaging optics can be dispersive when the display is a flat screen display or refractive or diffractive when the display is a projector or a near eye display.","For a reflective image source such as a liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) image source, the illumination light is polarized and the reflective image source changes the polarization state when the illumination light is reflected from the reflective image source based on the image content presented by the image source thereby forming image light. An analyzer polarizer is then included which causes the polarization effects imparted by the LCOS to form an image as the image light passes through the imaging optics and an image is presented to a viewer.","In U.S. Pat. No. 7,545,571, a wearable display system is presented which includes a reflective image source with a polarizing beam splitter as a frontlight to deflect and polarize illumination light supplied by an edge light source onto the reflective image source. The polarizing beam splitter is an angled plane in a solid block with a separate curved reflector associated with the edge light source. The curved reflector can be a total internal reflection block that is connected to the polarizing beam splitter. As such, the frontlight disclosed in this patent with the solid block of the polarizing beam splitter and the total internal reflection block provides a frontlight that is bulky and relatively heavy.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,195,136 discloses a series of frontlight illumination methods for use with reflective image sources. A method using a curved beam splitter is disclosed for making the frontlight more compact. However, the curved beam splitter is located a substantial distance away from the image source to reduce the angle of the light from the light source that is then reflected by the beam splitter to the image source. Also, the light is provided only on one side of the frontlight so the size of the beam splitter must be at least as big as the image source. As a result, the overall size of the frontlight is still relatively large when measured along the optical axis compared to the illuminated area on the image source.","There remains a need to provide a frontlight for displays with reflective image sources that provides good image quality with little scattered light and is also compact, efficient and light in weight.","The present disclosure provides a compact, efficient and light weight frontlight in a display assembly that includes a partially reflective surface to redirect the illumination light from a light source at the side to a reflective image source, wherein the size of the display assembly as measured by the height of the diffuser area is substantially smaller than the width of the reflective image source that is illuminated. In some embodiments, the partially reflective surface can be curved to focus or concentrate the light from the light source onto the reflective image source. The light source can be polarized and a polarizing beam splitter film can be used as the curved partially reflective surface such that the illumination light is redirected and the reflected image light is allowed to pass through to the imaging optics. Polarizing beam splitter film is light in weight and has very low light scattering as the image light passes through the frontlight on the way to the display optics, so image quality is preserved.","In other embodiments of the disclosure, light sources are provided on opposing sides of the frontlight so that light is provided to opposing edges of the reflective image source. In this case, the partially reflective surface is comprised of two surfaces, wherein one surface deflects the illumination light from one light source to one half of the image source and the other surface deflects light to the other half of the image source. In this embodiment, the partially reflective surfaces can be curved or flat.","In a further embodiment of the disclosure, the partially reflective surface is a polarizing beam splitter and the light source is polarized so the light from the light source is first redirected by the polarizing beam splitter and then transmitted after being reflected and changed in polarization by the reflective image source.","In another embodiment, the light from the light source is unpolarized so the polarizing beam splitter reflects one polarization state of the light to illuminate half of the reflective image source while transmitting the other polarization state of the light. The transmitted polarization state of the light passes to the opposite side of the frontlight where the light is recycled. The recycling of the transmitted polarization state can be done by passing through a quarter wave film and being reflected by a mirror so that it passes back through the quarter wave film and thereby changes polarization state. After the polarization state of the transmitted and reflected light has changed, it is redirected by the polarizing beam splitter to illuminate the other half of the reflective image source. In an alternate embodiment, light from the two sidelights of the frontlight acts in a complimentary fashion where the transmitted polarization state of the light from the opposite side becomes unpolarized when it interacts with the diffuser on the opposite side and is thereby recycled.","In yet another embodiment of the disclosure, methods are provided for making frontlights with flexible partially reflecting films. The flexible films can be supported at the edges and freestanding over the reflective image source or the flexible films can be clamped between two or more solid pieces that are transparent. The solid pieces can be shaped prior to being placed in contact with the flexible films. The solid pieces can hold the flexible film in a flat geometry or a curved geometry. In yet another embodiment, the flexible film can be supported at the edges and then solid pieces can be cast in place so that the flexible film is embedded in the transparent solid material.","In an embodiment, a system may include an interactive head-mounted eyepiece worn by a user, wherein the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content, an integrated processor for handling content for display to the user, an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly; the processor adapted to modify the content, wherein the modification is made in response to a sensor input. The content may be a video image. The modification may be at least one of adjust brightness, adjust color saturation, adjust color balance, adjust color hue, adjust video resolution, adjust transparency, adjust compression rate, adjust frames per second rate, isolate part of the video, stop the video from playing, pause the video, or restart the video. The sensor input may be derived from at least one of a charge-coupled device, black silicon sensor, IR sensor, acoustic sensor, induction sensor, motion sensor, optical sensor, opacity sensor, proximity sensor, inductive sensor, Eddy-current sensor, passive infrared proximity sensor, radar, capacitance sensor, capacitive displacement sensor, hall-effect sensor, magnetic sensor, GPS sensor, thermal imaging sensor, thermocouple, thermistor, photoelectric sensor, ultrasonic sensor, infrared laser sensor, inertial motion sensor, MEMS internal motion sensor, ultrasonic 3D motion sensor, accelerometer, inclinometer, force sensor, piezoelectric sensor, rotary encoders, linear encoders, chemical sensor, ozone sensor, smoke sensor, heat sensor, magnetometer, carbon dioxide detector, carbon monoxide detector, oxygen sensor, glucose sensor, smoke detector, metal detector, rain sensor, altimeter, GPS, detection of being outside, detection of context, detection of activity, object detector (e.g. billboard), marker detector (e.g. geo-location marker for advertising), laser rangefinder, sonar, capacitance, optical response, heart rate sensor, or an RF\/micropower impulse radio (MIR) sensor. The content may be stopped from playing in response to an indication from an accelerometer input that the user's head is moving. Audio sensor input may be generated by the speaking of at least one participant of a video conference. Visual sensor input may be a video image of at least one participant of a video conference or a video image of a visual presentation. The modification may be at least one of making the video image more or less transparent in response to an indication from a sensor that the user is moving.","In an embodiment, a system may include an interactive head-mounted eyepiece worn by a user, wherein the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content, an integrated processor for handling content for display to the user, an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly, the processor adapted to modify the content, wherein the modification is made in response to a sensor input; and further comprising, an integrated video image capture facility that records an aspect of the surrounding environment and provides the content for display.","These and other systems, methods, objects, features, and advantages of the present disclosure will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the embodiments and the drawings.","All documents mentioned herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference. References to items in the singular should be understood to include items in the plural, and vice versa, unless explicitly stated otherwise or clear from the text. Grammatical conjunctions are intended to express any and all disjunctive and conjunctive combinations of conjoined clauses, sentences, words, and the like, unless otherwise stated or clear from the context.","The present disclosure relates to eyepiece electro-optics. The eyepiece may include projection optics suitable to project an image onto a see-through or translucent lens, enabling the wearer of the eyepiece to view the surrounding environment as well as the displayed image. The projection optics, also known as a projector, may include an RGB LED module that uses field sequential color. With field sequential color, a single full color image may be broken down into color fields based on the primary colors of red, green, and blue and imaged by an LCoS (liquid crystal on silicon) optical display  individually. As each color field is imaged by the optical display , the corresponding LED color is turned on. When these color fields are displayed in rapid sequence, a full color image may be seen. With field sequential color illumination, the resulting projected image in the eyepiece can be adjusted for any chromatic aberrations by shifting the red image relative to the blue and\/or green image and so on. The image may thereafter be reflected into a two surface freeform waveguide where the image light engages in total internal reflections (TIR) until reaching the active viewing area of the lens where the user sees the image. A processor, which may include a memory and an operating system, may control the LED light source and the optical display. The projector may also include or be optically coupled to a display coupling lens, a condenser lens, a polarizing beam splitter, and a field lens.","Referring to , a processor  (e.g. a digital signal processor) may provide display sequential frames  for image display through a display component  (e.g. an LCOS display component) of the eyepiece . In embodiments, the sequential frames  may be produced with or without a display driver  as an intermediate component between the processor  and the display component . For example, and referring to , the processor  may include a frame buffer  and a display interface  (e.g. a mobile industry processor interface (MIPI), with a display serial interface (DSI)). The display interface  may provide per-pixel RGB data  to the display driver  as an intermediate component between the processor  and the display component , where the display driver  accepts the per-pixel RGB data  and generates individual full frame display data for red , green , and blue , thus providing the display sequential frames  to the display component . In addition, the display driver  may provide timing signals, such as to synchronize the delivery of the full frames    as display sequential frames  to the display component . In another example, and referring to , the display interface  may be configured to eliminate the display driver  by providing full frame display data for red , green , and blue  directly to the display component  as display sequential frames . In addition, timing signals  may be provided directly from the display interface  to the display components. This configuration may provide significantly lower power consumption by removing the need for a display driver. Not only may this direct panel information remove the need for a driver, but also may simplify the overall logic of the configuration, and remove redundant memory required to reform panel information from pixels, to generate pixel information from frame, and the like.","Referring to , in embodiments, to improve yield of the LCoS+ASIC package , the ASIC may be mounted onto a flexible printed circuit (FPC)  with a stiffener on the topside. The topside stiffener does not add thickness to the overall package if it is as tall as the ASIC. The FPC can connect to a standard LCoS package, such as LCoS on fiberglass reinforced epoxy laminates (FR4)  via a connector , such as a zero insertion force (ZIF) connection or Board to Board connector for a higher pin count. A pressure sensitive adhesive may be used to bond the ASIC, stiffener(s) and LCoS to the FPC.","Referring to , an illustrative embodiment of the augmented reality eyepiece  may be depicted. It will be understood that embodiments of the eyepiece  may not include all of the elements depicted in  while other embodiments may include additional or different elements. In embodiments, the optical elements may be embedded in the arm portions  of the frame  of the eyepiece. Images may be projected with a projector  onto at least one lens  disposed in an opening of the frame . One or more projectors , such as a nanoprojector, picoprojector, microprojector, femtoprojector, LASER-based projector, holographic projector, and the like may be disposed in an arm portion of the eyepiece frame . In embodiments, both lenses  are see-through or translucent while in other embodiments only one lens  is translucent while the other is opaque or missing. In embodiments, more than one projector  may be included in the eyepiece .","In embodiments such as the one depicted in , the eyepiece  may also include at least one articulating ear bud , a radio transceiver  and a heat sink  to absorb heat from the LED light engine, to keep it cool and to allow it to operate at full brightness. There are also one or more TI OMAP4 (open multimedia applications processors) , and a flex cable with RF antenna , all of which will be further described herein.","In an embodiment and referring to , the projector  may be an RGB projector. The projector  may include a housing , a heatsink  and an RGB LED engine or module . The RGB LED engine  may include LEDs, dichroics, concentrators, and the like. A digital signal processor (DSP) (not shown) may convert the images or video stream into control signals, such as voltage drops\/current modifications, pulse width modulation (PWM) signals, and the like to control the intensity, duration, and mixing of the LED light. For example, the DSP may control the duty cycle of each PWM signal to control the average current flowing through each LED generating a plurality of colors. A still image co-processor of the eyepiece may employ noise-filtering, image\/video stabilization, and face detection, and be able to make image enhancements. An audio back-end processor of the eyepiece may employ buffering, SRC, equalization and the like.","The projector  may include an optical display , such as an LCoS display, and a number of components as shown. In embodiments, the projector  may be designed with a single panel LCoS display ; however, a three panel display may be possible as well. In the single panel embodiment, the display  is illuminated with red, blue, and green sequentially (aka field sequential color). In other embodiments, the projector  may make use of alternative optical display technologies, such as a back-lit liquid crystal display (LCD), a front-lit LCD, a transflective LCD, an organic light emitting diode (OLED), a field emission display (FED), a ferroelectric LCoS (FLCOS), liquid crystal technologies mounted on Sapphire, transparent liquid-crystal micro-displays, quantum-dot displays, and the like.","In various embodiments, the display may be a 3D display, LCD, thin film transistor LCD, LED, LCOS, ferroelectric liquid crystal on silicon display, CMOS display, OLED, QLED, OLED arrays that have CMOS style pixels sensors at the junctions between the OED pixels, transmissive LCoS display, CRT display, VGA display, SXGA display, QVGA display, display with video based gaze tracker, display with exit pupil expanding technology, Asahi film display, a free form optics display, an XY polynomial combiner display, a light guide transfer display, an Amoled display, and the like. In embodiments, the display may be a holographic display that allows the eyepiece to display an image from the image source as a hologram. In embodiments, the display may be a liquid crystal reflective micro-display. Such a display may contain polarization optics and may improve brightness as compared to certain OLED micro displays. In embodiments, the display may be a free form prism display. Free form prism displays may achieve 3D stereo imaging capability. In embodiments, the display may be similar or the same as those displays described by Cannon and\/or Olympus in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,384,983 and 6,181,475 respectively. In yet other embodiments, the display may contain a video based gaze tracker. In embodiments, a light beam of an infrared light source may be divided and expanded inside an exit pupil expander (EPE) to produce collimated beams from the EPE toward the eyes. A Miniature video camera may image the cornea and eye gaze direction may be calculated by locating the pupil and the glints of the infrared beams. After user calibration, the data from the gaze tracker may reflect the user focus point in the displayed image which may be used as an input device. Such a device may be similar to that provided by Nokia Research Center of Tampere, Finland. Further, in embodiments, the display may contain an exit pupil expander which enlarges the exit pupil and transfers the image to a new position. Therefore only a thin transparent plate may need to be placed in front of the user's eyes and the image source may be placed elsewhere. In yet other embodiments, the display may be an off axis optics display. In embodiments, such a display may not be coincident with the mechanical center of the aperture. This may avoid obstruction of the primary aperture by secondary optical elements, instrument packages and\/or sensors and may provide access to instrument packages and\/or sensors at the focus. For example, the active-maxtrix organic light-emitting diode (Amoled) display may use a pixel design, called PenTile, from Nouvoyance which lets more light through in a couple of ways. First, the red, blue, and green subpixels are larger than those in traditional displays. Second, one out of every four subpixels is clear. This means the backlight can use less power and shine brighter. Fewer subpixels would usually mean a lower resolution, but the PenTile display uses individual sub-pixels to trick the eye into perceiving the same resolution while using about one-third as many subpixels as an RGB stripe panel. The PenTile display also uses image processing algorithms to determine the brightness of a scene, automatically dimming the backlight for darker images.","To overcome the limitations of the prior art previously described, the disclosure provides an integral array of switchable mirrors in a waveguide that can be used sequentially to provide a progressive scan of portions of the image across the display field of view. By rapidly switching the mirrors from reflective to transmissive in a sequential manner, the image can be provided to the user without perceptible flicker. Since each switchable mirror is in the transmissive state more than the reflective state, the array of switchable mirrors appears to be transparent to the user while also presenting the displayed image to the user.","Presentation of light from an image source by a waveguide is well known to those skilled in the art and as such will not be discussed herein.

As such, each switchable mirror is in the transmissive state for a greater portion of each cycle in the sequence than it is in the reflective state and consequently the user perceives the array of switchable mirrors to be relatively transparent.","In another embodiment of the disclosure, the integral array of switchable mirrors has more switchable mirrors than are needed to cover the display area. The extra switchable mirrors are used to provide an adjustment for different users that have different eye spacings (also known as interpupillary distance). In this case, the switchable mirrors that are used to present the image to the user are adjacent to one another so that they present a contiguous image area. The switchable mirrors at the edges of the array are used depending on the eye spacing of the user. As an example illustrated in , an array  is provided with seven switchable mirrors each 3 mm wide. During use, five adjacent switchable mirrors are used to provide a 15 mm wide display area (-) with +\/\u22123 mm of adjustment for eye spacing.

Coverglasses contain the liquid crystal on the outer surfaces. The response time is 10 millisec with reflectivity of 87% in the reflective state and transmission of 87% in the transmissive state. Three switchable mirrors can be driven in a sequence that operates at 30 Hz.

The surfaces of the prisms are polished to provide a flatness of less than 1 micron and piezoelectric microactuators are used to move the prisms approximately 10 microns from the transmissive state to the reflective state. The waveguide is molded to provide a flatness of less than 1 micron on the mating surfaces to the prisms. Five switchable mirrors can be driven by the piezoelectric actuators to operate in a sequence at 100 Hz. The piezoelectric microactuators are obtained from Steiner & Martins Inc., Miami, Fla.

Alternately, only 3 prisms are used at a time to provide a 15 mm wide display area (38 degree field of view) with the ability to move the display area laterally by +\/\u22125 mm to adjust for different spacing between the eyes for different users.","In embodiments, a waveguide display system may comprise an image source that provides image light from a displayed image, a waveguide to transport the image light to a display area, and an integral array of switchable mirrors to redirect the image light from the waveguide to the display area where the displayed image can be viewed by the user. In embodiments, the switchable mirrors may be electrically driven. The switchable mirrors may be mechanically driven in embodiments. In further embodiments, the microactuators may be used to mechanically drive the switchable mirrors. Further, the microactuators may be piezoelectric.

In addition, display technologies such as OLED and quantum-dot displays may allow for flexible displays, and so allowing greater packaging efficiency that may reduce the overall size of the eyepiece. For example, OLED and quantum-dot display materials may be printed through stamping techniques onto plastic substrates, thus creating a flexible display component. For example, the OLED (organic LED) display may be a flexible, low-power display that does not require backlighting. It can be curved, as in standard eyeglass lenses. In one embodiment, the OLED display may be or provide for a transparent display. In embodiments, high modulation transfer functions permit the combination of resolution levels and device size, e.g., eyeframe thickness, that have been unachievable heretofore.","Referring to , the eyepiece may utilize a planar illumination facility  in association with a reflective display , where light source(s)  are coupled  with an edge of the planar illumination facility , and where the planar side of the planar illumination facility  illuminates the reflective display  that provides imaging of content to be presented to the eye  of the wearer through transfer optics . In embodiments, the reflective display  may be an LCD, an LCD on silicon (LCoS), cholesteric liquid crystal, guest-host liquid crystal, polymer dispersed liquid crystal, phase retardation liquid crystal, and the like, or other liquid crystal technology know in the art. In other embodiments, the reflective display  may be a bi-stable display, such as electrophoretic, electrofluidic, electrowetting, electrokinetic, cholesteric liquid crystal, and the like, or any other bi-stable display known to the art. The reflective display  may also be a combination of an LCD technology and a bi-stable display technology. In embodiments, the coupling  between a light source  and the \u2018edge\u2019 of the planar illumination facility  may be made through other surfaces of the planar illumination facility  and then directed into the plane of the planar illumination facility , such as initially through the top surface, bottom surface, an angled surface, and the like. For example, light may enter the planar illumination facility from the top surface, but into a 45\u00b0 facet such that the light is bent into the direction of the plane. In an alternate embodiment, this bending of direction of the light may be implemented with optical coatings.","In an example, the light source  may be an RGB LED source (e.g. an LED array) coupled  directly to the edge of the planar illumination facility. The light entering the edge of the planar illumination facility may then be directed to the reflective display for imaging, such as described herein. Light may enter the reflective display to be imaged, and then redirected back through the planar illumination facility, such as with a reflecting surface at the backside of the reflective display. Light may then enter the transfer optics  for directing the image to the eye  of the wearer, such as through a lens , reflected by a beam splitter  to a reflective surface , back through the beam splitter , and the like, to the eye .

The image light from the reflective display  is then redirected back though the planar illumination facility  through a hole  in the supporting structure  to the transfer optics. Because this embodiment utilizes laser light, the FLC also utilizes optical feedback to reduce speckle from the lasers, by broadening the laser spectrum as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,265,896. In this embodiment, the laser source  is an IR laser source, where the FLC combines the beams to RGB, with back reflection that causes the laser light to hop and produce a broadened bandwidth to provide the speckle suppression. In this embodiment, the speckle suppression occurs in the wave-guides . The laser light from laser sources  is coupled to the planar illumination facility  through a multi-mode interference combiner (MMI) . Each laser source port is positioned such that the light traversing the MMI combiner superimposes on one output port to the planar illumination facility . The grating of the planar illumination facility  produces uniform illumination for the reflective display. In embodiments, the grating elements may use a very fine pitch (e.g. interferometric) to produce the illumination to the reflective display, which is reflected back with very low scatter off the grating as the light passes through the planar illumination facility to the transfer optics. That is, light comes out aligned such that the grating is nearly fully transparent. Note that the optical feedback utilized in this embodiment is due to the use of laser light sources, and when LEDs are utilized, speckle suppression may not be required because the LEDs are already broadband enough.","In an embodiment of an optics system utilizing a planar illumination facility  that includes a configuration with optical imperfections, in this case a \u2018grooved\u2019 configuration, is shown in . In this embodiment, the light source(s)  are coupled  directly to the edge of the planar illumination facility . Light then travels through the planar illumination facility  and encounters small grooves A-D in the planar illumination facility material, such as grooves in a piece of Poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA). In embodiments, the grooves A-D may vary in spacing as they progress away from the input port (e.g. less \u2018aggressive\u2019 as they progress from A to D), vary in heights, vary in pitch, and the like. The light is then redirected by the grooves A-D to the reflective display  as an incoherent array of light sources, producing fans of rays traveling to the reflective display , where the reflective display  is far enough away from the grooves A-D to produce illumination patterns from each groove that overlap to provide uniform illumination of the area of the reflective display . In other embodiments, there may be an optimum spacing for the grooves, where the number of grooves per pixel on the reflective display  may be increased to make the light more incoherent (more fill), but where in turn this produces lower contrast in the image provided to the wearer with more grooves to interfere within the provided image. While this embodiment has been discussed with respect to grooves, other optical imperfections, such as dots, are also possible.","In embodiments, and referring to , counter ridges  (or \u2018anti-grooves\u2019) may be applied into the grooves of the planar illumination facility, such as in a \u2018snap-on\u2019 ridge assembly . Wherein the counter ridges  are positioned in the grooves A-D such that there is an air gap between the groove sidewalls and the counter ridge sidewalls. This air gap provides a defined change in refractive index as perceived by the light as it travels through the planar illumination facility that promotes a reflection of the light at the groove sidewall. The application of counter ridges  reduces aberrations and deflections of the image light caused by the grooves. That is, image light reflected from reflective display  is refracted by the groove sidewall and as such it changes direction because of Snell's law. By providing counter ridges in the grooves, where the sidewall angle of the groove matches the sidewall angle of the counter ridge, the refraction of the image light is compensated for and the image light is redirected toward the transfer optics .","In embodiments, and referring to , the planar illumination facility  may be a laminate structure created out of a plurality of laminating layers  wherein the laminating layers  have alternating different refractive indices. For instance, the planar illumination facility  may be cut across two diagonal planes  of the laminated sheet. In this way, the grooved structure shown in  is replaced with the laminate structure . For example, the laminating sheet may be made of similar materials (PMMA 1 versus PMMA 2\u2014where the difference is in the molecular weight of the PMMA). As long as the layers are fairly thick, there may be no interference effects, and act as a clear sheet of plastic. In the configuration shown, the diagonal laminations will redirect a small percentage of light source  to the reflective display, where the pitch of the lamination is selected to minimize aberration.","In an embodiment of an optics system,  shows a planar illumination facility  utilizing a \u2018wedge\u2019 configuration. In this embodiment, the light source(s) are coupled  directly to the edge of the planar illumination facility . Light then travels through the planar illumination facility  and encounters the slanted surface of the first wedge , where the light is redirected to the reflective display , and then back to the illumination facility  and through both the first wedge  and the second wedge  and on to the transfer optics. In addition, multi-layer coatings   may be applied to the wedges to improve transfer properties. In an example, the wedge may be made from PMMA, with dimensions of \u00bd mm high-10 mm width, and spanning the entire reflective display, have 1 to 1.5 degrees angle, and the like. In embodiments, the light may go through multiple reflections within the wedge  before passing through the wedge  to illuminate the reflective display . If the wedge  is coated with a highly reflecting coating  and , the ray may make many reflections inside wedge  before turning around and coming back out to the light source  again. However, by employing multi-layer coatings  and  on the wedge , such as with SiO2, Niobium Pentoxide, and the like, light may be directed to illuminate the reflective display . The coatings  and  may be designed to reflect light at a specified wavelength over a wide range of angles, but transmit light within a certain range of angles (e.g. theta out angles). In embodiments, the design may allow the light to reflect within the wedge until it reaches a transmission window for presentation to the reflective display , where the coating is then configured to enable transmission. The angle of the wedge directs light from an LED lighting system to uniformly irradiate a reflective image display to produce an image that is reflected through the illumination system. By providing light from the light source  such that a wide cone angle of light enters the wedge , different rays of light will reach transmission windows at different locations along the length of the wedge  so that uniform illumination of the surface of the reflective display  is provided and as a result, the image provided to the wearer's eye has uniform brightness as determined by the image content in the image.","In embodiments, the see-through optics system including a planar illumination facility  and reflective display  as described herein may be applied to any head-worn device known to the art, such as including the eyepiece as described herein, but also to helmets (e.g. military helmets, pilot helmets, bike helmets, motorcycle helmets, deep sea helmets, space helmets, and the like) ski goggles, eyewear, water diving masks, dusk masks, respirators, Hazmat head gear, virtual reality headgear, simulation devices, and the like. In addition, the optics system and protective covering associated with the head-worn device may incorporate the optics system in a plurality of ways, including inserting the optics system into the head-worn device in addition to optics and covering traditionally associated with the head-worn device. For instance, the optics system may be included in a ski goggle as a separate unit, providing the user with projected content, but where the optics system doesn't replace any component of the ski goggle, such as the see-through covering of the ski goggle (e.g. the clear or colored plastic covering that is exposed to the outside environment, keeping the wind and snow from the user's eyes). Alternatively, the optics system may replace, at least in part, certain optics traditionally associated with the head-worn gear. For instance, certain optical elements of the transfer optics  may replace the outer lens of an eyewear application. In an example, a beam splitter, lens, or mirror of the transfer optics  could replace the front lens for an eyewear application (e.g. sunglasses), thus eliminating the need for the front lens of the glasses, such as if the curved reflection mirror  is extended to cover the glasses, eliminating the need for the cover lens. In embodiments, the see-through optics system including a planar illumination facility  and reflective display  may be located in the head-worn gear so as to be unobtrusive to the function and aesthetic of the head-worn gear. For example, in the case of eyewear, or more specifically the eyepiece, the optics system may be located in proximity with an upper portion of the lens, such as in the upper portion of the frame.","In embodiments, the optical assembly may be used in configurations such as a head or helmet mounted display, and\/or further may comprise a single lens, binocular, holographic binocular, helmet visor, head mounted display with mangin mirror, integrated helmet and display sighting system, helmet integrated display sight system, link advanced head mounted display (AHMD), and multiple micro-display optics. In embodiments, the optical assembly may include a telescopic lens. Such lens may be spectacle mounted or otherwise. Such an embodiment may be beneficial to those with visual impairments. In embodiments, Eli Peli's wide-field Keplerian telescope may be built within the spectacle lens. Such design may use embedded mirrors inside of a carrier lens to fold the optical path and power elements for higher magnification. This may allow the wearer to simultaneously view the magnified and unmagnified field within the eyeglass format. In embodiments, the optical assembly may be used in configurations with the Q-Sight helmet mounted display developed by BAE Systems of London, United Kingdom.

While glass plate wire grid polarizers are well known in the industry and a rigid wire grid polarizer can be used in the disclosure, in a preferred embodiment of the present disclosure a flexible wire grid polarizer film is used for the curved wire grid polarizer. Suitable wire grid polarizer film is available from Asahi-Kasei E-materials Corp, Tokyo Japan.","An edge light provides a compact form of lighting for a display, but since it is located at the edge of the image source, the light must be deflected by 90 degrees to illuminate the image source.

A polarizer is provided adjacent to the edge light source to polarize the illumination light provided to the curved wire grid polarizer. The polarizer and the wire grid polarizer are oriented such that the light passing through the polarizer is reflected by the wire grid polarizer. Due to the quarter wave retarder film that is included in the reflective image source, the polarization of the reflected image light is the opposite polarization state compared to the illumination light. As such, the reflected image light passes through the wire grid polarizer film and continues to the display optics. By using a flexible wire grid polarizer film as a partial reflector, the partially reflective surface can be curved in a lightweight structure where the wire grid polarizer performs the dual role of being a reflector for the illumination light and a transparent member for the image light. An advantage provided by the wire grid polarizer film is that it can receive image light over a wide range of incident angles so that the curve doesn't interfere with the image light passing through to the display optics. In addition, since the wire grid polarizer film is thin (e.g. less than 200 micron), the curved shape doesn't noticeably distort the image light as it passes through to the display optics.

Wherein the linear polarizer in the light control element is oriented relative to the linearly polarized image light so that the second portion of the linearly polarized image light that passes through the partially reflecting mirror is blocked and eyeglow is reduced. In embodiments, eyeglow may be minimized or eliminated by attaching lenses to the waveguide or frame, such as the snap-fit optics described herein, that are oppositely polarized from the light reflecting from the user's eye, such as p-polarized in this case.","In embodiments, the light control element may include a second quarter wave film and a linear polarizer. The second quarter wave film converts a second portion of a circularly polarized image light into linearly polarized image light with a polarization state that is blocked by the linear polarizer in the light control element so that eyeglow is reduced. For example, when the light control element includes a linear polarizer and a quarter wave film, incoming unpolarized scene light from the external environment in front of the user is converted to linearly polarized light while 50% of the light is blocked. The first portion of scene light that passes through the linear polarizer is linearly polarized light which is converted by the quarter wave film to circularly polarized light. The third portion of scene light that is reflected from the partially reflecting mirror has reversed circular polarization which is then converted to linearly polarized light by the second quarter wave film. The linear polarizer then blocks the reflected third portion of the scene light thereby reducing escaping light and reducing eyeglow.  shows an example of a see-through display assembly with a light control element in a glasses frame.

The supporting members B and B along with the light control element B are connected to the glasses frame B. The other components such as the folding mirror B and the first quarter wave film B are also connected to the supporting members B and B so that the combined assembly is structurally sound.","Stray light in a compact optical system such as a head mounted display, typically comes from scattering off sidewalls of the housing or other structures where the light encounters the surface at a steep angle. This type of stray light produces bright areas of scattered light that surround the displayed image.","There are two approaches to reducing this type of stray light. One is to darken or roughen the sidewalls or other structures to reduce the reflectance of light. However, while this does increase the absorbance at the surface, the reflected light scattered off the surface may still be noticeable. The other is to provide baffles to block or clip the stray light. Blocking or clipping the reflected light scattered off the surface greatly reduces the effects of this stray light. In a head mounted display, it is beneficial to use both approaches to reducing stray light as bright areas around the displayed image are eliminated and the contrast of the displayed image is increased.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,949,583 provides a visor on the top of a head mounted display to block stray light from entering from above. However, this does not address the need for controls to reduce stray light that comes from inside the head mounted display system.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,369,952 provides two masks to block light that comes from around the edge of a liquid crystal display image source in a head mounted display. The first mask is located on the input side of the liquid crystal image source adjacent to the backlight, while the second mask is located on the output side of the liquid crystal display. Since the two masks are located close to the liquid crystal display, \u201cboth the first mask  and the second mask  have opening or windows , , respectively which are substantially equal and congruent to the active area of the LCD\u201d (Col 15, lines 15-19). By locating the masks close to the image source, the masks can have little effect on light that is emitted by the image source in a broad cone angle from areas of the image source that are nearer the center of the active area of the image source. This broad cone angle light can reflect off the sidewalls of the housing in a variety of ways and thereby contribute stray light in the form of bright areas and reduced contrast.","Therefore, there remains a need for a method to reduce stray light from sources inside of head mounted displays.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0392","num":"0391"},"figref":"FIG. 160","b":["16002","16012","16018","16002","16018","16012","16004","16008","16018","16012","16010","16008","16008","16002","16012","16010","16010","16004","16008","16004","16010","16010","16002","16020","16018","16014","16004","16020","16004"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0393","num":"0392"},"figref":["FIG. 161","FIG. 161","FIG. 160"],"b":["200","200","16104","16108","16102","16104","16108","16102","200","200","16104","16108","16102","200","16102","16104","16102","16104","200","16104","16102"]},"Given that the image source  includes a projection system with a light source with a wide cone angle of light the image light also has a wide cone angle.

In cases where the beam splitter layer  is a polarizing beam splitter, a first quarter wave film  is provided between the beam splitter layer  and the partially reflecting mirror . The first quarter wave film  converts the linearly polarized image light to circularly polarized image light (shown as S being converted to CR in ). The reflected first portion of image light  is then also circularly polarized where the circular polarization state is reversed (shown as CL in ) so that after passing back through the quarter wave film, the polarization state of the reflected first portion of image light  is reversed (to P polarization) compared to the polarization state of the image light  provided by the image source (shown as S). As a result, the reflected first portion of the image light  passes through the polarizing beam splitter without reflection losses.

In embodiments, the light control element  includes a controllable darkening layer . Wherein the second quarter wave film  converts the second portion of the circularly polarized image light  into linearly polarized image light  (shown as CR being converted to S) with a polarization state that is blocked by the linear polarizer  in the light control element  so that eyeglow is reduced.","When the light control element  includes a linear polarizer  and a quarter wave film , incoming unpolarized scene light  from the external environment in front of the user is converted to linearly polarized light (shown as P polarization state in ) while 50% of the light is blocked.

The third portion of scene light that is reflected from the partially reflecting mirror  has reversed circular polarization (shown as converting from CL to CR in ) which is then converted to linearly polarized light by the second quarter wave film  (shown as CR converting to S polarization in ). The linear polarizer  then blocks the reflected third portion of the scene light thereby reducing escaping light and reducing eyeglow.","As shown in , the reflected first portion of image light  and the transmitted second portion of scene light have the same circular polarization state (shown as CL) so that they combine and are converted by the first quarter wave film  into linearly polarized light (shown as P) which passes through the beam splitter when the beam splitter layer  is a polarizing beam splitter.

The reflected light then passes back through the frontlight.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0433","num":"0432"},"figref":["FIG. 187","FIG. 187","FIG. 187"],"b":["18700","18718","18700","18702","18712","18712","18704","18714","18718","18708","18720","18714","18720","18710","18708","18710","18704","18720","18708","18710"]},"In imaging systems in general, it is important to preserve the wavefront from the image source to provide a high quality image with good resolution and contrast. As such, the image light  must proceed perpendicularly from the reflective image source  to provide a uniform wavefront to the associated imaging optics for a high quality image to be provided to a viewer, as is known by those skilled in the art. As such, the diffused light rays  must be redirected by the partially reflective film  to be perpendicular to the reflective image source  so they can be reflected and pass vertically (as shown in ) into the associated imaging optics.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0435","num":"0434"},"figref":["FIG. 188","FIG. 187","FIG. 188"],"b":["18802","18804","18720","18802","18700","18718","18704","18720","18808","18720"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0436","num":"0435"},"figref":"FIG. 189","b":["18902","18804","18720","18904","18908","18720","18804","18720"]},"In an embodiment of the disclosure shown in , a curved partially reflective surface  is provided to redirect the diffused light  provided by the light source  downward to illuminate the reflective image source . The curved partially reflective surface  can be a polarizing beam splitter film, which is thin and flexible. In this case, the diffuser  includes a linear polarizer so that the light  is diffused and then linearly polarized, so the diffused light  is polarized. The linear polarizer in the diffuser  and the polarizing beam splitter film  are oriented such that light passing through the linear polarizer is reflected by the polarizing beam splitter film. In this way, when the reflective image source  changes the polarization of the diffused light , the polarization of the reflected image light  is the opposite polarization state compared to the diffused light . The reflected image light  then passes through the partially reflective film  and continues to the display optics. By using a flexible polarizing beam splitter film as the partially reflecting surface , the partially reflective surface  can be curved and lightweight. The polarizing beam splitter film performs the dual role of being a reflector for the diffused light  that illuminates the reflective image source  and a transparent member for the reflected image light . An advantage provided by polarizing beam splitter films as is known by those skilled in the art is that they can receive light over a wide range of incident angles so that a curve doesn't interfere with light passing through to the film. In addition, since polarizing beam splitter film is thin (e.g. less than 200 micron), the curved shape doesn't noticeably distort the image light  as it passes through the film to the display optics. Finally, the polarizing beam splitter films have a low tendency to scatter light so high image contrast can be maintained.","The flexible nature of polarizing beam splitter films allows them to be formed into curved shapes that redirect and focus light from the diffuser onto the reflective image source. The shape of the curve of the polarizing beam splitter film can be selected based on the light distribution provided by the diffuser to provide uniform illumination of the reflective image source.  shows a curved partially reflective film  with a parabolic shape, but radiused curves, complex splined curves, relatively flat curves, flats or segmented planes are possible as well to uniformly redirect and focus the diffused light  onto the reflective image source  depending on the nature of the light source  and the effectiveness of the diffuser . Experiments have shown that curved surfaces on the partially reflective surface  tend to concentrate the diffused light  into the center of the reflective image source  so that curved surfaces are best used when the diffuser  provides a distribution of light that is brighter at the edges. Conversely, experiments have shown that a relatively flat surface on the partially reflective surface  is best used when the diffuser  provides a distribution of light that is brighter at the center. The shape of the partially reflective surface  when it is comprised of a flexible film, can be maintained with side frames that have slots of the appropriate curve to hold the flexible film in place as shown in  as a free standing film. Two side frames are used to support the curved shape on either side of the display assembly  along with the other components. Because a large part of the display assembly  is comprised of air and the partially reflective surface  is thin film, weight is substantially lower compared to the prior art display assembly  shown in . In addition, as can be seen in , the width of the reflective image source  that is illuminated is greater than the height of the diffuser  so that the display assembly  is more compact than the prior art display assembly shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0439","num":"0438"},"figref":["FIG. 191","FIG. 191","FIG. 187","FIG. 191","FIG. 187"],"b":["19104","19102","19120","19102","18700","19120","19110","19120","19112","19102","19120","19110","19112","19104","19104","19114","19108","19114","19118","18720","19120","19110","19108","18704","18700","18720"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0440","num":"0439"},"figref":["FIG. 192","FIG. 192","FIG. 191"],"b":["19202","19104","19204","19202","19202","19102","19202"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0441","num":"0440"},"figref":["FIG. 193","FIG. 193","FIG. 187"],"b":["19302","19104","19308","19308","19312","18720","18720","19312","19310","19304","18704","19302"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0442","num":"0441"},"figref":["FIG. 194","FIG. 193","FIG. 194"],"b":["19402","19308","19404","19302","19404","19308","19308","19404","19404","19310"]},"In preferred embodiments of the disclosure, the partially reflective films in the display assemblies shown in  are polarizing beam splitting films.

Care must be taken to prevent air from being entrapped under the flat sheet of transparent material when it is applied to the transparent casting material. Stops can be provided in the surrounding structure to hold the flat sheet of transparent material parallel to the reflective image source.","The transparent liquid casting material can be any transparent liquid casting material such as epoxy, acrylic or urethane. The same transparent liquid casting material should be used for the top film holder as the bottom film holder so the image light is exposed to a uniform optical thickness solid block and the image light is not deflected by the surfaces of the folded polarizing beam splitter film. The transparent liquid casting material can be cured after casting by allowing a cure time, exposing to UV or exposing to heat. Curing of the transparent casting material can be done in a single step or in multiple steps. Curing of the lower portion as shown in  can be done prior to the casting of the upper portion shown in . Alternately, curing of the entire cast frontlight can be done after the step shown in .","The advantage of the method shown in  is that intimate contact is obtained between the transparent casting material and the reflective beam splitter film so that light can pass unimpeded through the portions of the frontlight. The casting method can also be used with a solid top or bottom film holder so that only the top or bottom film holder is cast.

The folded polarizing beam splitter film can be bonded to the solid piece prior to casting the other film holder in place. In this way, the cast film holder will have intimate contact with the surfaces of the polarizing beam splitter film. The materials used for the solid film holder should have the same refractive index as the cast film holder to avoid deflecting the image light as it passes through from the reflective image source to the associated imaging optics. An example of suitably matched materials is APEC 2000 from Bayer which has a refractive index of 1.56 and is injection moldable with EpoxAcast 690 from Smooth-On which has an refractive index of 1.565 and is castable.","In a yet further embodiment of the method, a solid film holder is made using a multi-step molding process as shown in the flowchart of . In Step , the bottom film holder is molded. Suitable molding techniques include injection molding, compression molding or casting. In Step , the polarizing beam splitter film is folded. In Step , the folded polarizing beam splitter film is placed on the molded bottom film holder and then placed as an insert into a mold for the top film holder. In Step , the top film holder is then molded over the folded polarizing beam splitter film and the bottom film holder. The end result is a solid film holder with the folded polarizing beam splitter film inside such as is shown in ,  and . The advantage of this multi-step molding technique is that the folded polarizing beam splitter film is forced to conform to the surface of the bottom film holder and the top and bottom film holders are in intimate contact with the folded polarizing beam splitter film. In a preferred embodiment, the refractive index of the top and bottom film holders is the same within 0.03. In a further preferred embodiment, the glass transition point of the material for the bottom film holder is higher than the glass transition point for the material of the top film holder or the material for the bottom film holder is crosslinked so that the bottom film holder doesn't deform when the top film holder is molded over the folded polarizing beam splitter film and the bottom film holder. An example of a suitable combination of injection moldable materials are cyclic olefin materials such as Zeonex E48R from Zeon Chemicals with a Tg of 139 C and refractive index of 1.53 and Topas 6017 from Topas Advanced Polymers with a Tg of 177 C and refractive index of 1.53.","It is to be understood that some embodiments of the AR eyepieces of the present disclosure have high modulation transfer functions that permit combinations of resolution levels and device size, e.g., eyeframe thickness, that have been unachievable heretofore.

The curve of the curved wire grid polarizer controls the width of the image light. The curve enables use of a narrow light source because it spreads the light when the light strikes it and then folds it\/reflects it to uniformly illuminate an image display. Image light passing back through the wire grid polarizer is unperturbed. Thus, the curve also enables the miniaturization of the optical assembly.","In , augmented reality eyepiece  includes a frame  and left and right earpieces or temple pieces .

The eyepiece may be used for a plurality of video applications, such as recording video taken through an integrated camera or as transmitted from an external video device, playing back video to the wearer through the eyepiece (by methods and systems as described herein), streaming live video either from an external source (e.g. a conference call, a live news feed, a video stream from another eyepiece) or from an integrated camera (e.g. from an integrated non-line-of-sight camera), and the like. In embodiments, the eyepiece may accommodate multiple video applications being presented to the wearer at once, such as for example viewing a streamed external video link concurrent with a playback of a video file stored on the eyepiece. The eyepiece may provide for a 3D viewing experience, such as through providing images to either eyes, or alternately, a reduced 3D experience, such as providing a reduced amount of content to one of two eyes. The eyepiece may provide for text-enhanced video, such as when audio conditions are too loud to hear the included audio, the audio is in a language foreign to the user, the user wants to record a transcription of the audio, and the like.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may provide for context-aware video applications, such as adjusting at least one parameter of video capture and\/or viewing as a function of the environment of the wearer. For instance, a wearer of the eyepiece may be presented video through the eyepiece in the context of an external environment that requires the wearer to concentrate on the external environment more than the video, where the at least one parameter adjusts the presented video in a manner that makes the presentation less distracting (e.g. adjustment of spatial resolution; adjustment of frames per second; replacement of the video presentation with a static image representative of the content of the video, such as a stored picture of the person, a single frame from the video); and the like. In another instance, video may be captured by an integrated camera on the eyepiece in the context of the wearer being in motion (e.g. walking, running, biking, driving) where the at least one parameter adjusts the video being captured to help accommodate for the motion (e.g. making adjustments during periods where the eyepiece senses rapid motion where the video would be blurred, making adjustments during periods where the wearer is walking or moving slowly).","In embodiments, the at least one parameter may be a spatial resolution parameter (e.g. pixels per area, specific color pixels per area, limiting to only a single (\u2018black and white\u2019) pixel per area), field-of-view, frames recorded per time, frames presented per time, data compression, periods of time not recorded\/presented, and the like.","In embodiments, the at least one parameter may be adjusted based on a sensed input by the eyepiece, such as from a motion detection input (as described herein) for determining head motion (e.g. to determine rapid head motion, slow head motion), motion of the surrounding video-captured environment or within the environment through processing of images received through the integrated camera for determining relative motion between the wearer and the environment, eye motion of the wearer (as described herein) to determine whether the wearer is being distracted by video being presented to the wearer, ambient light and\/or sound conditions, and the like.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may provide image processing with respect to reducing the effects of motion or the environment on the quality of a video experience by the wearer or as stored when capturing video, such as for the compensation for gentle movements, bouncing, rapid motion; adjustment of background lighting and\/or sound environment, such as by adjusting the color mixture, brightness; and the like. Selection of processing may be a function of sensed inputs, environmental conditions, video content, and the like. For instance, a high quality image may be preferred in some instances, such that under certain circumstances a reduction in quality is not acceptable, and so video may be paused under those circumstances. In another instance, video and\/or audio compression may be applied where it is determined that circumstances preclude the capture of an acceptable level of quality, but where some continuity of capture is still desired. Processing may also be applied differently to each eye of the eyepiece, such as with respect to a wearer's dominant eye, to varying environmental conditions experienced in one eye verses the other, and the like. Processing may compensate for a bright environment, where an embedded sensor is used to check ambient light levels for possible adjustments to the display of content, such as to determine what color channel compression and\/or manipulation to perform based on the environment, modifying a color curve\/palette to be more or less visible relative to the ambient environment, to vary color depth, color curve, vary how the color is compressed, and the like.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may initiate an action as a result of a sensed condition, such as going to a screen-shot mode while continuing the audio portion of the video when a condition is exceeded, such as exceeding a predetermined amount of movement by the eyepiece, stop taking video if the motion is such as would degrade a predetermined quality level, trigger a change in the video presentation as the motion level is exceeded in the received video, and the like.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may initiate an action as a result of the receipt of a control signal. The control signal could be based on the location of the eyepiece, on what is currently being viewed by the eyepiece or a user gesture. The action could be the upload or download of the video being captured by the eyepiece from a storage location. The action may be initiated solely upon receipt of the control signal itself or by the receipt of the control signal and a confirmation control signal initiated by the user. The action could be the initiation of a process to move to a specific position within the video being displayed by the glasses, bookmark a specific position within the video being displayed by the glasses, and the like.","In embodiments, adjustments made as a result of sensed conditions may be controlled through user preferences, an organizations policy, state or federal regulations, and the like. For instance, it may be a preference to always provide a certain quality, resolution, compression, and the like, no matter what the sensed inputs indicate.","In an example, the wearer of the eyepiece may be in an environment where their head, and thus the integrated camera of the eyepiece, is rapidly shaking while the eyepiece is recording video. In this case the eyepiece may adjust at least one parameter to reduce the extent to which the shaky video is captured, such as increasing the compression being applied to the video, reducing the number of frames being captured per period of time (e.g. capturing a frame every few seconds), discarding frames that have a large change in the image from frame to frame, reducing the spatial resolution, and the like.","In an example, the wearer of the eyepiece may be using video conferencing through the eyepiece where the eyepiece senses through a motion sensor that the wearer is moving. As a result, static images may replace the participant's video feed during this motion, such as for the image of one of the other participants or the user's image as transmitted to the other members. In this way, the distracting effects of the motion of the wearer may be reduced for the wearer and\/or the other participants in the videoconference.","In an example, the wearer may be viewing a video and then begin driving a car, where it may become a safety issue if the wearer continues to view the video as currently displayed. In this instance, the eyepiece may be able to detect the motion of the environment as indicative of being in a car, and alter the viewing experience to be less distracting, such as if the eye movement of the wearer indicates that the user is quickly alternating between the line-of-sight (driving direction) or the field of view directly behind the car, and the displayed video. The eyepiece may for instance halt the video, and present the viewer with options to continue. The eyepiece may further be able to sense the motion of the environment as differentiated between being in a car, a bike, walking, and the like, and adjust accordingly.","In an example, the wearer may need assistance in navigating to a location, whether in a car, on a bike, walking, or the like. In this instance, the eyepiece would display a video navigation application to the user. The navigation instructions that are displayed by the eyepiece to the user could be selected by a control signal. The control signal could be generated by a location specified by the wearer, by what is currently being displayed in the glasses or on a destination spoken by wearer. The location may be one of an eating\/drinking, education, event, exercise, home, outdoors, retail, transportation location, or the like.","In an example, the wearer may be capturing video where the ambient environment is distracting or lowers the quality of the video in some regard, such as because of color contrast, mixture, depth, resolution, brightness, and the like. The eyepiece may adjust for conditions where the wearer is outside verses inside, under different lighting conditions, under unfavorable sound conditions, and the like. In this case, the eyepiece may adjust the image and sound as recorded so as to create a video product that is a more effective representation of the content being captured.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may provide an external interface to computer peripheral devices, such as a monitor, display, TV, keyboards, mice, memory storage (e.g. external hard drive, optical drive, solid state memory), network interface (e.g. to the Internet), and the like. For instance, the external interface may provide direct connectivity to external computer peripheral devices (e.g. connect directly to a monitor), indirect connectivity to external computer peripheral devices (e.g. through a central external peripheral interface device), through a wired connection, though a wireless connection, and the like. In an example, the eyepiece may be able to connect to a central external peripheral interface device that provides connectivity to external peripheral devices, where the external peripheral interface device may include computer interface facilities, such as a computer processor, memory, operating system, peripheral drivers and interfaces, USB port, external display interface, network port, speaker interface, microphone interface, and the like. In embodiments, the eyepiece may be connected to the central external peripheral interface by a wired connection, wireless connection, directly in a cradle, and the like, and when connected may provide the eyepiece with computational facilities similar to or identical to a personal computer. In embodiments, the device selected to be controlled by the eyepiece may be chosen the user looking at the eyepiece, pointing at the eyepiece, selecting from a user interface displayed on the eyepiece, and the like. In other embodiments, the eyepiece may display the user interface of the device when a user looks or points at the device.","The frame  is in a general shape of a pair of wrap-around sunglasses. The sides of the glasses include shape-memory alloy straps , such as nitinol straps. The nitinol or other shape-memory alloy straps are fitted for the user of the augmented reality eyepiece. The straps are tailored so that they assume their trained or preferred shape when worn by the user and warmed to near body temperature. In embodiments, the fit of the eyepiece may provide user eye width alignment techniques and measurements. For instance, the position and\/or alignment of the projected display to the wearer of the eyepiece may be adjustable in position to accommodate the various eye widths of the different wearers. The positioning and\/or alignment may be automatic, such as though detection of the position of the wearer's eyes through the optical system (e.g. iris or pupil detection), or manual, such as by the wearer, and the like.","Other features of this embodiment include detachable, noise-cancelling earbuds. As seen in the figure, the earbuds are intended for connection to the controls of the augmented reality eyepiece for delivering sounds to ears of the user. The sounds may include inputs from the wireless internet or telecommunications capability of the augmented reality eyepiece. The earbuds also include soft, deformable plastic or foam portions, so that the inner ears of the user are protected in a manner similar to earplugs. In one embodiment, the earbuds limit inputs to the user's ears to about 85 dB. This allows for normal hearing by the wearer, while providing protection from gunshot noise or other explosive noises and listening in high background noise environments. In one embodiment, the controls of the noise-cancelling earbuds have an automatic gain control for very fast adjustment of the cancelling feature in protecting the wearer's ears.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0481","num":"0480"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":["2114","2300"]},"A detailed and assembled view of the components of the projector discussed above may be seen in .

The RGB LED light engine  is depicted near the bottom, mounted on heat sink . The holder  is mounted atop the LED light engine , the holder mounting light tunnel , diffuser lens  (to eliminate hotspots) and condenser lens .

For example, the frame rate may triple (over an RGB system) and this may be useful in a night vision and the like situation where the camera is imaging the surroundings, where those images may be processed and displayed as content. The image may be brighter, such as be three times brighter if three LEDs are used, or provide a space savings with only one LED. If multiple LEDs are used, they may be the same color or they could be different (RGB). The system may be a switchable monochrome\/color system where RGB is used but when the wearer wants monochrome they could either choose an individual LED or a number of them. All three LEDs may be used at the same time, as opposed to sequencing, to create white light. Using three LEDs without sequencing may be like any other white light where the frame rate goes up by a factor of three. The \u201cswitching\u201d between monochrome and color may be done \u201cmanually\u201d (e.g. a physical button, a GUI interface selection) or it may be done automatically depending on the application that is running.

The eyepiece further includes one or more integrated processors for handling content for display to the user and an integrated image source, such as a projector facility, for introducing the content to the optical assembly. In embodiments where the image source is a projector, the projector facility includes a light source and the optical display. Light from the light source, such as an RGB module, is emitted under control of the processor and traverses a polarizing beam splitter where it is polarized before being reflected off the optical display, such as the LCoS display or LCD display in certain other embodiments, and into the optical waveguide. A surface of the polarizing beam splitter may reflect the color image from the optical display into the optical waveguide. The RGB LED module may emit light sequentially to form a color image that is reflected off the optical display. The corrective element may be a see-through correction lens that is attached to the optical waveguide to enable proper viewing of the surrounding environment whether the image source is on or off. This corrective element may be a wedge-shaped correction lens, and may be prescription, tinted, coated, or the like. The freeform optical waveguide, which may be described by a higher order polynomial, may include dual freeform surfaces that enable a curvature and a sizing of the waveguide. The curvature and the sizing of the waveguide enable its placement in a frame of the interactive head-mounted eyepiece. This frame may be sized to fit a user's head in a similar fashion to sunglasses or eyeglasses. Other elements of the optical assembly of the eyepiece include a homogenizer through which light from the light source is propagated to ensure that the beam of light is uniform and a collimator that improves the resolution of the light entering the optical waveguide.","In embodiments, the prescription lens may be mounted on the inside of the eyepiece lens or on the outside. In some embodiments, the prescription power may be divided into prescription lenses mounted on the outside and inside of the eyepiece lens. In embodiments, the prescription correction is provided by corrective optics that cling to eyepiece lens or a component of the optical assembly, such as the beamsplitter, such as through surface tension. In embodiments, the corrective optics may be provided in part in one location in the optical path, and in part in another location in the optical path. For example, half of the corrective optics may be provided on the outside of the converging surface of the beamsplitter and the other half on the inside of the converging surface. In this way, correction may be provided differently to the image light from the internal source and to the scene light. That is, the light from the source may only be corrected by the portion of the corrective optics on the inside of the converging lens, as the image is reflected to the eye of the user, and the scene light may be corrected through both portions as the light is transmitted through the beamsplitter, thus being exposed to different optical corrections. In another embodiment, the optical assembly associated with the beamsplitter may be a sealed assembly, such as to make the assembly water proof, dust proof, and the like, where an inner surface of the sealed optical assembly has one portion of the corrective optics and the outside surface of the sealed optical assembly has another portion of the corrective optics. Suitable optics may be provided by 3M's Press-On Optics, which are available at least as Prisms (a.k.a. Fresnel Prisms), Aspheric Minus Lenses, Aspheric Plus Lenses, and Bifocal Lenses.

The diopter correction facility may be adapted to mount to the optical assembly. The diopter correction facility may be adapted to mount to the head-mounted eyepiece. The diopter correction facility may mount using a friction fit. The diopter correction facility may mount using a magnetic attachment facility. The user may select from a plurality of different diopter correction facilities depending on the user's eyesight.","In embodiments, the present disclosure may provide for corrective optics that \u2018snap on\u2019 to the eyepiece, such as where a user removable and replaceable diopter correction facility is adapted to be removably attached in a position between the user's eye and the displayed content such that the diopter correction facility corrects the users eyesight with respect to the displayed content and the surrounding environment.

In embodiments, the waveguide  may be a freeform waveguide, where the surfaces of the waveguide are described by a polynomial equation. The waveguide may be rectilinear. The waveguide  may include two reflective surfaces. When the image light enters the waveguide , it may strike a first surface with an angle of incidence greater than the critical angle above which total internal reflection (TIR) occurs. The image light may engage in TIR bounces between the first surface and a second facing surface, eventually reaching the active viewing area  of the composite lens. In an embodiment, light may engage in at least three TIR bounces. Since the waveguide  tapers to enable the TIR bounces to eventually exit the waveguide, the thickness of the composite lens  may not be uniform. Distortion through the viewing area of the composite lens  may be minimized by disposing a wedge-shaped correction lens  along a length of the freeform waveguide  in order to provide a uniform thickness across at least the viewing area of the lens . The correction lens  may be a prescription lens, a tinted lens, a polarized lens, a ballistic lens, and the like, mounted on the inside or outside of the eyepiece lens, or in some embodiments, mounted on both the inside and outside of the eyepiece lens.","In some embodiments, while the optical waveguide may have a first surface and a second surface enabling total internal reflections of the light entering the waveguide, the light may not actually enter the waveguide at an internal angle of incidence that would result in total internal reflection. The eyepiece may include a mirrored surface on the first surface of the optical waveguide to reflect the displayed content towards the second surface of the optical waveguide. Thus, the mirrored surface enables a total reflection of the light entering the optical waveguide or a reflection of at least a portion of the light entering the optical waveguide. In embodiments, the surface may be 100% mirrored or mirrored to a lower percentage. In some embodiments, in place of a mirrored surface, an air gap between the waveguide and the corrective element may cause a reflection of the light that enters the waveguide at an angle of incidence that would not result in TIR.","In an embodiment, the eyepiece includes an integrated image source, such as a projector, that introduces content for display to the optical assembly from a side of the optical waveguide adjacent to an arm of the eyepiece. As opposed to prior art optical assemblies where image injection occurs from a top side of the optical waveguide, the present disclosure provides image injection to the waveguide from a side of the waveguide. The displayed content aspect ratio is between approximately square to approximately rectangular with the long axis approximately horizontal. In embodiments, the displayed content aspect ratio is 16:9. In embodiments, achieving a rectangular aspect ratio for the displayed content where the long axis is approximately horizontal may be done via rotation of the injected image. In other embodiments, it may be done by stretching the image until it reaches the desired aspect ratio.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0492","num":"0491"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["504","502","502","504","508","520","508","510","502","512","502","508","510"]},"In embodiments such as that shown in , the projected image may be a stereo image when two projectors  are used for the left and right images.

The free end of each of the arms , has a hole, e.g., hole  of arm , for fixedly capturing a shaft  therebetween, as is discussed below (see ). The arm has an anchor portion  where it attaches to the shaft portion  of the yoke . The anchor portion  has a through-hole  for slidably capturing a pin , as is discussed below (see ).","Referring again to , the adjustment mechanism has a first thumbwheel  for controlling the lateral position of the projection screen and a second thumbwheel  for controlling the tilt of the projection screen . The first thumbwheel  extends partially through a slot  in the adjustment platform  and is threadably engaged and supported by the first threaded shaft . The first threaded shaft  is slidably supported in through-holes in third and fourth support blocks ,  (see ). The third and fourth blocks ,  and\/or the sides of the slot  act to prevent the first thumbwheel  from moving laterally. Thus, rotating the thumbwheel  around its axis (indicated by arrow A) causes the first threaded shaft  to move laterally (indicated by arrow B). As best seen in , the first threaded shaft  has a pin  extending radially outward from its bridge-side end. (Note that the threads of the first threaded shaft  are not depicted in the drawings, but may be single or multiple pitch threads.) The pin  is slidably captured by the vertically-oriented through-hole  of the anchor portion  of arm of yoke . When the first thumbwheel  is turned in a direction that causes the first threaded shaft  to advance laterally towards the bridge , the pin  pushes against the bridge  side of through-hole  which, in turn, makes the yoke , the carriage , the frame , and the first projection screen all move laterally toward the bridge  (see arrow C). Similarly, turning the first thumbwheel  in the opposite direction results in the first projection screen moving laterally away from the bridge .","The second thumbwheel  is used to control the tilt of the first projection screen around the axis defined by the carriage shaft  and the yoke shaft portion . Referring now to , the second thumbwheel  is fixedly attached to the narrow portion  of a hollow flanged shaft . The flange portion  of the flanged shaft  threadably receives a threaded shaft portion  of an eyehook . (Note that the threads of the threaded shaft portion  are not depicted in the drawings, but may be single or multiple pitch threads.) In use, the narrow portion  of the flanged shaft  rotatably passes through a countersunk hole  in the adjustment platform  (see ) so that the thumbwheel  is on the bottom side of the adjustment platform  and the eyehook  is on the top side and the flange portion  of the flanged shaft  is captured within the countersunk portion of the countersunk hole . Referring again to , the eye of the eyehook  is slidably engaged around the shaft  which is captured within the holes at the free ends of the yoke arms , . Thus, turning the second thumbwheel  around its axis (as indicated by arrow D) causes the flanged shaft  to turn with it which causes the threaded shaft portion  of the eyehook  to move vertically in or out of the flange portion  (as indicated by arrow E) which cause the eye of the eyehook  to push against the shaft  which, in turn, causes the yoke  to move around its axis thus causing the first projection screen to tilt away from or towards the wearer (as indicated by arrow F).","Referring again to , it is to be noted that the electronics and portions of the projection system are located on a platform  that is fixed to the top of the carriage . Thus, the spatial relationship between the projection screen and its associated electronics and portion of its projection system remains substantially unchanged by any lateral or tilt adjustment that is made to the projection screen ","The AR eyeglass  also includes a similar adjustment mechanism to the adjustment mechanism  just described for laterally positioning and tilting the second projection screen which is located on the wearer's right side of the AR eyepiece .","In an embodiment, the eyepiece may include a slanted or curved guide rail for IPD adjustment that keeps the optics module more in the curved frame. In some embodiments, a display is operably connected to such a slanted or curved guide rail.","In embodiments, the display screen or screens of the AR eyepieces are arranged so as to be parallel to the line connecting the user's eyes. In some embodiment, the display screen or screens are rotated about their vertical axis so that their ends which are near the nose are rotated inward toward the eye, that is \u201ctoed-in\u201d, at an angle that is in the range of about 0.1 to about 5 degrees from being parallel to the line connecting the user's eyes. In some of these latter embodiments, the toe-in angle is permanently fixed, while in other embodiments, the toe-in angle is user-adjustable. In some of the user-adjustable embodiments, the adjustability is limited to two or more preset positions, e.g., those representing near convergence, medium distance convergence, and distant convergence. In other embodiments, the adjustability is continuous. Preferably, in embodiments of the AR eyeglasses which also include automatic vergence corrections as disclosed herein, the amount of toe-in is taken into consideration in the vergence corrections. In embodiments where the toe-in is permanently fixed, the toe-in amount may be included directly in the automatic vergence corrections without the need for a position sensor, but in the user-adjustable embodiments, a position sensor is preferably used to communicate to the processor the amount of toe-in present to use in the vergence correction calculations. In the embodiments in which the toe-in angle is user-adjustable, the adjustment may be made either manually, e.g., by use of a turnwheel that directly or indirectly, e.g., through a drive train, selectably rotates one or both display screens about their vertical axes, or may be motorized to accomplish the selectable rotation when activated by the user through a user interface or a control switch.","In some cases, the toe-in feature may be used to relax the user's eyes during lengthy sessions of activity during which the user's eyes are kept at a particular focus distance, e.g., while reading, watching a monitor, a ball game, or a horizon. The toe-in feature described above may be used in order to adjust for the user's interpupillary distance by effectively rotating the display screens to be better aligned with the user's eyes.","In embodiments, the present disclosure may provide for a mechanical pupil distance adjustment, such as where the optical assembly of the eyepiece is adapted to be user position adjustable within a glasses frame such that the user has the ability to change the position of the optical assembly with respect to the user's eye.

The calibration factor may comprise horizontal and\/or vertical adjustments of the displayed content within the field of view. The calibration factor may comprise a plurality of calibration factors, each representing a distance to a real-world object distance calibration factor to be used when positioning content within the field of view based on a distance to real-world object calculation. The calibration factor may comprise a calibration process based on a plurality of calibration factors, each representing a distance to a real-world object distance calibration factor to be used when positioning content within the field of view based on a distance to real-world object calculation. The positioning of the image can be adjusted on the display to move it within the field of view. Moving the two images further apart will make it appear that the imaged object is getting further away, while moving the images closer together will make the object appear to be closer. The difference in the position of an object within the field of view for each eye is known as the disparity. The disparity relates to the perceived distance that the object is away from the user.","Referring now to , an exploded view of the glasses is depicted.

For example, a gun-mounted camera may enable shooting a target not in direct line of sight when the camera feed is directed to the eyepiece.","The lenses may be chromic, such as photochromic or electrochromic. The electrochromic lens may include integral chromic material or a chromic coating which changes the opacity of at least a portion of the lens in response to a burst of charge applied by the processor across the chromic material. For example, and referring to , a chromic portion  of the lens  is shown darkened, such as for providing greater viewability by the wearer of the eyepiece when that portion is showing displayed content to the wearer. In embodiments, there may be a plurality of chromic areas on the lens that may be controlled independently, such as large portions of the lens, sub-portions of the projected area, programmable areas of the lens and\/or projected area, controlled to the pixel level, and the like. Activation of the chromic material may be controlled via the control techniques further described herein or automatically enabled with certain applications (e.g. a streaming video application, a sun tracking application, an ambient brightness sensor, a camera tracking brightness in the field of view) or in response to a frame-embedded UV sensor. In embodiments, an electrochromic layer may be located between optical elements and\/or on the surface of an optical element on the eyepiece, such as on a corrective lens, on a ballistic lens, and the like. In an example, the electrochromic layer may consist of a stack, such as an Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) coated PET\/PC film with two layers of electrochromic (EC) between, which may eliminate another layer of PET\/PC, thereby reducing reflections (e.g. a layer stack may comprise a PET\/PC-EC-PET\/PC-EC-PET\/PC). In embodiments, the electrically controllable optical layer may be provided as a liquid crystal based solution with a binary state of tint. In other embodiments, multiple layers of liquid crystal or an alternative e-tint forming the optical layer may be used to provide variable tint such that certain layers or segments of the optical layer may be turned on or off in stages. Electrochromic layers may be used generically for any of the electrically controlled transparencies in the eyepiece, including SPD, LCD, electrowetting, and the like.","In embodiments, the lens may have an angular sensitive coating which enables transmitting light-waves with low incident angles and reflecting light, such as s-polarized light, with high incident angles. The chromic coating may be controlled in portions or in its entirety, such as by the control technologies described herein. The lenses may be variable contrast and the contrast may be under the control of a push button or any other control technique described herein. In embodiments, the user may wear the interactive head-mounted eyepiece, where the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content. The optical assembly may include a corrective element that corrects the user's view of the surrounding environment, an integrated processor for handling content for display to the user, and an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly. The optical assembly may include an electrochromic layer that provides a display characteristic adjustment that is dependent on displayed content requirements and surrounding environmental conditions. In embodiments, the display characteristic may be brightness, contrast, and the like. The surrounding environmental condition may be a level of brightness that without the display characteristic adjustment would make the displayed content difficult to visualize by the wearer of the eyepiece, where the display characteristic adjustment may be applied to an area of the optical assembly where content is being displayed.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may have brightness, contrast, spatial, resolution, and the like control over the eyepiece projected area, such as to alter and improve the user's view of the projected content against a bright or dark surrounding environment. For example, a user may be using the eyepiece under bright daylight conditions, and in order for the user to clearly see the displayed content the display area my need to be altered in brightness and\/or contrast. Alternatively, the viewing area surrounding the display area may be altered. In addition, the area altered, whether within the display area or not, may be spatially oriented or controlled per the application being implemented. For instance, only a small portion of the display area may need to be altered, such as when that portion of the display area deviates from some determined or predetermined contrast ratio between the display portion of the display area and the surrounding environment. In embodiments, portions of the lens may be altered in brightness, contrast, spatial extent, resolution, and the like, such as fixed to include the entire display area, adjusted to only a portion of the lens, adaptable and dynamic to changes in lighting conditions of the surrounding environment and\/or the brightness-contrast of the displayed content, and the like. Spatial extent (e.g. the area affected by the alteration) and resolution (e.g. display optical resolution) may vary over different portions of the lens, including high resolution segments, low resolution segments, single pixel segments, and the like, where differing segments may be combined to achieve the viewing objectives of the application(s) being executed. In embodiments, technologies for implementing alterations of brightness, contrast, spatial extent, resolution, and the like, may include electrochromic materials, LCD technologies, embedded beads in the optics, flexible displays, suspension particle device (SPD) technologies, colloid technologies, and the like.","In embodiments, there may be various modes of activation of the electrochromic layer. For example, the user may enter sunglass mode where the composite lenses appear only somewhat darkened or the user may enter \u201cBlackout\u201d mode, where the composite lenses appear completely blackened.","In an example of a technology that may be employed in implementing the alterations of brightness, contrast, spatial extent, resolution, and the like, may be electrochromic materials, films, inks, and the like. Electrochromism is the phenomenon displayed by some materials of reversibly changing appearance when electric charge is applied. Various types of materials and structures can be used to construct electrochromic devices, depending on the specific applications. For instance, electrochromic materials include tungsten oxide (WO), which is the main chemical used in the production of electrochromic windows or smart glass. In embodiments, electrochromic coatings may be used on the lens of the eyepiece in implementing alterations. In another example, electrochromic displays may be used in implementing \u2018electronic paper\u2019, which is designed to mimic the appearance of ordinary paper, where the electronic paper displays reflected light like ordinary paper. In embodiments, electrochromism may be implemented in a wide variety of applications and materials, including gyricon (consisting of polyethylene spheres embedded in a transparent silicone sheet, with each sphere suspended in a bubble of oil so that they can rotate freely), electro-phoretic displays (forming images by rearranging charged pigment particles using an applied electric field), E-Ink technology, electro-wetting, electro-fluidic, interferometric modulator, organic transistors embedded into flexible substrates, nano-chromics displays (NCD), and the like.","In another example of a technology that may be employed in implementing the alterations of brightness, contrast, spatial extent, resolution, and the like, may be suspended particle devices (SPD). When a small voltage is applied to an SPD film, its microscopic particles, which in their stable state are randomly dispersed, become aligned and allow light to pass through. The response may be immediate, uniform, and with stable color throughout the film. Adjustment of the voltage may allow users to control the amount of light, glare and heat passing through. The system's response may range from a dark blue appearance, with up to full blockage of light in its off state, to clear in its on state. In embodiments, SPD technology may be an emulsion applied on a plastic substrate creating the active film. This plastic film may be laminated (as a single glass pane), suspended between two sheets of glass, plastic or other transparent materials, and the like.","Referring to , in certain embodiments, the electro-optics may be mounted in a monocular or binocular flip-up\/flip-down arrangement in two parts: 1) electro-optics; and 2) correction lens.  depicts a two part eyepiece where the electro-optics are contained within a module  that may be electrically connected to the eyepiece  via an electrical connector , such as a plug, pin, socket, wiring, and the like. In this arrangement, the lens  in the frame  may be a correction lens entirely. The interpupillary distance (IPD) between the two halves of the electro-optic module  may be adjusted at the bridge  to accommodate various IPDs. Similarly, the placement of the display  may be adjusted via the bridge .  depicts the binocular electro-optics module  where one half is flipped up and the other half is flipped down. The nose bridge may be fully adjustable and elastomeric. This enables 3-point mounting on nose bridge and ears with a head strap to assure the stability of images in the user's eyes, unlike the instability of helmet-mounted optics, that shift on the scalp. Referring to , the lens  may be ANSI-compliant, hard-coat scratch-resistant polycarbonate ballistic lenses, may be chromic, may have an angular sensitive coating, may include a UV-sensitive material, and the like. In this arrangement, the electro-optics module may include a CMOS-based VIS\/NIR\/SWIR black silicon sensor for night vision capability. The electro-optics module  may feature quick disconnect capability for user flexibility, field replacement and upgrade. The electro-optics module  may feature an integrated power dock.","As in , the flip-up\/flip-down lens  may include a light block . Removable, elastomeric night adapters\/light dams\/light blocks  may be used to shield the flip-up\/flip-down lens , such as for night operations. The exploded top view of the eyepiece also depicts a headstrap , frame , and adjustable nose bridge .  depicts an exploded view of the electro-optic assembly in a front (A) and side angle (B) view. A holder  holds the see-through optic with corrective lens . An O-ring  and screw  secures the holder to the shaft . A spring  provides a spring-loaded connection between the holder  and shaft . The shaft  connects to the attachment bracket , which secures to the eyepiece using the thumbscrew . The shaft  serves as a pivot and an IPD adjustment tool using the IPD adjustment knob . As seen in , the knob  rotates along adjustment threads . The shaft  also features two set screw grooves .","In embodiments, a photochromic layer may be included as part of the optics of the eyepiece. Photochromism is the reversible transformation of a chemical species between two forms by the absorption of electromagnetic radiation, where the two forms have different absorption spectra, such as a reversible change of color, darkness, and the like, upon exposure to a given frequency of light. In an example, a photochromic layer may be included between the waveguide and corrective optics of the eyepiece, on the outside of the corrective optic, and the like. In embodiments, a photochromic layer (such as used as a darkening layer) may be activated with a UV diode, or other photochromic responsive wavelength known in the art. In the case of the photochromic layer being activated with UV light, the eyepiece optics may also include a UV coating outside the photochromic layer to prevent UV light from the Sun from accidentally activating it.","Photochromics are presently fast to change from light to dark and slow to change from dark to light. This due to the molecular changes that are involved with the photochromic material changing from clear to dark. Photochromic molecules are vibrating back to clear after the UV light, such as UV light from the sun, is removed. By increasing the vibration of the molecules, such as by exposure to heat, the optic will clear quicker. The speed at which the photochromic layer goes from dark to light may be temperature-dependent. Rapid changing from dark to light is particularly important for military applications where users of sunglasses often go from a bright outside environment to a dark inside environment and it is important to be able to see quickly in the inside environment.","This disclosure provides a photochromic film device with an attached heater that is used to accelerate the transition from dark to clear in the photochromic material. This method relies on the relationship between the speed of transition of photochromic materials from dark to clear wherein the transition is faster at higher temperatures. To enable the heater to increase the temperature of the photochromic material rapidly, the photochromic material is provided as a thin layer with a thin heater. By keeping the thermal mass of the photochromic film device low per unit area, the heater only has to provide a small amount of heat to rapidly produce a large temperature change in the photochromic material. Since the photochromic material only needs to be at a higher temperature during the transition from dark to clear, the heater only needs to be used for short periods of time so the power requirement is low.","The heater may be a thin and transparent heater element, such as an ITO heater or any other transparent and electrically conductive film material. When a user needs the eyepiece to go clear quickly, the user may activate the heater element by any of the control techniques discussed herein.","In an embodiment, the heater element may be used to calibrate the photochromic element to compensate for cold ambient conditions when the lenses might go dark on their own.","In another embodiment, a thin coat of photochromic material may be deposited on a thick substrate with the heater element layered on top. For example, the cover sunglass lens may comprise an accelerated photochromic solution and still have a separate electrochromic patch over the display area that may optionally be controlled with or without UV light.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0526","num":"0525"},"figref":["FIG. 94A","FIG. 94B"]},"U.S. Pat. No. 3,152,215 describes a heater layer combined with a photochromic layer to heat the photochromic material for the purpose of reducing the time to transition from dark to clear. However, the photochromic layer is positioned in a wedge which would greatly increase the thermal mass of the device and thereby decrease the rate that the heater could change the temperature of the photochromic material or alternately greatly increase the power required to change the temperature of the photochromic material.","This disclosure includes the use of a thin carrier layer that the photochromic material is applied to. The carrier layer can be glass or plastic. The photochromic material can be applied by vacuum coating, by dipping or by thermal diffusion into the carrier layer as is well known in the art. The thickness of the carrier layer can be 150 microns or less. The selection of the thickness of the carrier layer is selected based on the desired darkness of the photochromic film device in the dark state and the desired speed of transition between the dark state and the clear state. Thicker carrier layers can be darker in the dark state while being slower to heat to an elevated temperature due to having more thermal mass. Conversely, thinner carrier layers can be less dark in the dark state while being faster to heat to an elevated temperature due to having less thermal mass.","The protective layer shown in  is separated from the photochromic film device to keep the thermal mass of the photochromic film device low. In this way, the protective layer can be made thicker to provide higher impact strength. The protective layer can be glass or plastic, for example the protective layer can be polycarbonate.","The heater can be a transparent conductor that is patterned into a conductive path that is relatively uniform so that the heat generated over the length of the patterned heater is relatively uniform. An example of a transparent conductor that can be patterned is titanium dioxide. A larger area is provided at the ends of the heater pattern for electrical contacts such as is shown in .","As noted in the discussion for , the augmented reality glasses may include a lens  for each eye of the wearer. The lenses  may be made to fit readily into the frame , so that each lens may be tailored for the person for whom the glasses are intended. Thus, the lenses may be corrective lenses, and may also be tinted for use as sunglasses, or have other qualities suitable for the intended environment. Thus, the lenses may be tinted yellow, dark or other suitable color, or may be photochromic, so that the transparency of the lens decreases when exposed to brighter light. In one embodiment, the lenses may also be designed for snap fitting into or onto the frames, i.e., snap on lenses are one embodiment. For example, the lenses may be made from high-quality Schott optical glass and may include a polarizing filter.","Of course, the lenses need not be corrective lenses; they may simply serve as sunglasses or as protection for the optical system within the frame. In non-flip up\/flip down arrangements, it goes without saying that the outer lenses are important for helping to protect the rather expensive waveguides, viewing systems and electronics within the augmented reality glasses. At a minimum, the outer lenses offer protection from scratching by the environment of the user, whether sand, brambles, thorns and the like, in one environment, and flying debris, bullets and shrapnel, in another environment. In addition, the outer lenses may be decorative, acting to change a look of the composite lens, perhaps to appeal to the individuality or fashion sense of a user. The outer lenses may also help one individual user to distinguish his or her glasses from others, for example, when many users are gathered together.","It is desirable that the lenses be suitable for impact, such as a ballistic impact. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the lenses and the frames meet ANSI Standard Z87.1-2010 for ballistic resistance. In one embodiment, the lenses also meet ballistic standard CE EN166B. In another embodiment, for military uses, the lenses and frames may meet the standards of MIL-PRF-31013, standards 3.5.1.1 or 4.4.1.1. Each of these standards has slightly different requirements for ballistic resistance and each is intended to protect the eyes of the user from impact by high-speed projectiles or debris. While no particular material is specified, polycarbonate, such as certain Lexan\u00ae grades, usually is sufficient to pass tests specified in the appropriate standard.","In one embodiment, as shown in , the lenses snap in from the outside of the frame, not the inside, for better impact resistance, since any impact is expected from the outside of the augmented reality eyeglasses. In this embodiment, replaceable lens  has a plurality of snap-fit arms which fit into recesses of frame . The engagement angle of the arm is greater than 90\u00b0, while the engagement angle of the recess is also greater than 90\u00b0. Making the angles greater than right angles has the practical effect of allowing removal of lens  from the frame . The lens  may need to be removed if the person's vision has changed or if a different lens is desired for any reason. The design of the snap fit is such that there is a slight compression or bearing load between the lens and the frame. That is, the lens may be held firmly within the frame, such as by a slight interference fit of the lens within the frame.","The cantilever snap fit of  is not the only possible way to removably snap-fit the lenses and the frame. For example, an annular snap fit may be used, in which a continuous sealing lip of the frame engages an enlarged edge of the lens, which then snap-fits into the lip, or possibly over the lip. Such a snap fit is typically used to join a cap to an ink pen. This configuration may have an advantage of a sturdier joint with fewer chances for admission of very small dust and dirt particles. Possible disadvantages include the fairly tight tolerances required around the entire periphery of both the lens and frame, and the requirement for dimensional integrity in all three dimensions over time.","It is also possible to use an even simpler interface, which may still be considered a snap-fit. A groove may be molded into an outer surface of the frame, with the lens having a protruding surface, which may be considered a tongue that fits into the groove. If the groove is semi-cylindrical, such as from about 270\u00b0 to about 300\u00b0, the tongue will snap into the groove and be firmly retained, with removal still possible through the gap that remains in the groove. In this embodiment, shown in , a lens or replacement lens or cover  with a tongue  may be inserted into a groove  in a frame , even though the lens or cover is not snap-fit into the frame. Because the fit is a close one, it will act as a snap-fit and securely retain the lens in the frame.","In another embodiment, the frame may be made in two pieces, such as a lower portion and an upper portion, with a conventional tongue-and-groove fit. In another embodiment, this design may also use standard fasteners to ensure a tight grip of the lens by the frame. The design should not require disassembly of anything on the inside of the frame. Thus, the snap-on or other lens or cover should be assembled onto the frame, or removed from the frame, without having to go inside the frame. As noted in other parts of this disclosure, the augmented reality glasses have many component parts. Some of the assemblies and subassemblies may require careful alignment. Moving and jarring these assemblies may be detrimental to their function, as will moving and jarring the frame and the outer or snap-on lens or cover.","In embodiments, the flip-up\/flip-down arrangement enables a modular design for the eyepiece. For example, not only can the eyepiece be equipped with a monocular or binocular module , but the lens  may also be swapped. In embodiments, additional features may be included with the module , either associated with one or both displays . Referring to , either monocular or binocular versions of the module  may be display only  (monocular),  (binocular) or may be equipped with a forward-looking camera  (monocular), and  &  (binocular). In some embodiments, the module may have additional integrated electronics, such as a GPS, a laser range finder, and the like. In the embodiment  enabling urban leader tactical response, awareness & visualization, also known as \u2018Ultra-Vis\u2019, a binocular electro-optic module  is equipped with stereo forward-looking cameras , GPS, and a laser range finder . These features may enable the Ultra-Vis embodiment to have panoramic night vision, and panoramic night vision with laser range finder and geo location.","In an embodiment, the electro-optics

embodiment, an augmented reality eyepiece may include electrically-controlled lenses as part of the microprojector or as part of the optics between the microprojector and the waveguide.  depicts an embodiment with such liquid lenses .","The glasses may also include at least one camera or optical sensor  that may furnish an image or images for viewing by the user. The images are formed by a microprojector  on each side of the glasses for conveyance to the waveguide  on that side. In one embodiment, an additional optical element, a variable focus lens  may also be furnished. The lens may be electrically adjustable by the user so that the image seen in the waveguides  are focused for the user. In embodiments, the camera may be a multi-lens camera, such as an \u2018array camera\u2019, where the eyepiece processor may combine the data from the multiple lenses and multiple viewpoints of the lenses to build a single high-quality image. This technology may be referred to as computational imaging, since software is used to process the image. Computational imaging may provide image-processing advantages, such as allowing processing of the composite image as a function of individual lens images. For example, since each lens may provide its own image, the processor may provide image processing to create images with special focusing, such as foveal imaging, where the focus from one of the lens images is clear, higher resolution, and the like, and where the rest of the image is defocused, lower resolution, and the like. The processor may also select portions of the composite image to store in memory, while deleting the rest, such as when memory storage is limited and only portions of the composite image are critical to save. In embodiments, use of the array camera may provide the ability to alter the focus of an image after the image has been taken. In addition to the imaging advantages of an array camera, the array camera may provide a thinner mechanical profile than a traditional single-lens assembly, thus making it easier to integrate into the eyepiece.","Variable lenses may include the so-called liquid lenses furnished by Varioptic, S. A., Lyons, France, or by LensVector, Inc., Mountain View, Calif., U.S.A. Such lenses may include a central portion with two immiscible liquids. Typically, in these lenses, the path of light through the lens, i.e., the focal length of the lens is altered or focused by applying an electric potential between electrodes immersed in the liquids. At least one of the liquids is affected by the resulting electric or magnetic field potential. Thus, electrowetting may occur, as described in U.S. Pat. Appl. Publ. 2010\/0007807, assigned to LensVector, Inc. Other techniques are described in LensVector Pat. Appl. Publs. 2009\/021331 and 2009\/0316097. All three of these disclosures are incorporated herein by reference, as though each page and figures were set forth verbatim herein.","Other patent documents from Varioptic, S. A., describe other devices and techniques for a variable focus lens, which may also work through an electrowetting phenomenon. These documents include U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,245,440 and 7,894,440 and U.S. Pat. Appl. Publs. 2010\/0177386 and 2010\/0295987, each of which is also incorporated herein by reference, as though each page and figures were set forth verbatim herein. In these documents, the two liquids typically have different indices of refraction and different electrical conductivities, e.g., one liquid is conductive, such as an aqueous liquid, and the other liquid is insulating, such as an oily liquid. Applying an electric potential may change the thickness of the lens and does change the path of light through the lens, thus changing the focal length of the lens.","The electrically-adjustable lenses may be controlled by the controls of the glasses. In one embodiment, a focus adjustment is made by calling up a menu from the controls and adjusting the focus of the lens. The lenses may be controlled separately or may be controlled together. The adjustment is made by physically turning a control knob, by indicating with a gesture, or by voice command. In another embodiment, the augmented reality glasses may also include a rangefinder, and focus of the electrically-adjustable lenses may be controlled automatically by pointing the rangefinder, such as a laser rangefinder, to a target or object a desired distance away from the user.","As shown in U.S. Pat. No. 7,894,440, discussed above, the variable lenses may also be applied to the outer lenses of the augmented reality glasses or eyepiece. In one embodiment, the lenses may simply take the place of a corrective lens. The variable lenses with their electric-adjustable control may be used instead of or in addition to the image source- or projector-mounted lenses. The corrective lens inserts provide corrective optics for the user's environment, the outside world, whether the waveguide displays are active or not.","It is important to stabilize the images presented to the wearer of the augmented reality glasses or eyepiece(s), that is, the images seen in the waveguide. The view or images presented travel from one or two digital cameras or sensors mounted on the eyepiece, to digital circuitry, where the images are processed and, if desired, stored as digital data before they appear in the display of the glasses. In any event, and as discussed above, the digital data is then used to form an image, such as by using an LCOS display and a series of RGB light emitting diodes. The light images are processed using a series of lenses, a polarizing beam splitter, an electrically-powered liquid corrective lens and at least one transition lens from the projector to the waveguide.","The process of gathering and presenting images includes several mechanical and optical linkages between components of the augmented reality glasses. It seems clear, therefore, that some form of stabilization will be required. This may include optical stabilization of the most immediate cause, the camera itself, since it is mounted on a mobile platform, the glasses, which themselves are movably mounted on a mobile user. Accordingly, camera stabilization or correction may be required. In addition, at least some stabilization or correction should be used for the liquid variable lens. Ideally, a stabilization circuit at that point could correct not only for the liquid lens, but also for any aberration and vibration from many parts of the circuit upstream from the liquid lens, including the image source. One advantage of the present system is that many commercial off-the-shelf cameras are very advanced and typically have at least one image-stabilization feature or option. Thus, there may be many embodiments of the present disclosure, each with a same or a different method of stabilizing an image or a very fast stream of images, as discussed below. The term optical stabilization is typically used herein with the meaning of physically stabilizing the camera, camera platform, or other physical object, while image stabilization refers to data manipulation and processing.","One technique of image stabilization is performed on digital images as they are formed. This technique may use pixels outside the border of the visible frame as a buffer for the undesired motion. Alternatively, the technique may use another relatively steady area or basis in succeeding frames. This technique is applicable to video cameras, shifting the electronic image from frame to frame of the video in a manner sufficient to counteract the motion. This technique does not depend on sensors and directly stabilizes the images by reducing vibrations and other distracting motion from the moving camera. In some techniques, the speed of the images may be slowed in order to add the stabilization process to the remainder of the digital process, and requiring more time per image. These techniques may use a global motion vector calculated from frame-to-frame motion differences to determine the direction of the stabilization.","Optical stabilization for images uses a gravity- or electronically-driven mechanism to move or adjust an optical element or imaging sensor such that it counteracts the ambient vibrations. Another way to optically stabilize the displayed content is to provide gyroscopic correction or sensing of the platform housing the augmented reality glasses, e.g., the user. As noted above, the sensors available and used on the augmented reality glasses or eyepiece include MEMS gyroscopic sensors. These sensors capture movement and motion in three dimensions in very small increments and can be used as feedback to correct the images sent from the camera in real time. It is clear that at least a large part of the undesired and undesirable movement probably is caused by movement of the user and the camera itself. These larger movements may include gross movements of the user, e.g., walking or running, riding in a vehicle. Smaller vibrations may also result within the augmented reality eyeglasses, that is, vibrations in the components in the electrical and mechanical linkages that form the path from the camera (input) to the image in the waveguide (output). These gross movements may be more important to correct or to account for, rather than, for instance, independent and small movements in the linkages of components downstream from the projector. In embodiments, the gyroscopic stabilization may stabilize the image when it is subject to a periodic motion. For such periodic motion, the gyroscope may determine the periodicity of the user's motion and transmit the information to a processor to correct for the placement of content in the user's view. The gyroscope may utilize a rolling average of two or three or more cycles of periodic motion in determining the periodicity. Other sensors may also be used to stabilize the image or correctly place the image in the user's field of view, such as an accelerometer, a position sensor, a distance sensor, a rangefinder, a biological sensor, a geodetic sensor, an optical sensor, a video sensor, a camera, an infrared sensor, a light sensor, a photocell sensor, or an RF sensor. When a sensor detects user head or eye movement, the sensor provides an output to a processor which may determine the direction, speed, amount, and rate of the user's head or eye movement. The processor may convert this information into a suitable data structure for further processing by the processor controlling the optical assembly (which may be the same processor). The data structure may be one or more vector quantities. For example, the direction of the vector may define the orientation of the movement, and the length of the vector may define the rate of the movement. Using the processed sensor output, the display of content is adjusted accordingly.","Motion sensing may thus be used to sense the motion and correct for it, as in optical stabilization, or to sense the motion and then correct the images that are being taken and processed, as in image stabilization. An apparatus for sensing motion and correcting the images or the data is depicted in . In this apparatus, one or more kinds of motion sensors may be used, including accelerometers, angular position sensors or gyroscopes, such as MEMS gyroscopes. Data from the sensors is fed back to the appropriate sensor interfaces, such as analog to digital converters (ADCs) or other suitable interface, such as digital signal processors (DSPs). A microprocessor then processes this information, as discussed above, and sends image-stabilized frames to the display driver and then to the see-through display or waveguide discussed above. In one embodiment, the display begins with the RGB display in the microprojector of the augmented reality eyepiece.","In another embodiment, a video sensor or augmented reality glasses, or other device with a video sensor may be mounted on a vehicle. In this embodiment, the video stream may be communicated through a telecommunication capability or an Internet capability to personnel in the vehicle. One application could be sightseeing or touring of an area. Another embodiment could be exploring or reconnaissance, or even patrolling, of an area. In these embodiments, gyroscopic stabilization of the image sensor would be helpful, rather than applying a gyroscopic correction to the images or digital data representing the images. An embodiment of this technique is depicted in . In this technique, a camera or image sensor  is mounted on a vehicle . One or more motion sensors , such as gyroscopes, are mounted in the camera assembly . A stabilizing platform  receives information from the motion sensors and stabilizes the camera assembly , so that jitter and wobble are minimized while the camera operates. This is true optical stabilization. Alternatively, the motion sensors or gyroscopes may be mounted on or within the stabilizing platform itself. This technique would actually provide optical stabilization, stabilizing the camera or image sensor, in contrast to digital stabilization, correcting the image afterwards by computer processing of the data taken by the camera.","In one technique, the key to optical stabilization is to apply the stabilization or correction before an image sensor converts the image into digital information. In one technique, feedback from sensors, such as gyroscopes or angular velocity sensors, is encoded and sent to an actuator that moves the image sensor, much as an autofocus mechanism adjusts a focus of a lens. The image sensor is moved in such a way as to maintain the projection of the image onto the image plane, which is a function of the focal length of the lens being used. Autoranging and focal length information, perhaps from a range finder of the interactive head-mounted eyepiece, may be acquired through the lens itself. In another technique, angular velocity sensors, sometimes also called gyroscopic sensors, can be used to detect, respectively, horizontal and vertical movements. The motion detected may then be fed back to electromagnets to move a floating lens of the camera. This optical stabilization technique, however, would have to be applied to each lens contemplated, making the result rather expensive.","Stabilization of the liquid lens is discussed in U.S. Pat. Appl. Publ. 2010\/0295987, assigned to Varioptic, S. A., Lyon, France. In theory, control of a liquid lens is relatively simple, since there is only one variable to control: the level of voltage applied to the electrodes in the conducting and non-conducting liquids of the lens, using, for examples, the lens housing and the cap as electrodes. Applying a voltage causes a change or tilt in the liquid-liquid interface via the electrowetting effect. This change or tilt adjusts the focus or output of the lens. In its most basic terms, a control scheme with feedback would then apply a voltage and determine the effect of the applied voltage on the result, i.e., a focus or an astigmatism of the image. The voltages may be applied in patterns, for example, equal and opposite + and \u2212 voltages, both positive voltages of differing magnitude, both negative voltages of differing magnitude, and so forth. Such lenses are known as electrically variable optic lenses or electro-optic lenses.","Voltages may be applied to the electrodes in patterns for a short period of time and a check on the focus or astigmatism made. The check may be made, for instance, by an image sensor. In addition, sensors on the camera or in this case the lens, may detect motion of the camera or lens. Motion sensors would include accelerometers, gyroscopes, angular velocity sensors or piezoelectric sensors mounted on the liquid lens or a portion of the optic train very near the liquid lens. In one embodiment, a table, such as a calibration table, is then constructed of voltages applied and the degree of correction or voltages needed for given levels of movement. More sophistication may also be added, for example, by using segmented electrodes in different portions of the liquid so that four voltages may be applied rather than two. Of course, if four electrodes are used, four voltages may be applied, in many more patterns than with only two electrodes. These patterns may include equal and opposite positive and negative voltages to opposite segments, and so forth. An example is depicted in . Four electrodes  are mounted within a liquid lens housing (not shown). Two electrodes are mounted in or near the non-conducting liquid and two are mounted in or near the conducting liquid. Each electrode is independent in terms of the possible voltage that may be applied.","Look-up or calibration tables may be constructed and placed in the memory of the augmented reality glasses. In use, the accelerometer or other motion sensor will sense the motion of the glasses, i.e., the camera on the glasses or the lens itself. A motion sensor such as an accelerometer will sense in particular, small vibration-type motions that interfere with smooth delivery of images to the waveguide. In one embodiment, the image stabilization techniques described here can be applied to the electrically-controllable liquid lens so that the image from the projector is corrected immediately. This will stabilize the output of the projector, at least partially correcting for the vibration and movement of the augmented reality eyepiece, as well as at least some movement by the user. There may also be a manual control for adjusting the gain or other parameter of the corrections. Note that this technique may also be used to correct for near-sightedness or far-sightedness of the individual user, in addition to the focus adjustment already provided by the image sensor controls and discussed as part of the adjustable-focus projector.","Another variable focus element uses tunable liquid crystal cells to focus an image. These are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Appl. Publ. Nos. 2009\/0213321, 2009\/0316097 and 2010\/0007807, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety and relied on. In this method, a liquid crystal material is contained within a transparent cell, preferably with a matching index of refraction. The cell includes transparent electrodes, such as those made from indium tin oxide (ITO). Using one spiral-shaped electrode, and a second spiral-shaped electrode or a planar electrode, a spatially non-uniform magnetic field is applied. Electrodes of other shapes may be used. The shape of the magnetic field determines the rotation of molecules in the liquid crystal cell to achieve a change in refractive index and thus a focus of the lens. The liquid crystals can thus be electromagnetically manipulated to change their index of refraction, making the tunable liquid crystal cell act as a lens.","In a first embodiment, a tunable liquid crystal cell  is depicted in . The cell includes an inner layer of liquid crystal  and thin layers  of orienting material such as polyimide. This material helps to orient the liquid crystals in a preferred direction. Transparent electrodes  are on each side of the orienting material. An electrode may be planar, or may be spiral shaped as shown on the right in . Transparent glass substrates  contain the materials within the cell. The electrodes are formed so that they will lend shape to the magnetic field. As noted, a spiral shaped electrode on one or both sides, such that the two are not symmetrical, is used in one embodiment. A second embodiment is depicted in . Tunable liquid crystal cell  includes central liquid crystal material , transparent glass substrate walls , and transparent electrodes. Bottom electrode  is planar, while top electrode  is in the shape of a spiral. Transparent electrodes may be made of indium tin oxide (ITO).","Additional electrodes may be used for quick reversion of the liquid crystal to a non-shaped or natural state. A small control voltage is thus used to dynamically change the refractive index of the material the light passes through. The voltage generates a spatially non-uniform magnetic field of a desired shape, allowing the liquid crystal to function as a lens.","In one embodiment, the camera includes the black silicon, short wave infrared (SWIR) CMOS sensor described elsewhere in this patent. In another embodiment, the camera is a 5 megapixel (MP) optically-stabilized video sensor. In one embodiment, the controls include a 3 GHz microprocessor or microcontroller, and may also include a 633 MHz digital signal processor with a 30 M polygon\/second graphic accelerator for real-time image processing for images from the camera or video sensor. In one embodiment, the augmented reality glasses may include a wireless internet, radio or telecommunications capability for wideband, personal area network (PAN), local area network (LAN), a wide local area network, WLAN, conforming to IEEE 802.11, or reach-back communications. The equipment furnished in one embodiment includes a Bluetooth capability, conforming to IEEE 802.15. In one embodiment, the augmented reality glasses include an encryption system, such as a 256-bit Advanced Encryption System (AES) encryption system or other suitable encryption program, for secure communications.","In one embodiment, the wireless telecommunications may include a capability for a 3G or 4G network and may also include a wireless internet capability. In order for an extended life, the augmented reality eyepiece or glasses may also include at least one lithium-ion battery, and as discussed above, a recharging capability. The recharging plug may comprise an AC\/DC power converter and may be capable of using multiple input voltages, such as 120 or 240 VAC. The controls for adjusting the focus of the adjustable focus lenses in one embodiment comprises a 2D or 3D wireless air mouse or other non-contact control responsive to gestures or movements of the user. A 2D mouse is available from Logitech, Fremont, Calif., USA. A 3D mouse is described herein, or others such as the Cideko AVK05 available from Cideko, Taiwan, R.O.C, may be used.","In an embodiment, the eyepiece may comprise electronics suitable for controlling the optics, and associated systems, including a central processing unit, non-volatile memory, digital signal processors, 3-D graphics accelerators, and the like. The eyepiece may provide additional electronic elements or features, including inertial navigation systems, cameras, microphones, audio output, power, communication systems, sensors, stopwatch or chronometer functions, thermometer, vibratory temple motors, motion sensor, a microphone to enable audio control of the system, a UV sensor to enable contrast and dimming with photochromic materials, and the like.","In an embodiment, the central processing unit (CPU) of the eyepiece may be an OMAP 4, with dual 1 GHz processor cores. The CPU may include a 633 MHz DSP, giving a capability for the CPU of 30 million polygons\/second.","The system may also provide dual micro-SD (secure digital) slots for provisioning of additional removable non-volatile memory.","An on-board camera may provide 1.3 MP color and record up to 60 minutes of video footage. The recorded video may be transferred wirelessly or using a mini-USB transfer device to off-load footage.","The communications system-on-a-chip (SOC) may be capable of operating with wide local area networks (WLAN), Bluetooth version 3.0, a GPS receiver, an FM radio, and the like.","The eyepiece may operate on a 3.6 VDC lithium-ion rechargeable battery for long battery life and ease of use. An additional power source may be provided through solar cells on the exterior of the frame of the system. These solar cells may supply power and may also be capable of recharging the lithium-ion battery.","The total power consumption of the eyepiece may be approximately 400 mW, but is variable depending on features and applications used. For example, processor-intensive applications with significant video graphics demand more power, and will be closer to 400 mW. Simpler, less video-intensive applications will use less power. The operation time on a charge also may vary with application and feature usage.","The micro-projector illumination engine, also known herein as the projector, may include multiple light emitting diodes (LEDs). In order to provide life-like color, Osram red, Cree green, and Cree blue LEDs are used. These are die-based LEDs. The RGB engine may provide an adjustable color output, allowing a user to optimize viewing for various programs and applications.","In embodiments, illumination may be added to the glasses or controlled through various means. For example, LED lights or other lights may be embedded in the frame of the eyepiece, such as in the nose bridge, around the composite lens, or at the temples.","The intensity of the illumination and or the color of illumination may be modulated. Modulation may be accomplished through the various control technologies described herein, through various applications, filtering and magnification.","By way of example, illumination may be modulated through various control technologies described herein such as through the adjustment of a control knob, a gesture, eye movement, or voice command. If a user desires to increase the intensity of illumination, the user may adjust a control knob on the glasses or he may adjust a control knob in the user interface displayed on the lens or by other means. The user may use eye movements to control the knob displayed on the lens or he may control the knob by other means. The user may adjust illumination through a movement of the hand or other body movement such that the intensity or color of illumination changes based on the movement made by the user. Also, the user may adjust the illumination through a voice command such as by speaking a phrase requesting increased or decreased illumination or requesting other colors to be displayed. Additionally, illumination modulation may be achieved through any control technology described herein or by other means.","Further, the illumination may be modulated per the particular application being executed. As an example, an application may automatically adjust the intensity of illumination or color of illumination based on the optimal settings for that application. If the current levels of illumination are not at the optimal levels for the application being executed, a message or command may be sent to provide for illumination adjustment.","In embodiments, illumination modulation may be accomplished through filtering and or through magnification. For example, filtering techniques may be employed that allow the intensity and or color of the light to be changed such that the optimal or desired illumination is achieved. Also, in embodiments, the intensity of the illumination may be modulated by applying greater or less magnification to reach the desired illumination intensity.","The projector may be connected to the display to output the video and other display elements to the user. The display used may be an SVGA 800\u00d7600 dots\/inch SYNDIANT liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) display.","The target MPE dimensions for the system may be 24 mm\u00d712 mm\u00d76 mm.","The focus may be adjustable, allowing a user to refine the projector output to suit their needs.","The optics system may be contained within a housing fabricated for 6061-T6 aluminum and glass-filled ABS\/PC.","The weight of the system, in an embodiment, is estimated to be 3.75 ounces, or 95 grams.","In an embodiment, the eyepiece and associated electronics provide night vision capability. This night vision capability may be enabled by a black silicon SWIR sensor. Black silicon is a complementary metal-oxide silicon (CMOS) processing technique that enhances the photo response of silicon over 100 times. The spectral range is expanded deep into the short wave infra-red (SWIR) wavelength range. In this technique, a 300 nm deep absorbing and anti-reflective layer is added to the glasses. This layer offers improved responsivity as shown in , where the responsivity of black silicon is much greater than silicon's over the visible and NIR ranges and extends well into the SWIR range. This technology is an improvement over current technology, which suffers from extremely high cost, performance issues, as well as high volume manufacturability problems. Incorporating this technology into night vision optics brings the economic advantages of CMOS technology into the design.","Unlike current night-vision goggles (NVGs), which amplify starlight or other ambient light from the visible light spectrum, SWIR sensors pick up individual photons and convert light in the SWIR spectrum to electrical signals, similar to digital photography. The photons can be produced from the natural recombination of oxygen and hydrogen atoms in the atmosphere at night, also referred to as \u201cNight Glow.\u201d Shortwave infrared devices see objects at night by detecting the invisible, shortwave infrared radiation within reflected star light, city lights or the moon. They also work in daylight, or through fog, haze or smoke, whereas the current NVG Image Intensifier infrared sensors would be overwhelmed by heat or brightness. Because shortwave infrared devices pick up invisible radiation on the edge of the visible spectrum, the SWIR images look like the images produced by visible light with the same shadows and contrast and facial details, only in black and white, dramatically enhancing recognition so people look like people; they don't look like blobs often seen with thermal Imagers. One of the important SWIR capabilities is of providing views of targeting lasers on the battlefield. Targeting lasers (1.064 um) are not visible with current night-vision goggles. With SWIR Electro-optics, soldiers will be able to view every targeting laser in use, including those used by the enemy. Unlike Thermal Imagers, which do not penetrate windows on vehicles or buildings, the Visible\/Near Infrared\/Short Wave Infrared Sensor can see through them\u2014day or night, giving users an important tactical advantage.","Certain advantages include using active illumination only when needed. In some instances there may be sufficient natural illumination at night, such as during a full moon. When such is the case, artificial night vision using active illumination may not be necessary. With black silicon CMOS-based SWIR sensors, active illumination may not be needed during these conditions, and is not provided, thus improving battery life.","In addition, a black silicon image sensor may have over eight times the signal to noise ratio found in costly indium-gallium arsenide image sensors under night sky conditions. Better resolution is also provided by this technology, offering much higher resolution than available using current technology for night vision. Typically, long wavelength images produced by CMOS-based SWIR have been difficult to interpret, having good heat detection, but poor resolution. This problem is solved with a black image silicon SWIR sensor, which relies on much shorter wavelengths. SWIR is highly desirable for battlefield night vision glasses for these reasons.  illustrates the effectiveness of black silicon night vision technology, providing both before and after images of seeing through a) dust; b) fog, and c) smoke. The images in  demonstrate the performance of the new VIS\/NIR\/SWIR black silicon sensor. In embodiments, the image sensor may be able to distinguish between changes in the natural environment, such as disturbed vegetation, disturbed ground, and the like. For example, an enemy combatant may have recently placed an explosive device in the ground, and so the ground over the explosive will be \u2018disturbed ground\u2019, and the image sensor (along with processing facilities internal or external to the eyepiece) may be able to distinguish the recently disturbed ground from the surrounding ground. In this way, a soldier may be able to detect the possible placement of an underground explosive device (e.g. an improvised explosive device (IED)) from a distance.","Previous night vision systems suffered from \u201cblooms\u201d from bright light sources, such as streetlights. These \u201cblooms\u201d were particularly strong in image intensifying technology and are also associated with a loss of resolution. In some cases, cooling systems are necessary in image intensifying technology systems, increasing weight and shortening battery power lifespan.  shows the difference in image quality between A) a flexible platform of uncooled CMOS image sensors capable of VIS\/NIR\/SWIR imaging and B) an image intensified night vision system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0587","num":"0586"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 13A","FIG. 13B"],"b":["1300","1307","1301","1302","1303","1304","1305","1306","1307","1308","1309"]},"These advantages derive from the CMOS compatible processing technique that enhances the photo response of silicon over 100 times and extends the spectral range deep into the short wave infrared region. The difference in responsivity is illustrated in . While typical night vision goggles are limited to the UV, visible and near infrared (NIR) ranges, to about 1100 nm (1.1 micrometers) the newer CMOS image sensor ranges also include the short wave infrared (SWIR) spectrum, out to as much as 2000 nm (2 micrometers).","The black silicon core technology may offer significant improvement over current night vision glasses. Femtosecond laser doping may enhance the light detection properties of silicon across a broad spectrum. Additionally, optical response may be improved by a factor of 100 to 10,000. The black silicon technology is a fast, scalable, and CMOS compatible technology at a very low cost, compared to current night vision systems. Black silicon technology may also provide a low operation bias, with 3.3 V typical. In addition, uncooled performance may be possible up to 50\u00b0 C. Cooling requirements of current technology increase both weight and power consumption, and also create discomfort in users. As noted above, the black silicon core technology offers a high-resolution replacement for current image intensifier technology. Black silicon core technology may provide high speed electronic shuttering at speeds up to 1000 frames\/second with minimal cross talk. In certain embodiments of the night vision eyepiece, an OLED display may be preferred over other optical displays, such as the LCoS display.","The eyepiece incorporating the VIS\/NIR\/SWIR black silicon sensor may provide for better situational awareness (SAAS) surveillance and real-time image enhancement.","In some embodiments, the VIS\/NIR\/SWIR black silicon sensor may be incorporated into a form factor suitable for night vision only, such as a night vision goggle or a night vision helmet. The night vision goggle may include features that make it suitable for the military market, such as ruggedization and alternative power supplies, while other form factors may be suitable for the consumer or toy market. In one example, the night vision goggles may have extended range, such as 500-1200 nm, and may also useable as a camera.","In some embodiments, the VIS\/NIR\/SWIR black silicon sensor as well as other outboard sensors may be incorporated into a mounted camera that may be mounted on transport or combat vehicles so that the real-time feed can be sent to the driver or other occupants of the vehicle by superimposing the video on the forward view without obstructing it. The driver can better see where he or she is going, the gunner can better see threats or targets of opportunity, and the navigator can better sense situational awareness (SAAS) while also looking for threats. The feed could also be sent to off-site locations as desired, such as higher headquarters of memory\/storage locations for later use in targeting, navigation, surveillance, data mining, and the like.","Further advantages of the eyepiece may include robust connectivity. This connectivity enables download and transmission using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi\/Internet, cellular, satellite, 3G, FM\/AM, TV, and UVB transceiver for sending\/receiving vast amounts of data quickly. For example, the UWB transceiver may be used to create a very high data rate, low-probability-of-intercept\/low-probability-of-detection (LPI\/LPD), Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) to connect weapons sights, weapons-mounted mouse\/controller, E\/O sensors, medical sensors, audio\/video displays, and the like. In other embodiments, the WPAN may be created using other communications protocols. For example, a WPAN transceiver may be a COTS-compliant module front end to make the power management of a combat radio highly responsive and to avoid jeopardizing the robustness of the radio. By integrating the ultra wideband (UWB) transceiver, baseband\/MAC and encryption chips onto a module, a physically small dynamic and configurable transceiver to address multiple operational needs is obtained. The WPAN transceivers create a low power, encrypted, wireless personal area network (WPAN) between soldier worn devices. The WPAN transceivers can be attached or embedded into nearly any fielded military device with a network interface (handheld computers, combat displays, etc.). The system is capable of supporting many users, AES encryption, robust against jamming and RF interference as well as being ideal for combat providing low probabilities of interception and detection (LPI\/LPD). The WPAN transceivers eliminate the bulk, weight and \u201csnagability\u201d of data cables on the soldier. Interfaces include USB 1.1, USB 2.0 OTG, Ethernet 10-, 100 Base-T and RS232 9-pin D-Sub. The power output may be \u221210, \u221220 dBm outputs for a variable range of up to 2 meters. The data capacity may be 768 Mbps and greater. The bandwidth may be 1.7 GHz. Encryption may be 128-bit, 192-bit or 256-bit AES. The WPAN transceiver may include Optimized Message Authentication Code (MAC) generation. The WPAN transceiver may comply to MIL-STD-461F. The WPAN transceiver may be in the form of a connector dust cap and may attach to any fielded military device. The WPAN transceiver allows simultaneous video, voice, stills, text and chat, eliminates the need for data cables between electronic devices, allows hands-free control of multiple devices without distraction, features an adjustable connectivity range, interfaces with Ethernet and USB 2.0, features an adjustable frequency 3.1 to 10.6 GHz and 200 mw peak draw and nominal standby.","For example, the WPAN transceiver may enable creating a WPAN between the eyepiece  in the form of a GSE stereo heads-up combat display glasses, a computer, a remote computer controller, and biometric enrollment devices like that seen in . In another example, the WPAN transceiver may enable creating a WPAN between the eyepiece in the form of flip-up\/-down heads-up display combat glasses, the HUD CPU (if it is external), a weapon fore-grip controller, and a forearm computer similar to that seen in .","The eyepiece may provide its own cellular connectivity, such as though a personal wireless connection with a cellular system. The personal wireless connection may be available for only the wearer of the eyepiece, or it may be available to a plurality of proximate users, such as in a Wi-Fi hot spot (e.g. WiFi), where the eyepiece provides a local hotspot for others to utilize. These proximate users may be other wearers of an eyepiece, or users of some other wireless computing device, such as a mobile communications facility (e.g. mobile phone). Through this personal wireless connection, the wearer may not need other cellular or Internet wireless connections to connect to wireless services. For instance, without a personal wireless connection integrated into the eyepiece, the wearer may have to find a WiFi connection point or tether to their mobile communications facility in order to establish a wireless connection. In embodiments, the eyepiece may be able to replace the need for having a separate mobile communications device, such as a mobile phone, mobile computer, and the like, by integrating these functions and user interfaces into the eyepiece. For instance, the eyepiece may have an integrated WiFi connection or hotspot, a real or virtual keyboard interface, a USB hub, speakers (e.g. to stream music to) or speaker input connections, integrated camera, external camera, and the like. In embodiments, an external device, in connectivity with the eyepiece, may provide a single unit with a personal network connection (e.g. WiFi, cellular connection), keyboard, control pad (e.g. a touch pad), and the like.","Communications from the eyepiece may include communication links for special purposes. For instance, an ultra-wide bandwidth communications link may be utilized when sending and\/or receiving large volumes of data in a short amount of time. In another instance, a near-field communications (NFC) link may be used with very limited transmission range in order to post information to transmit to personnel when they are very near, such as for tactical reasons, for local directions, for warnings, and the like. For example, a soldier may be able to post\/hold information securely, and transmit only to people very nearby with a need-to-know or need-to-use the information. In another instance, a wireless personal area network (PAN) may be utilized, such as to connect weapons sights, weapons-mounted mouse\/controller, electro-optic sensors, medical sensors, audio-visual displays, and the like.","The eyepiece may include MEMS-based inertial navigation systems, such as a GPS processor, an accelerometer (e.g. for enabling head control of the system and other functions), a gyroscope, an altimeter, an inclinometer, a speedometer\/odometer, a laser rangefinder, and a magnetometer, which also enables image stabilization.","The eyepiece may include integrated headphones, such as the articulating earbud , that provide audio output to the user or wearer.","In an embodiment, a forward facing camera (see ) integrated with the eyepiece may enable basic augmented reality. In augmented reality, a viewer can image what is being viewed and then layer an augmented, edited, tagged, or analyzed version on top of the basic view. In the alternative, associated data may be displayed with or over the basic image. If two cameras are provided and are mounted at the correct interpupillary distance for the user, stereo video imagery may be created. This capability may be useful for persons requiring vision assistance. Many people suffer from deficiencies in their vision, such as near-sightedness, far-sightedness, and so forth. A camera and a very close, virtual screen as described herein provides a \u201cvideo\u201d for such persons, the video adjustable in terms of focal point, nearer or farther, and fully in control by the person via voice or other command. This capability may also be useful for persons suffering diseases of the eye, such as cataracts, retinitis pigmentosa, and the like. So long as some organic vision capability remains, an augmented reality eyepiece can help a person see more clearly. Embodiments of the eyepiece may feature one or more of magnification, increased brightness, and ability to map content to the areas of the eye that are still healthy. Embodiments of the eyepiece may be used as bifocals or a magnifying glass. The wearer may be able to increase zoom in the field of view or increase zoom within a partial field of view. In an embodiment, an associated camera may make an image of the object and then present the user with a zoomed picture. A user interface may allow a wearer to point at the area that he wants zoomed, such as with the control techniques described herein, so the image processing can stay on task as opposed to just zooming in on everything in the camera's field of view.","A rear-facing camera (not shown) may also be incorporated into the eyepiece in a further embodiment. In this embodiment, the rear-facing camera may enable eye control of the eyepiece, with the user making application or feature selection by directing his or her eyes to a specific item displayed on the eyepiece.","A further embodiment of a device for capturing biometric data about individuals may incorporate a microcassegrain telescoping folded optic camera into the device. The microcassegrain telescoping folded optic camera may be mounted on a handheld device, such as the bio-print device, the bio-phone, and could also be mounted on glasses used as part of a bio-kit to collect biometric data.","A cassegrain reflector is a combination of a primary concave mirror and a secondary convex mirror. These reflectors are often used in optical telescopes and radio antennas because they deliver good light (or sound) collecting capability in a shorter, smaller package.","In a symmetrical cassegrain both mirrors are aligned about the optical axis, and the primary mirror usually has a hole in the center, allowing light to reach the eyepiece or a camera chip or light detection device, such as a CCD chip. An alternate design, often used in radio telescopes, places the final focus in front of the primary reflector. A further alternate design may tilt the mirrors to avoid obstructing the primary or secondary mirror and may eliminate the need for a hole in the primary mirror or secondary mirror. The microcassegrain telescoping folded optic camera may use any of the above variations, with the final selection determined by the desired size of the optic device.","The classic cassegrain configuration  uses a parabolic reflector as the primary mirror and a hyperbolic mirror as the secondary mirror. Further embodiments of the microcassegrain telescoping folded optic camera may use a hyperbolic primary mirror and\/or a spherical or elliptical secondary mirror. In operation the classic cassegrain with a parabolic primary mirror and a hyperbolic secondary mirror reflects the light back down through a hole in the primary, as shown in . Folding the optical path makes the design more compact, and in a \u201cmicro\u201d size, suitable for use with the bio-print sensor and bio-print kit described herein. In a folded optic system, the beam is bent to make the optical path much longer than the physical length of the system. One common example of folded optics is prismatic binoculars. In a camera lens the secondary mirror may be mounted on an optically flat, optically clear glass plate that closes the lens tube. This support eliminates \u201cstar-shaped\u201d diffraction effects that are caused by a straight-vaned support spider. This allows for a sealed closed tube and protects the primary mirror, albeit at some loss of light collecting power.","The cassegrain design also makes use of the special properties of parabolic and hyperbolic reflectors. A concave parabolic reflector will reflect all incoming light rays parallel to its axis of symmetry to a single focus point. A convex hyperbolic reflector has two foci and reflects all light rays directed at one focus point toward the other focus point. Mirrors in this type of lens are designed and positioned to share one focus, placing the second focus of the hyperbolic mirror at the same point as where the image is observed, usually just outside the eyepiece. The parabolic mirror reflects parallel light rays entering the lens to its focus, which is coincident with the focus of the hyperbolic mirror. The hyperbolic mirror then reflects those light rays to the other focus point, where the camera records the image.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0606","num":"0605"},"figref":["FIG. 36","FIG. 36"],"b":["3600","3602","3604","3606","3608","3604"]},"Further embodiments may utilize microscopic mirrors to form the camera, while still providing for a longer optical path through the use of folded optics. The same principles of cassegrain design are used.","Lens  provides optics for use in conjunction with the folded optics of the cassegrain design. The lens  may be selected from a variety of types, and may vary depending on the application. The threads  permit a variety of cameras to be interchanged depending on the needs of the user.","Eye control of feature and option selection may be controlled and activated by object recognition software loaded on the system processor. Object recognition software may enable augmented reality, combine the recognition output with querying a database, combine the recognition output with a computational tool to determine dependencies\/likelihoods, and the like.","Three-dimensional viewing is also possible in an additional embodiment that incorporates a 3D projector. Two stacked picoprojectors (not shown) may be used to create the three dimensional image output.","Referring to , a plurality of digital CMOS Sensors with redundant micros and DSPs for each sensor array and projector detect visible, near infrared, and short wave infrared light to enable passive day and night operations, such as real-time image enhancement , real-time keystone correction , and real-time virtual perspective correction . The eyepiece may utilize digital CMOS image sensors and directional microphones (e.g. microphone arrays) as described herein, such as for visible imaging for monitoring the visible scene (e.g. for biometric recognition, gesture control, coordinated imaging with 2D\/3D projected maps), IR\/UV imaging for scene enhancement (e.g. seeing through haze, smoke, in the dark), sound direction sensing (e.g. the direction of a gunshot or explosion, voice detection), and the like. In embodiments, each of these sensor inputs may be fed to a digital signal processor (DSP) for processing, such as internal to the eyepiece or as interfaced to external processing facilities. The outputs of the DSP processing of each sensor input stream may then be algorithmically combined in a manner to generate useful intelligence data. For instance, this system may be useful for a combination of real-time facial recognition, real time voice detection, and analysis through links to a database, especially with distortion corrections and contemporaneous GPS location for soldiers, service personnel, and the like, such as in monitoring remote areas of interest, e.g., known paths or trails, or high-security areas. In an embodiment, the sound direction sensor input to the DSP may be processed to produce one or more of a visible, auditory or vibration queue to a user of the eyepiece to indicate a direction of the sound. For example, if hearing protection is used to cut off the sound of a loud blast or gunfire to protect the soldiers hearing or if a an explosion is so loud that the soldier can't tell where it came from and now their ears could be ringing so loud they can't hear anything, a visible, auditory or vibration queue to the operator may be used to indicate the direction of the original threat.","The augmented reality eyepiece or glasses may be powered by any stored energy system, such as battery power, solar power, line power, and the like. A solar energy collector may be placed on the frame, on a belt clip, and the like. Battery charging may occur using a wall charger, car charger, on a belt clip, in a glasses case, and the like. In one embodiment, the eyepiece may be rechargeable and be equipped with a mini-USB connector for recharging. In another embodiment, the eyepiece may be equipped for remote inductive recharging by one or more remote inductive power conversion technologies, such as those provided by Powercast, Ligonier, Pa., USA; and Fulton Int'l. Inc., Ada, Mich., USA, which also owns another provider, Splashpower, Inc., Cambridge, UK.","The augmented reality eyepiece also includes a camera and any interface necessary to connect the camera to the circuit. The output of the camera may be stored in memory and may also be displayed on the display available to the wearer of the glasses. A display driver may also be used to control the display. The augmented reality device also includes a power supply, such as a battery, as shown, power management circuits and a circuit for recharging the power supply. As noted elsewhere, recharging may take place via a hard connection, e.g., a mini-USB connector, or by means of an inductor, a solar panel input, and so forth.","The control system for the eyepiece or glasses may include a control algorithm for conserving power when the power source, such as a battery, indicates low power. This conservation algorithm may include shutting power down to applications that are energy intensive, such as lighting, a camera, or sensors that require high levels of energy, such as any sensor requiring a heater, for example. Other conservation steps may include slowing down the power used for a sensor or for a camera, e.g., slowing the sampling or frame rates, going to a slower sampling or frame rate when the power is low; or shutting down the sensor or camera at an even lower level. Thus, there may be at least three operating modes depending on the available power: a normal mode; a conserve power mode; and an emergency or shutdown mode.","Applications of the present disclosure may be controlled through movements and direct actions of the wearer, such as movement of his or her hand, finger, feet, head, eyes, and the like, enabled through facilities of the eyepiece (e.g. accelerometers, gyros, cameras, optical sensors, GPS sensors, and the like) and\/or through facilities worn or mounted on the wearer (e.g. body mounted sensor control facilities). In this way, the wearer may directly control the eyepiece through movements and\/or actions of their body without the use of a traditional hand-held remote controller. For instance, the wearer may have a sense device, such as a position sense device, mounted on one or both hands, such as on at least one finger, on the palm, on the back of the hand, and the like, where the position sense device provides position data of the hand, and provides wireless communications of position data as command information to the eyepiece. In embodiments, the sense device of the present disclosure may include a gyroscopic device (e.g. electronic gyroscope, MEMS gyroscope, mechanical gyroscope, quantum gyroscope, ring laser gyroscope, fiber optic gyroscope), accelerometers, MEMS accelerometers, velocity sensors, force sensors, pressure sensors, optical sensors, proximity sensor, RFID, and the like, in the providing of position information. For example, a wearer may have a position sense device mounted on their right index finger, where the device is able to sense motion of the finger. In this example, the user may activate the eyepiece either through some switching mechanism on the eyepiece or through some predetermined motion sequence of the finger, such as moving the finger quickly, tapping the finger against a hard surface, and the like. Note that tapping against a hard surface may be interpreted through sensing by accelerometers, force sensors, pressure sensors, and the like. The position sense device may then transmit motions of the finger as command information, such as moving the finger in the air to move a cursor across the displayed or projected image, moving in quick motion to indicate a selection, and the like. In embodiments, the position sense device may send sensed command information directly to the eyepiece for command processing, or the command processing circuitry may be co-located with the position sense device, such as in this example, mounted on the finger as part of an assembly including the sensors of the position sense device. Command information may be accompanied by a visual indicator. For example, the cursor may change color when interacting with different content. For example, in order to know where your finger is when you are using an external device to control the glasses, a visual indication of the command information may be displayed in the glasses.","In embodiments, the wearer may have a plurality of position sense devices mounted on their body. For instance, and in continuation of the preceding example, the wearer may have position sense devices mounted on a plurality of points on the hand, such as with individual sensors on different fingers, or as a collection of devices, such as in a glove. In this way, the aggregate sense command information from the collection of sensors at different locations on the hand may be used to provide more complex command information. For instance, the wearer may use a sensor device glove to play a game, where the glove senses the grasp and motion of the user's hands on a ball, bat, racket, and the like, in the use of the present disclosure in the simulation and play of a simulated game. In embodiments, the plurality of position sense devices may be mounted on different parts of the body, allowing the wearer to transmit complex motions of the body to the eyepiece for use by an application.","In embodiments, the sense device may have a force sensor, pressure sensor, and the like, such as for detecting when the sense device comes in contact with an object. For instance, a sense device may include a force sensor at the tip of a wearer's finger. In this case, the wearer may tap, multiple tap, sequence taps, swipe, touch, and the like to generate a command to the eyepiece. Force sensors may also be used to indicate degrees of touch, grip, push, and the like, where predetermined or learned thresholds determine different command information. In this way, commands may be delivered as a series of continuous commands that constantly update the command information being used in an application through the eyepiece. In an example, a wearer may be running a simulation, such as a game application, military application, commercial application, and the like, where the movements and contact with objects, such as through at least one of a plurality of sense devices, are fed to the eyepiece as commands that influence the simulation displayed through the eyepiece. For instance, a sense device may be included in a pen controller, where the pen controller may have a force sensor, pressure sensor, inertial measurement unit, and the like, and where the pen controller may be used to produce virtual writing, control a cursor associated with the eyepiece's display, act as a computer mouse, provide control commands though physical motion and\/or contact, and the like.","In embodiments, the sense device may include an optical sensor or optical transmitter as a way for movement to be interpreted as a command. For instance, a sense device may include an optical sensor mounted on the hand of the wearer, and the eyepiece housing may include an optical transmitter, such that when a user moves their hand past the optical transmitter on the eyepiece, the motions may be interpreted as commands. A motion detected through an optical sensor may include swiping past at different speeds, with repeated motions, combinations of dwelling and movement, and the like. In embodiments, optical sensors and\/or transmitters may be located on the eyepiece, mounted on the wearer (e.g. on the hand, foot, in a glove, piece of clothing), or used in combinations between different areas on the wearer and the eyepiece, and the like.","In one embodiment, a number of sensors useful for monitoring the condition of the wearer or a person in proximity to the wearer are mounted within the augmented reality glasses. Sensors have become much smaller, thanks to advances in electronics technology. Signal transducing and signal processing technologies have also made great progress in the direction of size reduction and digitization. Accordingly, it is possible to have not merely a temperature sensor in the AR glasses, but an entire sensor array. These sensors may include, as noted, a temperature sensor, and also sensor to detect: pulse rate; beat-to-beat heart variability; EKG or ECG; respiration rate; core body temperature; heat flow from the body; galvanic skin response or GSR; EMG; EEG; EOG; blood pressure; body fat; hydration level; activity level; oxygen consumption; glucose or blood sugar level; body position; and UV radiation exposure or absorption. In addition, there may also be a retinal sensor and a blood oxygenation sensor (such as an Sp0sensor), among others. Such sensors are available from a variety of manufacturers, including Vermed, Bellows Falls, Vt., USA; VTI, Ventaa, Finland; and ServoFlow, Lexington, Mass., USA.","In some embodiments, it may be more useful to have sensors mounted on the person or on equipment of the person, rather than on the glasses themselves. For example, accelerometers, motion sensors and vibration sensors may be usefully mounted on the person, on clothing of the person, or on equipment worn by the person. These sensors may maintain continuous or periodic contact with the controller of the AR glasses through a Bluetooth\u00ae radio transmitter or other radio device adhering to IEEE 802.11 specifications. For example, if a physician wishes to monitor motion or shock experienced by a patient during a foot race, the sensors may be more useful if they are mounted directly on the person's skin, or even on a T-shirt worn by the person, rather than mounted on the glasses. In these cases, a more accurate reading may be obtained by a sensor placed on the person or on the clothing rather than on the glasses. Such sensors need not be as tiny as the sensors which would be suitable for mounting on the glasses themselves, and be more useful, as seen.","The AR glasses or goggles may also include environmental sensors or sensor arrays. These sensors are mounted on the glasses and sample the atmosphere or air in the vicinity of the wearer. These sensors or sensor array may be sensitive to certain substances or concentrations of substances. For example, sensors and arrays are available to measure concentrations of carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen (\u201cNO\u201d), temperature, relative humidity, noise level, volatile organic chemicals (VOC), ozone, particulates, hydrogen sulfide, barometric pressure and ultraviolet light and its intensity. Vendors and manufacturers include: Sensares, Crolles, FR; Cairpol, Ales, FR; Critical Environmental Technologies of Canada, Delta, B.C., Canada; Apollo Electronics Co., Shenzhen, China; and AV Technology Ltd., Stockport, Cheshire, UK. Many other sensors are well known. If such sensors are mounted on the person or on clothing or equipment of the person, they may also be useful. These environmental sensors may include radiation sensors, chemical sensors, poisonous gas sensors, and the like.","In one embodiment, environmental sensors, health monitoring sensors, or both, are mounted on the frames of the augmented reality glasses. In another embodiment, the sensors may be mounted on the person or on clothing or equipment of the person. For example, a sensor for measuring electrical activity of a heart of the wearer may be implanted, with suitable accessories for transducing and transmitting a signal indicative of the person's heart activity.","The signal may be transmitted a very short distance via a Bluetooth\u00ae radio transmitter or other radio device adhering to IEEE 802.15.1 specifications. Other frequencies or protocols may be used instead. The signal may then be processed by the signal-monitoring and processing equipment of the augmented reality glasses, and recorded and displayed on the virtual screen available to the wearer. In another embodiment, the signal may also be sent via the AR glasses to a friend or squad leader of the wearer. Thus, the health and well-being of the person may be monitored by the person and by others, and may also be tracked over time.","In another embodiment, environmental sensors may be mounted on the person or on equipment of the person. For example, radiation or chemical sensors may be more useful if worn on outer clothing or a web-belt of the person, rather than mounted directly on the glasses. As noted above, signals from the sensors may be monitored locally by the person through the AR glasses. The sensor readings may also be transmitted elsewhere, either on demand or automatically, perhaps at set intervals, such as every quarter-hour or half-hour. Thus, a history of sensor readings, whether of the person's body readings or of the environment, may be made for tracking or trending purposes.","In an embodiment, an RF\/micropower impulse radio (MIR) sensor may be associated with the eyepiece and serve as a short-range medical radar. The sensor may operate on an ultra-wide band. The sensor may include an RF\/impulse generator, receiver, and signal processor, and may be useful for detecting and measuring cardiac signals by measuring ion flow in cardiac cells within 3 mm of the skin. The receiver may be a phased array antenna to enable determining a location of the signal in a region of space. The sensor may be used to detect and identify cardiac signals through blockages, such as walls, water, concrete, dirt, metal, wood, and the like. For example, a user may be able to use the sensor to determine how many people are located in a concrete structure by how many heart rates are detected. In another embodiment, a detected heart rate may serve as a unique identifier for a person so that they may be recognized in the future. In an embodiment, the RF\/impulse generator may be embedded in one device, such as the eyepiece or some other device, while the receiver is embedded in a different device, such as another eyepiece or device. In this way, a virtual \u201ctripwire\u201d may be created when a heart rate is detected between the transmitter and receiver. In an embodiment, the sensor may be used as an in-field diagnostic or self-diagnosis tool. EKG's may be analyzed and stored for future use as a biometric identifier. A user may receive alerts of sensed heart rate signals and how many heart rates are present as displayed content in the eyepiece.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0626","num":"0625"},"figref":"FIG. 29","b":"2900"},"In an embodiment, a sense device enables simultaneous electric field sensing through the eyepiece. Electric field (EF) sensing is a method of proximity sensing that allows computers to detect, evaluate and work with objects in their vicinity. Physical contact with the skin, such as a handshake with another person or some other physical contact with a conductive or a non-conductive device or object, may be sensed as a change in an electric field and either enable data transfer to or from the eyepiece or terminate data transfer. For example, videos captured by the eyepiece may be stored on the eyepiece until a wearer of the eyepiece with an embedded electric field sensing transceiver touches an object and initiates data transfer from the eyepiece to a receiver. The transceiver may include a transmitter that includes a transmitter circuit that induces electric fields toward the body and a data sense circuit, which distinguishes transmitting and receiving modes by detecting both transmission and reception data and outputs control signals corresponding to the two modes to enable two-way communication. An instantaneous private network between two people may be generated with a contact, such as a handshake. Data may be transferred between an eyepiece of a user and a data receiver or eyepiece of the second user. Additional security measures may be used to enhance the private network, such as facial or audio recognition, detection of eye contact, fingerprint detection, biometric entry, iris or retina tracking, and the like.","In embodiments, there may be an authentication facility associated with accessing functionality of the eyepiece, such as access to displayed or projected content, access to restricted projected content, enabling functionality of the eyepiece itself (e.g. as through a login to access functionality of the eyepiece) either in whole or in part, and the like. Authentication may be provided through recognition of the wearer's voice, iris, retina, fingerprint, and the like, or other biometric identifier. For example, the eyepiece or an associated controller may have an IR, ultrasonic or capacitive tactile sensor for receiving control input related to authentication or other eyepiece functions. A capacitance sensor can detect a fingerprint and launch an application or otherwise control an eyepiece function. Each finger has a different fingerprint so each finger can be used to control different eyepiece functions or quick launch different applications or provide various levels of authentication. Capacitance does not work with gloves but an ultrasonic sensor does and can be used in the same way to provide biometric authentication or control. Ultrasonic sensors useful in the eyepiece or associated controller include Sonavation's SonicTouch\u2122 technology used in Sonavation's SonicSlide\u2122 sensors, which works by acoustically measuring the ridges and valleys of the fingerprint to image the fingerprint in 256 shades of gray in order to discern the slightest fingerprint detail. The key imaging component of the SonicSlide\u2122 sensor is the ceramic Micro-Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) piezoelectric transducer array that is made from a ceramic composite material.","The authentication system may provide for a database of biometric inputs for a plurality of users such that access control may be provided for use of the eyepiece based on policies and associated access privileges for each of the users entered into the database. The eyepiece may provide for an authentication process. For instance, the authentication facility may sense when a user has taken the eyepiece off, and require re-authentication when the user puts it back on. This better ensures that the eyepiece only provides access to those users that are authorized, and for only those privileges that the wearer is authorized for. In an example, the authentication facility may be able to detect the presence of a user's eye or head as the eyepiece is put on. In a first level of access, the user may only be able to access low-sensitivity items until authentication is complete. During authentication, the authentication facility may identify the user, and look up their access privileges. Once these privileges have been determined, the authentication facility may then provide the appropriate access to the user. In the case of an unauthorized user being detected, the eyepiece may maintain access to low-sensitivity items, further restrict access, deny access entirely, and the like.","In an embodiment, a receiver may be associated with an object to enable control of that object via touch by a wearer of the eyepiece, wherein touch enables transmission or execution of a command signal in the object. For example, a receiver may be associated with a car door lock. When a wearer of the eyepiece touches the car, the car door may unlock. In another example, a receiver may be embedded in a medicine bottle. When the wearer of the eyepiece touches the medicine bottle, an alarm signal may be initiated. In another example, a receiver may be associated with a wall along a sidewalk. As the wearer of the eyepiece passes the wall or touches the wall, advertising may be launched either in the eyepiece or on a video panel of the wall.","In an embodiment, when a wearer of the eyepiece initiates a physical contact, a WiFi exchange of information with a receiver may provide an indication that the wearer is connected to an online activity such as a game or may provide verification of identity in an online environment. In the embodiment, a representation of the person could change color or undergo some other visual indication in response to the contact.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may include a tactile interface as in , such as to enable haptic control of the eyepiece, such as with a swipe, tap, touch, press, click, roll of a rollerball, and the like. For instance, the tactile interface  may be mounted on the frame of the eyepiece , such as on an arm, both arms, the nosepiece, the top of the frame, the bottom of the frame, and the like. In embodiments, the tactile interface  may include controls and functionality similar to a computer mouse, with left and right buttons, a 2D position control pad such as described herein, and the like. For example, the tactile interface may be mounted on the eyepiece near the user's temple and act as a \u2018temple mouse\u2019 controller for the eyepiece projected content to the user and may include a temple-mounted rotary selector and enter button. In another example, the tactile interface may be one or more vibratory temple motors which may vibrate to alert or notify the user, such as to danger left, danger right, a medical condition, and the like. The tactile interface may be mounted on a controller separate from the eyepiece, such as a worn controller hand-carried controller, and the like. If there is an accelerometer in the controller then it may sense the user tapping, such as on a keyboard, on their hand (either on the hand with the controller or tapping with the hand that has the controller), and the like. The wearer may then touch the tactile interface in a plurality of ways to be interpreted by the eyepiece as commands, such as by tapping one or multiple times on the interface, by brushing a finger across the interface, by pressing and holding, by pressing more than one interface at a time, and the like. In embodiments, the tactile interface may be attached to the wearer's body (e.g. their hand, arm, leg, torso, neck), their clothing, as an attachment to their clothing, as a ring , as a bracelet, as a necklace, and the like. For example, the interface may be attached on the body, such as on the back of the wrist, where touching different parts of the interface provides different command information (e.g. touching the front portion, the back portion, the center, holding for a period of time, tapping, swiping, and the like). In embodiments, user contact with the tactile interface may be interpreted through force, pressure, movement, and the like. For instance, the tactile interface may incorporate resistive touch technologies, capacitive touch technologies, proportional pressure touch technologies, and the like. In an example, the tactile interface may utilize discrete resistive touch technologies where the application requires the interface to be simple, rugged, low power, and the like. In another example, the tactile interface may utilize capacitive tough technologies where more functionality is required through the interface, such as though movement, swiping, multi-point contacts, and the like. In another example, the tactile interface may utilize pressure touch technologies, such as when variable pressure commanding is required. In embodiments, any of these, or like touch technologies, may be used in any tactile interface as described herein.","In an embodiment, a hand held accessory may be used to control a virtual keyboard for input to the glasses. For example, If the hand held device has a touch screen, the user may interact with the touch screen that either presents an on-screen keyboard or is adapted to allow users to interact with the device which coordinates with a virtual keyboard to provide input to the glasses. For example, the virtual keyboard may be presented in the glasses, but instead of selecting items in the air, the user can adapt the touch screen device to accept input corresponding to the virtual keyboard. The device may track fingers as they slide across the capacitive module, and a click of the device would give a key strike sensation. The device may have a touch surface on the front and one or more action buttons on the back or top that allow the user to click to select without lifting their fingers off the touch surface. The letters the user has selected may be highlighted. The user could still do swipe texting, lift their fingers to end a word, insert a space, double tap to insert a period, and the like.  depicts a virtual keyboard  presented in a user's field of view. On the keyboard, two keys are highlighted, \u2018D\u2019 and \u2018Enter\u2019. A touchscreen accessory device  is being used in the figure to provide this input to the keyboard, which is then transmitted to the glasses as input. Thus is provided a visual indicator indicating of having executed input or control commands using a virtual interface or actual touch screen on an external device.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may include a haptic communication interface that utilizes magnetic fields to transmit and\/or receive a command, telemetry, information, and the like, between the eyepiece and an external device or directly to\/from the user. For instance, a user may have a patterned magnetic material applied directly to some part of their body (e.g., skin, finger nail, internal to the body, and the like), where the patterned magnetic material physically responds (e.g. vibration, forces, motion, and the like) to an oscillating magnetic field generated by the haptic communication interface. The oscillating magnetic field may convey information through modulations of the field, such as through the amplitude of the signal, a time-wise variance of the signal, frequencies of the signal, and the like. The information conveyed may be an alert, an indication of an incoming call, for entertainment, for communication, an indication associated with a eyepiece application, to indicate the proximity of the user to the eyepiece, to provide haptic feedback to the user from the eyepiece, and the like. Different commands may induce different stimulus effects to the patterned magnetic material for different commands or indicators. For example, the different stimulus effects may be implemented with different frequencies and\/or sequence patterns for incoming calls from different people in a user's contact list, different intensities for different alert levels, interesting patterns for purposes of entertainment, and the like.","The haptic communication interface may include coils that transmit and\/or receive oscillating magnetic signals. The magnetic material may be a ferromagnetic material, a paramagnetic material, and the like, and may be applied as a power, ink, a tattoo, a decal, tape, a rub-on, sprayed-on, and the like. In embodiments, the magnetic material may have the ability to be demagnetized when the user is not using the eyepiece, un-magnetized when the magnetic material is not in the presence of the magnetic field from the eyepiece, and the like. The applied magnetic material may be applied in a spatial pattern that is functional, such as to respond to specific communication signal modulations, have a specific impedance, respond to specific frequencies, and the like. The applied magnetic material may be a visible image, invisible image, tattoo, marking, label, symbol, and the like. The applied magnetic material may include a pattern that utilizes the incoming magnetic signal to generate a transmitted signal back to the eyepiece haptic communication interface, such as with an identifier for the user, as a signal to indicate proximity between the eyepiece and the magnetic material, and the like. For example, an identifier could be a user ID that is compared to a stored ID on the eyepiece to confirm that the user is an authorized user of the eyepiece. In another example, the magnetic material may only be able to generate a transmitted signal back to the eyepiece if the magnetic material is close to the eyepiece. For instance, the user may have the magnetic material applied to a fingernail, and the user may provide a command indicator to the eyepiece by bringing their finger close to a user tactile interface.","In another example, the wearer may have an interface mounted in a ring as shown in , a hand piece, and the like, where the interface may have at least one of a plurality of command interface types, such as a tactile interface, a position sensor device, and the like with wireless command connection to the eyepiece. In an embodiment, the ring  may have controls that mirror a computer mouse, such as buttons  (e.g. functioning as a one-button, multi-button, and like mouse functions), a 2D position control , scroll wheel, and the like. The buttons  and 2D position control  may be as shown in , where the buttons are on the side facing the thumb and the 2D position controller is on the top. Alternately, the buttons and 2D position control may be in other configurations, such as all facing the thumb side, all on the top surface, or any other combination. The 2D position control  may be a 2D button position controller (e.g. such as the TrackPoint pointing device embedded in some laptop keyboards to control the position of the mouse), a pointing stick, joystick, an optical track pad, an opto touch wheel, a touch screen, touch pad, track pad, scrolling track pad, trackball, any other position or pointing controller, and the like. In embodiments, control signals from the tactile interface (such as the ring tactile interface ) may be provided with a wired or wireless interface to the eyepiece, where the user is able to conveniently supply control inputs, such as with their hand, thumb, finger, and the like. In embodiments, the ring may be able to expand to fit any finger, or contract for a better fit. For example, the ring may have a customizable strap or a spring-mounted hinge. For example, the user may be able to articulate the controls with their thumb, where the ring is worn on the user's index finger. In embodiments, a method or system may provide an interactive head-mounted eyepiece worn by a user, wherein the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content, a processor for handling content for display to the user, and an integrated projector facility for projecting the content to the optical assembly, and a control device worn on the body of the user, such as a hand of the user, including at least one control component actuated by the user, and providing a control command from the actuation of the at least one control component to the processor as a command instruction. The command instruction may be directed to the manipulation of content for display to the user. The control device may be worn on a first digit of the hand of the user, and the at least one control component may be actuated by a second digit of a hand of the user. The first digit may be the index finger, the second digit the thumb, and the first and second digit on the same hand of the user. The control device may have at least one control component mounted on the index finger side facing the thumb. The at least one control component may be a button. The at least one control component may be a 2D position controller. The control device may have at least one button actuated control component mounted on the index finger side facing the thumb, and a 2D position controller actuated control component mounted on the top facing side of the index finger. The control components may be mounted on at least two digits of the user's hand. The control device may be worn as a glove on the hand of the user. The control device may be worn on the wrist of the user. The at least one control component may be worn on at least one digit of the hand, and a transmission facility may be worn separately on the hand. The transmission facility may be worn on the wrist. The transmission facility may be worn on the back of the hand. The control component may be at least one of a plurality of buttons. The at least one button may provide a function substantially similar to a conventional computer mouse button. Two of the plurality of buttons may function substantially similar to primary buttons of a conventional two-button computer mouse. The control component may be a scrolling wheel. The control component may be a 2D position control component. The 2D position control component may be a button position controller, pointing stick, joystick, optical track pad, opto-touch wheel, touch screen, touch pad, track pad, scrolling track pad, trackball, capacitive touch screen, and the like. The 2D position control component may be controlled with the user's thumb. The control component may be a touch-screen capable of implementing touch controls including button-like functions and 2D manipulation functions. The control component may be actuated when the user puts on the projected processor content pointing and control device. The ring controller may be powered by an on-board battery that may be disposable, rechargeable, solar, and the like.","In embodiments, the wearer may have an interface mounted in a ring AA that includes a camera AA, such as shown in FIG. AA. In embodiments, the ring controller AA may have control interface types as described herein, such as through buttons , 2D position control , 3D position control (e.g. utilizing accelerometers, gyros), and the like. The ring controller AA may then be used to control functions within the eyepiece, such as controlling the manipulation of the projected display content to the wearer. In embodiments, the control interfaces ,  may provide control aspects to the embedded camera AA, such as on\/off, zoom, pan, focus, recording a still image picture, recording a video, and the like. Alternately, the functions may be controlled through other control aspects of the eyepiece, such as through voice control, other tactile control interfaces, eye gaze detection as described herein, and the like. The camera may also have automatic control functions enabled, such as auto-focus, timed functions, face detection and\/or tracking, auto-zoom, and the like. For example, the ring controller AA with integrated camera AA may be used to view the wearer AA during a videoconference enabled through the eyepiece, where the wearer AA may hold the ring controller (e.g. as mounted on their finger) out in order to allow the camera AA a view of their face for transmission to at least one other participant on the videoconference. Alternately, the wearer may take the ring controller AA off and place it down on a surface AA (e.g. a table top) such that the camera AA has a view of the wearer. An image of the wearer AA may then be displayed on the display area AA of the eyepiece and transmitted to others on the videoconference, such as along with the images AA of other participants on the videoconference call. In embodiments, the camera AA may provide for manual or automatic FOV AA adjustment. For instance, the wearer may set the ring controller AA down on a surface AA for use in a video conference call, and the FOV AA may be controlled either manually (e.g. through button controls , , voice control, other tactile interface) or automatically (e.g. though face recognition) in order for the camera's FOV AA to be directed to the wearer's face. The FOV AA may be enabled to change as the wearer moves, such as by tracking by face recognition. The FOV AA may also zoomed in\/out to adjust to changes in the position of the wearer's face. In embodiments, the camera AA may be used for a plurality of still and\/or video applications, where the view of the camera is provided to the wearer on the display area AA of the eyepiece, and where storage may be available in the eyepiece for storing the images\/videos, which may be transferred, communicated, and the like, from the eyepiece to some external storage facility, user, web-application, and the like. In embodiments, a camera may be incorporated in a plurality of different mobile devices, such as worn on the arm, hand, wrist, finger, and the like, such as the watch  with embedded camera  as shown in . As with the ring controller AA, any of these mobile devices may include manual and\/or automatic functions as described for the ring controller AA. In embodiments, the ring controller AA may have additional sensors, embedded functions, control features, and the like, such as a fingerprint scanner, tactile feedback, and LCD screen, an accelerometer, Bluetooth, and the like. For instance, the ring controller may provide for synchronized monitoring between the eyepiece and other control components, such as described herein.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may provide a system and method for providing an image of the wearer to videoconference participants through the use of an external mirror, where the wearer views themselves in the mirror and an image of themselves is captured through an integrated camera of the eyepiece. The captured image may be used directly, or the image may be flipped to correct for the image reversal of the mirror. In an example, the wearer may enter into a videoconference with a plurality of other people, where the wearer may be able to view live video images of the others though the eyepiece. By utilizing an ordinary mirror, and an integrated camera in the eyepiece, the user may be able to view themselves in the mirror, have the image captured by the integrated camera, and provide the other people with an image of themselves for purposes of the videoconference. This image may also be available to the wearer as a projected image to the eyepiece, such as in addition to the images of the other people involved in the videoconference.","In embodiments, a control component may provide a surface-sensing component in the control device for detecting motion across a surface may also be provided. The surface sensing component may be disposed on the palmar side of the user's hand. The surface may be at least one of a hard surface, a soft surface, surface of the user's skin, surface of the user's clothing, and the like. Providing control commands may be transmitted wirelessly, through a wired connection, and the like. The control device may control a pointing function associated with the displayed processor content. The pointing function may be control of a cursor position; selection of displayed content, selecting and moving displayed content; control of zoom, pan, field of view, size, position of displayed content; and the like. The control device may control a pointing function associated with the viewed surrounding environment. The pointing function may be placing a cursor on a viewed object in the surrounding environment. The viewed object's location position may be determined by the processor in association with a camera integrated with the eyepiece. The viewed object's identification may be determined by the processor in association with a camera integrated with the eyepiece. The control device may control a function of the eyepiece. The function may be associated with the displayed content. The function may be a mode control of the eyepiece. The control device may be foldable for ease of storage when not worn by the user. In embodiments, the control device may be used with external devices, such as to control the external device in association with the eyepiece. External devices may be entertainment equipment, audio equipment, portable electronic devices, navigation devices, weapons, automotive controls, and the like.","In embodiments, a body worn control device (e.g. as worn on a finger, attached to the hand at the palm, on the arm, leg, torso, and the like) may provide 3D position sensor information to the eyepiece. For instance, the control device may act as an \u2018air mouse\u2019, where 3D position sensors (e.g. accelerometers, gyros, and the like) provide position information when a user commands so, such as with the click of a button, a voice command, a visually detected gesture, and the like. The user may be able to use this feature to navigate either a 2D or 3D image being projected to the user via the eyepiece projection system. Further, the eyepiece may provide an external relay of the image for display or projection to others, such as in the case of a presentation. The user may be able to change the mode of the control device between 2D and 3D, in order to accommodate different functions, applications, user interfaces, and the like. In embodiments, multiple 3D control devices may be utilized for certain applications, such as in simulation applications.","In embodiments, a system may comprise an interactive head-mounted eyepiece worn by a user, wherein the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content, wherein the optical assembly comprises a corrective element that corrects the user's view of the surrounding environment, an integrated processor for handling content for display to the user, and an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly; and a tactile control interface mounted on the eyepiece that accepts control inputs from the user through at least one of a user touching the interface and the user being proximate to the interface.","In embodiments, control of the eyepiece, and especially control of a cursor associated with displayed content to the user, may be enabled through hand control, such as with a worn device  as in , as a virtual computer mouse A as in , and the like. For instance, the worn device  may transmit commands through physical interfaces (e.g. a button , scroll wheel ), and the virtual computer mouse A may be able interpret commands though detecting motion and actions of the user's thumb, fist, hand, and the like. In computing, a physical mouse is a pointing device that functions by detecting two-dimensional motion relative to its supporting surface. A physical mouse traditionally consists of an object held under one of the user's hands, with one or more buttons. It sometimes features other elements, such as \u201cwheels\u201d, which allow the user to perform various system-dependent operations, or extra buttons or features that can add more control or dimensional input. The mouse's motion translates into the motion of a cursor on a display, which allows for fine control of a graphical user interface. In the case of the eyepiece, the user may be able to utilize a physical mouse, a virtual mouse, or combinations of the two. In embodiments, a virtual mouse may involve one or more sensors attached to the user's hand, such as on the thumb A, finger A, palm A, wrist A, and the like, where the eyepiece receives signals from the sensors and translates the received signals into motion of a cursor on the eyepiece display to the user. In embodiments, the signals may be received through an exterior interface, such as the tactile interface , through a receiver on the interior of the eyepiece, at a secondary communications interface, on an associated physical mouse or worn interface, and the like. The virtual mouse may also include actuators or other output type elements attached to the user's hand, such as for haptic feedback to the user through vibration, force, pressure, electrical impulse, temperature, and the like. Sensors and actuators may be attached to the user's hand by way of a wrap, ring, pad, glove, and the like. As such, the eyepiece virtual mouse may allow the user to translate motions of the hand into motion of the cursor on the eyepiece display, where \u2018motions\u2019 may include slow movements, rapid motions, jerky motions, position, change in position, and the like, and may allow users to work in three dimensions, without the need for a physical surface, and including some or all of the six degrees of freedom. Note that because the \u2018virtual mouse\u2019 may be associated with multiple portions of the hand, the virtual mouse may be implemented as multiple \u2018virtual mouse\u2019 controllers, or as a distributed controller across multiple control members of the hand. In embodiments, the eyepiece may provide for the use of a plurality of virtual mice, such as for one on each of the user's hands, one or more of the user's feet, and the like.","In embodiments, the eyepiece virtual mouse may need no physical surface to operate, and detect motion such as through sensors, such as one of a plurality of accelerometer types (e.g. tuning fork, piezoelectric, shear mode, strain mode, capacitive, thermal, resistive, electromechanical, resonant, magnetic, optical, acoustic, laser, three dimensional, and the like), and through the output signals of the sensor(s) determine the translational and angular displacement of the hand, or some portion of the hand. For instance, accelerometers may produce output signals of magnitudes proportional to the translational acceleration of the hand in the three directions. Pairs of accelerometers may be configured to detect rotational accelerations of the hand or portions of the hand. Translational velocity and displacement of the hand or portions of the hand may be determined by integrating the accelerometer output signals and the rotational velocity and displacement of the hand may be determined by integrating the difference between the output signals of the accelerometer pairs. Alternatively, other sensors may be utilized, such as ultrasound sensors, imagers, IR\/RF, magnetometer, gyro magnetometer, and the like. As accelerometers, or other sensors, may be mounted on various portions of the hand, the eyepiece may be able to detect a plurality of movements of the hand, ranging from simple motions normally associated with computer mouse motion, to more highly complex motion, such as interpretation of complex hand motions in a simulation application. In embodiments, the user may require only a small translational or rotational action to have these actions translated to motions associated with user intended actions on the eyepiece projection to the user.","In embodiments, the virtual mouse may have physical switches associated with it to control the device, such as an on\/off switch mounted on the hand, the eyepiece, or other part of the body. The virtual mouse may also have on\/off control and the like through pre-defined motions or actions of the hand. For example, the operation of the virtual mouse may be enabled through a rapid back and forth motion of the hand. In another example, the virtual mouse may be disabled through a motion of the hand past the eyepiece, such as in front of the eyepiece. In embodiments, the virtual mouse for the eyepiece may provide for the interpretation of a plurality of motions to operations normally associated with physical mouse control, and as such, familiar to the user without training, such as single clicking with a finger, double clicking, triple clicking, right clicking, left clicking, click and drag, combination clicking, roller wheel motion, and the like. In embodiments, the eyepiece may provide for gesture recognition, such as in interpreting hand gestures via mathematical algorithms.","In embodiments, gesture control recognition may be provided through technologies that utilize capacitive changes resulting from changes in the distance of a user's hand from a conductor element as part of the eyepiece's control system, and so would require no devices mounted on the user's hand. In embodiments, the conductor may be mounted as part of the eyepiece, such as on the arm or other portion of the frame, or as some external interface mounted on the user's body or clothing. For example, the conductor may be an antenna, where the control system behaves in a similar fashion to the touch-less musical instrument known as the theremin. The theremin uses the heterodyne principle to generate an audio signal, but in the case of the eyepiece, the signal may be used to generate a control input signal. The control circuitry may include a number of radio frequency oscillators, such as where one oscillator operates at a fixed frequency and another controlled by the user's hand, where the distance from the hand varies the input at the control antenna. In this technology, the user's hand acts as a grounded plate (the user's body being the connection to ground) of a variable capacitor in an L-C (inductance-capacitance) circuit, which is part of the oscillator and determines its frequency. In another example, the circuit may use a single oscillator, two pairs of heterodyne oscillators, and the like. In embodiments, there may be a plurality of different conductors used as control inputs. In embodiments, this type of control interface may be ideal for control inputs that vary across a range, such as a volume control, a zoom control, and the like. However, this type of control interface may also be used for more discrete control signals (e.g. on\/off control) where a predetermined threshold determines the state change of the control input.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may interface with a physical remote control device, such as a wireless track pad mouse, hand held remote control, body mounted remote control, remote control mounted on the eyepiece, and the like. The remote control device may be mounted on an external piece of equipment, such as for personal use, gaming, professional use, military use, and the like. For example, the remote control may be mounted on a weapon for a soldier, such as mounted on a pistol grip, on a muzzle shroud, on a fore grip, and the like, providing remote control to the soldier without the need to remove their hands from the weapon. The remote control may be removably mounted to the eyepiece.","In embodiments, a remote control for the eyepiece may be activated and\/or controlled through a proximity sensor. A proximity sensor may be a sensor able to detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical contact. For example, a proximity sensor may emit an electromagnetic or electrostatic field, or a beam of electromagnetic radiation (infrared, for instance), and look for changes in the field or return signal. The object being sensed is often referred to as the proximity sensor's target. Different proximity sensor targets may demand different sensors. For example, a capacitive or photoelectric sensor might be suitable for a plastic target; an inductive proximity sensor requires a metal target. Other examples of proximity sensor technologies include capacitive displacement sensors, eddy-current, magnetic, photocell (reflective), laser, passive thermal infrared, passive optical, CCD, reflection of ionizing radiation, and the like. In embodiments, the proximity sensor may be integral to any of the control embodiments described herein, including physical remote controls, virtual mouse, interfaces mounted on the eyepiece, controls mounted on an external piece of equipment (e.g. a game controller, a weapon), and the like.","In embodiments, sensors for measuring a user's body motion may be used to control the eyepiece, or as an external input, such as using an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a 3-axis magnetometer, a 3-axis gyro, a 3-axis accelerometer, and the like. For instance, an sensor may be mounted on the hand(s) of the user, thereby enabling the use of the signals from the sensor for control the eyepiece, as described herein. In another instance, sensor signals may be received and interpreted by the eyepiece to assess and\/or utilize the body motions of the user for purposes other than control. In an example, sensors mounted on each leg and each arm of the user may provide signals to the eyepiece that allow the eyepiece to measure the gait of the user. The gait of the user may then in turn be used to monitor the gait of the user over time, such as to monitor changes in physical behavior, improvement during physical therapy, changes due to a head trauma, and the like. In the instance of monitoring for a head trauma, the eyepiece may initially determine a baseline gait profile for the user, and then monitor the user over time, such as before and after a physical event (e.g. a sports-related collision, an explosion, an vehicle accident, and the like). In the case of an athlete or person in physical therapy, the eyepiece may be used periodically to measure the gait of the user, and maintain the measurements in a database for analysis. A running gait time profile may be produced, such as to monitor the user's gait for indications of physical traumas, physical improvements, and the like.","In embodiments, control of the eyepiece, and especially control of a cursor associated with displayed content to the user, may be enabled through the sensing of the motion of a facial feature, the tensing of a facial muscle, the clicking of the teeth, the motion of the jaw, and the like, of the user wearing the eyepiece through a facial actuation sensor B. For instance, as shown in , the eyepiece may have a facial actuation sensor as an extension from the eyepiece earphone assembly B, from the arm B of the eyepiece, and the like, where the facial actuation sensor may sense a force, a vibration, and the like associated with the motion of a facial feature. The facial actuation sensor may also be mounted separate from the eyepiece assembly, such as part of a standalone earpiece, where the sensor output of the earpiece and the facial actuation sensor may be either transferred to the eyepiece by either wired or wireless communication (e.g. Bluetooth or other communications protocol known to the art). The facial actuation sensor may also be attached to around the ear, in the mouth, on the face, on the neck, and the like. The facial actuation sensor may also be comprised of a plurality of sensors, such as to optimize the sensed motion of different facial or interior motions or actions. In embodiments, the facial actuation sensor may detect motions and interpret them as commands, or the raw signals may be sent to the eyepiece for interpretation. Commands may be commands for the control of eyepiece functions, controls associated with a cursor or pointer as provided as part of the display of content to the user, and the like. For example, a user may click their teeth once or twice to indicate a single or double click, such as normally associated with the click of a computer mouse. In another example, the user may tense a facial muscle to indicate a command, such as a selection associated with the projected image. In embodiments, the facial actuation sensor may utilize noise reduction processing to minimize the background motions of the face, the head, and the like, such as through adaptive signal processing technologies. A voice activity sensor may also be utilized to reduce interference, such as from the user, from other individuals nearby, from surrounding environmental noise, and the like. In an example, the facial actuation sensor may also improve communications and eliminate noise by detecting vibrations in the cheek of the user during speech, such as with multiple microphones to identify the background noise and eliminate it through noise cancellation, volume augmentation, and the like.","In embodiments, the user of the eyepiece may be able to obtain information on some environmental feature, location, object, and the like, viewed through the eyepiece by raising their hand into the field of view of the eyepiece and pointing at the object or position. For instance, the pointing finger of the user may indicate an environmental feature, where the finger is not only in the view of the eyepiece but also in the view of an embedded camera. The system may now be able to correlate the position of the pointing finger with the location of the environmental feature as seen by the camera. Additionally, the eyepiece may have position and orientation sensors, such as GPS and a magnetometer, to allow the system to know the location and line of sight of the user. From this, the system may be able to extrapolate the position information of the environmental feature, such as to provide the location information to the user, to overlay the position of the environmental information onto a 2D or 3D map, to further associate the established position information to correlate that position information to secondary information about that location (e.g. address, names of individuals at the address, name of a business at that location, coordinates of the location), and the like. Referring to , in an example, the user is looking though the eyepiece C and pointing with their hand C at a house C in their field of view, where an embedded camera C has both the pointed hand C and the house C in its field of view. In this instance, the system is able to determine the location of the house C and provide location information C and a 3D map superimposed onto the user's view of the environment. In embodiments, the information associated with an environmental feature may be provided by an external facility, such as communicated with through a wireless communication connection, stored internal to the eyepiece, such as downloaded to the eyepiece for the current location, and the like. In embodiments, information provided to the wearer of the eyepiece may include any of a plurality of information related to the scene as viewed by the wearer, such as geographic information, point of interest information, social networking information (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, and the like information related to a person standing in front of the wearer augmented around the person, such as \u2018floating\u2019 around the person), profile information (e.g. such as stored in the wearer's contact list), historical information, consumer information, product information, retail information, safety information, advertisements, commerce information, security information, game related information, humorous annotations, news related information, and the like.","In embodiments, the user may be able to control their view perspective relative to a 3D projected image, such as a 3D projected image associated with the external environment, a 3D projected image that has been stored and retrieved, a 3D displayed movie (such as downloaded for viewing), and the like. For instance, and referring again to , the user may be able to change the view perspective of the 3D displayed image C, such as by turning their head, and where the live external environment and the 3D displayed image stay together even as the user turns their head, moves their position, and the like. In this way, the eyepiece may be able to provide an augmented reality by overlaying information onto the user's viewed external environment, such as the overlaid 3D displayed map C, the location information C, and the like, where the displayed map, information, and the like, may change as the user's view changes. In another instance, with 3D movies or 3D converted movies, the perspective of the viewer may be changed to put the viewer \u2018into\u2019 the movie environment with some control of the viewing perspective, where the user may be able to move their head around and have the view change in correspondence to the changed head position, where the user may be able to \u2018walk into\u2019 the image when they physically walk forward, have the perspective change as the user moves the gazing view of their eyes, and the like. In addition, additional image information may be provided, such as at the sides of the user's view that could be accessed by turning the head.","In embodiments, the user of one eyepiece may be able to synchronize their view of a projected image or video with at least the view of a second user of an eyepiece or other video display device. For instance, two separate eyepiece users may wish to view the same 3D map, game projection, point-of-interest projection, video, and the like, where the two viewers are not only seeing the same projected content, but where the projected content's view is synchronized between them. In an example, two users may want to jointly view a 3D map of a region, and the image is synchronized such that the one user may be able to point at a position on the 3D map that the other user is able to see and interact with. The two users may be able to move around the 3D map and share a virtual-physical interaction between the two users and the 3D map, and the like. Further, a group of eyepiece wearers may be able to jointly interact with a projection as a group. In this way, two or more users may be able to have a unified augmented reality experience through the coordination-synchronization of their eyepieces. Synchronization of two or more eyepieces may be provided by communication of position information between the eyepieces, such as absolute position information, relative position information, translation and rotational position information, and the like, such as from position sensors as described herein (e.g. gyroscopes, IMU, GPS, and the like). Communications between the eyepieces may be direct, through an Internet network, through the cell-network, through a satellite network, and the like. Processing of position information contributing to the synchronization may be executed in a master processor in a single eyepiece, collectively amongst a group of eyepieces, in remote server system, and the like, or any combination thereof. In embodiments, the coordinated, synchronized view of projected content between multiple eyepieces may provide an extended augmented reality experience from the individual to a plurality of individuals, where the plurality of individuals benefit from the group augmented reality experience. For example, a group of concertgoers may synchronize their eyepieces with a feed from the concert producers such that visual effects or audio may be pushed to people with eyepieces by the concert producer, performers, other audience members, and the like. In an example, the performer may have a master eyepiece and may control sending content to audience members. In one embodiment, the content may be the performer's view of the surrounding environment. The performer may be using the master eyepiece for applications as well, such as controlling an external lighting system, interacting with an augmented reality drum kit or sampling board, calling up song lyrics, and the like.","In embodiments, the image or video displayed on the eyepiece can be synchronized with images or video displayed on or captured by a connected device that has a communication link to the eyepiece or directly from the feed of a remote camera. The feed could be selected or another action could be initiated by a sensor input or control signal received from one of the connected devices, metadata sent by one of the other connected devices, or the like. Other video display devices may be other eyepieces, desktop computers, laptop computers, smartphones, tablet computers, televisions, or the like. The eyepieces, devices, and remote cameras could be connected by wide area, local area, metropolitan area, personal area, and cloud network communication links. The sensor input could be an audio sensor input, video sensor input, or the like. Other actions that could be initiated by receipt of the sensor input or control signal could include the initiating of an action such as tracking a target, sending a message, or initiating video synchronization as described elsewhere in this disclosure, and the like. For instance, the video captured by the eyepiece of a guard at a remote checkpoint or screening location could automatically be selected for display on the eyepiece of a supervisor, when a facial recognition application recognizes a person of interest in the video feed from the guard's eyepiece.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may utilize sound projection techniques to realize a direction of sound for the wearer of the eyepiece, such as with surround sound techniques. Realization of a direction of sound for a wearer may include the reproduction of the sound from the direction of origin, either in real-time or as a playback. It may include a visual or audible indicator to provide a direction for the source of sound. Sound projection techniques may be useful to an individual that has their hearing impaired or blocked, such as due to the user experiencing hearing loss, a user wearing headphones, a user wearing hearing protection, and the like. In this instance, the eyepiece may provide enhanced 3D audible reproduction. In an example, the wearer may have headphones on, and a gunshot has been fired. In this example, the eyepiece may be able to reproduce the 3D sound profile for the sound of the gunshot, thus allowing the wearer to respond to the gunshot knowing where the sound came from. In another example, a wearer with headphones, hearing loss, in a loud environment, and the like, may not otherwise be able to tell what's being said and\/or the direction of the person speaking, but is provided with a 3D sound enhancement from the eyepiece (e.g. the wearer is listening to other proximate individuals through headphones and so does not have directionality information). In another example, a wearer may be in a loud ambient environment, or in an environment where periodic loud noises can occur. In this instance, the eyepiece may have the ability to cut off the loud sound to protect the wearer's hearing, or the sound could be so loud that the wearer can't tell where the sound came from, and further, now their ears could be ringing so loud they can't hear anything. To aid in this situation, the eyepiece may provide visible, auditory, vibration, and the like queues to the wearer to indicate the direction of the sound source. In embodiments, the eyepiece may provide \u201caugmented\u201d hearing where the wearer's ears are plugged to protect their ears from loud noises, but using the ear buds to generate a reproduction of sound to replace what's missing from the natural world. This artificial sound may then be used to give directionality to wirelessly transmitted communication that the operator couldn't hear naturally.","In embodiments, an example of a configuration for establishing directionality of a source sound may be point different microphones in different directions. For instance, at least one microphone may be used for the voice of the wearer, at least one microphone for the surrounding environment, at least one pointing down at the ground, and potentially in a plurality of different discrete directions. In this instance, the microphone pointing down may be subtracted to isolate other sounds, which may be combined with 3D sound surround, and augmented hearing techniques, as described herein.","In an example of a sound augmented system as part of the eyepiece, there are a number of users with eyepieces, such as in a noisy environment where all the users have \u2018plugged ears\u2019 as implemented through artificial noise blockage through the eyepiece ear buds. One of wearers may yell out that they need some piece of equipment. Because of all the ambient noise and the hearing protection the eyepiece creates, no one can hear the request for equipment. Here, the wearer making the verbal request has a filtered microphone close to their mouth, and they could wirelessly transmit the request to the others, where their eyepiece could relay a sound signal to the other user's eyepieces, and to the ear on the correct side, and the others would know to look to the right or left to see who has made the request. This system could be further enhanced with geo-locations of all the wearers, and a \u201cvirtual\u201d surround sound system that uses the two ear buds to give the perception of 3D space (such as the SRS True Surround Technology).","In embodiments, auditory queues could also be computer generated so the communicating user doesn't need to verbalize their communication but can select it from a list of common commands, the computer generates the communication based on preconfigured conditions, and the like. In an example, the wearers may be in a situation where they don't want a display in front of their eyes but want to have ear buds in their ears. In this case, if they wanted to notify someone in a group to get up and follow them, they could just click a controller a certain number of times, or provide a visual hand gesturer with a camera, an IMU, and the like. The system may choose the \u2018follow me\u2019 command and transmit it to the other users with the communicating user's location for the 3D system to trick them into hearing from where they are actually sitting out of sight of them. In embodiments, directional information may be determined and\/or provided through position information from the users of eyepieces.","The eyepiece may include facilities for providing a vibration sensation to the user, such as through vibration actuators in the frame or arms of the eyepiece structure, such as through mechanical vibration motors, piezoelectric vibration actuator, ultrasonic vibration actuator, and the like. The vibration may be provided to indicate a message indication to the user, as an indicator to a user that is sight-impaired (e.g. because of darkness, smoke, clouds, blindness), as part of a game, part of a simulation, and the like. Vibration actuators may be used separately or in conjunction with speakers in side-arms of the eyepiece to help create a 3D visual-sound-vibration virtual reality environment, such as for games, simulations, and the like. For instance, vibration actuators may be mounted in each side arm of the eyepiece such that when an application presents a projectile flying past the user's left side of their head, the left side vibration actuator is set to vibrate in such a way as to simulate the sensation of the projectile actually flying past the user. In addition, the speaker on that side arm may synchronously apply a sound that mimics the sound the projectile would make as it flies past the user's head. Vibration and\/or speakers may be mounted on the eyepiece in such a way as to provide a 3D vibrational-audio experience to the user to augment the visual experience provided through the visually displayed content, such as in 3D visually displayed content. In this way, the user may be enveloped in a multi-sensory virtual 3D environment. In embodiments, the present disclosure may comprise an interactive head-mounted eyepiece worn by a user, wherein the eyepiece comprises an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content, an integrated image source adapted to introduce the content to the optical assembly, and an processing facility adapted to manage the functionality of the eyepiece, wherein the head-mounted eyepiece has a structure comprising a frame through which the user views the surrounding environment and a left and right side arm for supporting the frame on the head of the user, and a vibration actuator in each of the left and right side arm, each vibration actuator independently responsive to vibration commands from the processing facility. The vibration command may initiate a vibration in one of the vibration actuators in response to a virtual projectile as part of the displayed content, a virtual explosion, a message indication, a visual cue, a warning, and the like. The displayed content may be provided as part of the user playing a simulation, a game application, a utility application, and the like. The application calling the vibration command may be running locally on the eyepiece, in part or in whole through an external platform where the eyepiece has a communicative interconnection with the external platform, and the like. Further, the eyepiece may include an integrated speaker as described herein, such as in each of the left and right side arm, where the vibration command initiates a vibration in one of the vibration actuators in time synchronization with an auditory command to initiate a sound in the speaker on the same side arm as receiving the vibration command.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may provide aspects of signals intelligence (SIGINT), such as in the use of existing WiFi, 3G, Bluetooth, and the like communications signals to gather signals intelligence for devices and users in proximity to the wearer of the eyepiece. These signals may be from other eyepieces, such as to gather information about other known friendly users; other eyepieces that have been picked up by an unauthorized individual, such as through a signal that is generated when an unauthorized user tries to use the eyepiece; other communications devices (e.g. radios, cell phones, pagers, walky-talkies, and the like); electronic signals emanating from devices that may not be directly used for communications; and the like. Information gathered by the eyepiece may be direction information, position information, motion information, number of and\/or rate of communications, and the like. Further, information may be gathered through the coordinated operations of multiple eyepieces, such as in the triangulation of a signal for determination of the signal's location.","Referring to , in embodiments the user of the eyepiece D may be able to use multiple hand\/finger points from their hand D to define the field of view (FOV) D of the camera D relative to the see-thru view, such as for augmented reality applications. For instance, in the example shown, the user is utilizing their first finger and thumb to adjust the FOV D of the camera D of the eyepiece D. The user may utilize other combinations to adjust the FOV D, such as with combinations of fingers, fingers and thumb, combinations of fingers and thumbs from both hands, use of the palm(s), cupped hand(s), and the like. The use of multiple hand\/finger points may enable the user to alter the FOV  of the camera D in much the same way as users of touch screens, where different points of the hand\/finger establish points of the FOV to establish the desired view. In this instance however, there is no physical contact made between the user's hand(s) and the eyepiece. Here, the camera may be commanded to associate portions of the user's hand(s) to the establishing or changing of the FOV of the camera. The command may be any command type described herein, including and not limited to hand motions in the FOV of the camera, commands associated with physical interfaces on the eyepiece, commands associated with sensed motions near the eyepiece, commands received from a command interface on some portion of the user, and the like. The eyepiece may be able to recognize the finger\/hand motions as the command, such as in some repetitive motion. In embodiments, the user may also utilize this technique to adjust some portion of the projected image, where the eyepiece relates the viewed image by the camera to some aspect of the projected image, such as the hand\/finger points in view to the projected image of the user. For example, the user may be simultaneously viewing the external environment and a projected image, and the user utilizes this technique to change the projected viewing area, region, magnification, and the like. In embodiments, the user may perform a change of FOV for a plurality of reasons, including zooming in or out from a viewed scene in the live environment, zoom in or out from a viewed portion of the projected image, to change the viewing area allocated to the projected image, to change the perspective view of the environment or projected image, and the like.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may enable simultaneous FOVs. For example, simultaneous wide, medium, and narrow camera FOVs may be used, where the user can have different FOVs up simultaneously in view (i.e. wide to show the entire field, perhaps static, and narrow to focus on a particular target, perhaps moving with the eye or with a cursor).","In embodiments the eyepiece may be able to determine where the user is gazing, or the motion of the user's eye, by tracking the eye through reflected light off the user's eye. This information may then be used to help correlate the user's line of sight with respect to the projected image, a camera view, the external environment, and the like, and used in control techniques as described herein. For instance, the user may gaze at a location on the projected image and make a selection, such as with an external remote control or with some detected eye movement (e.g. blinking). In an example of this technique, and referring to , transmitted light E, such as infrared light, may be reflected E from the eye E and sensed at the optical display  (e.g. with a camera or other optical sensor). The information may then be analyzed to extract eye rotation from changes in reflections. In embodiments, an eye tracking facility may use the corneal reflection and the center of the pupil as features to track over time; use reflections from the front of the cornea and the back of the lens as features to track; image features from inside the eye, such as the retinal blood vessels, and follow these features as the eye rotates; and the like. Alternatively, the eyepiece may use other techniques to track the motions of the eye, such as with components surrounding the eye, mounted in contact lenses on the eye, and the like. For instance, a special contact lens may be provided to the user with an embedded optical component, such as a mirror, magnetic field sensor, and the like, for measuring the motion of the eye. In another instance, electric potentials may be measured and monitored with electrodes placed around the eyes, utilizing the steady electric potential field from the eye as a dipole, such as with its positive pole at the cornea and its negative pole at the retina. In this instance, the electric signal may be derived using contact electrodes placed on the skin around the eye, on the frame of the eyepiece, and the like. If the eye moves from the centre position towards the periphery, the retina approaches one electrode while the cornea approaches the opposing one. This change in the orientation of the dipole and consequently the electric potential field results in a change in the measured signal. By analyzing these changes eye movement may be tracked.","In another example of how eye gaze direction of the user and associated control may be applied involves placement (by the eyepiece) and optional selection (by the user) of a visual indicator in the user's peripheral vision, such as in order to reduce clutter in the narrow portion of the user's visual field around the gaze direction where the eye's highest visual input resides. Since the brain is limited as to how much information it can process at a time, and the brain pays the most attention to visual content close to the direction of gaze, the eyepiece may provide projected visual indicators in the periphery of vision as cues to the user. This way the brain may only have to process the detection of the indicator, and not the information associated with the indicator, thus decrease the potential for overloading the user with information. The indicator may be an icon, a picture, a color, symbol, a blinking object, and the like, and indicate an alert, an email arriving, an incoming phone call, a calendar event, an internal or external processing facility that requires attention from the user, and the like. With the visual indicator in the periphery, the user may become aware of it without being distracted by it. The user may then optionally decide to elevate the content associated with the visual cue in order to see more information, such as gazing over to the visual indicator, and by doing so, opening up its content. For example, an icon representing an incoming email may indicate an email being received. The user may notice the icon, and choose to ignore it (such as the icon disappearing after a period of time if not activated, such as by a gaze or some other control facility). Alternately, the user may notice the visual indicator and choose to \u2018active\u2019 it by gazing in the direction of the visual indicator. In the case of the email, when the eyepiece detects that the user's eye gaze is coincident with the location of the icon, the eyepiece may open up the email and reveal its content. In this way the user maintains control over what information is being paid attention to, and as a result, minimize distractions and maximize content usage efficiency.","In embodiments, and associated with certain optical configurations described herein, such as the frontlight LCoS, feedback between the two or more displays may ensure that the displays have the same brightness and contrast. In embodiments, cameras in each display may be employed. The current to the LEDs may be controlled and color balance may be obtained, such as by selecting LED's of similar quality, output, and or color (e.g. from similar bins), right and left pulse width modulation (PWM) values may be provided, and periodic calibration may be carried out. In embodiments, calibration of the power spectrum may be achieved. If the display is turned down because of high outside brightness, the user may know the calibration for each display. In embodiments, equal brightness, color saturation, color balance, hue and the like between the two displays may be created. This may prevent the user's brain from ignoring one display. In embodiments, a feedback system from the displays may be created that allows the user or another to regulate brightness and the like such that each display has a constant and or consistent brightness, color saturation, balance, hue and the like. In embodiments, there may be a brightness sensor on each display that may be color, RGB, white sensor, sensor for overall light, and the like. In embodiments, the sensor may be a power sensor that monitors or checks the power delivered to or consumed by the LED. The user or another may regulate one or more displays by turning the power to the LED up or down. This may be done during manufacturing and or may be done during the life of the eyepiece and or periodically. In embodiments, there may be a dynamic range aspect. As LEDs and\/or power are dimmed down there may be a power algorithm that may be refined on one display so that both maintain consistent brightness. In embodiments the user and or manufacturer or the eyepiece may adjust the LEDs to follow the same brightness curve as the power is changed. There may be RGB LEDs and the LED curve may be matched between the two displays. Accordingly, the brightness, color saturation, color balance, hue and the like may be controlled over a dynamic range. In embodiments, such items may be measured and controlled during manufacturing, during a dynamic range, during the life of the glasses and the like. In embodiments, equal brightness, color saturation, color balance, hue and the like between the two displays may be actually created or created to be perceived by the user based on differences between the user's eyes. In various embodiments, adjustments of brightness, color saturation, color balance, hue and the like may be performed by a user, manufacturer, and or automatically performed by the eyepiece based on feedback, various program algorithms, and the like. In embodiments, sensor feedback may cause an automatic and or manual adjustment in at least one of brightness, color saturation, color balance, hue and the like.","In embodiments, a system may comprise an interactive head-mounted eyepiece worn by a user, wherein the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content, and an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly wherein the optical assembly comprises two or more displays, and wherein at least one of brightness, color saturation, color balance, and hue is regulated for at least one of the displays such that at least one of brightness, color saturation, color balance, and hue of the two or more displays is balanced relative to one another within a predetermined range. In embodiments, the regulation may comprise making at least one of brightness, color saturation, color balance, hue, and the like of the two or more displays relative to one another within a predetermined range. In embodiments, an adjustment of at least one of brightness, color saturation, color balance, hue, and the like may be made based on the detection of power delivered to the integrated image source. In embodiments the adjustment may be based on a power algorithm so that at least on of brightness, color saturation, color balance, hue, and the like is consistent between the two or more displays. In further embodiments, the adjustment may be based on a sensor of total optic sensor feedback. In embodiments, at least one of brightness, color saturation, color balance, hue, and the like may be regulated at least one of during manufacturing, during a dynamic range of output produced by the integrated image source, and the like.

In embodiments, contrast may be checked on each display and adjusted accordingly and may be regulated during the manufacturing process to calibrate and adjust the displays, and it may be measured in the manufacturing process, over a dynamic range, during the life of the glasses and the like. In embodiments, the contrast of the system may be automatically calibrated between the two displays as well as in comparison to the outside world. In embodiments, the user may compensate for the differences between his eyes. The contrast may be adjusted as necessary to compensate for a sight and or perception deficit of the user. In embodiments, the contrast ratio may be a function of how the optics module is assembled. Reducing stray light, as described herein, may address techniques for assembling to provide a high contrast ratio. In embodiments, various types of single pixel brightness and or multi pixel color detectors may be inserted into the optical train to sample some or all of the light that is not making it all the way to the eye box of the display. In embodiments, and depending on where the detector is placed in the optical path, the system may be provided with real time feedback to compensate for assembly tolerances, LED and LCoS panel yield, binning tolerances, Hot and Cold panel compensation and or maintain individual user calibrations. In embodiments, brightness and contrast of the displays may be managed through good manufacturing practices. Further, during manufacturing, quality analysis may be done to test and, as necessary, calibrate the displays and compensate as necessary. Additionally, over the life of the system as components wear out, or the system heats and cools during use, one may modify calibration with a look up table for compensation values. In various embodiments, adjustments of brightness, color saturation, color balance, hue, contrast and the like may be performed by a user, manufacturer, and or automatically performed by the eyepiece based on feedback, various program algorithms, and the like. In embodiments, sensor feedback may cause an automatic and or manual adjustment in at least one of brightness, color saturation, color balance, hue, contrast, and the like.","In embodiments, a system may comprise an interactive head-mounted eyepiece worn by a user, wherein the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content, and an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly wherein the optical assembly comprises two or more displays, and wherein the contrast is regulated for at least one of the displays such that the contrast of the two or more displays is balanced relative to one another within a predetermined range.

In embodiments, the system may be adapted to automatically check the contrast of the two or more displays relative to one another and selectively set the contrast of the two or more displays to a predetermined value. In embodiments, the system may be adapted to automatically check the contrast of the two or more displays relative to one another and selectively set the contrast of the two or more displays to a predetermined value based on sensor feedback measurements. In embodiments, the contrast may be regulated to compensate for a deficit of the user. In embodiments, the contrast may be regulated as a function of at least one of stray light and light produced by the integrated image source. In embodiments, the contrast may be regulated based on feedback from detectors in the optical path of the system. Further, the detectors may comprise at least one of a single pixel brightness and multi pixel color detectors. In embodiments, the system may be provided with real time feedback to compensate for at least one of assembly tolerances, LED, and LCoS panel yield, binning tolerances, Hot and cold panel compensation, and to maintain individual user calibrations. In embodiments, the calibration of contrast may be regulated based off of a look up table for one or more compensation values.","In an embodiment, certain optical configurations described herein, such as the frontlight LCoS, enable insertion of a camera in many locations along the optical train to put the camera directly on axis with the eye. For example, a camera sensor may be placed adjacent to the LCoS, such as the camera  in . This in turn enables measurement of the location, diameter, velocity and direction of the pupil and imaging of the iris directly. Such measurements and imaging may be used for secure login or loading user settings, detecting health conditions by measuring the size and\/or thickness of capillaries, setting a placeholder\/bookmark based on last gazed area in book, and the like. Data collected by the camera about the various components of the eye can be used to control user interfaces, determine stress levels, monitor alertness, detect reactions to external or projected stimulus and the like. Since the frontlit optics are sharp and compact, a camera with extremely small pixels may be placed in the optical train retaining the small overall size of the optics and ensuring a high resolution image. In embodiments, the camera may be placed in many parts of the optical path by inserting a beam splitter as in  but it could also enable placement of the camera on the LCoS PCB, embedded directly into the LCoS silicone substrate, or other optical train placement.","In embodiments where the camera is put directly on axis with the eye, the camera may be able to see or detect the eye or directly into the eye. In embodiments, the system can track eye movement, detect pupil dilation, measure location, diameter, velocity and direction of the pupil and mage the iris directly. In embodiments the camera may determine if the user is looking around the environment or if the user is controlling the eyepiece. For example only, the camera may sense patterns of eye movement that cause it to send a signal to track eye movement such that it senses predetermined control commands that the user may perform with his eye. By way of example, the camera may recognize that the user's eyes are reading something on the user interface based on a pattern of the user's eye movement. In such cases, the camera initiate detection of a particular set of eye commands to transmit to the eye piece to carry out a particular function such as opening email and the like. In embodiments, the camera may detect that a user may focus on an object in a predetermined manner to control the eyepiece, such as by focusing on an item for a prolonged period of time, focusing on an item, moving the eye quickly and then re-focusing on the item, and the like. As the camera detects patters of movement such as these, it may signal to the eye piece to perform a particular function. For example only, focusing, looking away and re-focusing may cause the camera to signal to the eye piece that the user intends to \u201cdouble-click\u201d on an item in the display. Of course, any such patterns and or algorithms may be used for controlling the device via user's eye movement. In embodiments, the camera may detect a particular pattern of movement and when such movement is detected when particular application is in use, the camera may send a particular signal to the eyepiece based on such combination. By way of example, if an email program is open and the user's eyes exhibit a pattern of consistent with reading, the camera may signal to the eye piece to open a particular email on which the user's eyes are focused. In various embodiments, commands for controlling the eyepiece may be initiated based on the detection of the camera.","In embodiments the camera's detection of location, diameter, velocity and direction of the pupil, imaging of the retina and or iris directly, and the like may allow for security measures. By way of example when a user puts on the eyepiece, the camera may perform a retina scan which identifies the user against a database either onboard the eyepiece or stored remotely therefrom. In embodiments, if the user is recognized as the owner of the glasses or as a user of the glasses, it may open up the applications, and provide access to the user. If their glasses do not recognize the user, they may lock or prevent all or partial functionality. I embodiments the user may not need such a password, and the eyepiece may perform this function automatically. In embodiments, when the user is not recognized, the camera may take identifying information about the wearer in the event the wearer has stolen the eyepiece.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may perform user diagnostics based on detection of eye movement, detection of location, diameter, velocity and direction of the pupil, imaging of the retina and or iris directly, and the like. For example, diagnostics may be based on pupil dilation. If, for instance, the user's pupil dilates in a manner consistent with one who is lying, the camera and or eyepiece may detect that the user is lying. Further, if the user has a concussion, the pupil may change size despite a given amount of light entering the eye. The eyepiece may alert the user if he has a concussion. In embodiments, the eyepiece may be given to a soldier, athlete and the like as they exit physical activity and the eye piece may be used to diagnose the user as, for instance, having a concussion. The eyepiece may have a database of users on board or separate from the eye piece that may have information stored as related to various users. In an embodiment, as a player comes off the field to the sidelines, he may wear the glasses to perform a retina scan to identify the user via a database and then diagnose or examine the user by detecting the user's pupil size and comparing to the size of a pupil expected for the given light conditions. If the user's data falls outside of the expected ranger, the glasses may tell the user that his pupils are consistent with having a concussion. Similar uses may be employed such as detecting possible drug intoxication, detecting retina damage, detecting eye conditions and the like.","In embodiments, organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) may be used in applications for microdisplays and\/or sensors herein, and may be used with a Fraunhofer system, such as OLEDCam, or otherwise in the detection of eye movement or otherwise used with the eyepiece for illuminating the user's eye and the like. In embodiments, the device for detecting eye movements may be placed along the optical train on axis with a user's. In embodiments, microscale optical emitters and receivers may be integrated into the same chip. They may be implemented in an array type structure as a bidirectional or unidirectional microdisplay. In embodiments, the device may present and\/or capture images at the same time. The microdisplay may be the basis for a system for personalized information and present information to the user and recognize interaction by the user. The user may perceive the environment as usual, and additional information may be presented via the eyepiece equipped with the bidirectional display. The visual information may be adapted to the context of operation of the system and the user may interact by movements or actions of the eyes. In embodiments, a CMOS-Chip may include a microdisplay and a camera on one substrate with a center element of the being a nested active matrix consisting of OLED pixels and photo diodes. In embodiments, the pixel cell may consist of red-green-blue-white and red-green-blue-photodiode pixel cells, and the like.","In embodiments, a system may comprise an interactive head-mounted eyepiece worn by the user, wherein the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content, an integrated image source adapted to introduce the displayed content to the optical assembly, and a camera disposed in the optical assembly along an optical axis such that the camera may view at least a portion of an eye of the user.

In embodiments, commands for controlling the eyepiece may be initiated based on at least on image captured by the camera. In embodiments, a diagnosis of the user may be based on at least on image captured by the camera. Identification of the user may also be based on at least one image captured by the camera. By way of example the diagnosis may include a diagnosis of a concussion. In embodiments of the system, the identification of the user may be deployed as security aspect of the eyepiece. In embodiments, the integrated image source may illuminate the eye during an image capture by the camera. Further, the light from the image source may be modulated during an image capture by the camera. In embodiments, the camera may comprise one or more organic light emitting diodes (OLED). In embodiments, the user's eye, and or other parts listed herein including the iris, pupil, eyelid, eyelash, and the like, may be illuminate by various lights, LEDs, OLEDs, and the like. In embodiments, illumination of the user's eye may be used for imaging techniques, capturing data of the eye, identification and the like.","In an embodiment, the system may comprise an interactive head-mounted eyepiece worn by a user, wherein the eyepiece includes an optical assembly though which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content, and integrated image source adapted to introduce the displayed content to the optical assembly, and a device for detecting eye movements. In embodiments, the device for detecting eye movements may comprise microscale optical emitters and receivers integrated into the same chip. In embodiments, the device may comprise a CMOS-Chip including a microdisplay and a camera on one substrate. In embodiments, the device for detecting eye movements may be disposed along the optical train on axis with the user's eye.","In embodiments, a camera is disposed in the optical assembly along an optical axis such that the camera views at least a portion of an eye of the user and may image one or more of the eye, a pupil, a retina, an eyelid and eyelashes. The integrated processor and the camera are adapted to track eye movements of the user; measure at least one of pupil dilation, pupil location, pupil diameter, pupil velocity and pupil direction; distinguish user eye movements intended as control or commands from user eye movements for reading or gazing; use eye movements of the user as commands for the processor for controlling a function of the integrated processor or the interactive head-mounted eyepiece; and use eye movements of the user as commands to control a device external to the user and external to the interactive head-mounted eyepiece. A diagnosis or an identification of the user may be based on at least one image captured by the camera, such as concussion. Identification of the user may be deployed as a security aspect of the eyepiece. The system may include a user input interface to control or signal an external device based on eye movements from the user. The camera may be adapted to capture an image of both eyes, and wherein the images are compared to a database comprising other images of both eyes to indicate a diagnosis. The optical axis of the integrated image source and the optical axis of the camera may be different. At least a portion of the optical axis of the integrated image source and the optical axis of the camera may be the same.","A device, such as a camera, microscale optical emitters and receivers integrated into the same chip, or CMOS-Chip including a microdisplay and a camera on one substrate, in an augmented reality eyepiece may detect eye movements of the user. An integrated image source may be adapted to at least one of modulate light from an image source and illuminate the eye, during an image capture by the camera. The camera may include one or more organic light emitting diodes (OLED). The device for detecting eye movements may be along the optical train on axis with the user's eye or on a different axis from the user's eye. An integrated processor may be adapted to interpret eye movements of the user as commands for operating a device within the interactive head-mounted eyepiece or an external device.","A method of detecting eye movements of a user may include wearing a head-mounted eyepiece, the head-mounted eyepiece including an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content, an integrated processor and an integrated image source adapted to introduce the displayed content to the optical assembly, and a camera, detecting eye movements of the user with the camera and the integrated processor, and controlling a device through the eye movements and the integrated processor, wherein the camera detects movements of at least one eye of the user and interprets the movements as commands. The integrated processor may distinguish between eye movements as commands and eye movements intended for gazing. The method may include interpreting predetermined eye movements as a command to perform a particular function. The method may include scanning at least one eye of the user to determine an identification of the user. The method may include scanning at least one eye of the user to diagnose a medical condition of the user. The camera may include at least one organic light emitting diode (OLED). Specific eye movements may be interpreted as specific commands. Eye movements may be selected from the group consisting of blinking, repetitive blinking, blink count, blink rate, eye open-closed (slow blink), gaze tracking, eye movements to the side, up and down, side to side, through a sequence of positions, to a specific position, dwell time in a position, gazing toward a fixed object, and gaze through a certain portion of a lens of the head mounted eyepiece. The method may include controlling the device through eye movements and a user input interface. The method may include capturing a view of the surrounding environment with the camera or a second camera for displaying to the user.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may utilize sub-conscious control aspects, such as images in the wearer's periphery, images presented to the user at rates below conscious perception, sub-conscious perceptions to a viewed scene by the viewer, and the like. For instance, a wearer may be presented images through the eyepiece that are at a rate the wearer is unaware of, but is subconsciously made aware of as presented content, such as a reminder, an alert (e.g. an alert that calls on the wearer to increase a level of attention to something, but not so much so that the user needs a full conscious reminder), an indication related to the wearer's immediate environment (e.g. the eyepiece has detected something in the wearer's field of view that may have some interest to the wearer, and to which the indication draws the wearer's attention), and the like. In another instance, the eyepiece may provide indicators to the wearer through a brain activity monitoring interface, where electrical signals within the brain fire before a person realizes they've recognized an image. For instance, the brain activity-monitoring interface may include electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors (or the like) to monitor brain activity as the wearer is viewing the current environment. When the eyepiece, through the brain activity-monitoring interface, senses that the wearer has become \u2018aware\u2019 of an element of the surrounding environment, the eyepiece may provide conscious level feedback to the wearer to make the wearer more aware of the element. For example, a wearer may unconsciously become aware of seeing a familiar face in a crowd (e.g. a friend, a suspect, a celebrity), and the eyepiece provides a visual or audio indication to the wearer to bring the person more consciously to the attention of the wearer. In another example, the wearer may view a product that arouses their attention at a subconscious level, and the eyepiece provides a conscious indication to the wearer, more information about the product, an enhanced view of the product, a link to more information about the product, and the like. In embodiments, the ability for the eyepiece to extend the wearer's reality to a subconscious level may enable the eyepiece to provide the wearer with an augmented reality beyond their normal conscious experience with the world around them.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may have a plurality of modes of operation where control of the eyepiece is controlled at least in part by positions, shapes, motions of the hand, and the like. To provide this control the eyepiece may utilize hand recognition algorithms to detect the shape of the hand\/fingers, and to then associate those hand configurations, possibly in combination with motions of the hand, as commands. Realistically, as there may be only a limited number of hand configurations and motions available to command the eyepiece, these hand configurations may need to be reused depending upon the mode of operation of the eyepiece. In embodiments, certain hand configurations or motions may be assigned for transitioning the eyepiece from one mode to the next, thereby allowing for the reuse of hand motions. For instance, and referring to , the user's hand F may be moved in view of a camera on the eyepiece, and the movement may then be interpreted as a different command depending upon the mode, such as a circular motion F, a motion across the field of view F, a back and forth motion F, and the like. In a simplistic example, suppose there are two modes of operation, mode one for panning a view from the projected image and mode two for zooming the projected image. In this example the user may want to use a left-to-right finger-pointed hand motion to command a panning motion to the right. However, the user may also want to use a left-to-right finger-pointed hand motion to command a zooming of the image to greater magnification. To allow the dual use of this hand motion for both command types, the eyepiece may be configured to interpret the hand motion differently depending upon the mode the eyepiece is currently in, and where specific hand motions have been assigned for mode transitions. For instance, a clockwise rotational motion may indicate a transition from pan to zoom mode, and a counter-clockwise rotational motion may indicate a transition from zoom to pan mode. This example is meant to be illustrative and not limiting in anyway, where one skilled in the art will recognize how this general technique could be used to implement a variety of command\/mode structures using the hand(s) and finger(s), such as hand-finger configurations-motions, two-hand configuration-motions, and the like.","In embodiments, a system may comprise an interactive head-mounted eyepiece worn by a user, wherein the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content, wherein the optical assembly comprises a corrective element that corrects the user's view of the surrounding environment, an integrated processor for handling content for display to the user, and an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly; and an integrated camera facility that images a gesture, wherein the integrated processor identifies and interprets the gesture as a command instruction. The control instruction may provide manipulation of the content for display, a command communicated to an external device, and the like.","In embodiments, control of the eyepiece may be enabled through eye movement, an action of the eye, and the like. For instance, there may be a camera on the eyepiece that views back to the wearer's eye(s), where eye movements or actions may be interpreted as command information, such as through blinking, repetitive blinking, blink count, blink rate, eye open-closed, gaze tracking, eye movements to the side, up and down, side to side, through a sequence of positions, to a specific position, dwell time in a position, gazing toward a fixed object (e.g. the corner of the lens of the eyepiece), through a certain portion of the lens, at a real-world object, and the like. In addition, eye control may enable the viewer to focus on a certain point on the displayed image from the eyepiece, and because the camera may be able to correlate the viewing direction of the eye to a point on the display, the eyepiece may be able to interpret commands through a combination of where the wearer is looking and an action by the wearer (e.g. blinking, touching an interface device, movement of a position sense device, and the like). For example, the viewer may be able to look at an object on the display, and select that object through the motion of a finger enabled through a position sense device.","In some embodiments, the glasses may be equipped with eye tracking devices for tracking movement of the user's eye, or preferably both eyes; alternatively, the glasses may be equipped with sensors for six-degree freedom of movement tracking, i.e., head movement tracking. These devices or sensors are available, for example, from Chronos Vision GmbH, Berlin, Germany and ISCAN, Woburn, Mass. Retinal scanners are also available for tracking eye movement. Retinal scanners may also be mounted in the augmented reality glasses and are available from a variety of companies, such as Tobii, Stockholm, Sweden, and SMI, Teltow, Germany, and ISCAN.","The augmented reality eyepiece also includes a user input interface, as shown, to allow a user to control the device. Inputs used to control the device may include any of the sensors discussed above, and may also include a trackpad, one or more function keys and any other suitable local or remote device. For example, an eye tracking device may be used to control another device, such as a video game or external tracking device. As an example,  depicts a user with an augmented reality eyepiece equipped with an eye tracking device A, discussed elsewhere in this document. The eye tracking device allows the eyepiece to track the direction of the user's eye or preferably, eyes, and send the movements to the controller of the eyepiece. Control system includes the augmented reality eyepiece and a control device for the weapon. The movements may then be transmitted to the control device for a weapon controlled by the control device, which may be within sight of the user. The movement of the user's eyes is then converted by suitable software to signals for controlling movement in the weapon, such as quadrant (range) and azimuth (direction). Additional controls may be used in conjunction with eye tracking, such as with the user's trackpad or function keys. The weapon may be large caliber, such as a howitzer or mortar, or may small caliber, such as a machine gun.","The movement of the user's eyes is then converted by suitable software to signals for controlling movement of the weapon, such as quadrant (range) and azimuth (direction) of the weapon. Additional controls may be used for single or continuous discharges of the weapon, such as with the user's trackpad or function keys. Alternatively, the weapon may be stationary and non-directional, such as an implanted mine or shape-charge, and may be protected by safety devices, such as by requiring specific encoded commands. The user of the augmented reality device may activate the weapon by transmitting the appropriate codes and commands, without using eye-tracking features.","In embodiments, control of the eyepiece may be enabled though gestures by the wearer. For instance, the eyepiece may have a camera that views outward (e.g. forward, to the side, down) and interprets gestures or movements of the hand of the wearer as control signals. Hand signals may include passing the hand past the camera, hand positions or sign language in front of the camera, pointing to a real-world object (such as to activate augmentation of the object), and the like. Hand motions may also be used to manipulate objects displayed on the inside of the translucent lens, such as moving an object, rotating an object, deleting an object, opening-closing a screen or window in the image, and the like. Although hand motions have been used in the preceding examples, any portion of the body or object held or worn by the wearer may also be utilized for gesture recognition by the eyepiece.","In embodiments, head motion control may be used to send commands to the eyepiece, where motion sensors such as accelerometers, gyros, or any other sensor described herein, may be mounted on the wearer's head, on the eyepiece, in a hat, in a helmet, and the like. Referring to , head motions may include quick motions of the head, such as jerking the head in a forward and\/or backward motion , in an up and\/or down motion , in a side to side motion as a nod, dwelling in a position, such as to the side, moving and holding in position, and the like. Motion sensors may be integrated into the eyepiece, mounted on the user's head or in a head covering (e.g. hat, helmet) by wired or wireless connection to the eyepiece, and the like. In embodiments, the user may wear the interactive head-mounted eyepiece, where the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content. The optical assembly may include a corrective element that corrects the user's view of the surrounding environment, an integrated processor for handling content for display to the user, and an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly. At least one of a plurality of head motion sensing control devices may be integrated or in association with the eyepiece that provide control commands to the processor as command instructions based upon sensing a predefined head motion characteristic. The head motion characteristic may be a nod of the user's head such that the nod is an overt motion dissimilar from ordinary head motions. The overt motion may be a jerking motion of the head. The control instructions may provide manipulation of the content for display, be communicated to control an external device, and the like. Head motion control may be used in combination with other control mechanisms, such as using another control mechanism as discussed herein to activate a command and for the head motion to execute it. For example, a wearer may want to move an object to the right, and through eye control, as discussed herein, select the object and activate head motion control. Then, by tipping their head to the right, the object may be commanded to move to the right, and the command terminated through eye control.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may be controlled through audio, such as through a microphone. Audio signals may include speech recognition, voice recognition, sound recognition, sound detection, and the like. Audio may be detected though a microphone on the eyepiece, a throat microphone, a jaw bone microphone, a boom microphone, a headphone, ear bud with microphone, and the like.","In embodiments, command inputs may provide for a plurality of control functions, such as turning on\/off the eyepiece projector, turn on\/off audio, turn on\/off a camera, turn on\/off augmented reality projection, turn on\/off GPS, interaction with display (e.g. select\/accept function displayed, replay of captured image or video, and the like), interaction with the real-world (e.g. capture image or video, turn a page of a displayed book, and the like), perform actions with an embedded or external mobile device (e.g. mobile phone, navigation device, music device, VoIP, and the like), browser controls for the Internet (e.g. submit, next result, and the like), email controls (e.g. read email, display text, text-to-speech, compose, select, and the like), GPS and navigation controls (e.g. save position, recall saved position, show directions, view location on map), and the like. In embodiments, the eyepiece, or component portions thereof, may be automatically turned on\/off via a sensor indication, such as from an IR sensor, an accelerometer, a force sensor, a micro-switch, a capacitive sensor, through an eye-tracking detection facility, and the like. For example, the eyepiece may be automatically turned off when the user takes the eyepiece off their head by way of a capacitive sensor that senses the eyepiece is no longer in physical contact with the user's skin, such as at the bridge of the user's nose. One skilled in the art will appreciate other like configurations for sensing when the eyepiece has been taken off. In embodiments, the eyepiece may sense when detachable components are attached-detached from the eyepiece, and utilize this sensing to turn on\/off aspects of the eyepiece. For example, a portion of the optics may be detachable, and when the optics portion is removed the power to that half of the eyepiece system is powered down to preserve power in the battery. The present disclosure may include a power management facility, where the power management facility controls power provided to select components of the eyepiece in correspondence to the sensor. The eyepiece may be mounted in a frame with a nose bridge and foldable arms, wherein hinges to the frame attach the foldable arms, and where the sensor may be mounted in the nose bridge of the frame, in the arm, in the hinge, and the like. The select component may be the image source, the processor, and the like. The power management facility may be in a sleep mode when the user is not wearing the eyepiece, where sleep mode may include a periodic reading of the sensor, where the power management facility transitions to a wake mode and powers on the eyepiece when it detects the user is wearing the eyepiece. The power management facility may reduce power to components based on usage of eyepiece functions, power remaining in an integrated battery, network availability, power consumption rate, and the like. The reduction of power may be based on a user preference profile. The user may override the reduction of power through a command. The user may be provided an indication through a user interface of the eyepiece when power is being reduced. The electrochromic density in the optical assembly may be increased if a brightness level of the image source is reduced as a result of reducing the power to the image source.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may provide 3D display imaging to the user, such as through conveying a stereoscopic, auto-stereoscopic, computer-generated holography, volumetric display image, stereograms\/stereoscopes, view-sequential displays, electro-holographic displays, parallax \u201ctwo view\u201d displays and parallax panoramagrams, re-imaging systems, and the like, creating the perception of 3D depth to the viewer. Display of 3D images to the user may employ different images presented to the user's left and right eyes, such as where the left and right optical paths have some optical component that differentiates the image, where the projector facility is projecting different images to the user's left and right eye's, and the like. The optical path, including from the projector facility through the optical path to the user's eye, may include a graphical display device that forms a visual representation of an object in three physical dimensions. A processor, such as the integrated processor in the eyepiece or one in an external facility, may provide 3D image processing as at least a step in the generation of the 3D image to the user.","In embodiments, holographic projection technologies may be employed in the presentation of a 3D imaging effect to the user, such as computer-generated holography (CGH), a method of digitally generating holographic interference patterns. For instance, a holographic image may be projected by a holographic 3D display, such as a display that operates on the basis of interference of coherent light. Computer generated holograms have the advantage that the objects which one wants to show do not have to possess any physical reality at all, that is, they may be completely generated as a \u2018synthetic hologram\u2019. There are a plurality of different methods for calculating the interference pattern for a CGH, including from the fields of holographic information and computational reduction as well as in computational and quantization techniques. For instance, the Fourier transform method and point source holograms are two examples of computational techniques. The Fourier transformation method may be used to simulate the propagation of each plane of depth of the object to the hologram plane, where the reconstruction of the image may occur in the far field. In an example process, there may be two steps, where first the light field in the far observer plane is calculated, and then the field is Fourier transformed back to the lens plane, where the wavefront to be reconstructed by the hologram is the superposition of the Fourier transforms of each object plane in depth. In another example, a target image may be multiplied by a phase pattern to which an inverse Fourier transform is applied. Intermediate holograms may then be generated by shifting this image product, and combined to create a final set. The final set of holograms may then be approximated to form kinoforms for sequential display to the user, where the kinoform is a phase hologram in which the phase modulation of the object wavefront is recorded as a surface-relief profile. In the point source hologram method the object is broken down in self-luminous points, where an elementary hologram is calculated for every point source and the final hologram is synthesized by superimposing all the elementary holograms.","In an embodiment, 3-D or holographic imagery may be enabled by a dual projector system where two projectors are stacked on top of each other for a 3D image output. Holographic projection mode may be entered by a control mechanism described herein or by capture of an image or signal, such as an outstretched hand with palm up, an SKU, an RFID reading, and the like. For example, a wearer of the eyepiece may view a letter \u2018X\u2019 on a piece of cardboard which causes the eyepiece to enter holographic mode and turning on the second, stacked projector. Selecting what hologram to display may be done with a control technique. The projector may project the hologram onto the cardboard over the letter \u2018X\u2019. Associated software may track the position of the letter \u2018X\u2019 and move the projected image along with the movement of the letter \u2018X\u2019. In another example, the eyepiece may scan a SKU, such as a SKU on a toy construction kit, and a 3-D image of the completed toy construction may be accessed from an online source or non-volatile memory. Interaction with the hologram, such as rotating it, zooming in\/out, and the like, may be done using the control mechanisms described herein. Scanning may be enabled by associated bar code\/SKU scanning software. In another example, a keyboard may be projected in space or on a surface. The holographic keyboard may be used in or to control any of the associated applications\/functions.","In embodiments, eyepiece facilities may provide for locking the position of a virtual keyboard down relative to a real environmental object (e.g. a table, a wall, a vehicle dashboard, and the like) where the virtual keyboard then does not move as the wearer moves their head. In an example, and referring to , the user may be sitting at a table and wearing the eyepiece , and wish to input text into an application, such as a word processing application, a web browser, a communications application, and the like. The user may be able to bring up a virtual keyboard , or other interactive control element (e.g. virtual mouse, calculator, touch screen, and the like), to use for input. The user may provide a command for bringing up the virtual keyboard , and use a hand gesture  for indicating the fixed location of the virtual keyboard . The virtual keyboard  may then remain fixed in space relative to the outside environment, such as fixed to a location on the table , where the eyepiece facilities keep the location of the virtual keyboard  on the table  even when the user turns their head. That is, the eyepiece  may compensate for the user's head motion in order to keep the user's view of the virtual keyboard  located on the table . In embodiments, the user may wear the interactive head-mounted eyepiece, where the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content. The optical assembly may include a corrective element that corrects the user's view of the surrounding environment, an integrated processor for handling content for display to the user, and an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly. An integrated camera facility may be provided that images the surrounding environment, and identifies a user hand gesture as an interactive control element location command, such as a hand-finger configuration moved in a certain way, positioned in a certain way, and the like. The location of the interactive control element then may remain fixed in position with respect to an object in the surrounding environment, in response to the interactive control element location command, regardless of a change in the viewing direction of the user. In this way, the user may be able to utilize a virtual keyboard in much the same way they would a physical keyboard, where the virtual keyboard remains in the same location. However, in the case of the virtual keyboard there are not \u2018physical limitations\u2019, such as gravity, to limit where the user may locate the keyboard. For instance, the user could be standing next to a wall, and place the keyboard location on the wall, and the like. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the \u2018virtual keyboard\u2019 technology may be applied to any controller, such as a virtual mouse, virtual touch pad, virtual game interface, virtual phone, virtual calculator, virtual paintbrush, virtual drawing pad, and the like. For example, a virtual touchpad may be visualized through the eyepiece to the user, and positioned by the user such as by use of hand gestures, and used in place of a physical touchpad.","In embodiments, eyepiece facilities may use visual techniques to render the projection of an object (e.g. virtual keyboard, keypad, calculator, notepad, joystick, control panel, book) onto a surface, such as by applying distortions like parallax, keystone, and the like. For example, the appearance of a keyboard projected onto a tabletop in front of the user with proper perspective may be aided through applying a keystone effect, where the projection as provided through the eyepiece to the user is distorted so that it looks like it is lying down on the surface of the table. In addition, these techniques may be applied dynamically, to provide the proper perspective even as the user moves around in relationship to the surface.","In embodiments, eyepiece facilities may provide for gesture recognition that may be used to provide a keyboard and mouse experience with the eyepiece. For instance, with images of a keyboard, mouse, and fingers overlaid on the lower part of the display, the system may be capable of tracking finger positions in real time to enable a virtual desktop. Through gesture recognition, tracking may be done without wires and external powered devices. In another instance, fingertip locations may be tracked through gesture recognition through the eyepiece without wires and external power, such as with gloves with passive RFID chips in each fingertip. In this instance, each RFID chip may have its own response characteristic, enabling a plurality of digits of the fingers to be read simultaneously. The RFID chips may be paired with the eyewear so that they are distinguishable from other RFID chips that may be operating nearby. The eyewear may provide the signals to activate the RFID chips and have two or more receiving antennas. Each receiving antenna may be connected to a phase-measurement circuit element that in turn provides input to a location-determining algorithm. The location-determining algorithm may also provide velocity and acceleration information, and the algorithm that ultimately may provide keyboard and mouse information to the eyepiece operating system. In embodiments, with two receiving antennas, the azimuthal positions of each fingertip can be determined with the phase difference between the receiving antennas. The relative phase difference between RFID chips may then be used to determine the radial positions of the fingertips.","In embodiments, eyepiece facilities may use visual techniques to render the projection of a previously taken medical scan onto the wearer's body, such as an x-ray, an ultrasound, an MRI, a PET scan, and the like. For example, and referring to , the eyepiece may have access to an x-ray image taken of the wearer's hand. The eyepiece may then utilize its integrated camera to view the wear's hand A, and overlay a projected image A of the x-ray onto the hand. Further, the eyepiece may be able to maintain the image overlay as the wearer moves their hand and gaze relative to one other. In embodiments, this technique may also be implemented while the wearer is looking in the mirror, where the eyepiece transposes an image on top of the reflected image. This technique may be used as part of a diagnostic procedure, for rehabilitation during physical therapy, to encourage exercise and diet, to explain to a patient a diagnosis or condition, and the like. The images may be the images of the wearer, generic images from a database of images for medical conditions, and the like. The generic overlay may show some type of internal issue that is typical of a physical condition, a projection of what the body will look like if a certain routine is followed for a period of time, and the like. In embodiments, an external control device, such as pointer controller, may enable the manipulation of the image. Further, the overlay of the image may be synchronized between multiple people, each wearing an eyepiece, as described herein. For instance, a patient and a doctor may both project the image onto the patient's hand, where the doctor may now explain a physical ailment while the patient views the synchronized images of the projected scan and the doctor's explanation.","In embodiments, eyepiece facilities may provide for removing the portions of a virtual keyboard projection where intervening obstructions appear (e.g. the user's hand getting in the way, where it is not desired to project the keyboard onto the user's hand). In an example, and referring to , the eyepiece  may provide a projected virtual keyboard  to the wearer, such as onto a tabletop. The wearer may then reach \u2018over\u2019 the virtual keyboard  to type. As the keyboard is merely a projected virtual keyboard, rather than a physical keyboard, without some sort of compensation to the projected image the projected virtual computer would be projected \u2018onto\u2019 the back of the user's hand. However, as in this example, the eyepiece may provide compensation to the projected image such that the portion of the wearer's hand  that is obstructing the intended projection of the virtual keyboard onto the table may be removed from the projection. That is, it may not be desirable for portions of the keyboard projection  to be visualized onto the user's hand, and so the eyepiece subtracts the portion of the virtual keyboard projection that is co-located with the wearer's hand . In embodiments, the user may wear the interactive head-mounted eyepiece, where the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content. The optical assembly may include a corrective element that corrects the user's view of the surrounding environment, an integrated processor for handling content for display to the user, and an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly. The displayed content may include an interactive control element (e.g. virtual keyboard, virtual mouse, calculator, touch screen, and the like). An integrated camera facility may image a user's body part as it interacts with the interactive control element, wherein the processor removes a portion of the interactive control element by subtracting the portion of the interactive control element that is determined to be co-located with the imaged user body part based on the user's view. In embodiments, this technique of partial projected image removal may be applied to other projected images and obstructions, and is not meant to be restricted to this example of a hand over a virtual keyboard.","In embodiments, eyepiece facilities may provide for intervening obstructions for any virtual content that is displayed over \u201creal\u201d world content. If some reference frame is determined that places the content at some distance, then any object that passes between the virtual image and the viewer may be subtracted from the displayed content so as not to create a discontinuity for the user that is expecting the displayed information to exist at a certain distance away. In embodiments, variable focus techniques may also be used to increase the perception of a distance hierarchy amongst the viewed content.","In embodiments, eyepiece facilities may provide for the ability to determine an intended text input from a sequence of character contacts swiped across a virtual keypad, such as with the finger, a stylus, the entire hand, and the like. For example, and referring to , the eyepiece may be projecting a virtual keyboard , where the user wishes to input the word \u2018wind\u2019. Normally, the user would discretely press the key positions for \u2018w\u2019, then \u2018i\u2019, then \u2018n\u2019, and finally \u2018d\u2019, and a facility (camera, accelerometer, and the like, such as described herein) associated with the eyepiece would interpret each position as being the letter for that position. However, the system may also be able to monitor the movement, or swipe, of the user's finger or other pointing device across the virtual keyboard and determine best fit matches for the pointer movement. In the figure, the pointer has started at the character \u2018w\u2019 and swept a path  though the characters e, r, t, y, u, i, k, n, b, v, f, and d where it stops. The eyepiece may observe this sequence and determine the sequence, such as through an input path analyzer, feed the sensed sequence into a word matching search facility, and output a best fit word, in this case \u2018wind\u2019 as text . In embodiments, the eyepiece may monitor the motion of the pointing device across the keypad and determine the word more directly, such as though auto complete word matching, pattern recognition, object recognition, and the like, where some \u2018separator\u2019 indicates the space between words, such as a pause in the motion of the pointing device, a tap of the pointing device, a swirling motion of the pointing device, and the like. For instance, the entire swipe path may be used with pattern or object recognition algorithms to associate whole words with the discrete patterns formed by the user's finger as they move through each character to form words, with a pause between the movements as demarcations between the words. The eyepiece may provide the best-fit word, a listing of best-fit words, and the like. In embodiments, the user may wear the interactive head-mounted eyepiece, where the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content. The optical assembly may include a corrective element that corrects the user's view of the surrounding environment, an integrated processor for handling content for display to the user, and an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly. The displayed content may comprise an interactive keyboard control element (e.g. a virtual keyboard, calculator, touch screen, and the like), and where the keyboard control element is associated with an input path analyzer, a word matching search facility, and a keyboard input interface. The user may input text by sliding a pointing device (e.g. a finger, a stylus, and the like) across character keys of the keyboard input interface in a sliding motion through an approximate sequence of a word the user would like to input as text, wherein the input path analyzer determines the characters contacted in the input path, the word matching facility finds a best word match to the sequence of characters contacted and inputs the best word match as input text. In embodiments, the reference displayed content may be something other than a keyboard, such as a sketch pad for freehand text, or other interface references like a 4-way joystick pad for controlling a game or real robots and aircraft, and the like. Another example may be a virtual drum kit, such as with colored pads the user \u201ctaps\u201d to make a sound. The eyepiece's ability to interpret patterns of motion across a surface may allow for projecting reference content in order to give the user something to point at and provide them with visual and\/or audio feedback. In embodiments, the \u2018motion\u2019 detected by the eyepiece may be the motion of the user's eye as they look at the surface. For example, the eyepiece may have facilities for tracking the eye movement of the user, and by having both the content display locations of a projected virtual keyboard and the gazing direction of the user's eye, the eyepiece may be able to detect the line-of-sight motion of the user's eye across the keyboard, and then interpret the motions as words as described herein.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may provide the capability to command the eyepiece via hand gesture \u2018air lettering\u2019, such as the wearer using their finger to air swipe out a letter, word, and the like in view of an embedded eyepiece camera, where the eyepiece interprets the finger motion as letters, words, symbols for commanding, signatures, writing, emailing, texting, and the like. For instance, the wearer may use this technique to sign a document utilizing an \u2018air signature\u2019. The wearer may use this technique to compose text, such as in an email, text, document, and the like. The wearer eyepiece may recognize a symbol made through the hand motion as a control command. In embodiments, the air lettering may be implemented through hand gesture recognition as interpreted by images captured through an eyepiece camera, or through other input control devices, such as via an inertial measurement unit (IMU) mounted in a device on the user's finger, hand, and the like, as described herein.","In embodiments, eyepiece facilities may provide for presenting displayed content corresponding to an identified marker indicative of the intention to display the content. That is, the eyepiece may be commanded to display certain content based upon sensing a predetermined external visual cue. The visual cue may be an image, an icon, a picture, face recognition, a hand configuration, a body configuration, and the like. The displayed content may be an interface device that is brought up for use, a navigation aid to help the user find a location once they get to some travel location, an advertisement when the eyepiece views a target image, an informational profile, and the like. In embodiments, visual marker cues and their associated content for display may be stored in memory on the eyepiece, in an external computer storage facility and imported as needed (such as by geographic location, proximity to a trigger target, command by the user, and the like), generated by a third-party, and the like. In embodiments, the user may wear the interactive head-mounted eyepiece, where the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content. The optical assembly may include a corrective element that corrects the user's view of the surrounding environment, an integrated processor for handling content for display to the user, and an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly. An integrated camera facility may be provided that images an external visual cue, wherein the integrated processor identifies and interprets the external visual cue as a command to display content associated with the visual cue. Referring to , in embodiments the visual cue  may be included in a sign  in the surrounding environment, where the projected content is associated with an advertisement. The sign may be a billboard, and the advertisement for a personalized advertisement based on a preferences profile of the user. The visual cue , may be a hand gesture, and the projected content a projected virtual keyboard , . For instance, the hand gesture may be a thumb and index finger gesture  from a first user hand, and the virtual keyboard  projected on the palm of the first user hand, and where the user is able to type on the virtual keyboard with a second user hand. The hand gesture  may be a thumb and index finger gesture combination of both user hands, and the virtual keyboard  projected between the user hands as configured in the hand gesture, where the user is able to type on the virtual keyboard using the thumbs of the user's hands. Visual cues may provide the wearer of the eyepiece with an automated resource for associating a predetermined external visual cue with a desired outcome in the way of projected content, thus freeing the wearer from searching for the cues themselves.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may include a visual recognition language translation facility for providing translations for visually presented content, such as for road signs, menus, billboards, store signs, books, magazines, and the like. The visual recognition language translation facility may utilize optical character recognition to identify letters from the content, match the strings of letters to words and phrases through a database of translations. This capability may be completely contained within the eyepiece, such as in an offline mode, or at least in part in an external computing facility, such as on an external server. For instance, a user may be in a foreign country, where the signs, menus, and the like are not understood by the wearer of the eyepiece, but for which the eyepiece is able to provide translations. These translations may appear as an annotation to the user, replace the foreign language words (such as on the sign) with the translation, provided through an audio translation to the user, and the like. In this way, the wearer won't have to take the effort to look up word translations, but rather they would be provided automatically. In an example, a user of the eyepiece may be Italian, and coming to the United States they have the need to interpret the large number of road signs in order to drive around safely. Referring to , the Italian user of the eyepiece is viewing a U.S. stop sign A. In this instance, the eyepiece may identify the letters on the sign, translate the word \u2018stop\u2019 in the Italian for stop, \u2018arresto\u2019, and make the stop sign A appear to read the word \u2018arresto\u2019 rather than \u2018stop\u2019. In embodiments, the eyepiece may also provide simple translation messages to the wearer, provide audio translations, provide a translation dictionary to the wearer, and the like. The present disclosure may comprise an interactive head-mounted eyepiece worn by a user, where the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content, and an integrated image source adapted to introduce the content to the optical assembly; an integrated camera for imaging text viewed within the surrounding environment; an optical character recognition facility to correlate one or more characters from the viewed text to one or more characters of a first language, and correlate the one or more characters of the first language to the one or more characters of the second language, wherein the integrated image source presents the one or more characters of the second language as displayed content, wherein the displayed content is locked in a position relative to the one or more characters from the viewed text. The presentation of the one or more characters of the second language may appear as an annotation to the user and placed as displayed content in relative to the originally viewed text. The presentation of the one or more characters of the second language may be superimposed onto the viewed location of the originally viewed text, such as the presentation of the one or more characters of the second language superimposed onto the originally viewed text matches the font characteristics of the originally viewed text. The viewed text is on a sign, a printed document, book, a road sign, a billboard, a menu, and the like. The optical character recognition facility may be incorporated in the eyepiece, provided external to the eyepiece, or provided in a combination of internally and externally. The one or more characters may be words, phrases, strings of alphanumeric characters, and the like. The one or more characters of the second language may be saved in an external facility and tagged so as to be made available to a second eyepiece viewing the same text, such as the tagging including a geographical location indication, an object identifier, and the like. In addition, the presentation of the one or more characters of the second language may be stored such that when the view of the text moves outside the view of the eyepiece it is recalled for presentation when the text moves back within the view of the eyepiece.","In one example, the eyepiece may be used in an adaptive environment, such as for blind users. In embodiments, the results of face recognition or object identification may be processed to obtain an audible result and can be presented as audio to a wearer of the glasses through associated earbuds\/headphones. In other embodiments, the results of face recognition or object identification may be translated into haptic vibrations in the glasses or an associated controller. In an example, if someone stands in front of a user of the adaptive glasses, a camera may image the person and transmit the image to the integrated processor for processing by face recognition software or to face recognition software operating on a server or in the cloud. The results of the face recognition may be presented as written text in the display of the glasses for certain individuals, but for blind or poor vision users, the result may be processed to obtain audio. In other examples, object recognition may determine the user is approaching a curb, doorway, or other object and the glasses or controller would audibly or haptically warn the user. For poor vision users, the text on the display could be magnified or the contrast could be increased.","In embodiments, a GPS sensor may be used to determine a location of the user wearing the adaptive display. The GPS sensor may be accessed by a navigation application to audibly announce various points of interest to the user as they are approached or reached. In embodiments, the user may be audibly guided to an endpoint by the navigation application.","The eyepiece may be useful for various applications and markets. It should be understood that the control mechanisms described herein may be used to control the functions of the applications described herein. The eyepiece may run a single application at a time or multiple applications may run at a time. Switching between applications may be done with the control mechanisms described herein. The eyepiece may be used in military applications, gaming, image recognition applications, to view\/order e-books, GPS Navigation (Position, Direction, Speed and ETA), Mobile TV, athletics (view pacing, ranking, and competition times; receive coaching), telemedicine, industrial inspection, aviation, shopping, inventory management tracking, firefighting (enabled by VIS\/NIRSWIR sensor that sees through fog, haze, dark), outdoor\/adventure, custom advertising, and the like. In an embodiment, the eyepiece may be used with e-mail, such as GMAIL in , the Internet, web browsing, viewing sports scores, video chat, and the like. In an embodiment, the eyepiece may be used for educational\/training purposes, such as by displaying step by step guides, such as hands-free, wireless maintenance and repair instructions. For example, a video manual and\/or instructions may be displayed in the field of view. In an embodiment, the eyepiece may be used in Fashion, Health, and Beauty. For example, potential outfits, hairstyles, or makeup may be projected onto a mirror image of a user. In an embodiment, the eyepiece may be used in Business Intelligence, Meetings, and Conferences. For example, a user's name tag can be scanned, their face run through a facial recognition system, or their spoken name searched in database to obtain biographical information. Scanned name tags, faces, and conversations may be recorded for subsequent viewing or filing.","In an embodiment, a \u201cMode\u201d may be entered by the eyepiece. In the mode, certain applications may be available. For example, a consumer version of the eyepiece may have a Tourist Mode, Educational Mode, Internet Mode, TV Mode, Gaming Mode, Exercise Mode, Stylist Mode, Personal Assistant Mode, and the like.","A user of the augmented reality glasses may wish to participate in video calling or video conferencing while wearing the glasses. Many computers, both desktop and laptop have integrated cameras to facilitate using video calling and conferencing. Typically, software applications are used to integrate use of the camera with calling or conferencing features. With the augmented reality glasses providing much of the functionality of laptops and other computing devices, many users may wish to utilize video calling and video conferencing while on the move wearing the augmented reality glasses.","In an embodiment, a video calling or video conferencing application may work with a WiFi connection, or may be part of a 3G or 4G calling network associated with a user's cell phone. The camera for video calling or conferencing is placed on a device controller, such as a watch or other separate electronic computing device. Placing the video calling or conferencing camera on the augmented reality glasses is not feasible, as such placement would provide the user with a view only of themselves, and would not display the other participants in the conference or call. However, the user may choose to use the forward-facing camera to display their surroundings or another individual in the video call.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0708","num":"0707"},"figref":["FIG. 32","FIG. 32"],"b":["3200","3202"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0709","num":"0708"},"figref":"FIG. 33","b":["3300","3302","3304","3306","3314","3312","3306","3314","3308","3308","3310","3310","3316"]},"In operation, the video call camera depends on the signal capture which transforms the incident light, as well as incident sound into electrons. For light this process is performed by CCD or CMOS chip . The microphone transforms sound into electrical impulses.","The first step in the process of generating an image for a video call is to digitize the image. The CCD or CMOS chip  dissects the image and converts it into pixels. If a pixel has collected many photons, the voltage will be high. If the pixel has collected few photons, the voltage will be low. This voltage is an analog value. During the second step of digitization, the voltage is transformed into a digital value by the analog to digital converter , which handles image processing. At this point, a raw digital image is available.","Audio captured by the microphone  is also transformed into a voltage. This voltage is sent to the analog to digital converter  where the analog values are transformed into digital values.","The next step is to enhance the signal so that it may be sent to viewers of the video call or conference. Signal enhancement includes creating color in the image using a color filter, located in front of the CCD or CMOS chip . This filter is red, green, or blue and changes its color from pixel to pixel, and in an embodiment, may be a color filter array, or Bayer filter. These raw digital images are then enhanced by the filter to meet aesthetic requirements. Audio data may also be enhanced for a better calling experience.","In the final step before transmission, the image and audio data are compressed and output as a digital video stream, in an embodiment using a digital video camera. If a photo camera is used, single images may be output, and in a further embodiment, voice comments may be appended to the files. The enhancement of the raw digital data takes place away from the camera, and in an embodiment may occur in the device controller or computing device that the augmented reality glasses communicate with during a video call or conference.","Further embodiments may provide for portable cameras for use in industry, medicine, astronomy, microscopy, and other fields requiring specialized camera use. These cameras often forgo signal enhancement and output the raw digital image. These cameras may be mounted on other electronic devices or the user's hand for ease of use.","The camera interfaces to the augmented reality glasses and the device controller or computing device using an IEEE 1394 interface bus. This interface bus transmits time critical data, such as a video and data whose integrity is critically important, including parameters or files to manipulate data or transfer images.","In addition to the interface bus, protocols define the behavior of the devices associated with the video call or conference. The camera for use with the augmented reality glasses, may, in embodiments, employ one of the following protocols: AV\/C, DCAM, or SBP-2.","AV\/C is a protocol for Audio Video Control and defines the behavior of digital video devices, including video cameras and video recorders.","DCAM refers to the 1394 based Digital Camera Specification and defines the behavior of cameras that output uncompressed image data without audio.","SBP-2 refers to Serial Bus Protocol and defines the behavior of mass storage devices, such as hard drives or disks.","Devices that use the same protocol are able to communicate with each other. Thus, for video calling using the augmented reality glasses, the same protocol may be used by the video camera on the device controller and the augmented reality glasses. Because the augmented reality glasses, device controller, and camera use the same protocol, data may be exchanged among these devices. Files that may be transferred among devices include: image and audio files, image and audio data flows, parameters to control the camera, and the like.","In an embodiment, a user desiring to initiate a video call may select a video call option from a screen presented when the call process is initiated. The user selects by making a gesture using a pointing device, or gesture to signal the selection of the video call option. The user then positions the camera located on the device controller, wristwatch, or other separable electronic device so that the user's image is captured by the camera. The image is processed through the process described above and is then streamed to the augmented reality glasses and the other participants for display to the users.","In embodiments, the camera may be mounted on a cell phone, personal digital assistant, wristwatch, pendant, or other small portable device capable of being carried, worn, or mounted. The images or video captured by the camera may be streamed to the eyepiece. For example, when a camera is mounted on a rifle, a wearer may be able to image targets not in the line of sight and wirelessly receive imagery as a stream of displayed content to the eyepiece.","In embodiments, the present disclosure may provide the wearer with GPS-based content reception, as in . As noted, augmented reality glasses of the present disclosure may include memory, a global positioning system, a compass or other orienting device, and a camera. GPS-based computer programs available to the wearer may include a number of applications typically available from the Apple Inc. App Store for iPhone use. Similar versions of these programs are available for other brands of smart phone and may be applied to embodiments of the present disclosure. These programs include, for example, SREngine (scene recognition engine), NearestTube, TAT Augmented ID, Yelp, Layar, and TwittARound, as well as other more specialized applications, such as RealSki.","SREngine is a scene recognition engine that is able to identify objects viewed by the user's camera. It is a software engine able to recognize static scenes, such as scenes of architecture, structures, pictures, objects, rooms, and the like. It is then able to automatically apply a virtual \u201clabel\u201d to the structures or objects according to what it recognizes. For example, the program may be called up by a user of the present disclosure when viewing a street scene, such as . Using a camera of the augmented reality glasses, the engine will recognize the Fontaines de la Concorde in Paris. The program will then summon a virtual label, shown in  as part of a virtual image  projected onto the lens . The label may be text only, as seen at the bottom of the image . Other labels applicable to this scene may include \u201cfountain,\u201d \u201cmuseum,\u201d \u201chotel,\u201d or the name of the columned building in the rear. Other programs of this type may include the Wikitude Ark. Travel Guide, Yelp and many others.","NearestTube, for example, uses the same technology to direct a user to the closest subway station in London, and other programs may perform the same function, or similar, in other cities. Layar is another application that uses the camera, a compass or direction, and GPS data to identify a user's location and field of view. With this information, an overlay or label may appear virtually to help orient and guide the user. Yelp and Monocle perform similar functions, but their databases are somewhat more specialized, helping to direct users in a similar manner to restaurants or to other service providers.","The user may control the glasses, and call up these functions, using any of the controls described in this patent. For example, the glasses may be equipped with a microphone to pick up voice commands from a user and process them using software contained with a memory of the glasses. The user may then respond to prompts from small speakers or earbuds also contained within the glasses frame. The glasses may also be equipped with a tiny track pad, similar to those found on smartphones. The trackpad may allow a user to move a pointer or indicator on the virtual screen within the AR glasses, similar to a touch screen. When the user reaches a desired point on the screen, the user depresses the track pad to indicate his or her selection. Thus, a user may call up a program, e.g., a travel guide, and then find his or her way through several menus, perhaps selecting a country, a city and then a category. The category selections may include, for example, hotels, shopping, museums, restaurants, and so forth. The user makes his or her selections and is then guided by the AR program. In one embodiment, the glasses also include a GPS locator, and the present country and city provides default locations that may be overridden.","In an embodiment, the eyepiece's object recognition software may process the images being received by the eyepiece's forward facing camera in order to determine what is in the field of view. In other embodiments, the GPS coordinates of the location as determined by the eyepiece's GPS may be enough to determine what is in the field of view. In other embodiments, an RFID or other beacon in the environment may be broadcasting a location. Any one or combination of the above may be used by the eyepiece to identify the location and the identity of what is in the field of view.","When an object is recognized, the resolution for imaging that object may be increased or images or video may be captured at low compression. Additionally, the resolution for other objects in the user's view may be decreased, or captured at a higher compression rate in order to decrease the needed bandwidth.","Once determined, content related to points of interest in the field of view may be overlaid on the real world image, such as social networking content, interactive tours, local information, and the like. Information and content related to movies, local information, weather, restaurants, restaurant availability, local events, local taxis, music, and the like may be accessed by the eyepiece and projected on to the lens of the eyepiece for the user to view and interact with. For example, as the user looks at the Eiffel Tower, the forward facing camera may take an image and send it for processing to the eyepiece's associated processor. Object recognition software may determine that the structure in the wearer's field of view is the Eiffel Tower. Alternatively, the GPS coordinates determined by the eyepiece's GPS may be searched in a database to determine that the coordinates match those of the Eiffel Tower. In any event, content may then be searched relating to the Eiffel Tower visitor's information, restaurants in the vicinity and in the Tower itself, local weather, local Metro information, local hotel information, other nearby tourist spots, and the like. Interacting with the content may be enabled by the control mechanisms described herein. In an embodiment, GPS-based content reception may be enabled when a Tourist Mode of the eyepiece is entered.","In an embodiment, the eyepiece may be used to view streaming video. For example, videos may be identified via search by GPS location, search by object recognition of an object in the field of view, a voice search, a holographic keyboard search, and the like. Continuing with the example of the Eiffel Tower, a video database may be searched via the GPS coordinates of the Tower or by the term \u2018Eiffel Tower\u2019 once it has been determined that is the structure in the field of view. Search results may include geo-tagged videos or videos associated with the Eiffel Tower. The videos may be scrolled or flipped through using the control techniques described herein. Videos of interest may be played using the control techniques described herein. The video may be laid over the real world scene or may be displayed on the lens out of the field of view. In an embodiment, the eyepiece may be darkened via the mechanisms described herein to enable higher contrast viewing. In another example, the eyepiece may be able to utilize a camera and network connectivity, such as described herein, to provide the wearer with streaming video conferencing capabilities. The streamed video could be video of at least one other video conference participant, a visual presentation, or the like. The streamed video could be automatically uploaded upon capture to a video storage location, without interaction by the user of the eyepiece. The streamed video could be uploaded to a physical or virtual storage location. The virtual storage location could be located at a single physical location or a cloud storage location. The streamed video of the video conference could also be modified by the eyepiece, where the modification could be based on a sensor input. The sensor input could be a visual sensor input or an audio sensor input. The visual sensor input could be an image of another participant of the video conference, a visual presentation, or the like. The audio sensor input could be the voice of a particular participant of the video conference.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may provide for an interface to accept wireless streaming media (e.g. video, audio, text messaging, phone call and calendar alerts) from an external facility, such as a smart phone, a tablet, a personal computer, an entertainment device, a portable music and video device, a home theater system, a home entertainment system, another eyepiece, and the like. The wireless streaming media may be through any of the wireless communication systems and protocols know in the art, such as Bluetooth, WiFi, wireless home network connection, wireless local area network (WLAN), wireless home digital interface (WHDI), cellular mobile telecommunications, and the like. The eyepiece may also use multiple wireless communications systems, such as one for streaming high data rate media (e.g. video), one for low data rate media (e.g. text messaging), one for command data between the external facility and the eyepiece, and the like. For example, high data rate video could be streamed via a WiFi DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) interface, and Bluetooth for low data rate applications, such as text messaging. In embodiments, the external facility may be provided with an application to support the interface with the eyepiece. For example, a mobile application may be made available to the user for interfacing their smart phone with the eyepiece. In embodiments, the external facility may be provided with a transmission facility to interface with the eyepiece. For example, a transmitter dongle could be provided to interface the user's smart phone to the eyepiece. Because streaming of media from an external device may place much of the processing requirements onto the external device, the eyepiece may require less on-board processing capabilities to accommodate the streaming media. For instance, an embodiment of the eyepiece for accommodating streaming media may comprise an interface for accepting the streaming media, buffering data, providing the streaming media to the optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content, and the like. That is, an embodiment of the eyepiece for accepting streaming media may be a simplified version of other embodiments of the eyepiece as described herein, such as to act as display for the external facility. In an example, a user may be able to stream a video from their smart phone to a \u2018simplified version\u2019 of the eyepiece. However, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that any additional functions described herein may also be included to create embodiment versions of the eyepiece that span from the very simplest version of the eyepiece, such as acting solely as a display interface for the external facility, to a version that includes a full range of the capabilities described herein, such as where a wireless streaming interface is but one of the plurality of functions and capabilities provided by the eyepiece. For instance, control techniques, power saving techniques, applications, driving one or both displays with the streaming media, displaying in a 3D mode, and the like, as described herein, may be useful even in the simpler versions of the eyepiece in order to aid in the commanding modes of the streaming media, battery management for increased life, optional media viewing modes, and the like. Alternately, an ultra-simple version of the eyepiece may provide an embodiment that minimizes the cost and complexity of the eyepiece, such as where the interface between the external facility and the eyepiece is a wired interface. For example, an embodiment of the eyepiece may provide a wired interface between a user's smart phone or tablet and the eyepiece, where the processing capabilities of the eyepiece may now be restricted to only that processing required to present the streaming media to the optics assembly for viewing the content on the lens(es) of the eyepiece.","In other embodiments, an app running on a smart phone may act as a remote input device for the glasses. For example, a user interface, such as a keyboard, may allow users to type in characters via the smart phone. The app would make the phone look like a BLUETOOTH keyboard. The app could simply be a full screen blank app that transmits touches to a pseudo touch screen driver running on the glasses, such that the user could do pinch and drags using the smart phone as an actual physical place to do these motions and get tactile feedback to your hands and visual feedback in the glasses. Thus, more generic apps running on the glasses that utilize these types of input gestures could work well with the user using a smart phone touch screen. Command information may be accompanied by a visual indicator. For example, in order to know where your finger is when you are using the external device to control the glasses or a glasses app, a visual indication of the command information may be displayed in the glasses, such as a highlighted trace of the finger's motion. The present disclosure may comprise an interactive head-mounted eyepiece worn by a user, wherein the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content, and an integrated image source adapted to introduce the content to the optical assembly; an integrated processor; an external device that has a physical user interface and an application to turn the external device into a user interface for the eyepiece operable through the integrated processor, wherein the physical interaction with the external device is indicated in the displayed content. In embodiments, the external device may be a smart phone, a tablet, a mobile navigation device, and the like. The physical user interface may be a keypad, a touchpad, a control interface, and the like. For instance, the physical interface may be an iPhone, and the displayed content a virtual keyboard that displays the user's action on the iPhone keypad as actions on a virtual keypad as displayed content on the eyepiece, such as showing highlighted keys, an indication of key depression, and the like, on the virtual keypad as the user's finger action physically interacts with the iPhone's physical keypad. The finger action may be one of a selection of content and movement of displayed content. The manipulation may be a multiple finger action on the touch pad, such as a pinch manipulation to resize the displayed content on the eyepiece.","As noted, the user of augmented reality may receive content from an abundance of sources. A visitor or tourist may desire to limit the choices to local businesses or institutions; on the other hand, businesses seeking out visitors or tourists may wish to limit their offers or solicitations to persons who are in their area or location but who are visiting rather than local residents. Thus, in one embodiment, the visitor or tourist may limit his or her search only to local businesses, say those within certain geographic limits. These limits may be set via GPS criteria or by manually indicating a geographic restriction. For example, a person may require that sources of streaming content or ads be limited to those within a certain radius (a set number or km or miles) of the person. Alternatively, the criteria may require that the sources are limited to those within a certain city or province. These limits may be set by the augmented reality user just as a user of a computer at a home or office would limit his or her searches using a keyboard or a mouse; the entries for augmented reality users are simply made by voice, by hand motion, or other ways described elsewhere in the portions of this disclosure discussing controls.","In addition, the available content chosen by a user may be restricted or limited by the type of provider. For example, a user may restrict choices to those with a website operated by a government institution (.gov) or by a non-profit institution or organization (.org). In this way, a tourist or visitor who may be more interested in visiting government offices, museums, historical sites and the like, may find his or her choices less cluttered. The person may be more easily able to make decisions when the available choices have been pared down to a more reasonable number. The ability to quickly cut down the available choices is desirable in more urban areas, such as Paris or Washington, D.C., where there are many choices.","The user controls the glasses in any of the manners or modes described elsewhere in this patent. For example, the user may call up a desired program or application by voice or by indicating a choice on the virtual screen of the augmented reality glasses. The augmented glasses may respond to a track pad mounted on the frame of the glasses, as described above. Alternatively, the glasses may be responsive to one or more motion or position sensors mounted on the frame. The signals from the sensors are then sent to a microprocessor or microcontroller within the glasses, the glasses also providing any needed signal transducing or processing. Once the program of choice has begun, the user makes selections and enters a response by any of the methods discussed herein, such as signaling \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d with a head movement, a hand gesture, a trackpad depression, or a voice command.","At the same time, content providers, that is, advertisers, may also wish to restrict their offerings to persons who are within a certain geographic area, e.g., their city limits. At the same time, an advertiser, perhaps a museum, may not wish to offer content to local persons, but may wish to reach visitors or out-of-towners. In another example, advertisements may not be presented when the user is home but may be presented when the user is traveling or away from home. The augmented reality devices discussed herein are desirably equipped with both GPS capability and telecommunications capability and an integrated processor for implementing geographic-based rules for advertisement presentation. It will be a simple matter for the museum to provide streaming content within a limited area by limiting its broadcast power. The museum, however, may provide the content through the Internet and its content may be available world-wide. In this instance, a user may receive content through an augmented reality device advising that the museum is open today and is available for touring.","The user may respond to the content by the augmented reality equivalent of clicking on a link for the museum. The augmented reality equivalent may be a voice indication, a hand or eye movement, or other sensory indication of the user's choice, or by using an associated body-mounted controller. The museum then receives a cookie indicating the identity of the user or at least the user's internet service provider (ISP). If the cookie indicates or suggests an internet service provider other than local providers, the museum server may then respond with advertisements or offers tailored to visitors. The cookie may also include an indication of a telecommunications link, e.g., a telephone number. If the telephone number is not a local number, this is an additional clue that the person responding is a visitor. The museum or other institution may then follow up with the content desired or suggested by its marketing department.","Another application of the augmented reality eyepiece takes advantage of a user's ability to control the eyepiece and its tools with a minimum use of the user's hands, using instead voice commands, gestures or motions. As noted above, a user may call upon the augmented reality eyepiece to retrieve information. This information may already be stored in a memory of the eyepiece, but may instead be located remotely, such as a database accessible over the Internet or perhaps via an intranet which is accessible only to employees of a particular company or organization. The eyepiece may thus be compared to a computer or to a display screen which can be viewed and heard at an extremely close range and generally controlled with a minimal use of one's hands.","Applications may thus include providing information on-the-spot to a mechanic or electronics technician. The technician can don the glasses when seeking information about a particular structure or problem encountered, for example, when repairing an engine or a power supply. Using voice commands, he or she may then access the database and search within the database for particular information, such as manuals or other repair and maintenance documents. The desired information may thus be promptly accessed and applied with a minimum of effort, allowing the technician to more quickly perform the needed repair or maintenance and to return the equipment to service. For mission-critical equipment, such time savings may also save lives, in addition to saving repair or maintenance costs.","The information imparted may include repair manuals and the like, but may also include a full range of audio-visual information, i.e., the eyepiece screen may display to the technician or mechanic a video of how to perform a particular task at the same time the person is attempting to perform the task. The augmented reality device also includes telecommunications capabilities, so the technician also has the ability to call on others to assist if there is some complication or unexpected difficulty with the task. This educational aspect of the present disclosure is not limited to maintenance and repair, but may be applied to any educational endeavor, such as secondary or post-secondary classes, continuing education courses or topics, seminars, and the like.","In an embodiment, a Wi-Fi enabled eyepiece may run a location-based application for geo-location of opted-in users. Users may opt-in by logging into the application on their phone and enabling broadcast of their location, or by enabling geo-location on their own eyepiece. As a wearer of the eyepiece scans people, and thus their opted-in device, the application may identify opted-in users and send an instruction to the projector to project an augmented reality indicator on an opted-in user in the user's field of view. For example, green rings may be placed around people who have opted-in to have their location seen. In another example, yellow rings may indicate people who have opted-in but don't meet some criteria, such as they do not have a FACEBOOK account, or that there are no mutual friends if they do have a FACEBOOK account.","Some social networking, career networking, and dating applications may work in concert with the location-based application. Software resident on the eyepiece may coordinate data from the networking and dating sites and the location-based application. For example, TwittARound is one such program which makes use of a mounted camera to detect and label location-stamped tweets from other tweeters nearby. This will enable a person using the present disclosure to locate other nearby Twitter users. Alternatively, users may have to set their devices to coordinate information from various networking and dating sites. For example, the wearer of the eyepiece may want to see all E-HARMONY users who are broadcasting their location. If an opted-in user is identified by the eyepiece, an augmented reality indicator may be laid over the opted-in user. The indicator may take on a different appearance if the user has something in common with the wearer, many things in common with the user, and the like. For example, and referring to , two people are being viewed by the wearer. Both of the people are identified as E-HARMONY users by the rings placed around them. However, the woman shown with solid rings has more than one item in common with the wearer while the woman shown with dotted rings has no items in common with the wearer. Any available profile information may get accessed and displayed to the user.","In an embodiment, when the wearer directs the eyepiece in the direction of a user who has a networking account, such as FACEBOOK, TWITTER, BLIPPY, LINKEDIN, GOGGLE, WIKIPEDIA, and the like, the user's recent posts or profile information may be displayed to the wearer. For example, recent status updates, \u201ctweets\u201d, \u201cblips\u201d, and the like may get displayed, as mentioned above for TwittARound. In an embodiment, when the wearer points the eyepiece in a target user's direction, they may indicate interest in the user if the eyepiece is pointed for a duration of time and\/or a gesture, head, eye, or audio control is activated. The target user may receive an indication of interest on their phone or in their glasses. If the target user had marked the wearer as interesting but was waiting on the wearer to show interest first, an indication may immediately pop up in the eyepiece of the target user's interest. A control mechanism may be used to capture an image and store the target user's information on associated non-volatile memory or in an online account.","In other applications for social networking, a facial recognition program, such as TAT Augmented ID, from TAT\u2014The Astonishing Tribe, Malmo, Sweden, may be used. Such a program may be used to identify a person by his or her facial characteristics. This software uses facial recognition software to identify a person. Using other applications, such as photo identifying software from Filch, one can then identify the particular nearby person, and one can then download information from social networking sites with information about the person. This information may include the person's name and the profile the person has made available on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and the like. This application may be used to refresh a user's memory of a person or to identify a nearby person, as well as to gather information about the person.","In other applications for social networking, the wearer may be able to utilize location-based facilities of the eyepiece to leave notes, comments, reviews, and the like, at locations, in association with people, places, products, and the like. For example, a person may be able to post a comment on a place they visited, where the posting may then be made available to others through the social network. In another example, a person may be able to post that comment at the location of the place such that the comment is available when another person comes to that location. In this way, a wearer may be able to access comments left by others when they come to the location. For instance, a wearer may come to the entrance to a restaurant, and be able to access reviews for the restaurant, such as sorted by some criteria (e.g. most recent review, age of reviewer, and the like).","A user may initiate the desired program by voice, by selecting a choice from a virtual touchscreen, as described above, by using a trackpad to select and choose the desired program, or by any of the control techniques described herein. Menu selections may then be made in a similar or complementary manner. Sensors or input devices mounted in convenient locations on the user's body may also be used, e.g., sensors and a track pad mounted on a wrist pad, on a glove, or even a discreet device, perhaps of the size of a smart phone or a personal digital assistant.","Applications of the present disclosure may provide the wearer with Internet access, such as for browsing, searching, shopping, entertainment, and the like, such as through a wireless communications interface to the eyepiece. For instance, a wearer may initiate a web search with a control gesture, such as through a control facility worn on some portion of the wearer's body (e.g. on the hand, the head, the foot), on some component being used by the wearer (e.g. a personal computer, a smart phone, a music player), on a piece of furniture near the wearer (e.g. a chair, a desk, a table, a lamp), and the like, where the image of the web search is projected for viewing by the wearer through the eyepiece. The wearer may then view the search through the eyepiece and control web interaction though the control facility.","In an example, a user may be wearing an embodiment configured as a pair of glasses, with the projected image of an Internet web browser provided through the glasses while retaining the ability to simultaneously view at least portions of the surrounding real environment. In this instance, the user may be wearing a motion sensitive control facility on their hand, where the control facility may transmit relative motion of the user's hand to the eyepiece as control motions for web control, such as similar to that of a mouse in a conventional personal computer configuration. It is understood that the user would be enabled to perform web actions in a similar fashion to that of a conventional personal computer configuration. In this case, the image of the web search is provided through the eyepiece while control for selection of actions to carry out the search is provided though motions of the hand. For instance, the overall motion of the hand may move a cursor within the projected image of the web search, the flick of the finger(s) may provide a selection action, and so forth. In this way, the wearer may be enabled to perform the desired web search, or any other Internet browser-enabled function, through an embodiment connected to the Internet. In one example, a user may have downloaded computer programs Yelp or Monocle, available from the App Store, or a similar product, such as NRU (\u201cnear you\u201d), an application from Zagat to locate nearby restaurants or other stores, Google Earth, Wikipedia, or the like. The person may initiate a search, for example, for restaurants, or other providers of goods or services, such as hotels, repairmen, and the like, or information. When the desired information is found, locations are displayed or a distance and direction to a desired location is displayed. The display may take the form of a virtual label co-located with the real world object in the user's view.","Other applications from Layar (Amsterdam, the Netherlands) include a variety of \u201clayers\u201d tailored for specific information desired by a user. A layer may include restaurant information, information about a specific company, real estate listings, gas stations, and so forth. Using the information provided in a software application, such as a mobile application and a user's global positioning system (GPS), information may be presented on a screen of the glasses with tags having the desired information. Using the haptic controls or other control discussed elsewhere in this disclosure, a user may pivot or otherwise rotate his or her body and view buildings tagged with virtual tags containing information. If the user seeks restaurants, the screen will display restaurant information, such as name and location. If a user seeks a particular address, virtual tags will appear on buildings in the field of view of the wearer. The user may then make selections or choices by voice, by trackpad, by virtual touch screen, and so forth.","Applications of the present disclosure may provide a way for advertisements to be delivered to the wearer. For example, advertisements may be displayed to the viewer through the eyepiece as the viewer is going about his or her day, while browsing the Internet, conducting a web search, walking through a store, and the like. For instance, the user may be performing a web search, and through the web search the user is targeted with an advertisement. In this example, the advertisement may be projected in the same space as the projected web search, floating off to the side, above, or below the view angle of the wearer. In another example, advertisements may be triggered for delivery to the eyepiece when some advertising providing facility, perhaps one in proximity to the wearer, senses the presence of the eyepiece (e.g. through a wireless connection, RFID, and the like), and directs the advertisement to the eyepiece. In embodiments, the eyepiece may be used for tracking of advertisement interactions, such as the user seeing or interacting with a billboard, a promotion, an advertisement, and the like. For instance, user's behavior with respect to advertisements may be tracked, such as to provide benefits, rewards, and the like to the user. In an example, the user may be paid five dollars in virtual cash whenever they see a billboard. The eyepiece may provide impression tracking, such as based on seeing branded images (e.g. based on time, geography), and the like. As a result, offers may be targeted based on the location and the event related to the eyepiece, such as what the user saw, heard, interacted with, and the like. In embodiments, ad targeting may be based on historical behavior, such as based on what the user has interacted with in the past, patterns of interactions, and the like.","For example, the wearer may be window-shopping in Manhattan, where stores are equipped with such advertising providing facilities. As the wearer walks by the stores, the advertising providing facilities may trigger the delivery of an advertisement to the wearer based on a known location of the user determined by an integrated location sensor of the eyepiece, such as a GPS. In an embodiment, the location of the user may be further refined via other integrated sensors, such as a magnetometer to enable hyperlocal augmented reality advertising. For example, a user on a ground floor of a mall may receive certain advertisements if the magnetometer and GPS readings place the user in front of a particular store. When the user goes up one flight in the mall, the GPS location may remain the same, but the magnetometer reading may indicate a change in elevation of the user and a new placement of the user in front of a different store. In embodiments, one may store personal profile information such that the advertising providing facility is able to better match advertisements to the needs of the wearer, the wearer may provide preferences for advertisements, the wearer may block at least some of the advertisements, and the like. The wearer may also be able to pass advertisements, and associated discounts, on to friends. The wearer may communicate them directly to friends that are in close proximity and enabled with their own eyepiece; they may also communicate them through a wireless Internet connection, such as to a social network of friends, though email, SMS; and the like. The wearer may be connected to facilities and\/or infrastructure that enables the communication of advertisements from a sponsor to the wearer; feedback from the wearer to an advertisement facility, the sponsor of the advertisement, and the like; to other users, such as friends and family, or someone in proximity to the wearer; to a store, such as locally on the eyepiece or in a remote site, such as on the Internet or on a user's home computer; and the like. These interconnectivity facilities may include integrated facilities to the eyepiece to provide the user's location and gaze direction, such as through the use of GPS, 3-axis sensors, magnetometer, gyros, accelerometers, and the like, for determining direction, speed, attitude (e.g. gaze direction) of the wearer. Interconnectivity facilities may provide telecommunications facilities, such as cellular link, a WiFi\/MiFi bridge, and the like. For instance, the wearer may be able to communicate through an available WiFi link, through an integrated MiFi (or any other personal or group cellular link) to the cellular system, and the like. There may be facilities for the wearer to store advertisements for a later use. There may be facilities integrated with the wearer's eyepiece or located in local computer facilities that enable caching of advertisements, such as within a local area, where the cached advertisements may enable the delivery of the advertisements as the wearer nears the location associated with the advertisement. For example, local advertisements may be stored on a server that contains geo-located local advertisements and specials, and these advertisements may be delivered to the wearer individually as the wearer approaches a particular location, or a set of advertisements may be delivered to the wearer in bulk when the wearer enters a geographic area that is associated with the advertisements so that the advertisements are available when the user nears a particular location. The geographic location may be a city, a part of the city, a number of blocks, a single block, a street, a portion of the street, sidewalk, and the like, representing regional, local, hyper-local areas. Note that the preceding discussion uses the term advertisement, but one skilled in the art will appreciate that this can also mean an announcement, a broadcast, a circular, a commercial, a sponsored communication, an endorsement, a notice, a promotion, a bulletin, a message, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0753","num":"0752"},"figref":["FIGS. 18-20A","FIG. 18","FIG. 18"],"b":"1800"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0754","num":"0753"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":"1900"},"As illustrated in , the augmented reality enabled device such as the camera lens provided in the eyepiece may be utilized to receive and\/or view graffiti , slogans, drawings, and the like, that may be displayed on the roadside or on top, side, front of the buildings and shops. The roadside billboards and the graffiti may have a visual (e.g. a code, a shape) or wireless indicator that may link the advertisement, or advertisement database, to the billboard. When the wearer nears and views the billboard, a projection of the billboard advertisement may then be provided to the wearer. In embodiments, one may also store personal profile information such that the advertisements may better match the needs of the wearer, the wearer may provide preferences for advertisements, the wearer may block at least some of the advertisements, and the like. In embodiments, the eyepiece may have brightness and contrast control over the eyepiece projected area of the billboard so as to improve readability for the advertisement, such as in a bright outside environment.","In other embodiments, users may post information or messages on a particular location, based on its GPS location or other indicator of location, such as a magnetometer reading. The intended viewer is able to see the message when the viewer is within a certain distance of the location, as explained with . In a first step  of the method , a user decides the location where the message is to be received by persons to whom the message is sent. The message is then posted , to be sent to the appropriate person or persons when the recipient is close to the intended \u201cviewing area.\u201d Location of the wearers of the augmented reality eyepiece is continuously updated  by the GPS system which forms a part of the eyepiece. When the GPS system determines that the wearer is within a certain distance of the desired viewing area, e.g., 10 meters, the message is then sent  to the viewer. In one embodiment, the message then appears as e-mail or a text message to the recipient, or if the recipient is wearing an eyepiece, the message may appear in the eyepiece. Because the message is sent to the person based on the person's location, in one sense, the message may be displayed as \u201cgraffiti\u201d on a building or feature at or near the specified location. Specific settings may be used to determine if all passersby to the \u201cviewing area\u201d can see the message or if only a specific person or group of people or devices with specific identifiers. For example, a soldier clearing a village may virtually mark a house as cleared by associating a message or identifier with the house, such as a big X marking the location of the house. The soldier may indicate that only other American soldiers may be able to receive the location-based content. When other American soldiers pass the house, they may receive an indication automatically, such as by seeing the virtual \u2018X\u2019 on the side of the house if they have an eyepiece or some other augmented reality-enabled device, or by receiving a message indicating that the house has been cleared. In another example, content related to safety applications may be streamed to the eyepiece, such as alerts, target identification, communications, and the like.","Embodiments may provide for a way to view information associated with products, such as in a store. Information may include nutritional information for food products, care instructions for clothing products, technical specifications for consumer electronics products, e-coupons, promotions, price comparisons with other like products, price comparisons with other stores, and the like. This information may be projected in relative position with the product, to the periphery of sight to the wearer, in relation to the store layout, and the like. The product may be identified visually through a SKU, a brand tag, and the like; transmitted by the product packaging, such as through an RFID tag on the product; transmitted by the store, such as based on the wearer's position in the store, in relative position to the products; and the like.","For example, a viewer may be walking through a clothing store, and as they walk are provided with information on the clothes on the rack, where the information is provided through the product's RFID tag. In embodiments, the information may be delivered as a list of information, as a graphic representation, as audio and\/or video presentation, and the like. In another example, the wearer may be food shopping, and advertisement providing facilities may be providing information to the wearer in association with products in the wearer's proximity, the wearer may be provided information when they pick up the product and view the brand, product name, SKU, and the like. In this way, the wearer may be provided a more informative environment in which to effectively shop.","One embodiment may allow a user to receive or share information about shopping or an urban area through the use of the augmented reality enabled devices such as the camera lens fitted in the eyepiece of exemplary sunglasses. These embodiments will use augmented reality (AR) software applications such as those mentioned above in conjunction with searching for providers of goods and services. In one scenario, the wearer of the eyepiece may walk down a street or a market for shopping purposes. Further, the user may activate various modes that may assist in defining user preferences for a particular scenario or environment. For example the user may enter navigation mode through which the wearer may be guided across the streets and the market for shopping of the preferred accessories and products. The mode may be selected and various directions may be given by the wearer through various methods such as through text commands, voice commands, and the like. In an embodiment, the wearer may give a voice command to select the navigation mode which may result in the augmented display in front of the wearer. The augmented information may depict information pertinent to the location of various shops and vendors in the market, offers in various shops and by various vendors, current happy hours, current date and time and the like. Various sorts of options may also be displayed to the wearer. The wearer may scroll the options and walk down the street guided through the navigation mode. Based on options provided, the wearer may select a place that suits him the best for shopping based on such as offers and discounts and the like. In embodiments, the eyepiece may provide the ability to search, browse, select, save, share, receive advertisements, and the like for items of purchase, such as viewed through the eyepiece. For example, the wearer may search for an item across the Internet and make a purchase without making a phone call, such as through an application store, commerce application, and the like.","The wearer may give a voice command to navigate toward the place and the wearer may then be guided toward it. The wearer may also receive advertisements and offers automatically or based on request regarding current deals, promotions and events in the interested location such as a nearby shopping store. The advertisements, deals and offers may appear in proximity of the wearer and options may be displayed for purchasing desired products based on the advertisements, deals and offers. The wearer may for example select a product and purchase it through a Google checkout. A message or an email may appear on the eyepiece, similar to the one depicted in , with information that the transaction for the purchase of the product has been completed. A product delivery status\/information may also be displayed. The wearer may further convey or alert friends and relatives regarding the offers and events through social networking platforms and may also ask them to join.","In embodiments, the user may wear the head-mounted eyepiece wherein the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user may view a surrounding environment and displayed content. The displayed content may comprise one or more local advertisements. The location of the eyepiece may be determined by an integrated location sensor and the local advertisement may have a relevance to the location of the eyepiece. By way of example, the user's location may be determined via GPS, RFID, manual input, and the like. Further, the user may be walking by a coffee shop, and based on the user's proximity to the shop, an advertisement, similar to that depicted in , showing the store's brand , such as the band for a fast food restaurant or coffee may appear in the user's field of view. The user may experience similar types of local advertisements as he or she moves about the surrounding environment.","In other embodiments, the eyepiece may contain a capacitive sensor capable of sensing whether the eyepiece is in contact with human skin. The sensor may be a capacitive sensor, a resistive sensor, an inductive sensor, an electromagnetic field sensor, or the like. Such sensor or group of sensors may be placed on the eyepiece and or eyepiece arm in such a manner that allows detection of when the glasses are being worn by a user. In other embodiments, sensors may be used to determine whether the eyepiece is in a position such that they may be worn by a user, for example, when the earpiece is in the unfolded position. Furthermore, local advertisements may be sent only when the eyepiece is in contact with human skin, in a wearable position, a combination of the two, actually worn by the user and the like. In other embodiments, the local advertisement may be sent in response to the eyepiece being powered on or in response to the eyepiece being powered on and worn by the user and the like. By way of example, an advertiser may choose to only send local advertisements when a user is in proximity to a particular establishment and when the user is actually wearing the glasses and they are powered on allowing the advertiser to target the advertisement to the user at the appropriate time.","In accordance with other embodiments, the local advertisement may be displayed to the user as a banner advertisement, two-dimensional graphic, text and the like. Further, the local advertisement may be associated with a physical aspect of the user's view of the surrounding environment. The local advertisement may also be displayed as an augmented reality advertisement wherein the advertisement is associated with a physical aspect of the surrounding environment. Such advertisement may be two or three-dimensional. By way of example, a local advertisement may be associated with a physical billboard as described further in  wherein the user's attention may be drawn to displayed content showing a beverage being poured from a billboard  onto an actual building in the surrounding environment. The local advertisement may also contain sound that is displayed to the user through an earpiece, audio device or other means. Further, the local advertisement may be animated in embodiments. For example, the user may view the beverage flow from the billboard onto an adjacent building and, optionally, into the surrounding environment. Similarly, an advertisement may display any other type of motion as desired in the advertisement. Additionally, the local advertisement may be displayed as a three-dimensional object that may be associated with or interact with the surrounding environment. In embodiments where the advertisement is associated with an object in the user's view of the surrounding environment, the advertisement may remain associated with or in proximity to the object even as the user turns his head. For example, if an advertisement, such as the coffee cup as described in , is associated with a particular building, the coffee cup advertisement may remain associated with and in place over the building even as the user turns his head to look at another object in his environment.","In other embodiments, local advertisements may be displayed to the user based on a web search conducted by the user where the advertisement is displayed in the content of the web search results. For example, the user may search for \u201chappy hour\u201d as he is walking down the street, and in the content of the search results, a local advertisement may be displayed advertising a local bar's beer prices.","Further, the content of the local advertisement may be determined based on the user's personal information. The user's information may be made available to a web application, an advertising facility and the like. Further, a web application, advertising facility or the user's eyepiece may filter the advertising based on the user's personal information. Generally, for example, a user may store personal information about his likes and dislikes and such information may be used to direct advertising to the user's eyepiece. By way of specific example, the user may store data about his affinity for a local sports team, and as advertisements are made available, those advertisements with his favorite sports team may be given preference and pushed to the user. Similarly, a user's dislikes may be used to exclude certain advertisements from view. In various embodiments, the advertisements may be cashed on a server where the advertisement may be accessed by at least one of an advertising facility, web application and eyepiece and displayed to the user.","In various embodiments, the user may interact with any type of local advertisement in numerous ways. The user may request additional information related to a local advertisement by making at least one action of an eye movement, body movement and other gesture. For example, if an advertisement is displayed to the user, he may wave his hand over the advertisement in his field of view or move his eyes over the advertisement in order to select the particular advertisement to receive more information relating to such advertisement. Moreover, the user may choose to ignore the advertisement by any movement or control technology described herein such as through an eye movement, body movement, other gesture and the like. Further, the user may chose to ignore the advertisement by allowing it to be ignored by default by not selecting the advertisement for further interaction within a given period of time. For example, if the user chooses not to gesture for more information from the advertisement within five seconds of the advertisement being displayed, the advertisement may be ignored by default and disappear from the users view. Furthermore, the user may select to not allow local advertisements to be displayed whereby said user selects such an option on a graphical user interface or by turning such feature off via a control on said eyepiece.","In other embodiments, the eyepiece may include an audio device. Accordingly, the displayed content may comprise a local advertisement and audio such that the user is also able to hear a message or other sound effects as they relate to the local advertisement. By way of example, and referring again to , while the user sees the beer being poured, he will actually be able to hear an audio transmission corresponding to the actions in the advertisement. In this case, the user may hear the bottle open and then the sound of the liquid pouring out of the bottle and onto the rooftop. In yet other embodiments, a descriptive message may be played, or general information may be given as part of the advertisement, or both. In embodiments, any audio may be played as desired for the advertisement.","In accordance with another embodiment, social networking may be facilitated with the use of the augmented reality enabled devices such as a camera lens fitted in the eyepiece. This may be utilized to connect several users or other persons that may not have the augmented reality enabled device together who may share thoughts and ideas with each other. For instance, the wearer of the eyepiece may be sitting in a school campus along with other students. The wearer may connect with and send a message to a first student who may be present in a coffee shop. The wearer may ask the first student regarding persons interested in a particular subject such as environmental economics for example. As other students pass through the field of view of the wearer, the camera lens fitted inside the eyepiece may track and match the students to a networking database such as \u2018Google me\u2019 that may contain public profiles. Profiles of interested and relevant persons from the public database may appear and pop-up in front of the wearer on the eyepiece. Some of the profiles that may not be relevant may either be blocked or appear blocked to the user. The relevant profiles may be highlighted for quick reference of the wearer. The relevant profiles selected by the wearer may be interested in the subject environmental economics and the wearer may also connect with them. Further, they may also be connected with the first student. In this manner, a social network may be established by the wearer with the use of the eyepiece enabled with the feature of the augmented reality. The social networks managed by the wearer and the conversations therein may be saved for future reference.","The present disclosure may be applied in a real estate scenario with the use of the augmented reality enabled devices such as a camera lens fitted in an eyepiece.

The wearer may select and receive information about the selected option. The augmented reality enabled scenes of the selected options may be displayed to the wearer and the wearer may be able to view pictures and take a facility tour in the virtual environment. The wearer may further receive information about real estate agents and fix an appointment with one of those. An email notification or a call notification may also be received on the eyepiece for confirmation of the appointment. If the wearer finds the selected real estate of worth, a deal may be made and that may be purchased by the wearer.","In accordance with another embodiment, customized and sponsored tours and travels may be enhanced through the use of the augmented reality-enabled devices, such as a camera lens fitted in the eyepiece. For instance, the wearer (as a tourist) may arrive in a city such as Paris and wants to receive tourism and sightseeing related information about the place to accordingly plan his visit for the consecutive days during his stay. The wearer may put on his eyepiece or operate any other augmented reality enabled device and give a voice or text command regarding his request. The augmented reality enabled eyepiece may locate wearer position through geo-sensing techniques and decide tourism preferences of the wearer. The eyepiece may receive and display customized information based on the request of the wearer on a screen. The customized tourism information may include information about art galleries and museums, monuments and historical places, shopping complexes, entertainment and nightlife spots, restaurants and bars, most popular tourist destinations and centers\/attractions of tourism, most popular local\/cultural\/regional destinations and attractions, and the like without limitations. Based on user selection of one or more of these categories, the eyepiece may prompt the user with other questions such as time of stay, investment in tourism and the like. The wearer may respond through the voice command and in return receive customized tour information in an order as selected by the wearer. For example the wearer may give a priority to the art galleries over monuments. Accordingly, the information may be made available to the wearer. Further, a map may also appear in front of the wearer with different sets of tour options and with different priority rank such as:\n\n","The wearer, for instance, may select the first option since it is ranked as highest in priority based on wearer indicated preferences. Advertisements related to sponsors may pop up right after selection. Subsequently, a virtual tour may begin in the augmented reality manner that may be very close to the real environment. The wearer may for example take a 30 seconds tour to a vacation special to the Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas. The virtual 3D tour may include a quick look at the rooms, beach, public spaces, parks, facilities, and the like. The wearer may also experience shopping facilities in the area and receive offers and discounts in those places and shops. At the end of the day, the wearer might have experienced a whole day tour sitting in his chamber or hotel. Finally, the wearer may decide and schedule his plan accordingly.","Another embodiment may allow information concerning auto repairs and maintenance services with the use of the augmented reality enabled devices such as a camera lens fitted in the eyepiece. The wearer may receive advertisements related to auto repair shops and dealers by sending a voice command for the request.

The eyepiece may pull up a 3D model of the wearer's vehicle and show the amount of oil left in the car through an augmented reality enabled scene\/view. The eyepiece may show other relevant information also about the vehicle of the wearer such as maintenance requirements in other parts like brake pads. The wearer may see 3D view of the wearing brake pads and may be interested in getting those repaired or changed. Accordingly, the wearer may schedule an appointment with a vendor to fix the problem via using the integrated wireless communication capability of the eyepiece. The confirmation may be received through an email or an incoming call alert on the eyepiece camera lens.","In accordance with another embodiment, gift shopping may benefit through the use of the augmented reality enabled devices such as a camera lens fitted in the eyepiece. The wearer may post a request for a gift for some occasion through a text or voice command. The eyepiece may prompt the wearer to answer his preferences such as type of gifts, age group of the person to receive the gift, cost range of the gift and the like. Various options may be presented to the user based on the received preferences. For instance, the options presented to the wearer may be: Cookie basket, Wine and cheese basket, Chocolate assortment, Golfer's gift basket, and the like.","The available options may be scrolled by the wearer and the best fit option may be selected via the voice command or text command. For example, the wearer may select the Golfer's gift basket. A 3D view of the Golfer's gift basket along with a golf course may appear in front of the wearer. The virtual 3D view of the Golfer's gift basket and the golf course enabled through the augmented reality may be perceived very close to the real world environment. The wearer may finally respond to the address, location and other similar queries prompted through the eyepiece. A confirmation may then be received through an email or an incoming call alert on the eyepiece camera lens.","In various embodiments, a glasses platform may be used with various control mechanisms and take physical and informational inputs, perform processing functions, and control on-board and external features and systems, including based on feedback loops, to interact with content and execute e-commerce transactions. While such e-commerce and content scenarios are vast, some such scenarios include but are not limited to retail shopping environments, educational environments, transportation environments, home environments, event environments, dining\/drinking environments, and outdoor environments. While these areas are described herein, various other scenarios would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.","In embodiments, the glasses platform may be used in retail shopping environments. For example, the user may use the glasses to receive content related to an item and\/or environment of interest. The user may receive and\/or look up pricing information or alternative offers, product information such as SKU\/barcodes, ratings, advertisements, GroupOn offers and the like in a retail shopping environment.

These games may be computer video games, such as those furnished by Electronic Arts Mobile, UbiSoft and Activision Blizzard, e.g., World of Warcraft\u00ae (WoW). Just as games and recreational applications are played on computers at home (rather than computers at work), augmented reality glasses may also use gaming applications. The screen may appear on an inside of the glasses so that a user may observe the game and participate in the game. In addition, controls for playing the game may be provided through a virtual game controller, such as a joystick, control module or mouse, described elsewhere herein. The game controller may include sensors or other output type elements attached to the user's hand, such as for feedback from the user through acceleration, vibration, force, pressure, electrical impulse, temperature, electric field sensing, and the like. Sensors and actuators may be attached to the user's hand by way of a wrap, ring, pad, glove, bracelet, and the like. As such, an eyepiece virtual mouse may allow the user to translate motions of the hand, wrist, and\/or fingers into motions of the cursor on the eyepiece display, where \u201cmotions\u201d may include slow movements, rapid motions, jerky motions, position, change in position, and the like, and may allow users to work in three dimensions, without the need for a physical surface, and including some or all of the six degrees of freedom.","As seen in , gaming application implementations  may use both the internet and a GPS. In one embodiment, a game is downloaded from a customer database via a game provider, perhaps using their web services and the internet as shown, to a user computer or augmented reality glasses. At the same time, the glasses, which also have telecommunication capabilities, receive and send telecommunications and telemetry signals via a cellular tower and a satellite. Thus, an on-line gaming system has access to information about the user's location as well as the user's desired gaming activities.","Games may take advantage of this knowledge of the location of each player. For example, the games may build in features that use the player's location, via a GPS locator or magnetometer locator, to award points for reaching the location. The game may also send a message, e.g., display a clue, or a scene or images, when a player reaches a particular location. A message, for example, may be to go to a next destination, which is then provided to the player. Scenes or images may be provided as part of a struggle or an obstacle which must be overcome, or as an opportunity to earn game points. Thus, in one embodiment, augmented reality eyepieces or glasses may use the wearer's location to quicken and enliven computer-based video games.","One method of playing augmented reality games is depicted in . In this method , a user logs into a website whereby access to a game is permitted. The game is selected. In one example, the user may join a game, if multiple player games are available and desired; alternatively, the user may create a custom game, perhaps using special roles the user desired. The game may be scheduled, and in some instances, players may select a particular time and place for the game, distribute directions to the site where the game will be played, etc. Later, the players meet and check into the game, with one or more players using the augmented reality glasses. Participants then play the game and if applicable, the game results and any statistics (scores of the players, game times, etc.) may be stored. Once the game has begun, the location may change for different players in the game, sending one player to one location and another player or players to a different location. The game may then have different scenarios for each player or group of players, based on their GPS or magnetometer-provided locations. Each player may also be sent different messages or images based on his or her role, his or her location, or both. Of course, each scenario may then lead to other situations, other interactions, directions to other locations, and so forth. In one sense, such a game mixes the reality of the player's location with the game in which the player is participating.","Games can range from simple games of the type that would be played in a palm of a player's hand, such as small, single player games. Alternatively, more complicated, multi-player games may also be played. In the former category are games such as SkySiege, A R Drone and Fire Fighter 360. In addition, multiplayer games are also easily envisioned. Since all players must log into the game, a particular game may be played by friends who log in and specify the other person or persons. The location of the players is also available, via GPS or other method. Sensors in the augmented reality glasses or in a game controller as described above, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes or even a magnetic compass, may also be used for orientation and game playing. An example is AR Invaders, available for iPhone applications from the App Store. Other games may be obtained from other vendors and for non-iPhone type systems, such as Layar, of Amsterdam and Paris SA, Paris, France, supplier of AR Drone, A R Flying Ace and AR Pursuit.","In embodiments, games may also be in 3D such that the user can experience 3D gaming. For example, when playing a 3D game, the user may view a virtual, augmented reality or other environment where the user is able to control his view perspective. The user may turn his head to view various aspects of the virtual environment or other environment. As such, when the user turns his head or makes other movements, he may view the game environment as if he were actually in such environment. For example, the perspective of the user may be such that the user is put \u2018into\u2019 a 3D game environment with at least some control over the viewing perspective where the user may be able to move his head and have the view of the game environment change in correspondence to the changed head position. Further, the user may be able to \u2018walk into\u2019 the game when he physically walks forward, and have the perspective change as the user moves. Further, the perspective may also change as the user moves the gazing view of his eyes, and the like. Additional image information may be provided, such as at the sides of the user's view that could be accessed by turning the head.","In embodiments, the 3D game environment may be projected onto the lenses of the glasses or viewed by other means. Further, the lenses may be opaque or transparent. In embodiments, the 3D game image may be associated with and incorporate the external environment of the user such that the user may be able to turn his head and the 3D image and external environment stay together. Further, such 3D gaming image and external environment associations may change such that the 3D image associates with more than one object or more than one part of an object in the external environment at various instances such that it appears to the user that the 3D image is interacting with various aspects or objects of the actual environment. By way of example, the user may view a 3D game monster climb up a building or on to an automobile where such building or automobile is an actual object in the user's environment. In such a game, the user may interact with the monster as part of the 3D gaming experience. The actual environment around the user may be part of the 3D gaming experience. In embodiments where the lenses are transparent, the user may interact in a 3D gaming environment while moving about his or her actual environment. The 3D game may incorporate elements of the user's environment into the game, it may be wholly fabricated by the game, or it may be a mixture of both.","In embodiments, the 3D images may be associated with or generated by an augmented reality program, 3D game software and the like or by other means. In embodiments where augmented reality is employed for the purpose of 3D gaming, a 3D image may appear or be perceived by the user based on the user's location or other data. Such an augmented reality application may provide for the user to interact with such 3D image or images to provide a 3D gaming environment when using the glasses. As the user changes his location, for example, play in the game may advance and various 3D elements of the game may become accessible or inaccessible to the viewer. By way of example, various 3D enemies of the user's game character may appear in the game based on the actual location of the user. The user may interact with or cause reactions from other users playing the game and or 3D elements associated with the other users playing the game. Such elements associated with users may include weapons, messages, currency, a 3D image of the user and the like. Based on a user's location or other data, he or she may encounter, view, or engage, by any means, other users and 3D elements associated with other users. In embodiments, 3D gaming may also be provided by software installed in or downloaded to the glasses where the user's location is or is not used.","In embodiments, the lenses may be opaque to provide the user with a virtual reality or other virtual 3D gaming experience where the user is \u2018put into\u2019 the game where the user's movements may change the viewing perspective of the 3D gaming environment for the user. The user may move through or explore the virtual environment through various body, head, and or eye movements, use of game controllers, one or more touch screens, or any of the control techniques described herein which may allow the user to navigate, manipulate, and interact with the 3D environment, and thereby play the 3D game.","In various embodiments, the user may navigate, interact with and manipulate the 3D game environment and experience 3D gaming via body, hand, finger, eye, or other movements, through the use of one or more wired or wireless controllers, one or more touch screens, any of the control techniques described herein, and the like.","In embodiments, internal and external facilities available to the eyepiece may provide for learning the behavior of a user of the eyepiece, and storing that learned behavior in a behavioral database to enable location-aware control, activity-aware control, predictive control, and the like. For example, a user may have events and\/or tracking of actions recorded by the eyepiece, such as commands from the user, images sensed through a camera, GPS location of the user, sensor inputs over time, triggered actions by the user, communications to and from the user, user requests, web activity, music listened to, directions requested, recommendations used or provided, and the like. This behavioral data may be stored in a behavioral database, such as tagged with a user identifier or autonomously. The eyepiece may collect this data in a learn mode, collection mode, and the like. The eyepiece may utilize past data taken by the user to inform or remind the user of what they did before, or alternatively, the eyepiece may utilize the data to predict what eyepiece functions and applications the user may need based on past collected experiences. In this way, the eyepiece may act as an automated assistant to the user, for example, launching applications at the usual time the user launches them, turning off augmented reality and the GPS when nearing a location or entering a building, streaming in music when the user enters the gym, and the like. Alternately, the learned behavior and\/or actions of a plurality of eyepiece users may be autonomously stored in a collective behavior database, where learned behaviors amongst the plurality of users are available to individual users based on similar conditions. For example, a user may be visiting a city, and waiting for a train on a platform, and the eyepiece of the user accesses the collective behavior database to determine what other users have done while waiting for the train, such as getting directions, searching for points of interest, listening to certain music, looking up the train schedule, contacting the city website for travel information, connecting to social networking sites for entertainment in the area, and the like. In this way, the eyepiece may be able to provide the user with an automated assistant with the benefit of many different user experiences. In embodiments, the learned behavior may be used to develop preference profiles, recommendations, advertisement targeting, social network contacts, behavior profiles for the user or groups of users, and the like, for\/to the user.","In an embodiment, the augmented reality eyepiece or glasses may include one or more acoustic sensors for detecting sound . An example is depicted above in . In one sense, acoustic sensors are similar to microphones, in that they detect sounds. Acoustic sensors typically have one or more frequency bandwidths at which they are more sensitive, and the sensors can thus be chosen for the intended application. Acoustic sensors are available from a variety of manufacturers and are available with appropriate transducers and other required circuitry. Manufacturers include ITT Electronic Systems, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA; Meggitt Sensing Systems, San Juan Capistrano, Calif., USA; and National Instruments, Austin, Tex., USA. Suitable microphones include those which comprise a single microphone as well as those which comprise an array of microphones, or a microphone array.","Acoustic sensors may include those using micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. Because of the very fine structure in a MEMS sensor, the sensor is extremely sensitive and typically has a wide range of sensitivity. MEMS sensors are typically made using semiconductor manufacturing techniques. An element of a typical MEMS accelerometer is a moving beam structure composed of two sets of fingers. One set is fixed to a solid ground plane on a substrate; the other set is attached to a known mass mounted on springs that can move in response to an applied acceleration. This applied acceleration changes the capacitance between the fixed and moving beam fingers. The result is a very sensitive sensor. Such sensors are made, for example, by STMicroelectronics, Austin, Tex. and Honeywell International, Morristown N.J., USA.","In addition to identification, sound capabilities of the augmented reality devices may also be applied to locating an origin of a sound. As is well known, at least two sound or acoustic sensors are needed to locate a sound. The acoustic sensor will be equipped with appropriate transducers and signal processing circuits, such as a digital signal processor, for interpreting the signal and accomplishing a desired goal. One application for sound locating sensors may be to determine the origin of sounds from within an emergency location, such as a burning building, an automobile accident, and the like. Emergency workers equipped with embodiments described herein may each have one or more than one acoustic sensors or microphones embedded within the frame. Of course, the sensors could also be worn on the person's clothing or even attached to the person. In any event, the signals are transmitted to the controller of the augmented reality eyepiece. The eyepiece or glasses are equipped with GPS technology and may also be equipped with direction-finding capabilities; alternatively, with two sensors per person, the microcontroller can determine a direction from which the noise originated.","If there are two or more firefighters, or other emergency responders, their location is known from their GPS capabilities. Either of the two, or a fire chief, or the control headquarters, then knows the position of two responders and the direction from each responder to the detected noise. The exact point of origin of the noise can then be determined using known techniques and algorithms. See e.g., Acoustic Vector-Sensor Beamforming and Capon Direction Estimation, M. Hawkes and A. Nehorai, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 46, no. 9, September 1998, at 2291-2304; see also Cramer-Rao Bounds for Direction Finding by an Acoustic Vector Sensor Under Nonideal Gain-Phase Responses, Noncollocation or Nonorthogonal Orientation, P. K. Tam and K. T. Wong, IEEE Sensors Journal, vol. 9. No. 8, August 2009, at 969-982. The techniques used may include timing differences (differences in time of arrival of the parameter sensed), acoustic velocity differences, and sound pressure differences. Of course, acoustic sensors typically measure levels of sound pressure (e.g., in decibels), and these other parameters may be used in appropriate types of acoustic sensors, including acoustic emission sensors and ultrasonic sensors or transducers.","The appropriate algorithms and all other necessary programming may be stored in the microcontroller of the eyepiece, or in memory accessible to the eyepiece. Using more than one responder, or several responders, a likely location may then be determined, and the responders can attempt to locate the person to be rescued. In other applications, responders may use these acoustic capabilities to determine the location of a person of interest to law enforcement. In still other applications, a number of people on maneuvers may encounter hostile fire, including direct fire (line of sight) or indirect fire (out of line of sight, including high angle fire). The same techniques described here may be used to estimate a location of the hostile fire. If there are several persons in the area, the estimation may be more accurate, especially if the persons are separated at least to some extent, over a wider area. This may be an effective tool to direct counter-battery or counter-mortar fire against hostiles. Direct fire may also be used if the target is sufficiently close.","An example using embodiments of the augmented reality eyepieces is depicted in . In this example B, numerous soldiers are on patrol, each equipped with augmented reality eyepieces, and are alert for hostile fire. The sounds detected by their acoustic sensors or microphones may be relayed to a squad vehicle as shown, to their platoon leader, or to a remote tactical operations center (TOC) or command post (CP). Alternatively, or in addition to these, the signals may also be sent to a mobile device, such as an airborne platform, as shown. Communications among the soldiers and the additional locations may be facilitated using a local area network, or other network. In addition, all the transmitted signals may be protected by encryption or other protective measures. One or more of the squad vehicle, the platoon commander, the mobile platform, the TOC or the CP will have an integration capability for combining the inputs from the several soldiers and determining a possible location of the hostile fire. The signals from each soldier will include the location of the soldier from a GPS capability inherent in the augmented reality glasses or eyepiece. The acoustic sensors on each soldier may indicate a possible direction of the noise. Using signals from several soldiers, the direction and possibly the location of the hostile fire may be determined. The soldiers may then neutralize the location.","In addition to microphones, the augmented reality eyepiece may be equipped with ear buds, which may be articulating ear buds, as mentioned elsewhere herein, and may be removably attached , or may be equipped with an audio output jack . The eyepiece and ear buds may be equipped to deliver noise-cancelling interference, allowing the user to better hear sounds delivered from the audio-video communications capabilities of the augmented reality eyepiece or glasses, and may feature automatic gain control. The speakers or ear buds of the augmented reality eyepiece may also connect with the full audio and visual capabilities of the device, with the ability to deliver high quality and clear sound from the included telecommunications device. As noted elsewhere herein, this includes radio or cellular telephone (smart phone) audio capabilities, and may also include complementary technologies, such as Bluetooth\u2122 capabilities or related technologies, such as IEEE 802.11, for wireless personal area networks (WPAN).","Another aspect of the augmented audio capabilities includes speech recognition and identification capabilities. Speech recognition concerns understanding what is said while speech identification concerns understanding who the speaker is. Speech identification may work hand in hand with the facial recognition capabilities of these devices to more positively identify persons of interest. As described elsewhere in this document, a camera connected as part of the augmented reality eyepiece can unobtrusively focus on desired personnel, such as a single person in a crowd or multiple faces in a crowd. Using the camera and appropriate facial recognition software, an image of the person or people may be taken. The features of the image are then broken down into any number of measurements and statistics, and the results are compared to a database of known persons. An identity may then be made. In the same manner, a voice or voice sampling from the person of interest may be taken. The sample may be marked or tagged, e.g., at a particular time interval, and labeled, e.g., a description of the person's physical characteristics or a number. The voice sample may be compared to a database of known persons, and if the person's voice matches, then an identification may be made. In embodiments, multiple individuals of interest may by selected, such as for biometric identification. The multiple selection may be through the use of a cursor, a hand gesture, an eye movement, and the like. As a result of the multiple selection, information concerning the selected individuals may be provided to the user, such as through the display, through audio, and the like.","In embodiments where the camera is used for biometric identification of multiple people in a crowd, control technologies described herein may be used to select faces or irises for imaging. For example, a cursor selection using the hand-worn control device may be used to select multiple faces in a view of the user's surrounding environment. In another example, gaze tracking may be used to select which faces to select for biometric identification. In another example, the hand-worn control device may sense a gesture used to select the individuals, such as pointing at each individual.","In one embodiment, important characteristics of a particular person's speech may be understood from a sample or from many samples of the person's voice. The samples are typically broken into segments, frames and subframes. Typically, important characteristics include a fundamental frequency of the person's voice, energy, formants, speaking rate, and the like. These characteristics are analyzed by software which analyses the voice according to certain formulae or algorithms. This field is constantly changing and improving. However, currently such classifiers may include algorithms such as neural network classifiers, k-classifiers, hidden Markov models, Gaussian mixture models and pattern matching algorithms, among others.","A general template  for speech recognition and speaker identification is depicted in . A first step  is to provide a speech signal. Ideally, one has a known sample from prior encounters with which to compare the signal. The signal is then digitized in step  and is partitioned in step  into fragments, such as segments, frames and subframes. Features and statistics of the speech sample are then generated and extracted in step . The classifier, or more than one classifier, is then applied in step  to determine general classifications of the sample. Post-processing of the sample may then be applied in step , e.g., to compare the sample to known samples for possible matching and identification. The results may then be output in step . The output may be directed to the person requesting the matching, and may also be recorded and sent to other persons and to one or more databases.","In an embodiment, the audio capabilities of the eyepiece include hearing protection with the associated earbuds. The audio processor of the eyepiece may enable automatic noise suppression, such as if a loud noise is detected near the wearer's head. Any of the control technologies described herein may be used with automatic noise suppression.","In an embodiment, the eyepiece may include a nitinol head strap. The head strap may be a thin band of curved metal which may either pull out from the arms of the eyepiece or rotate out and extend out to behind the head to secure the eyepiece to the head. In one embodiment, the tip of the nitinol strap may have a silicone cover such that the silicone cover is grasped to pull out from the ends of the arms. In embodiments, only one arm has a nitinol band, and it gets secured to the other arm to form a strap. In other embodiments, both arms have a nitinol band and both sides get pulled out to either get joined to form a strap or independently grasp a portion of the head to secure the eyepiece on the wearer's head. In embodiments, the eyepiece may have interchangeable equipment to attach the eyepiece to an individual's head, such as a joint where a head strap, glasses arms, helmet strap, helmet snap connection, and the like may be attached. For example, there may be a joint in the eyepiece near the user's temple where the eyepiece may attach to a strap, and where the strap may be disconnected so the user may attach arms to make the eyepiece take the form of glasses, attach to a helmet, and the like. In embodiments, the interchangeable equipment attaching the eyepiece to the user's head or to a helmet may include an embedded antenna. For example, a Nitinol head strap may have an embedded antenna inside, such as for a particular frequency, for a plurality of frequencies, and the like. In addition, the arm, strap, and the like, may contain RF absorbing foam in order to aid in the absorption of RF energy while the antenna is used in transmission.","Referring to , the eyepiece may include one or more adjustable wrap around extendable arms . The adjustable wrap around extendable arms  may secure the position of the eyepiece to the user's head. One or more of the extendable arms  may be made out of a shape memory material. In embodiments, one or both of the arms may be made of nitinol and\/or any shape-memory material. In other instances, the end of at least one of the wrap around extendable arms  may be covered with silicone. Further, the adjustable wrap around extendable arms  may extend from the end of an eyepiece arm . They may extend telescopically and\/or they may slide out from an end of the eyepiece arms. They may slide out from the interior of the eyepiece arms  or they may slide along an exterior surface of the eyepiece arms . Further, the extendable arms  may meet and secure to each other. The extendable arms may also attach to another portion of the head mounted eyepiece to create a means for securing the eyepiece to the user's head. The wrap around extendable arms  may meet to secure to each other, interlock, connect, magnetically couple, or secure by other means so as to provide a secure attachment to the user's head. In embodiments, the adjustable wrap around extendable arms  may also be independently adjusted to attach to or grasp portions of the user's head. As such the independently adjustable arms may allow the user increased customizability for a personalized fit to secure the eyepiece to the user's head. Further, in embodiments, at least one of the wrap around extendable arms  may be detachable from the head mounted eyepiece. In yet other embodiments, the wrap around extendable arms  may be an add-on feature of the head mounted eyepiece. In such instances, the user may choose to put extendable, non-extendable or other arms on to the head mounted eyepiece.

Accordingly, the user may customize that type of material from which the adjustable wrap around extendable arm  is made by selecting a different kit with specific extendable arms suited to his preferences. Accordingly, the user may customize his eyepiece for his particular needs and preferences.","In yet other embodiments, an adjustable strap, , may be attached to the eyepiece arms such that it extends around the back of the user's head in order to secure the eyepiece in place. The strap may be adjusted to a proper fit. It may be made out of any suitable material, including but not limited to rubber, silicone, plastic, cotton and the like.","In an embodiment, the eyepiece may be secured to the user's head by a plurality of other structures, such a rigid arm, a flexible arm, a gooseneck flex arm, a cable tensioned system, and the like. For instance, a flexible arm may be constructed from a flexible tubing, such as in a gooseneck configuration, where the flexible arm may be flexed into position to adjust to the fit of a given user, and where the flexible arm may be reshaped as needed. In another instance, a flexible arm may be constructed from a cable tensioned system, such as in a robotic finger configuration, having multiple joints connecting members that are bent into a curved shape with a pulling force applied to a cable running through the joints and members. In this case, the cable-driven system may implement an articulating ear horn for size adjustment and eyepiece headwear retention. The cable-tensioned system may have two or more linkages, the cable may be stainless steel, Nitinol-based, electro-actuated, ratcheted, wheel adjusted, and the like.","Embodiments of a cable-tensioned system  are shown in FIGS. -A&B. In embodiments, a cable tension system may comprise an ear horn  comprised of two or more joints connecting members that may be bent to a curved shape with a pulling force applied to a cable  running through the joints and\/or members. In an erect position as shown in , the ear horn may be positioned straight along the user's head. The cable  may be attached to and tightened via an adjustor  whereby positioning the adjustor to increase tension in the cable  causes the ear horn to bend or curve to shape to the user's head. By increasing such tension, the ear horn may stiffen and or become more rigid. By shaping to the user's head, the ear horn  may adjust to a specific user's head and\/or to assist in eyewear retention by securely holding eyewear to a user's head. In embodiments, as the tension of the cable  increases, the ear horn becomes more rigid or less relaxed to position to the user's head, and as the tension is released in the cable , the ear horn becomes more flexible allowing one or both of ear horns to straighten and\/or to fold flat. In embodiments, the adjustor  may be a ratcheted, electro-actuated, wheel adjusted, comprise a wedge slider, and the like. In embodiments, a wedge slider may be a tapered adjustment that may allow the position of one or more portions of the ear horn and\/or eyepiece to be raised or lowed by pushing or pulling a tab or the like in or out to provide the adjustment. In embodiments, the ear horn  may be constructed in a robotic finger configuration and shaped as shown in . The adjustable ear horn as described herein may provide the benefit of securing the eyepiece to the user's head while providing the convenience of folding for ease of use. In embodiments, the ear horn may provide a wraparound head design where the ear horns of the right and left earpiece wrap around the user's head and touch or nearly touch in the back of the user's head. In embodiments, the ear horns may fasten to each other for added security. Such fastening may be through magnets on each ear horn, a hooking mechanism on the ear horn, and the like. In embodiments, the ear horns may wrap or contour partially or completely around the user's head and\/or they may secure to the user's head by running along the side of the user's head and\/or securing behind the user's ear. In embodiments, the ear horn may attach to an earpiece of an eyepiece such as the earpiece  shown in . The ear horn may be permanently or removably attached to the earpiece. In embodiments, the ear horn may comprise a portion of the earpiece of an eyepiece as shown in , or it may comprise the entire earpiece (not shown). In embodiments, the adjustor  may be positioned on the portion of the ear horn proximate to the eyepiece, on the end of the ear horn near or past the user's ear, or on any other piece of the ear horn and\/or eyepiece. In embodiments one or both ear horns may be adjustable as described herein. In embodiments as described herein, an ear horn (shown by itself and without the eyepiece) may wrap and\/or contour to the user's head as shown in .","In embodiments, a switchable attraction between multiple layers in a laminate may be used with the ear horns. For example one or more ear horns may comprise layers in a laminate and the attraction between layers may come from magnetic, electrostatic, and\/or vacuum means. In embodiments, magnets may be used by rotating the poles to be in an attracting or repelling position allowing layers in laminate to attract to each other such that the ear horns stiffen and to repel each other such that the ear horns relax. In embodiments where laminate layers are close together, an electric voltage may be applied to create an electrostatic attraction that may be electrically switched. As the attraction is created, the ear horns may stiffen. When the voltage is removed, or the electrostatic attraction is switched, the ear horns may relax. In embodiments, a vacuum may be created by forcing two layers together which fit together and have a spring back in one or more portions of the layers that creates a cavity or void between the layers creating a vacuum. As the layers are forced together, they may allow the ear horn to stiffen. The vacuum seal may be broken to allow the ear horn to relax. In various embodiments, as the ear horns stiffen, they may provide a more rigid and\/or secure retention of the eyepiece to the user's head. In embodiments, the ear horns may wrap or contour partially or completely around the user's head and\/or they may secure to the user's head by running along the side of the user's head and\/or securing behind the user's ear and\/or to the back of the user's head. As the electrostatic voltage, magnetic attraction, and\/or vacuum is adjusted, the ear horns may stiffen to allow the ear horns to secure to the user's head, and the ear horns may relax or release to straighten and\/or to fold flat to a closed position.","In embodiments, one or more ear horns may comprise an inner rod and\/or string structure where each ear horn further comprises a magnet. The magnet of each ear horn may connect to the other allowing the two ear horns to wrap around the user's head. The action of the magnets connecting to one another may allow the string and\/or inner rod structure to tighten providing a more secure fit to the user's head. By connecting the magnets, in embodiments, inner rods of the ear horns may erect or become firmer to allow the ear horns to wrap around the user's head and\/or inner strings of the ear horn may tighten and allow the ear horns to wrap around the user's head. In embodiments, the ear horns may wrap or contour partially or completely around the user's head and\/or they may secure to the user's head by running along the side of the user's head and\/or securing behind the user's ear. When the magnets are not connected, the ear horn may straighten and\/or may be able to be folded flat.","In embodiments, one or more ear horns may utilize air pressure in chambers inside of the ear horns which may stiffen the ear horns. The air pressure may be increased to stiffen the ear horn. Such stiffening may allow the ear horns to adjust to and\/or wrap around the user's head when the eyepiece is in use. In embodiments, the ear horns may wrap or contour partially or completely around the user's head and\/or they may secure to the user's head by running along the side of the user's head and\/or securing behind the user's ear. The air pressure may be decreased to relax the ear horns. When the ear horns are relaxed, they may be able to straighten and\/or to be folded flat. The air pressure may be adjusted before or after being put on or taken off the user's head. In embodiments, the air pressure may be adjusted by a pump in the side frame that is operated by finger pressure or other means. In embodiments, pump may be adjusted via a user interface displayed in the glasses or by other means.","In various embodiments as described herein, stiffness of the ear horn may be related to thickness in a cubic relationship. By way of example, two unconnected layers may be twice as stiff as a single layer, but if the layers are connected into a single layer, the combined layer that is twice as thick will have the stiffness increased by eight times. As a further example, three single layers are three times as stiff as a single layer, but three layers connected together will be twenty-seven times as stiff as the single layer.","In embodiments, one or more ear horns may comprise inner and outer portions whereby the inner portion is formed from the one portion of the ear horn and the outer portion is formed from another portion of the ear horn as shown in . The inner and outer portions may fork from the ear horn or otherwise be formed from the ear horn to form two separate portions where one portion is an outer portion and the other is an inner portion. In embodiments, the inner portion may be in contact with the user's head while the outer portion may be in contact with the inner portion. In embodiments, the inner and outer portions may interlock as shown in the embodiment described in . The inner and outer portions may comprise interlocking groves, teeth or other means by which they interlock or fasten together. The upper and\/or outer portion may comprise a tab or other protrusion by which the user may cause the inner and outer portions to no longer to be locked together. In embodiments, the portions may be curved to a user's head. Further, the inner surface may push outward against the outer surface. By interlocking the inner and outer portions, the thickness of the portions may be doubled. Accordingly, by increasing the thickness of the ear horn portion, the stiffness may be increased. In embodiments, by doubling the thickness of the ear horn, the stiffness may be increased eight times as compared to the single layer. Stripping the outer layer may return the ear horn portions to a flexible condition thereby allowing the ear horns to be folded flat. In embodiments, the ear horns may be attached by magnets, clips, hooks, or by other means to secure to the user's head.","Furthermore, in embodiments, one or more ear horns may comprise three portions as depicted in . In such an embodiment, the ear horn may comprise an inner and outer portion as described in reference to , however the embodiment may also include a middle portion  such that the ear horn is comprised of three portions as shown in . The ear horn may further comprise one or more buttons, straps, interlocking groves, teeth, pins or other means to lock together the ear horn portions. One or more of the portions may comprise a tab or other protrusion by which the user may cause the inner and outer portions to no longer to be locked together by causing the teeth or other moans of locking the portions together to release. In embodiments, three unconnected layers may be three times as stiff as a single layer, but when the three layers are locked\/connected together, the ear horn may be twenty-seven times as stiff as a single layer. When the three portions are unconnected or unlocked together, the ear horn may be flexible such that they may straighten and or fold flat. Further, while the portions are not locked together, the portions may slide over each other allowing them to be flexible and more easily stored when not in use and when the layers are locked or pinned together, they may not be able to slide over each other. The ear horn portions may reside in a sheath, tube or other structure comprising the ear horn such that the separate portions are not exposed. While ear horns of two and three portions have been described, one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that ear horns may be comprised of more than three portions, and\/or of varying thicknesses, in various embodiments.","In various embodiments as described herein, the wrapping ear horns may fold flat. When the ear horns are folded to a closed position, as when the user is not using the eyepiece, the ear horns may straighten out so that they fold flatter and the ability for the ear horn to wrap or contour to the user's head and\/or ear may not interfere with folding flat. In various embodiments as described herein, the ear horns may be folded and thereby straighten allowing the ear horn to become flat to allow the eyepiece to store in a flatter configuration. In various embodiments, the ear horns may straighten when released at the hinges or by other means thereby allowing the eyepiece to be folded flat. As described herein, in various embodiments, the ear horns may become less rigid allowing them to fold flat.","In embodiments, leveler pads may be used with one or more ear horns such that they may be able provide adjustment for ears that are in different vertical positions or to account for different positions of a user's ears or eyes. In embodiments, the pads may be placed on the ear horn at contact points of the user's ears to adjust the eyepiece to fit for different positions of the user's ears and\/or eyes. In embodiments, the leveler pads may be adjusted via a wedge slider or by various means. The leveler pads may be a portion of the ear horn or the leveler pads may attach to the ear horns via clips, adhesive, friction, or other means.","In various embodiments described herein, the eyepiece and ear horns may be fitted with closed cell foam on one or more areas that come in contact with the user. The foam may provide the user with comfort while also preventing moisture and sweat from permeating the foam. Further the closed cell foam may provide a non-porous surface to prevent the eyepiece from carrying bacteria, microbes and other organisms and to prevent growth of the same. In various embodiments as described herein, foam may be ant-microbial and or antibacterial and\/or treated with a substance for such purpose.","In an embodiment, the eyepiece may include security features, such as M-Shield Security, Secure content, DSM, Secure Runtime, IPsec, and the like. Other software features may include: User Interface, Apps, Framework, BSP, Codecs, Integration, Testing, System Validation, and the like.","In an embodiment, the eyepiece materials may be chosen to enable ruggedization.","In an embodiment, the eyepiece may be able to access a 3G access point that includes a 3G radio, an 802.11b connection and a Bluetooth connection to enable hopping data from a device to a 3G-enable embodiment of the eyepiece.","The present disclosure also relates to methods and apparatus for the capture of biometric data about individuals. The methods and apparatus provide wireless capture of fingerprints, iris patterns, facial structure and other unique biometric features of individuals and then send the data to a network or directly to the eyepiece. Data collected from an individual may also be compared with previously collected data and used to identify a particular individual.","In embodiments, the eyepiece  may be associated with mobile biometric devices, such as a biometric flashlight , a biometric phone , a biometric camera, a pocket biometric device , an arm strap biometric device , and the like, where the mobile biometrics device may act as a stand-alone device or in communications with the eyepiece, such as for control of the device, display of data from the device, storage of data, linking to an external system, linking to other eyepieces and\/or other mobile biometrics devices, and the like. The mobile biometrics device may enable a soldier or other non-military personnel to collect or utilize existing biometrics to profile an individual. The device may provide for tracking, monitoring, and collecting biometric records such as including video, voice, gait, face, iris biometrics and the like. The device may provide for geo-location tags for collected data, such as with time, date, location, data-taking personnel, the environment, and the like. The device may be able to capture and record fingerprints, palm prints, scars, marks, tattoos, audio, video, annotations, and the like, such as utilizing a thin film sensor, recording, collecting, identifying, and verifying face, fingerprint, iris, latent fingerprints, latent palm prints, voice, pocket litter, and other identifying visible marks and environmental data.

The camera may support dynamic range extension, adaptive defect pixel correction, advanced sharpness enhancement, geometric distortion correction, advanced color management, hardware-based face detection, video stabilization, and the like. In embodiments, the camera output may be transmitted to the eyepiece for presentation to the soldier. The device may accommodate a plurality of other sensors, such as described herein, including an accelerometer, compass, ambient light, proximity, barometric and temperature sensors, and the like, depending on requirements. The device may also have a mosaic print sensor, as described herein, producing high resolution images of the whorls and pores of an individual's fingerprint, multiple finger prints simultaneously, palm print, and the like. A soldier may utilize a mobile biometrics device to more easily collect personnel information, such as for document and media exploitation (DOMEX). For instance, during an interview, enrollment, interrogations, and the like, operators may photograph and read identifying data or \u2018pocket litter\u2019 (e.g. passport, ID cards, personal documents, cell phone directories, pictures), take biometric data, and the like, into a person of interest profile that may be entered into a searchable secure database. In embodiments, biometric data may be filed using the most salient image plus manual entry, enabling partial data capture. Data may be automatically geo-located, time\/date stamped, filed into a digital dossier, and the like, such as with a locally or network assigned global unique identifier (GUID). For instance, a face image may be captured at the scene of an IED bombing, the left iris image may be captured at a scene of a suicide bombing, latent fingerprints may be lifted from a sniper rifle, each taken from a different mobile biometrics device at different locations and times, and together identifying a person of interest from the multiple inputs, such as at a random vehicle inspection point.","A further embodiment of the eyepiece may be used to provide biometric data collection and result reporting. Biometric data may be visual biometric data, such as facial biometric data or iris biometric data, or may be audio biometric data.  depicts an embodiment providing biometric data capture. The assembly,  incorporates the eyepiece , discussed above in connection with . Eyepiece  provides an interactive head-mounted eyepiece that includes an optical assembly. Other eyepieces providing similar functionality may also be used. Eyepieces may also incorporate global positioning system capability to permit location information display and reporting.","The optical assembly allows a user to view the surrounding environment, including individuals in the vicinity of the wearer. An embodiment of the eyepiece allows a user to biometrically identify nearby individuals using facial images and iris images or both facial and iris images or audio samples. The eyepiece incorporates a corrective element that corrects a user's view of the surrounding environment and also displays content provided to the user through in integrated processor and image source. The integrated image source introduces the content to be displayed to the user to the optical assembly.","The eyepiece also includes an optical sensor for capturing biometric data. The integrated optical sensor, in an embodiment may incorporate a camera mounted on the eyepiece. This camera is used to capture biometric images of an individual near the user of the eyepiece. The user directs the optical sensor or the camera toward a nearby individual by positioning the eyepiece in the appropriate direction, which may be done just by looking at the individual. The user may select whether to capture one or more of a facial image, an iris image, or an audio sample.","The biometric data that may be captured by the eyepiece illustrated in  includes facial images for facial recognition, iris images for iris recognition, and audio samples for voice identification. The eyepiece  incorporates multiple microphones  in an end fire array disposed along both the right and left temples of the eyepiece. The microphone arrays  are specifically tuned to enable capture of human voices in an environment with a high level of ambient noise. The microphones may be directional, steerable, and covert. Microphones  provide selectable options for improved audio capture, including omni-directional operation, or directional beam operation. Directional beam operation allows a user to record audio samples from a specific individual by steering the microphone array in the direction of the subject individual. Adaptive microphone arrays may be created that will allow the operator to steer the directionality of the microphone array in three dimensions, where the directional beam may be adjusted in real time to maximize signal or minimize interfering noise for a non-stationary target. Array processing may allow summing of cardioid elements by analog or digital means, where there may be switching between omni and directional array operations. In embodiments, beam forming, array steering, adaptive array processing (speech source location), and the like, may be performed by the on-board processor. In an embodiment, the microphone may be capable of 10 dB directional recording.","Audio biometric capture is enhanced by incorporating phased array audio and video tracking for audio and video capture. Audio tracking allows for continuing to capture an audio sample when the target individual is moving in an environment with other noise sources. In embodiments, the user's voice may be subtracted from the audio track so as to enable a clearer rendition of the target individual, such as for distinguishing what is being said, to provide better location tracking, to provide better audio tracking, and the like.","To provide power for the display optics and biometric data collection the eyepiece  also incorporates a lithium-ion battery , that is capable of operating for over twelve hours on a single charge. In addition, the eyepiece  also incorporates a processor and solid-state memory  for processing the captured biometric data. The processor and memory are configurable to function with any software or algorithm used as part of a biometric capture protocol or format, such as the .wav format.","A further embodiment of the eyepiece assembly  provides an integrated communications facility that transmits the captured biometric data to a remote facility that stores the biometric data in a biometric data database. The biometric data database interprets the captured biometric data, interprets the data, and prepares content for display on the eyepiece.","In operation, a wearer of the eyepiece desiring to capture biometric data from a nearby observed individual positions himself or herself so that the individual appears in the field of view of the eyepiece. Once in position the user initiates capture of biometric information. Biometric information that may be captured includes iris images, facial images, and audio data.","In operation, a wearer of the eyepiece desiring to capture audio biometric data from a nearby observed individual positions himself or herself so that the individual appears is near the eyepiece, specifically, near the microphone arrays located in the eyepiece temples. Once in position the user initiates capture of audio biometric information. This audio biometric information consists of a recorded sample of the target individual speaking. Audio samples may be captured in conjunction with visual biometric data, such as iris and facial images.","To capture an iris image, the wearer\/user observes the desired individual and positions the eyepiece such that the optical sensor assembly or camera may collect an image of the biometric parameters of the desired individual. Once captured the eyepiece processor and solid-state memory prepare the captured image for transmission to the remote computing facility for further processing.","The remote computing facility receives the transmitted biometric image and compares the transmitted image to previously captured biometric data of the same type. Iris or facial images are compared with previously collected iris or facial images to determine if the individual has been previously encountered and identified.","Once the comparison has been made, the remote computing facility transmits a report of the comparison to the wearer\/user's eyepiece, for display. The report may indicate that the captured biometric image matches previously captured images. In such cases, the user receives a report including the identity of the individual, along with other identifying information or statistics. Not all captured biometric data allows for an unambiguous determination of identity. In such cases, the remote computing facility provides a report of findings and may request the user to collect additional biometric data, possibly of a different type, to aid in the identification and comparison process. Visual biometric data may be supplemented with audio biometric data as a further aid to identification.","Facial images are captured in a similar manner as iris images. The field of view is necessarily larger, due to the size of the images collected. This also permits to user to stand further off from the subject whose facial biometric data is being captured.","In operation the user may have originally captured a facial image of the individual. However, the facial image may be incomplete or inconclusive because the individual may be wearing clothing or other apparel, such as a hat, that obscures facial features. In such a case, the remote computing facility may request that a different type of biometric capture be used and additional images or data be transmitted. In the case described above, the user may be directed to obtain an iris image to supplement the captured facial image. In other instances, the additional requested data may be an audio sample of the individual's voice.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0862","num":"0864"},"figref":["FIG. 40","FIG. 40"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0863","num":"0865"},"figref":"FIG. 41"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0864","num":"0866"},"figref":["FIG. 42","FIG. 39","FIG. 43"]},"As shown in the top portion of , a single omnidirectional microphone may be used. The microphone may be placed at a given distance from the source of the sound and the sound pressure or digital audio input (DI)_at the microphone will be at a given dB level. Instead of a single microphone, multiple microphones or an array of microphones may be used. For example, 2 microphones may be placed twice as far away from the source, for a distance factor of 2, with a sound pressure increase of 6 dB. Alternatively, 4 microphones may be used, at a distance factor of 2.7, with an 8.8 dB increase in sound pressure. Arrays may also be used. For example, an 8-microphone array at a distance factor of 4 may have a DI increase of 12 dB while a 12-microphone array at a distance factor of 5 may have a DI increase of 13.2 dB. The graphs in  depict the points which produce the same signal level at the microphone from a given sound pressure level at that point. As shown in , a first order supercardioid microphone may be used at the same distance, in this example having a 6.2 dB increase, while a second order. The multiple microphones may be arranged in a composite microphone array. Instead of using one standard high quality microphone to capture an audio sample, the eyepiece temple pieces house multiple microphones of different character. For example, this may be provided when the user is generating a biometric fingerprint of someone's voice for future capture and comparison. One example of multiple microphone use uses microphones from cut off cell phones to reproduce the exact electrical and acoustic properties of the individual's voice. This sample is stored for future comparison in a database. If the individual's voice is later captured, the earlier sample is available for comparison, and will be reported to the eyepiece user, as the acoustic properties of the two samples will match.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0866","num":"0868"},"figref":"FIG. 44"},"In an embodiment, the integrated camera may continuously record a video file, and the integrated microphone may continuously record an audio file.

This disclosure also includes methods and systems for touchless or contactless fingerprinting using polarized light. In one embodiment, fingerprints may be taken by persons using a polarized light source and retrieving images of the fingerprints using reflected polarized light in two planes. In another embodiment, fingerprints may be taken by persons using a light source and retrieving images of the fingerprints using multispectral processing, e.g., using two imagers at two different locations with different inputs. The different inputs may be caused by using different filters or different sensors\/imagers. Applications of this technology may include biometric checks of unknown persons or subjects in which the safety of the persons doing the checking may be at issue.","In this method, an unknown person or subject may approach a checkpoint, for example, to be allowed further travel to his or her destination. As depicted in the system  shown in , the person P and an appropriate body part, such as a hand, a palm P, or other part, are illuminated by a source of polarized light . As is well known to those with skill in optical arts, the source of polarized light may simply be a lamp or other source of illumination with a polarizing filter to emit light that is polarized in one plane. The light travels to the person in an area which has been specified for non-contact fingerprinting, so that the polarized light impinges on the fingers or other body part of the person P. The incident polarized light is then reflected from the fingers or other body part and passes in all directions from the person. Two imagers or cameras  receive the reflected light after the light has passed through optical elements such as a lens  and a polarizing filter . The cameras or imagers may be mounted on the augmented reality glasses, as discussed above with respect to .","The light then passes from palm or finger or fingers of the person of interest to two different polarizing filters , and then to the imagers or cameras . Light which has passed through the polarizing filters may have a 90\u00b0 orientation difference (horizontal and vertical) or other orientation difference, such as 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0 or 120\u00b0. The cameras may be digital cameras with appropriate digital imaging sensors to convert the incident light into appropriate signals. The signals are then processed by appropriate processing circuitry , such as digital signal processors. The signals may then be combined in a conventional manner, such as by a digital microprocessor with memory . The digital processor with appropriate memory is programmed to produce data suitable for an image of a palm, fingerprint, or other image as desired. The digital data from the imagers may then be combined in this process, for example, using the techniques of U.S. Pat. No. 6,249,616 and others. As noted above in the present disclosure, the combined \u201cimage\u201d may then be checked against a database to determine an identity of the person. The augmented reality glasses may include such a database in the memory, or may refer the signals data elsewhere  for comparison and checking.","A process for taking contactless fingerprints, palm prints or other biometric prints is disclosed in the flowchart of . In one embodiment, a polarized light source is provided . In a second step , the person of interest and the selected body part is positioned for illumination by the light. In another embodiment, it may be possible to use incident white light rather than using a polarized light source. When the image is ready to be taken, light is reflected  from the person to two cameras or imagers. A polarizing filter is placed in front of each of the two cameras, so that the light received by the cameras is polarized  in two different planes, such as in a horizontal and vertical plane. Each camera then detects  the polarized light. The cameras or other sensors then convert the incidence of light into signals or data  suitable for preparation of images. Finally, the images are then combined  to form a very distinct, reliable print. The result is an image of very high quality that may be compared to digital databases to identify the person and to detect persons of interest.","It should be understood that while digital cameras are used in this contactless system, other imagers may be used, such as active pixel imagers, CMOS imagers, imagers that image in multiple wavelengths, CCD cameras, photo detector arrays, TFT imagers, and so forth. It should also be understood that while polarized light has been used to create two different images, other variations in the reflected light may also be used. For example, rather than using polarized light, white light may be used and then different filters applied to the imagers, such as a Bayer filter, a CYGM filter, or an RGBE filter. In other embodiments, it may be possible to dispense with a source of polarized light and instead use natural or white light rather than a source of polarized light.","The use of touchless or contactless fingerprinting has been under development for some time, as evidenced by earlier systems. For example, U.S. Pat. Appl. 2002\/0106115 used polarized light in a non-contact system, but required a metallic coating on the fingers of the person being fingerprinted. Later systems, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,651,594 and U.S. Pat. Appl. Publ. 2008\/0219522, required contact with a platen or other surface. The contactless system described herein does not require contact at the time of imaging, nor does it require prior contact, e.g., placing a coating or a reflective coating on the body part of interest. Of course, the positions of the imagers or cameras with respect to each other should be known for easier processing.","In use, the contactless fingerprint system may be employed at a checkpoint, such as a compound entrance, a building entrance, a roadside checkpoint or other convenient location. Such a location may be one where it is desirable to admit some persons and to refuse entrance or even detain other persons of interest. In practice, the system may make use of an external light source, such as a lamp, if polarized light is used. The cameras or other imagers used for the contactless imaging may be mounted on opposite sides of one set of augmented reality glasses (for one person). For example, a two-camera version is shown in , with two cameras  mounted on frame . In this embodiment, the software for at least processing the image may be contained within a memory of the augmented reality glasses. Alternatively, the digital data from the cameras\/imagers may be routed to a nearby datacenter for appropriate processing. This processing may include combining the digital data to form an image of the print. The processing may also include checking a database of known persons to determine whether the subject is of interest.","Another method of contactless fingerprinting utilizes quantum dot lasers to non-contact scan fingers and the hand to detect extremely low (parts per billion or even parts per trillion) concentrations of explosive compounds, as well as drug compounds. For example, the Quantum Dot or other kind of Laser, Laser Array may be mounted either in the back of the Bio-Phone or in the frame of the glasses so as to detect by very close proximity, but not touch, in order to prevent contamination from one subject to another. Thus, in addition to the capability of the glasses or other accessory devices to collect biometric data related to the iris, fingerprints, face and voice, an explosives or drugs contamination ID could also be collected.","Alternatively, one camera on each of two persons may be used, as seen in the camera  in . In this configuration, the two persons would be relatively near so that their respective images would be suitably similar for combining by the appropriate software. For example, the two cameras  in  may be mounted on two different pairs of augmented reality glasses, such as on two soldiers manning a checkpoint. Alternatively, the cameras may be mounted on a wall or on stationary parts of the checkpoint itself. The two images may then be combined by a remote processor with memory , such as a computer system at the building checkpoint.","As discussed above, persons using the augmented reality glasses may be in constant contact with each other through at least one of many wireless technologies, especially if they are both on duty at a checkpoint. Accordingly, the data from the single cameras or from the two-camera version may be sent to a data center or other command post for the appropriate processing, followed by checking the database for a match of the palm print, fingerprint, iris print, and so forth. The data center may be conveniently located near the checkpoint. With the availability of modern computers and storage, the cost of providing multiple datacenters and wirelessly updating the software will not be a major cost consideration in such systems.","The touchless or contactless biometric data gathering discussed above may be controlled in several ways, such as the control techniques discussed else in this disclosure. For example, in one embodiment, a user may initiate a data-gathering session by pressing a touch pad on the glasses, or by giving a voice command. In another embodiment, the user may initiate a session by a hand movement or gesture or using any of the control techniques described herein. Any of these techniques may bring up a menu, from which the user may select an option, such as \u201cbegin data gathering session,\u201d \u201cterminate data-gathering session,\u201d or \u201ccontinue session.\u201d If a data-gathering session is selected, the computer-controlled menu may then offer menu choices for number of cameras, which cameras, and so forth, much as a user selects a printer. There may also be modes, such as a polarized light mode, a color filter mode, and so forth. After each selection, the system may complete a task or offer another choice, as appropriate. User intervention may also be required, such as turning on a source of polarized light or other light source, applying filters or polarizers, and so forth.","After fingerprints, palm prints, iris images or other desired data has been acquired, the menu may then offer selections as to which database to use for comparison, which device(s) to use for storage, etc. The touchless or contactless biometric data gathering system may be controlled by any of the methods described herein.","While the system and sensors have obvious uses in identifying potential persons of interest, there are positive battlefield uses as well. The fingerprint sensor may be used to call up a soldier's medical history, giving information immediately on allergies, blood type, and other time sensitive and treatment determining data quickly and easily, thus allowing proper treatment to be provided under battlefield conditions. This is especially helpful for patients who may be unconscious when initially treated and who may be missing identification tags.","A further embodiment of a device for capturing biometric data from individuals may incorporate a server to store and process biometric data collected. The biometric data captured may include a hand image with multiple fingers, a palm print, a face camera image, an iris image, an audio sample of an individual's voice, and a video of the individual's gait or movement. The collected data must be accessible to be useful.","Processing of the biometric data may be done locally or remotely at a separate server. Local processing may offer the option to capture raw images and audio and make the information available on demand from a computer host over a WiFi or USB link. As an alternative, another local processing method processes the images and then transmits the processed data over the Internet. This local processing includes the steps of finding the finger prints, rating the finger prints, finding the face and then cropping it, finding and then rating the iris, and other similar steps for audio and video data. While processing the data locally requires more complex code, it does offer the advantage of reduced data transmission over the Internet.","A scanner associated with the biometric data collection devices may use code that is compliant with the USB Image Device protocol that is a commonly used scanner standard. Other embodiments may use different scanner standards, depending on need.","When a WiFi network is used to transfer the data, the Bio-Print device, which is further described herein, can function or appear like a web server to the network. Each of the various types of images may be available by selecting or clicking on a web page link or button from a browser client. This web server functionality may be part of the Bio-Print device, specifically, included in the microcomputer functionality.","A web server may be a part of the Bio-Print microcomputer host, allowing for the Bio-Print device to author a web page that exposes captured data and also provides some controls. An additional embodiment of the browser application could provide controls to capture high resolution hand prints, face images, iris images, set the camera resolution, set the capture time for audio samples, and also enable a streaming connection, using a web cam, Skype, or similar mechanism. This connection could be attached to the audio and face camera.","A further embodiment provides a browser application that gives access to images and audio captured via file transfer protocol (FTP) or other protocol. A still further embodiment of the browser application may provide for automatic refreshes at a selectable rate to repeatedly grab preview images.","An additional embodiment provides local processing of captured biometric data using a microcomputer and provides additional controls to display a rating of the captured image, allowing a user to rate each of the prints found, retrieve faces captured, and also to retrieve cropped iris images and allow a user to rate each of the iris prints.","Yet another embodiment provides a USB port compatible with the Open Multimedia Application Platform (OMAP3) system. OMAP3 is a proprietary system on a chip for portable multimedia applications. The OMAP3 device port is equipped with a Remote Network Driver Interface Specification (RNDIS), a proprietary protocol that may be used on top of USB. These systems provide the capability that when a Bio-Print device is plugged into a Windows PC USB host port, the device shows up as an IP interface. This IP interface would be the same as over WiFi (TCP\/IP web server). This allows for moving data off the microcomputer host and provides for display of the captured print.","An application on the microcomputer may implement the above by receiving data from an FPGA over the USB bus. Once received, JPEG content is created. This content may be written over a socket to a server running on a laptop, or be written to a file. Alternately, the server could receive the socket stream, pop the image, and leave it open in a window, thus creating a new window for each biometric capture. If the microcomputer runs Network File System (NFS), a protocol for use with Sun-based systems or SAMBA, a free software reimplementation that provides file and print services for Windows clients, the files captured may be shared and accessed by any client running NFS or System Management Bus (SMB), a PC communication bus implementation. In this embodiment, a JPEG viewer would display the files. The display client could include a laptop, augmented reality glasses, or a phone running the Android platform.","An additional embodiment provides for a server-side application offering the same services described above.","An alternative embodiment to a server-side application displays the results on the augmented reality glasses.","A further embodiment provides the microcomputer on a removable platform, similar to a mass storage device or streaming camera. The removable platform also incorporates an active USB serial port.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may include audio and\/or visual sensors to capture sounds and\/or visuals from 360 degrees around the wearer of an eyepiece. This may be from sensors mounted on the eyepiece itself, or coupled to sensors mounted on a vehicle that the wearer is in. For instance, sound sensors and\/or cameras may be mounted to the outside of a vehicle, where the sensors are communicatively coupled to the eyepiece to provide a surround sound and\/or sight \u2018view\u2019 of the surrounding environment. In addition, the sound system of the eyepiece may provide sound protection, canceling, augmentation, and the like, to help improve the hearing quality of the wearer while they are surrounded by extraneous or loud noise. In an example, a wearer may be coupled to cameras mounted on the vehicle they are driving. These cameras may then be in communication with the eyepiece, and provide a 360-degree view around the vehicle, such as provided in a projected graphical image through the eyepiece display to the wearer.","In an example, and referring to , control aspects of the eyepiece may include a remote device in the form of a watch controller , such as including a receiver and\/or transmitter for interfacing with the eyepiece for messaging and\/or controlling the eyepiece when the user is not wearing the eyepiece. The watch controller may include a camera, a fingerprint scanner, discrete control buttons, 2D control pad, an LCD screen, a capacitive touch screen for multi-touch control, a shake motor\/piezo bumper to give tactile feedback, buttons with tactile feel, Bluetooth, camera, fingerprint scanner, accelerometer, and the like, such as provided in a control function area  or on other functional portions  of the watch controller . For instance, a watch controller may have a standard watch display , but additionally have functionality to control the eyepiece, such as through control functions  in the control function area . The watch controller may display and\/or otherwise notify the user (e.g. vibration, audible sounds) of messages from the eyepiece, such an email, advertisements, calendar alerts, and the like, and show the content of the message that comes in from the eyepiece that the user is currently not wearing. A shake motor, piezo bumper, and the like, may provide tactile feedback to the touch screen control interface. The watch receiver may be able to provide virtual buttons and clicks in the control function area  user interface, buzz and bump the user's wrist, and the like, when a message is received. Communications connectivity between the eyepiece and the watch receiver may be provided through Bluetooth, WiFi, Cell network, or any other communications interface known to the art. The watch controller may utilize an embedded camera for videoconferencing (such as described herein), iris scanning (e.g. for recording an image of the iris for storage in a database, for use in authentication in conjunction with an existing iris image in storage, and the like), picture taking, video, and the like. The watch controller may have a fingerprint scanner, such as described herein. The watch controller, or any other tactile interface described herein, may measure a user's pulse, such as through a pulse sensor  (which may be located in the band, on the underside of the main body of the watch, and the like. In embodiments, the eyepiece and other control\/tactile interface components may have pulse detection such that the pulse from different control interface components are monitored in a synchronized way, such as for health, activity monitoring, authorization, and the like. For example, a watch controller and the eyepiece may both have pulse monitoring, where the eyepiece is capable of sensing whether the two are in synchronization, if both match a previously measured profile (such as for authentication), and the like. Similarly, other biometrics may be used for authentication between multiple control interfaces and the eyepiece, such as with fingerprints, iris scans, pulse, health profile, and the like, where the eyepiece knows whether the same person is wearing the interface component (e.g. the watch controller) and the eyepiece. Biometric\/health of a person may be determined by looking at IR LED view of the skin, for looking at subsurface pulse, and the like. In embodiments, multi-device authentication (e.g. token for Bluetooth handshake) may be used, such as using the sensors on both devices (e.g. fingerprint on both devices as a hash for the Bluetooth token), and the like.","In an embodiment, the watch controller may have a touch screen that may be useful for controlling the glasses even if they are not mounted on a user's face, such as if they are in a backpack. The transparent lens of the watch may have an OLED display with switchable mirrors affixed to the underside of the lens. In other embodiments, the watch controller lens may include an electric mirror or E-Ink display. In any event, the lens may cover a standard analog watch mechanism and the transparent lens including either the switchable mirrors or electric mirrors or e-ink display may be activated to display content. The watch may be used for gesture control with an integrated sensor that detects gestures. The watch may be used as an AR marker, such that when a camera of the glasses recognizes the watch, an app may be launched. One such app may be using the watch as a physical surface with an overlaid virtual image that effectively makes the watch a touch screen interface.","Referring to , the eyepiece may be stored in an eyepiece carrying case, such as including a recharge capability, an integrated display, and the like.  depicts an embodiment of a case, shown closed, with integrated recharge AC plug and digital display, and  shows the same embodiment case open.  shows another embodiment case closed, and  shows the same embodiment open, where a digital display is shown through the cover. In embodiments, the case may have the ability to recharge the eyepiece while in the case, such as through an AC connection or battery (e.g. a rechargeable lithium-ion battery built into the carrying case for charging the eyepiece while away from AC power). Electrical power may be transferred to the eyepiece through a wired or wireless connection, such as though a wireless induction pad configuration between the case and the eyepiece. In embodiments, the case may include a digital display in communications with the eyepiece, such as through Bluetooth wireless, and the like. The display may provide information about the state of the eyepiece, such as messages received, battery level indication, notifications, and the like.","Referring to , the eyepiece  may be used in conjunction with an unattended ground sensor unit , such as formed as a stake  that can be inserted in the ground  by personnel, fired from a remote control helicopter, dropped by plane, and the like. The ground sensor unit  may include a camera , a controller , a sensor , and the like. Sensors  may include a magnetic sensor, sound sensor, vibration sensor, thermal sensor, passive IR sensor, motion detector, GPS, real-time clock, and the like, and provide monitoring at the location of the ground sensor unit . The camera  may have a field of view  in both azimuth and elevation, such as a full or partial 360-degree camera array in azimuth and +\/\u221290 degrees in elevation. The ground sensor unit  may capture a sensor and image data of an event(s) and transmit it over a wireless network connection to an eyepiece . Further, the eyepiece may then transmit the data to an external communications facility , such as a cell network, a satellite network, a WiFi network, to another eyepiece, and the like. In embodiments, ground sensor units  may relay data from unit to unit, such as from A to B to C. Further, the data may then be relayed from eyepiece A to eyepiece B and on to the communications facility , such as in a backhaul data network. Data collected from a ground sensor unit , or array of ground sensor units, may be shared with a plurality of eyepieces, such as from eyepiece to eyepiece, from the communications facility to the eyepiece, and the like, such that users of the eyepiece may utilize and share the data, either in its raw form or in a post-processed form (i.e. as a graphic display of the data through the eyepiece). In embodiments, the ground sensor units may be inexpensive, disposable, toy-grade, and the like. In embodiments, the ground sensor unit  may provide backup for computer files from the eyepiece .","Referring to , the eyepiece may provide control through facilities internal and external to the eyepiece, such as initiated from the surrounding environment , input devices , sensing devices , user action capture devices , internal processing facilities , internal multimedia processing facilities, internal applications , camera , sensors , earpiece , projector , through a transceiver , through a tactile interface , from external computing facilities , external applications , event and\/or data feeds , external devices , third parties , and the like. Command and control modes  of the eyepiece may be initiated by sensing inputs through input devices , user action , external device interaction , reception of events and\/or data feeds , internal application execution , external application execution , and the like. In embodiments, there may be a series of steps included in the execution control, including at least combinations of two of the following: events and\/or data feeds, sensing inputs and\/or sensing devices, user action capture inputs and\/or outputs, user movements and\/or actions for controlling and\/or initiating commands, command and\/or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs may be reflected, applications on the platform that may use commands to respond to inputs, communications and\/or connection from the on-platform interface to external systems and\/or devices, external devices, external applications, feedback  to the user (such as related to external devices, external applications), and the like.","In embodiments, events and\/or data feeds may include email, military related communications, calendar alerts, security events, safety events, financial events, personal events, a request for input, instruction, entering an activity state, entering a military engagement activity state, entering a type of environment, entering a hostile environment, entering a location, and the like, and combinations of the same.","In embodiments, sensing inputs and\/or

operations applications, communications, information processing, fingerprint capture, facial recognition, iris capture, entertainment, easy access to information for pilots, locating objects in 3D in

feedback to the wearer related to external devices and applications may include visual display, heads-up display, bulls-eye or target tracking display, tonal output or sound warning, performance or rating indicator, score, mission accomplished indication, action complete indication, play of content, display of information, reports, data mining, recommendations, targeted advertisements, and the like.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of a head nod from a soldier as movement to initiate a silent command (such as during a combat engagement), through a graphical user interface for reflecting modes and\/or interfaces in which the control input is reflected, a military application on the eyepiece that uses the commands and\/or responds to the control input, an audio system controller to communicate and\/or connect from the eyepiece interface to an external system or device, and the like. For instance, the soldier may be controlling a secure communications device through the eyepiece during a combat engagement, and wish to change some aspect of communications, such as a channel, a frequency, an encoding level, and the like, without making a sound and with minimal motion so as to minimize the chance of being heard or seen. In this instance, a nod of the soldier's head may be programmed to indicate the change, such as a quick nod forward to indicate the beginning of a transmission, a quick nod backward to indicate the end of a transmission, and the like. In addition, the eyepiece may be projecting a graphical user interface to the soldier for the secure communications device, such as showing what channel is active, what alternative channels are available, others in their team that are currently transmitting, and the like. The nod of the soldier may then be interpreted by processing facilities of the eyepiece as a change command, the command transmitted to the audio system controller, and the graphical user interface for the communications device showing the change. Further, certain nods\/body motions may be interpreted as specific commands to be transmitted such that the eyepiece sends a pre-established communication without the soldier needing to be audible. That is, the soldier may be able to send pre-canned communications to their team though body motions (for example, as determined together with the team prior to the engagement). In this way, a soldier wearing and utilizing the facilities of the eyepiece may be able to connect and interface with the external secure communications device in a completely stealthy manner, maintaining silent communications with their team during engagement, even when out of sight with the team. In embodiments, other movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands, command and\/or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected, applications on platform that can use commands and\/or respond to inputs, communication or connection from the on-platform interface to external systems and devices, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of motion and position sensors as sensing inputs, an augmented reality interface as a command and control interface in which the inputs can be reflected to a soldier, a motion sensor and range finder for a weapon system as external devices to be controlled and information collected from, feedback to the soldier related to the external devices, and the like. For instance, a soldier wearing the eyepiece may be monitoring military movements within an environment with the motion sensor, and when the motion sensor is triggered an augmented reality interface may be projected to the wearer that helps identify a target, such as a person, vehicle, and the like for further monitoring and\/or targeting. In addition, the range finder may be able to determine the range to the object and feedback that information to the soldier for use in targeting (such as manually, with the soldier executing a firing action; or automatically, with the weapon system receiving the information for targeting and the soldier providing a command to fire). In embodiments, the augmented reality interface may provide information to the soldier about the target, such as the location of the object on a 2D or 3D projected map, identity of the target from previously collected information (e.g. as stored in an object database, including face recognition, object recognition), coordinates of the target, night vision imaging of the target, and the like. In embodiments, the triggering of the motion detector may be interpreted by processing facilities of the eyepiece as a warning event, the command may be transmitted to the range finder to determine the location of the object, as well as to the speakers of the ear phones of the eyepiece to provide an audio warning to the soldier that a moving object has been sensed in the area being monitored. The audio warning plus visual indicators to the soldier may serve as inputs to the soldier that attention should be paid to the moving object, such as if the object has been identified as an object of interest to the soldier, such as through an accessed database for known combatants, known vehicle types, and the like. For instance, the soldier may be at a guard post monitoring the perimeter around the post at night. In this case, the environment may be dark, and the soldier may have fallen into a low attentive state, as it may be late at night, with all environmental conditions quiet. The eyepiece may then act as a sentry augmentation device, \u2018watching\u2019 from the soldier's personal perspective (as opposed to some external monitoring facility for the guard post). When the eyepiece senses movement, the soldier may be instantly alerted as well as guided to the location, range, identity, and the like, of the motion. In this way, the soldier may be able to react to avoid personal danger, to target fire to the located movement, and the like, as well as alert the post to potential danger. Further, if a firefight were to ensue, the soldier may have improved reaction time as a result of the warning from the eyepiece, with better decision making though information about the target, and minimizing the danger of being injured or the guard post from being infiltrated. In embodiments, other sensing inputs and\/or sensing devices, command and\/or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected, useful external devices to be controlled, feedback related to external devices and\/or external applications, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may enable remote control of vehicles, such as a truck, robot, drone, helicopter, watercraft, and the like. For instance, a soldier wearing the eyepiece may be able to command through an internal communications interface for control of the vehicle. Vehicle control may be provided through voice commands, body movement (e.g. a soldier instrumented with movement sensors that are in interactive communication with the eyepiece, and interfaced through the eyepiece to control the vehicle), keyboard interface, and the like. In an example, a soldier wearing an eyepiece may provide remote control to a bomb disposal robot or vehicle, where commands are generated by the soldier though a command interface of the eyepiece, such as described herein. In another example, a soldier may command an aircraft, such as a remote control drone, remote control tactical counter-rotating helicopter, and the like. Again, the soldier may provide control of the remote control aircraft through control interfaces as described herein.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of a wearable sensor set as an action capture input for a soldier, utilizing a robot control interface as a command and control interface in which the inputs can be reflected, a drone or other robotic device as an external device to be controlled, and the like. For instance, the soldier wearing the eyepiece may be instrumented with a sensor set for the control of a military drone, such as with motion sensor inputs to control motion of the drone, hand recognition control for manipulation of control features of the drone (e.g. such as through a graphical user interface displayed through the eyepiece), voice command inputs for control of the drone, and the like. In embodiments, control of the drone through the eyepiece may include control of flight, control of on-board interrogation sensors (e.g. visible camera, IR camera, radar), threat avoidance, and the like. The soldier may be able to guide the drone to its intended target using body mounted sensors and picturing the actual battlefield through a virtual 2D\/3D projected image, where flight, camera, monitoring controls are commanded though body motions of the soldier. In this way, the soldier may be able to maintain an individualistic, full visual immersion, of the flight and environment of the drone for greater intuitive control. The eyepiece may have a robot control interface for managing and reconciling the various control inputs from the soldier-worn sensor set, and for providing an interface for control of the drone. The drone may then be controlled remotely through physical action of the soldier, such as through a wireless connection to a military control center for drone control and management. In another similar example, a soldier may control a bomb-disarming robot that may be controlled through a soldier-worn sensor set and associated eyepiece robot control interface. For instance, the soldier may be provided with a graphical user interface that provides a 2D or 3D view of the environment around the bomb disarming robot, and where the sensor pack provides translation of the motion of the soldier (e.g. arms, hands, and the like) to motions of the robot. In this way, the soldier may be able to provide a remote control interface to the robot to better enable sensitive control during the delicate bomb disarming process. In embodiments, other user action capture inputs and\/or devices, command and\/or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected, useful external devices to be controlled, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of an event indication to the soldier as they enter a location, a predictive-learning based user interface as a command and control mode and\/or interface in which the input occurrence of the event is reflected, a weapons control system as an external device to be controlled, and the like. For instance, an eyepiece may be programmed to learn the behavior of a soldier, such as what the soldier typically does when they enter a particular environment with a particular weapons control system, e.g. does the wearer turn on the system, arm the system, bring up visual displays for the system, and the like. From this learned behavior, the eyepiece may be able to make a prediction of what the soldier wants in the way of an eyepiece control function. For example, the soldier may be thrust into a combat situation, and needs the immediate use of a weapons control system. In this case, the eyepiece may sense the location and\/or the identity of the weapons system as the soldier approaches, and configure\/enable the weapons system to how the soldier typically configures the system when they are near the weapons control system, such as in previous uses of the weapons system where the eyepiece was in a learning mode, and commanding the weapons control system to turn on the system as last configured. In embodiments, the eyepiece may sense the location and\/or identity of the weapons system through a plurality of methods and systems, such as through a vision system recognizing the location, an RFID system, a GPS system, and the like. In embodiments, the commanding of the weapons control system may be through a graphical user interface that provides the soldier with a visual for fire-control of the weapon system, an audio-voice command system interface that provides choices to the soldier and voice recognition for commanding, pre-determined automatic activation of a function, and the like. In embodiments, there may be a profile associated with such learned commanding, where the soldier is able to modify the learned profile and\/or set preferences within the learned profile to help optimize automated actions, and the like. For example, the soldier may have separate weapon control profiles for weapons readiness (i.e. while on post and awaiting action) and for active weapons engagement with the enemy. The soldier may need to modify a profile to adjust to changing conditions associated with use of the weapon system, such as a change in fire command protocols, ammunition type, added capabilities of the weapon system, and the like. In embodiments, other events and\/or data feeds, command and\/or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected, useful external devices to be controlled, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of an individual responsibility event for a soldier (such as deployed in a theater of action, and managing their time) as an event and\/or data feed, a voice recognition system as a user action capture input device, an auditory command interface as a command and control interface in which the inputs can be reflected, video-based communications as an application on the eyepiece that is used to respond to the input from the soldier, and the like. For instance, a soldier wearing the eyepiece may get a visual indication projected to them of a scheduled event for a group video supported communication between commanders. The soldier may then use a voice command to an auditory command interface on the eyepiece to bring up the contact information for the call, and voice command the group video communication to be initiated. In this way, the eyepiece may serve as a personal assistant for the soldier, bringing up scheduled events and providing the soldier with a hands-free command interface to execute the scheduled events. In addition, the eyepiece may provide for the visual interface for the group video communication, where the images of the other commanders are projected to the soldier through the eyepiece, and where an external camera is providing the soldier's video image through communicative connection to the eyepiece (such as with an external device with a camera, using a mirror with the internally integrated camera, and the like, as described herein). In this way, the eyepiece may provide a fully integrated personal assistant and phone\/video-based communications platform, subsuming the functions of other traditionally separate electronics devices, such as the radio, mobile phone, a video-phone, a personal computer, a calendar, a hands-free command and control interface, and the like. In embodiments, other events and\/or data feeds, user action capture inputs and\/or devices, command and\/or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected, applications on platform that can use commands and\/or respond to inputs, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of a security event to a soldier as an event and\/or data feed; a camera and touch screen as user action capture input devices; an information processing, fingerprint capture, facial recognition application on the eyepiece to respond to the inputs; a graphical user interface for communications and\/or connection between the eyepiece and external systems and devices; and an external information processing, fingerprint capture, facial recognition application and database for access to external security facilities and connectivity, and the like. For instance, a soldier may receive a \u2018security event\u2019 while on post at a military checkpoint where a plurality of individuals is to be security checked and\/or identified. In this case there may be a need for recording the biometrics of the individuals, such as because they don't show up in a security database, because of suspicious behavior, because they fit the profile of a member of a combatant, and the like. The soldier may then use biometric input devices, such as a camera for photographing faces and a touch screen for recording fingerprints, where the biometric inputs are managed though an internal information, processing, fingerprint capture, and facial recognition application on the eyepiece. In addition, the eyepiece may provide a graphical user interface as a communications connection to an external information, processing, fingerprint capture, and facial recognition application, where the graphical user interface provides data capture interfaces, external database access, people of interest database, and the like. The eyepiece may provide for an end-to-end security management facility, including monitoring for people of interest, input devices for taking biometric data, displaying inputs and database information, connectivity to external security and database applications, and the like. For instance, the soldier may be checking people through a military checkpoint, and the soldier has been commanded to collect facial images, such as with iris biometrics, for anyone that meets a profile and is not currently in a security database. As individuals approach the soldier, as in a line to pass through the checkpoint, the soldier's eyepiece takes high-resolution images of each individual for facial and\/or iris recognition, such as checked though a database accessible through a network communication link. A person may be allowed to pass the checkpoint if they do not meet the profile (e.g. a young child), or is in the database with an indication that they are not considered a threat. A person may not be allowed to pass through the checkpoint, and is pulled aside, if the individual is indicated to be a threat or meets the profile and is not in the database. If they need to be entered into the security database, the soldier may be able to process the individual directly through facilities of the eyepiece or with the eyepiece controlling an external device, such as for collecting personal information for the individual, taking a close-up image of the individual's face and\/or iris, recording fingerprints, and the like, such as described herein. In embodiments, other events and\/or data feeds, user action capture inputs and\/or devices, applications on platform that can use commands and\/or respond to inputs, communication or connection from the on-platform interface to external systems and devices, applications for external devices, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of a finger movement as a user action for a soldier initiating an eyepiece command, a clickable icon as a command and control mode and\/or interface in which the user action can be reflected, an application on the eyepiece (e.g. weapons control, troop movements, intelligence data feed, and the like), a military application tracking API as a communication and\/or connection from the eyepiece application to an external system, an external personnel tracking application, feedback to military personnel, and the like. For instance, a system for monitoring a soldier's selection of an on-eyepiece application may be implemented through an API such that the monitoring provides a service to the military for monitoring and tracking application usage, feedback to the soldier as to other applications available to them based on the monitored behavior, and the like. In the course of a day, the soldier may select an application for use and\/or download, such as through a graphical user interface where clickable icons are presented, and to which the soldier may be able to select the icon based on a finger movement control implementation facility (such as a camera or inertial system through which the soldier's finger action is used as a control input, in this case to select the clickable icon). The selection may then be monitored through the military application tracking API that sends the selection, or stored number of selections (such as transmitting stored selections over a period of time), to the external personnel tracking application. The soldier's application selections, in this case \u2018virtual clicks\u2019, may then be analyzed for the purpose of optimizing usage, such as through increasing bandwidth, change of available applications, improvement to existing applications, and the like. Further, the external personnel tracking application may utilize the analysis to determine what the wearer's preferences are in terms of applications use, and send the wearer feedback in the form of recommendations of applications the wearer may be interested in, a preference profile, a list of what other similar military users are utilizing, and the like. In embodiments, the eyepiece may provide services to improve the soldier's experience with the eyepiece, such as with recommendations for usage that the soldier may benefit from, and the like, while aiding in guiding the military use of the eyepiece and applications thereof. For instance, a soldier that is new to using the eyepiece may not fully utilize its capabilities, such as in use of augmented reality interfaces, organizational applications, mission support, and the like. The eyepiece may have the capability to monitor the soldier's utilization, compare the utilization to utilization metrics (such as stored in an external eyepiece utilization facility), and provide feedback to the soldier in order to improve use and associated efficiency of the eyepiece, and the like. In embodiments, other user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands, command and\/or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected, applications on platform that can use commands and\/or respond to inputs, communication or connection from the on-platform interface to external systems and devices, applications for external devices, feedback related to external devices and\/or external applications, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of IR, thermal, force, carbon monoxide, and the like sensors as inputs; microphone as an additional input device; voice commands as an action by a soldier to initiate commands; a heads-up display as a command and control interface in which the inputs can be reflected; an instructional guidance application to provide guidance while reducing the need for the soldier to use their hands, such as in emergency repair in the field, maintenance, assembly, and the like; a visual display that provides feedback to the soldier based on the actions of the soldier and the sensor inputs; and the like. For instance, a soldier's vehicle may have been damaged in a firefight, leaving the soldier(s) stranded without immediate transport capabilities. The soldier may be able to bring up an instructional guidance application, as running through the eyepiece, to provide hands-free instruction and computer-based expert knowledge access to diagnosing the problem with the vehicle. In addition, the application may provide a tutorial for procedures not familiar to the soldier, such as restoring basic and temporary functionality of the vehicle. The eyepiece may also be monitoring various sensor inputs relevant to the diagnosis, such as an IR, thermal, force, ozone, carbon monoxide, and the like sensors, so that the sensor input may be accessible to the instructional application and\/or directly accessible to the soldier. The application may also provide for a microphone through which voice commands may be accepted; a heads-up display for the display of instruction information, 2D or 3D depiction of the portion of the vehicle under repair; and the like. In embodiments, the eyepiece may be able to provide a hands-free virtual assistant to the soldier to assist them in the diagnosis and repair of the vehicle in order to re-establish a means for transport, allowing the soldier to re-engage the enemy or move to safety. In embodiments, other sensing inputs and\/or sensing devices, user action capture inputs and\/or devices, user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands, command and\/or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected, applications on platform that can use commands and\/or respond to inputs, feedback related to external devices and\/or external applications, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of the eyepiece entering an \u2018activity state\u2019, such as a \u2018military engagement\u2019 activity mode, e.g. the soldier commanding the eyepiece into a military engagement mode, or the eyepiece sensing it is in proximity to a military activity, perhaps even a predetermined or targeted engagement area through a received mission directive, which may have further been developed in part through self-monitoring and learning the wearer's general engagement assignment. Continuing with this example, entering an activity state e.g. a military engagement activity state, such as while driving in a vehicle into an encounter with the enemy or into hostile territory, may be combined with an object detector as a sensing input or sensing device, a head-mounted camera and\/or eye-gaze detection system as a user action capture input, eye movement as a user movement or action for controlling or initiating commands, a 3D navigation interface as a command and control mode and\/or interface in which the inputs can be reflected, an engagement management application on-board the eyepiece as an application for coordinating command inputs and user interface, a navigation system controller to communicate or connect with external systems or devices, a vehicle navigation system as an external device to be controlled and\/or interfaced with, a military planning and execution facility as an external application for processing user actions with regard to a military directive, bulls-eye or target tracking system as feedback to the wearer as to enemy targeting opportunities within sight while driving, and the like. For instance, a soldier may enter a hostile environment while driving their vehicle, and the eyepiece, detecting the presence of the enemy engagement area (e.g. through GPS, direct viewing targets through an integrated camera, and the like) may enter a \u2018military engagement activity state\u2019 (such as enabled and\/or approved by the soldier). The eyepiece may then detect an enemy vehicle, hostile dwelling, and the like with an object detector that locates an enemy targeting opportunity, such as through a head-mounted camera. Further, an eye-gaze detection system on the eyepiece may monitor where the soldier is looking, and possibly highlight information about a target at the location of the wearer's gaze, such as enemy personnel, enemy vehicle, enemy weapons, as well as friendly forces, where friend and foe are identified and differentiated. The soldier's eye movement may also be tracked, such as for changing targets of interest, or for command inputs (e.g. a quick nod indicating a selection command, a downward eye movement indicating a command for additional information, and the like). The eyepiece may invoke a 3D navigation interface projection to assist in providing the soldier with information associated with their surroundings, and a military engagement application for coordinating the military engagement activity state, such as taking inputs from the soldier, providing outputs to the 3D navigation interface, interfacing with external devices and applications, and the like. The eyepiece may for instance utilize a navigation system controller to interface with a vehicle navigation system, and thus may include the vehicle navigation system into the military engagement experience. Alternately, the eyepiece may use its own navigation system, such as in place of the vehicle system or to augment it, such as when the soldier gets out of the vehicle and wishes to have over-the-ground directions provided to them. As part of the military engagement activity state, the eyepiece may interface with an external military planning and execution facility, such as to provide current status, troop movements, weather conditions, friendly forces position and strength, and the like. In embodiments, the soldier, through entering an activity state, may be provided feedback associated with the activity state, such as for a military engagement activity state being supplied feedback in the form of information associated with an identified target. In embodiments, other events and\/or data feeds, sensing inputs and\/or sensing devices, user action capture inputs and\/or devices, user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands, command and\/or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected, applications on platform that can use commands and\/or respond to inputs, communication or connection from the on-platform interface to external systems and devices, applications for external devices, feedback related to external devices and\/or external applications, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of a secure communications reception as a triggering event to a soldier, inertial movement tracking as a user action capture input device, drag-and-drop with fingers and swipe movements by the soldier as user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands, navigable lists as a command and control interface in which the inputs can be reflected, information conveying as a type of application on the eyepiece that can use commands and respond to inputs, a reconciliation system as a communication or connection from the on-eyepiece interface to external systems and devices, iris capture and recognition system as an external application for external systems and devices, and the like. A soldier wearing the eyepiece may receive a secure communication, and the communication may come in to the eyepiece as an \u2018event\u2019 to the soldier, such as to trigger an operations mode of the eyepiece, with a visual and\/or audible alert, to initiate an application or action on the eyepiece, and the like. The soldier may be able to react to the event through a plurality of control mechanisms, such as the wearer \u2018drag and dropping\u2019, swiping, and the like with their fingers and hands through a hand gesture interface (e.g. through a camera and hand gesture application on-board the eyepiece, where the wearer drags the email or information within the communication into a file, an application, another communication, and the like). The wearer may call up navigable lists as part of acting on the communication. The user may convey the information from the secure communication through an eyepiece application to external systems and devices, such as a reconciliation system for tracking communications and related actions. In embodiments, the eyepiece and\/or secure access system may require identification verification, such as through biometric identity verification e.g. fingerprint capture, iris capture recognition, and the like. For instance, the soldier may receive a secure communication that is a security alert, where the secure communication comes with secure links to further information, and where the soldier is required to provide biometric authentication before being provided access. Once authenticated, the soldier may be able to use hand gestures in their response and manipulation of content available through the eyepiece, such as manipulating lists, links, data, images, and the like available directly from the communications and\/or through the included links Providing the capability for the soldier to respond and manipulate content in association with the secure communication, may better allow the soldier to interact with the message and content in a manner that does not compromise any non-secure environment they may currently be in. In embodiments, other events and\/or data feeds, user action capture inputs and\/or devices, user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands, command and\/or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected, applications on platform that can use commands and\/or respond to inputs, communication or connection from the on-platform interface to external systems and devices, applications for external devices, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using an inertial user interface as a user action capture input device to provide military instruction to a soldier through the eyepiece to an external display device. For instance, a soldier, wearing the eyepiece, may wish to provide instruction to a group of other soldiers in the field from a briefing that has been made available to them through the facilities of the eyepiece. The soldier may be aided though the use of a physical 3D or 2D mouse (e.g. with inertial motion sensor, MEMS inertial sensor, ultrasonic 3D motion sensor, IR, ultrasonic, or capacitive tactile sensor, accelerometer, and the like), a virtual mouse, a virtual touch screen, a virtual keyboard, and the like to provide an interface for manipulating content in the briefing. The briefing may be viewable to and manipulated though the eyepiece, but also exported in real-time, such as to an external router that is connected to an external display device (e.g. computer monitor, projector, video screen, TV screen, and the like). As such, the eyepiece may provide a way for the soldier to have others view what they see through the eyepiece and as controlled through the control facilities of the eyepiece, allowing the soldier to export multimedia content associated with the briefing as enabled through the eyepiece to other non-eyepiece wearers. In an example, a mission briefing may be provided to a commander in the field, and the commander, through the eyepiece, may be able to brief their team with multimedia and augmented reality resources available through the eyepiece, as described herein, thus gaining the benefit that such visual resources provide. In embodiments, other sensing inputs and\/or sensing devices, user action capture inputs and\/or devices, command and\/or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected, communication or connection from the on-platform interface to external systems and devices, useful external devices to be controlled, feedback related to external devices and\/or external applications, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of a head nod as a user movement to initiating a command, a graphical user interface for reflecting modes and\/or interfaces in which the control input is reflected, an entertainment application on the eyepiece that uses the commands and\/or responds to the control input, an audio system controller to communicate and\/or connect from the eyepiece interface to an external system or device, and the like. For instance, the wearer of the eyepiece may be controlling an audio player through the eyepiece, and wish to change to the next track. A nod of the wearer's head may be programmed in this instance to indicate a change in track. In addition, the eyepiece may be projecting a graphical user interface for the audio player to the wearer, such as showing what track is playing. The nod of the wearer may then be interpreted by processing facilities of the eyepiece as a change track command, the command may then be transmitted to the audio system controller for changing the track, and the graphical user interface for the audio player may then show a change of track to the wearer.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of a motion sensor as a sensing input, an augmented reality interface as a command and control interface in which the inputs can be reflected to the wearer, a range finder as an external device to be controlled and information collected from, and the like. For instance, the wearer of the eyepiece may be monitoring movements within an environment with a motion sensor, and when the motion sensor is triggered an augmented reality interface may be projected to the wearer that helps identify the object. In addition, other sensors may aid in the identification, such as a range finder to determine the range to the object. The augmented reality interface may provide information to the wearer about the object, such as the location of the object on a 2D or 3D projected map, identity of the object from previously collected information (e.g. as stored in an object database, including face recognition, object recognition), coordinates of the object, night vision imaging of the object, and the like. The triggering of the motion detector may be interpreted by processing facilities of the eyepiece as a warning event, the command may then be transmitted to the range finder to determine the location of the object, as well as to the speakers of the ear phones of the eyepiece to provide an audio warning to the wearer that a moving object has been sensed. The audio warning plus visual indicators to the wearer may serve as inputs to the wearer that attention should be paid to the moving object, such as if the object has been identified as an object of interest to the wearer.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of a wearable sensor set as a user action capture input, a robot control interface as a command and control interface in which the inputs can be reflected, a drone or other robotic device as an external device to be controlled, and the like. For instance, the wearer of the eyepiece may be instrumented up with a sensor set for the control of a drone, such as motion sensor inputs to control motion of the drown, hand recognition control for manipulation of control features of the drone (e.g. such as through a graphical user interface displayed through the eyepiece), voice command inputs for control of the drone, and the like. The eyepiece may have a robot control interface for managing and reconciling the various control inputs from the sensor set, and for providing an interface for control of the drone. The drone may then be controlled remotely through action of the wearer, such as through a wireless connection to a control center for drone control and management, to the drone more directly, and the like. In another similar example, a robot (e.g. a bomb disarming robot) may be controlled through the sensor set and eyepiece robot control interface. For instance, the wearer may be provided with a graphical user interface that provides a 2D or 3D view of the environment around the robot, and where the sensor pack provides translation of the motion of the wearer (e.g. arms, hands, and the like) to motions of the robot. In this way, the wearer may be able to provide a remote control interface to the robot.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of entering a location as an event to the eyepiece, a predictive-learning based user interface as a command and control mode and\/or interface in which the input occurrence of the event is reflected, an entertainment system as an external device to be controlled, and the like. For instance, an eyepiece may be programmed to learn the behavior of the wearer, such as what the wearer typically does when they enter a room with an entertainment system, e.g. does the wearer turn on the television, the sound system, a game system, and the like. From this learned behavior, the eyepiece may be able to make a prediction of what the wearer wants in the way of an eyepiece control function. For example, walking into the living room, the eyepiece sensing the location and that the wearer typically turns on music through the entertainment system when they enter the room, and commanding the entertainment system to turn on the music that was last playing. In embodiments, the eyepiece may sense the location through a plurality of methods and systems, such as through a vision system recognizing the location, an RFID system, a GPS system, and the like. The commanding of the entertainment system may be through a graphical user interface that provides the wearer with choices, an audio-voice command system interface that provides choices to the wearer and voice recognition for commanding, an automatic activation of the command, and the like. There may be a profile associated with such learned commanding, where the wearer is able to modify the learned profile and\/or set preferences within the learned profile to help optimize automated actions and the like.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of a personal event as an event and\/or data feed, a voice recognition system as a user action capture input device, an auditory command interface as a command and control interface in which the inputs can be reflected, videoconferencing as an application on the eyepiece that is used to respond to the input from the wearer, and the like. For instance, a wearer may get a visual indication projected to them of a calendar event for a conference call. The user may then use a voice command to an auditory command interface on the eyepiece to bring up the dial-in information for the call, and voice command the videoconference to be initiated. In this way, the eyepiece may serve as a personal assistant, bringing up calendar events and providing the wearer with a hands-free command interface to execute the calendar events. In addition, the eyepiece may provide for the visual interface for the videoconference, where the image of others are projected to the wearer through the eyepiece, and where an external camera is providing the wearer's video image through communicative connection to the eyepiece. The eyepiece may provide a fully integrated personal assistant and phone\/videoconferencing platform, subsuming the functions of other traditionally separate electronics devices, such as the mobile phone, the PDA, a calendar, a hands-free command and control interface, and the like.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of a security event as an event and\/or data feed; a camera and touch screen as user action capture input devices; an information processing, fingerprint capture, facial recognition application on the eyepiece to respond to the inputs; a graphical user interface for communications and\/or connection between the eyepiece and external systems and devices; and an external information processing, fingerprint capture, facial recognition application and database for access to external security facilities and connectivity, and the like. For instance, a security official may be dealing with a \u2018security event\u2019, which might be some checkpoint with many individuals to be security checked and\/or identified, an individual that needs to be checked and\/or identified, and the like, where there is a need identified for recording the biometrics of an individual (e.g. because they don't show up in a security database, because of suspicious behavior, and the like). The security official may then use biometric input devices, such as a camera for photographing faces and a touch screen for recording fingerprints, where the biometric inputs are managed though an internal information, processing, fingerprint capture, and facial recognition application on the eyepiece. In addition, the eyepiece may provide a graphical user interface as a communications connection to an external information, processing, fingerprint capture, and facial recognition application, where the graphical user interface provides data capture interfaces, external database access, people of interest database, and the like. The eyepiece may provide for an end-to-end security management facility, including monitoring for people of interest, input devices for taking biometric data, displaying inputs and database information, connectivity to external security and database applications, and the like.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of a finger movement as a user action for initiating a command, a clickable ion as a command and control mode and\/or interface in which the user action can be reflected, an application on the eyepiece (e.g. phone application, music search, ads selection, and the like), an advertisement tracking API as a communication and\/or connection from the eyepiece application to an external system, an external advertisement application, feedback to the user, and the like. For instance, a system for monitoring user selection of on-eyepiece applications may be implemented through an API such that the monitoring provides a service to an advertisement placement facility, feedback to the wearer as to other applications the wearer may be interested in based on the monitored behavior, and the like. In the course of a day, the wearer may select an application for use and\/or download, such as through a graphical user interface where clickable icons are presented, and to which the wearer may be able to select the icon based on a finger movement control implementation facility (such as a camera or inertial system through which the wearer's finger action is used as a control input, in this case to select the clickable icon). The selection may then be monitored through the advertisement tracking API that sends the selection, or stored number of selections (such as transmitting stored selections over a period of time), to the external advertisement application. The wearer's application selections, in this case \u2018virtual clicks\u2019, may then be analyzed for the purpose of generating advertisement revenue, such as through advertisement placement back to the wearer, selling of the data to a third party advertisement facility, and the like. Further, the external advertisement application may utilize the analysis to determine what the wearer's preferences are in terms of applications use, and send the wearer feedback in the form of recommendations of applications the wearer may be interested in, a preference profile, a list of what other similar users are interested in downloading, and the like. In embodiments, the eyepiece may provide services to improve the wearer's experience with the eyepiece, such as with recommendations for downloads that the wearer may be interested in, with better targeted advertisements that the wearer may be interested in, and the like, while aiding in the generation of advertisement revenue for third-parties through an external advertisement application.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of body movement (e.g. kinetic sensor sensing head motion, cameras sensing hand motion, kinetic sensor sensing body motion) and touch sensors or audio as user action capture sensing devices (e.g. sensing a gaming device such as a steering wheel, a sword, and the like; sensing another player in the game; and the like), head and hand movement as user actions for controlling and\/or initiating commands (e.g. through gesture control), a virtual reality interface as a command and control interface through which the inputs can be reflected, an information display as an application on the eyepiece that can respond to the inputs, a computer gaming device as an external device to be controlled through a gaming application, and the play of the gaming content to the wearer and performance, rating, score, and the like, as feedback to the user related to the external device and application. For instance, a wearer may be able to play an interactive computer game (e.g. on a computer, a computer-based gaming platform, a mobile gaming platform) in conjunction with the eyepiece, where the wearer's body movements are interpreted as control inputs, such as though body movement sensors, touch sensors, infrared sensors, IR camera, visible camera, and the like. In this way, movements of the wearer's body may be fed into the computer game, rather than using more traditional control inputs such as a handheld game controller. For example, the eyepiece may sense the motion of user's hands and the like through IR and\/or visible cameras on the eyepiece and processed through on-board or external gesture recognition algorithms, the eyepiece may sense the motion of the user's head through motion sensors on the eyepiece (e.g. for sensing the user jumping, moving forward and back, side to side in response to the game), and the like. In an embodiment, the gestures may be captured by a downward facing camera, or a camera that is imaging downwards such as through the use of fold optics. In other embodiments, the camera may capture non-line of sight gestures for recognition. For example, a foviated or segmented camera can do motion tracking and room mapping when looking forward but has a quadrant or hemisphere looking down to capture gestures and user interface control commands with the users' hands at their side or in their lap that are non-parallel to the center axis of the display. Of course, hand gestures may be tracked as described herein, such as by using IMU sensors in a device (such as ring controller, a watch, a pistol grip, etc.), magnetic markers, RF tags, and the like. These body motion control inputs may then feed into a virtual reality interface and information display application on the eyepiece to provide the user with a visual depiction of the game environment, feed into a computer game platform to control the gaming platform from the user's motions, provided to both the virtual reality interface and information display of the eyepiece and the gaming platform to create an augmented reality game platform though the eyepiece, and the like. In embodiments, a control device or interactive control element used to sense body movement or otherwise show user interaction, may be removed from the computer image by a processor associated with the eyepiece. In cases where the sensor is not desired to be part of the game, all or part of the image of the control device may be removed from the image produced for gameplay. For example where the sensor is simply used to detect hand\/limb movement, the sensor may be removed from the image generation, however, where the sensor or control device is an object related to game play, such as a sword, the object may be depicted as such in the game play or AR environment. In embodiments, the control device may be desired to be viewed in a location other than where it is in reality. For example, a target at which a user throws darts may be displayed at the end of a hall in front of a user instead of being displayed associated with the darts that the user is throwing. By further example, if the user never releases the dart in actual game play, the dart, as a control device, may be shown as traveling to the target based on the characteristics of the user's throw. In embodiments, the computer game may be run entirely on-board the eyepiece as a local gaming application, interfaced to an external game facility local to the wearer, interfaced to a networked gaming facility (e.g. a massively multiplayer online game, MMOG), a combination of on the eyepiece and through a gaming platform, and the like. In the case where the eyepiece is interfacing and controlling a local external game facility (e.g. a game platform in the wearer's home), the eyepiece application portion of game execution may provide the visual environment and information display to the wearer, and the external game facility may provide the game application execution. Alternately, the eyepiece may provide the user movement sensing interface and provide that information to the gaming platform, where the gaming platform then provides the visual interface of the game to the user. Alternately, the eyepiece may provide the user movement sensing interface where this information is used by both the eyepiece and the gaming platform to create an augmented reality gaming interface that combines the visual interface and the gaming platform in the gaming presentation to the user. In embodiments, AR applications may augment an advertisement or the like on the side of a building or other structure with objects passing by in the foreground. As the user drives by, the camera may notice that an object (such as a light pole on the edge of a street) is moving through the field of view faster than the augmented surface in the background. The display system may subtract part of the augmented image to preserve the virtual layering of content behind the image. This may require tight calibration of the parallax between the user's eyes, the displays and the camera. In embodiments, this technique may be used to produce a depth map. It would be clear to one skilled in the art that many different partitioning configurations between the processing provided by the eyepiece and processing provide by external facilities may be implemented. Further, the game implementation may extend to external gaming facilities across the Internet, such as with an MMOG. External facilities, whether local or across the Internet, may then provide feedback to the wearer, such as in providing at least a portion of the played content (e.g. the locally provided game projection combined with content from the external facilities and other players), performance indications, scores, rankings, and the like. In embodiments, the eyepiece may provide a user environment for computer games, where the eyepiece interfaces with external control inputs and external processing facilities, to create the next generation of gaming platform.","As an alternative to the eyepiece detecting body movement through sensors in direct physical connection to the wearer (e.g. kinetic sensors, body movement sensors, touch sensors), the eyepiece may incorporate an active remote sensing system for indirect sensing and interpreting of body movements of the wearer, such as though the use of a 3D active depth sensor utilizing projected IR, sonar, RF, energy and the like, to sense the position of the wearers hands, feet, and the like. The active 3D depth sensor may also be used in combination with a visible or IR camera on the eyepiece. The combination of camera and 3D depth sensor may provide 3D motion capture that is processed on the eyepiece to provide advanced gesture recognition. The 3D active depth sensor may include a source (e.g. IR laser projector) and receiving sensor (e.g. IR sensor). In embodiments, the camera and 3D active depth sensor may point downward, sideways, outward, with respect to the eyepiece line-of-sight in order to improve the system's visibility of the user's hands, feet, and the like. In embodiments, there may be a plurality of cameras on the eyepiece, such as one or more for imaging as described herein (e.g. one facing forward, one detecting eye motion, one facing backwards), one or more for sensing motion of the wearer for command and control of eyepiece functions, applications, external devices, and the like. In an example, the combination of depth sensor and camera may point downward to capture images and motions of the wearer's hands, where the eyepiece processor uses the inputs from the depth sensor and camera to track the hand movements (e.g. translation and rotation of a hand, motion of individual digits of the hand), computes the motion of the hand using a motion algorithm, and controls eyepiece functionality based on the detected motions and an on-board data base of functional commands as a function of detected motions. In embodiments, interpreted hand motions may be used for control of eyepiece functions, eyepiece application, control of external facilities through the eyepiece, input to an external gaming platform, input to an internal virtual reality game, and the like. In embodiments, the camera, 3D active depth sensor, and associated algorithms may be combined with the on-board microphone or array of microphones to detect both the sounds and the motions of the surrounding environment.","The present disclosure may comprise an interactive head-mounted eyepiece worn by a user, wherein the eyepiece includes an optical assembly that simultaneously provides the user with a view of a surrounding environment along a forward-looking line-of-sight and of displayed content introduced to the optical assembly from an integrated image source, and provides an integrated camera with a view of a surrounding environment along a downward-looking line-of-sight for user gesture recognition through an integrated gesture recognition facility. In embodiments, the gesture recognition facility may identify a motion that the eyepiece interprets as a command to the eyepiece. The motion may be a hand motion, an arm motion, a finger motion, a foot motion, a leg motion, and the like. The integrated camera may be able to view the forward-looking line-of-sight surrounding environment as well as the downward-looking line-of-sight for gesture recognition. The integrated camera may have a segmented optical element for simultaneously imaging the forward-looking line of sight and the downward-looking line-of-sight views. Further, the eyepiece may have an active sensing system for indirect sensing and interpreting of body movements of the user, where the active sensing system provides an active signal through the optical assembly along the downward-looking line-of-sight view. The active signal may be an IR, sonar, RF, and the like active signal. The active sensing system may include a 3D active depth sensor to sense the position of at least one of the user's hands, feet, body, and the like. The active sensing system may be used in conjunction with the integrated camera to further provide for user gesture recognition.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may include a dual mode for marker location and tracking. A GPS for general marker location near a POI may be created, and then another second marker may be created. The second marker may be generated through a sensor reading, image processing, image recognition, user feedback, and the like. This second marker may be used for tracking in between taking GPS readings. In embodiments, the second marker may be used to provide a distance to or from a point of interest. The dual marker system may provide the user with the distance, time and directions between two points. The point may be a point of interest for travel, transportation, business, commerce, and the like. The dual mode for marker location and tracking may allow the user to locate an item to purchase, an item to visit, a travel destination, a mode of transportation, and the like. Transportation items may include a user's automobile, a train, airport, taxi stand, taxi, subway, and the like. Items of commerce may include various items such as but not limited to, food, entertainment, shopping, clothes, books, services, and the like. In embodiments, the item to locate may be a tourist attraction, restaurant, park, street, and the like. There may be an ecosystem of markers, ranging from QR codes to a wide range of communication devices (routers and switches) or passive sensors (RFID tags that can be pinged), all of which might want to relay some relevant information to the glasses, whether a precise location that permits the back end network to figure out what content to deliver, or some content itself that is specific to the location of the marker. A single party could use two markers to help orient or triangulate the glasses, providing exact orientation and distance information that might be more difficult to get with some single markers (especially ones that are not visual themselves). In embodiments, two markers may be processed. The eyepiece may be able to recognize two markers in proximity\/field of view, and to act on them, either simultaneously (e.g., for triangulation) or to assign one of them priority (e.g, a paid marker might take precedence over a non-paid marker in an advertising scenario; a safety-oriented marker might take precedence over an advertising marker, etc.). Markers may come from the glasses, but can also be placed by, for example, other glasses, or other systems (e.g., those of advertisers, government parties, etc., etc.)","In embodiments, a system may comprise an interactive head-mounted eyepiece worn by a user wherein the eyepiece wherein the eyepiece includes an optical assembly through which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content, an integrated image source for introducing the content to the optical assembly, and an integrated processor that generates a marker for a point of interest based on a GPS reading and stores the marker in a memory of the eyepiece, wherein the integrated processor creates a second marker in relation to the GPS point and stores the second marker in the memory. In embodiments, the second marker may be generated through a least one of a sensor reading, image processing, image recognition, user feedback on a current location, and the like. The second marker may be used to calculate at least one of the distance, directions, and time to a point of interest. In embodiments, a point of interest may be at least one of a tourist attraction, restaurant, park, a street, and the like. In embodiments, the GPS point may be used with the second marker to provide at least one of the distance, directions, time to an item of commerce, and the like. In embodiments, the GPS point may be used with the second marker to provide at least one of the distance, directions, the time to a mode of transportation, the tracking of a mode of transportation, and the like. In such embodiments, the mode of transportation may include at least one of a train, subway, automobile, and the like. In embodiments of the system, the GPS point may be used with the second marker to provide tracking of a point of interest. In embodiments, the GPS point may be used with the second marker to provide tracking of an item of commerce. In embodiments, user feedback may be verbal input to the eyepiece. The second marker may be generated through various means. By way of example, the second marker may be based on processing of a still and or video image captured by the eyepiece to obtain location information for the subject of the image. In embodiments, the second marker may be based on data obtained from an internet search, scanning a QR code, bar code, an object, and the like.","In various embodiments, the eyepiece may comprise an earpiece to provide for augmented hearing where the user is able to hear his surrounding environment, but also additional audio. Such audio may include game content, sports commentary, and the like. In embodiments, microphones and or ear bud may play audio binaurally or otherwise. In embodiments, a bone conduction earpiece may be used with the eyepiece. Such earpieces may allow the user to have audio waves transmitted to the inner ear through the skull bones, thereby, by-passing the user's eardrum. In embodiments, the earpiece may be used with cheekbones just in front of the user's ears, and or other bones capable of transmitting audio. Accordingly a user may be enabled to monitor or listen to audio while being cognizant if his or her surroundings. In embodiments, the earpiece may also employ sounds lasers, whereby through the use of a laser, the earpiece emits sound waves. In embodiments, the earpiece may also employ a device that allows for a user to experience heightened volume and\/or clarity of an external sound or of a sound generated by the earpiece. In various embodiments, the earpiece of the eyepiece may play, and or transmit audio from, radio, audio obtained wirelessly, audio via the internet, and the like. In embodiments, the eyepiece may also transmit satellite radio audio to the user.","In various embodiments, the eyepiece may comprise RF shielding for the brain and or other parts of the user's body. In embodiments, any portion of the eyepiece that transmits an electromagnet field may be shielded with barriers made of conductive or magnetic material or otherwise. In embodiments, the shield may comprise sheet metal, metal screen, metal foam, foam, and the like. Holes in the shield or mesh may be significantly smaller than the wavelength of the radiation that's being blocked or other radiation. In embodiments, the inside or other portion of the eyepiece and\/or eyepiece enclosure may be coated with a metallic ink or other material to provide shielding. Such metals may be copper, nickel and the like in the form of very small particulates. Such metal may be sprayed on the enclosure. In further embodiments, such an RF shield may be worn by the user to prevent various frequencies from reaching his or her brain, eyes, or other parts of the body.","In embodiments, an interactive head-mounted eyepiece worn by a user may include an optical assembly though which the user views a surrounding environment and displayed content, and integrated image source for introducing the content toe the optical assembly, a radio element, and shielding wherein the radio element may radiate electromagnetic radiation and the shielding blocks the radiation from radiating out of the eyepiece form a portion of the eyepiece.

In embodiments, the shielding may be positioned in at least one of an arm of the eyepiece, in a forehead section of the eyepiece, and the like. In embodiments, the shielding may be positioned at least in a forehead section of the eyepiece and in an arm of the eyepiece. In embodiments the shielding may be worn by a user.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of IR, thermal, force, ozone, Carbon Monoxide, and the like sensors as inputs; microphone as an additional input device; voice commands as an action by the wearer to initiate commands; a heads-up display as a command and control interface in which the inputs can be reflected; an instructional guidance application to provide guidance while reducing the need for using their hands, such as in maintenance and assembly; a visual display that provides feedback to the wearer based on the actions of the wearer and the sensor inputs; and the like. For instance, a car mechanic may be the wearer of the eyepiece, where the mechanic is using the eyepiece to aid in the maintenance of a vehicle. An instructional guidance application, as running through the eyepiece, may provide hands-free instruction and computer-based expert knowledge access to the mechanic while diagnosing a problem on a vehicle. In addition, the application may provide a tutorial for procedures not familiar to the mechanic. The eyepiece may also be monitoring various sensor inputs relevant to the diagnosis and safety, such as an IR, thermal, force, ozone, Carbon Monoxide, and the like sensors, so that the sensor input may be accessible to the instructional application and\/or directly accessible to the mechanic. The application may also provide for a microphone through which voice commands may be accepted; a heads-up display for the display of instruction information, 2D or 3D depiction of the portion of the vehicle under repair; feedback on time and cost of the repair; and the like. In embodiments, the eyepiece may be able to provide a hands-free virtual assistant to the mechanic to assist them in the diagnosis and repair of the vehicle.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of the eyepiece entering an \u2018activity state\u2019, such as a \u2018shopping\u2019 activity mode, e.g. the user commanding the eyepiece into a store shopping mode, or the eyepiece sensing it is in proximity to a shopping area, perhaps even a shopping area of interest to the wearer through a preference profile, which may have further been developed in part through self-monitoring and learning the wearer's shopping preferences. Continuing with this example, entering an activity state e.g. a shopping activity state, such as while driving in a car, may be combined with an object detector as a sensing input or sensing device, a head-mounted camera and\/or eye-gaze detection system as a user action capture input, eye movement as a user movement or action for controlling or initiating commands, a 3D navigation interface as a command and control mode and\/or interface in which the inputs can be reflected, an e-commerce application on-board the eyepiece as an application for coordinating command inputs and user interface, a navigation system controller to communicate or connect with external systems or devices, a vehicle navigation system as an external device to be controlled and\/or interfaced with, an advertising facility as an external application for processing user actions with regard to an advertising database, bulls-eye or target tracking system as feedback to the wearer as to shopping opportunities within sight while driving, and the like. For instance, a wearer may enter a shopping district while driving their car, and the eyepiece, detecting the presence of the shopping district (e.g. through GPS, direct viewing targets through an integrated camera, and the like) may enter a \u2018shopping activity state\u2019 (such as enabled and\/or approved by the wearer). The eyepiece may then detect a billboard, storefront, and the like with an object detector that locates a shopping opportunity, such as through a head-mounted camera. Further, an eye-gaze detection system on the eyepiece may monitor where the wearer is looking, and possibly highlight information about a target at the location of the wearer's gaze, such as sale items or specials currently available in a store. Eye movement of the wearer may also be tracked, such as for changing targets of interest, or for command inputs (e.g. a quick nod indicating a selection command, a downward eye movement indicating a command for additional information, and the like). For example, an iris or a retina of a user may be tracked to provide a control input. The eyepiece may invoke a 3D navigation interface projection to assist in providing the wearer information associated with their surroundings, and an e-commerce application for coordinating the shopping activity state, such as taking inputs from the wearer, providing outputs to the 3D navigation interface, interfacing with external devices and applications, and the like. The eyepiece may for instance utilize a navigation system controller to interface with a vehicle navigation system, and thus may include the vehicle navigation system into the shopping experience. Alternately, the eyepiece may use its own navigation system, such as in place of the vehicle system or to augment it, such as when the wearer gets out of the car and wishes to have walking directions provided to them. As part of the shopping activity state, the eyepiece may interface with an external advertising facility, such as to provide current deals, specials, pop-up ads for surrounding merchants, and the like. The external advertising facility may also be in connection with third-party advertisers, publishers, merchant support facilities, and the like, that may contribute to information provided to the wearer. In embodiments, the wearer, through entering an activity state, may be provided feedback associated with the activity state, such as for a shopping activity state being supplied feedback in the form of information associated with an identified target.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of email reception as a triggering event, inertial movement tracking as a user action capture input device, drag-and-drop with fingers and swipe movements as user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands, navigable lists as a command and control interface in which the inputs can be reflected, information conveying as a type of application on the eyepiece that can use commands and respond to inputs, a payment system as a communication or connection from the on-eyepiece interface to external systems and devices, iris capture and recognition system as an external application for external systems and devices, and the like. For instance, a wearer may receive a bill via an email, and the email may come in to the eyepiece as an \u2018event\u2019 to the wearer, such as to trigger an operations mode of the eyepiece, with a visual and\/or audible alert, to initiate an application on the eyepiece, and the like. The wearer may be able to react to the email event through a plurality of control mechanisms, such as the wearer \u2018drag and dropping\u2019, swiping, and the like with their fingers and hands through a hand gesture interface (e.g. through a camera and hand gesture application on-board the eyepiece, where the wearer drags the email or information within the email into a file, an application, another email, and the like). The wearer may call up navigable lists of bills to pay and the like. The user may convey the information from the email (e.g. billing information, account number, billed amount, and the like) through an eyepiece application to external systems and devices, such as a payment system for paying the bill. In embodiments, the eyepiece and\/or payment system may require identification verification, such as through biometric identity verification e.g. fingerprint capture, iris capture recognition, and the like.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using an inertial user interface as a user action capture input device to provide instruction through the eyepiece to an external display device. For instance, the wearer may wish to provide instruction to a group of individuals from a presentation available through the facilities of the eyepiece. The wearer may be aided though the use of a physical 3D or 2D mouse (e.g. with inertial motion sensor, MEMS inertial sensor, ultrasonic 3D motion sensor, accelerometer, and the like), a virtual mouse, a virtual touch screen, a virtual keyboard, and the like to provide an interface for manipulating content in the presentation. The presentation may be viewable to and manipulated though the eyepiece, but also exported in real-time, such as to an external router that is connected to an external display device (e.g. computer monitor, projector, video screen, TV screen, and the like). As such, the eyepiece may provide a way for the wearer to have others view what the wearer sees through the eyepiece and as controlled through the control facilities of the eyepiece, allowing the wearer to export the multimedia event enabled through the eyepiece to other non-eyepiece wearers.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using an events\/data feed and sensing inputs\/sensing devices, such as where a security event plus an acoustic sensor may be implemented. There may be a security alert sent to a soldier and an acoustic sensor is utilized as an input device to monitor voice content in the surrounding environment, directionality of gunfire, and the like. For instance, a security alert is broadcast to all military personnel in a specific area, and with the warning, the eyepiece activates an application that monitors an embedded acoustic sensor array that analyzes loud sounds to identify the type of source for the sound, and direction from which the sound came. In embodiments, other events and\/or data feeds, sensing inputs and\/or sensing devices, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using an events\/data feed and user action capture inputs\/devices, such as for a request for an input plus use of a camera. A soldier may be in a location of interest and is sent a request for photos or video from their location, such as where the request is accompanied with instructions for what to photograph. For instance, the soldier is at a checkpoint, and at some central command post it is determined that an individual on interest may attempt to cross the checkpoint. Central command may then provide instructions to eyepiece users in proximity to the checkpoint to record and upload images and video, which may in embodiments be performed automatically without the soldier needing to manually turn on the camera. In embodiments, other events and\/or data feeds, user action capture inputs and\/or devices, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using an events\/data feed and user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands, such as when a soldier is entering an \u2018activity state\u2019 and they use a hand gesture for control. A soldier may be put in an activity state of readiness to engage the enemy, and the soldier uses hand gestures to silently command the eyepiece within an engagement command and control environment. For instance, the soldier may suddenly enter an enemy area as determined by new intelligence received that places the eyepiece in a heightened alert state. In this state it may be a requirement that silence may be required, and so the eyepiece transitions to a hand gesture command mode. In embodiments, other events and\/or data feeds, user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using an events\/data feed and command\/control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected, such as entering a type of environment and the user of a virtual touch screen. A soldier may enter a weapons system area, and a virtual touch screen is made available to the wearer for at least a portion of the control of the weapons system. For instance, the soldier enters a weapons vehicle, and the eyepiece detecting the presence of the weapons system, and that the soldier is authorized to use the weapon, brings up a virtual fire control interface with virtual touch screen. In embodiments, other events and\/or data feeds, command and\/or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using an events\/data feed and applications on platform that can use commands\/respond to inputs, such as for a safety event in combination with easy access to information for pilots. A military pilot (or someone responsible for the flight checkout of a pilotless aircraft) may receive a safety event notification as they approach an aircraft prior to the aircraft taking off, and an application is brought up to walk them through the pre-flight checkout. For instance, a drone specialist approaches a drone to prepare it for launch, and an interactive checkout procedure is displayed to the soldier by the eyepiece. In addition, a communications channel may be opened to the pilot of the drone so they are included in the pre-flight checkout. In embodiments, other events and\/or data feeds, applications on platform that can use commands and\/or respond to inputs, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using an events\/data feed and a communication or connection from the on-platform interface to external systems and devices, such as the soldier entering a location and a graphical user interface (GUI). A soldier may enter a location where they are required to interact with external devices, and where the external device is interfaced through the GIU. For instance, a soldier gets in a military transport, and the soldier is presented with a GUI that opens up an interactive interface that instructs the soldier on what they need to do during different phases of the transport. In embodiments, other events and\/or data feeds, communication or connection from the on-platform interface to external systems and devices, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using an events\/data feed and a useful external device to be controlled, such as for an instruction provided and a weapon system. A soldier may be provided instructions, or a feed of instructions, where at least one instruction pertains to the control of an external weapons system. For instance, a soldier may be operating a piece of artillery, and the eyepiece is providing them not only performance and procedural information in association with the weapon, but also provides a feed of instructions, corrections, and the like, associated with targeting. In embodiments, other events and\/or data feeds, useful external devices to be controlled, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using an events\/data feed and an application for a useful external device, such as in a security event\/feed and biometrics capture\/recognition. A soldier may be sent a security event notification through (such as through a security feed) to capture biometrics (fingerprints, iris scan, walking gait profile) of certain individuals, where the biometrics are stored, evaluated, analyzed, and the like, through an external biometrics application (such as served from a secure military network-based server\/cloud). In embodiments, other events and\/or data feeds, applications for external devices, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using an events\/data feed and feedback to a soldier related to the external devices and applications, such as entering an activity state and the soldier being provided a display of information. A soldier may place the eyepiece into an activity state such as for military staging, readiness, action, debrief, and the like, and as feedback to being placed into the activity state the soldier receives a display of information pertaining to the entered state. For instance, a soldier enters into a staging state for a mission, where the eyepiece fetches information from a remote server as part of the tasks the soldier has to complete during staging, including securing equipment, additional training, and the like. In embodiments, other events and\/or data feeds, feedback related to external devices and\/or external applications, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using sensing inputs\/sensing devices and user action capture inputs\/devices, such as with an inertial motion sensor and head tracking system. The head motion of a soldier may be tracked through inertial motion sensor(s) in the eyepiece, such as for nod control of the eyepiece, view direction sensing for the eyepiece, and the like. For instance, the soldier may be a targeting a weapon system, and the eyepiece senses the gaze direction of the soldier's head through the inertial motion sensor(s) to provide continuous targeting of the weapon. Further, the weapon system may move continuously in response to the soldier's gaze direction, and so be continuously ready to fire on the target. In embodiments, other sensing inputs and\/or sensing devices, user action capture inputs and\/or devices, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using sensing inputs\/sensing devices and user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands, such as with an optical sensor and an eye shut, blink, and the like movement. The state of the soldier's eye may be sensed by an optical sensor that is included in the optical chain of the eyepiece, such as for using eye movement for control of the eyepiece. For instance, the soldier may be aiming their rifle, where the rifle has the capability to be fired through control commands from the eyepiece (such as in the case of a sniper, where commanding through the eyepiece may decrease the errors in targeting due to pulling the trigger manually). The soldier may then fire the weapon through a command initiated by the optical sensor detecting a predetermined eye movement, such as in a command profile kept on the eyepiece. In embodiments, other sensing inputs and\/or sensing devices, user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using sensing inputs\/sensing devices and command\/control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected, such as with a proximity sensor and robotic control interface. A proximity sensor integrated into the eyepiece may be used to sense the soldier's proximity to a robotic control interface in order to activate and enable the use of the robotics. For instance, a soldier walks up to a bomb-detecting robot, and the robot automatically activates and initializes configuration for this particular soldier (e.g. configuring for the preferences of the soldier). In embodiments, other sensing inputs and\/or sensing devices, command and\/or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using sensing inputs\/sensing devices and applications on platform that can use commands\/respond to inputs, such as with an audio sensor and music\/sound application. An audio sensor may monitor the ambient sound and initiate and\/or adjust the volume for music, ambient sound, sound cancelling, and the like, to help counter an undesirable ambient sound. For instance, a soldier is loaded onto a transport and the engines of the transport are initially off. At this time the soldier may have no other duties except to rest, so they initiate music to help them rest. When the engines of the transport come on the music\/sound application adjusts the volume and\/or initiates additional sound cancelling audio in order to help keep the music input the same as before the engines started up. In embodiments, other sensing inputs and\/or sensing devices, applications on platform that can use commands and\/or respond to inputs, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using sensing inputs\/sensing devices and communication or connection from the on-platform interface to external systems and devices, such as with a passive IR proximity sensor and external digital signal processor. A soldier may be monitoring a night scene with the passive IR proximity sensor, the sensor indicates a motion, and the eyepiece initiates a connection to an external digital signal processor for aiding in identifying the target from the proximity sensor data. Further, an IR imaging camera may be initiated to contribute additional data to the digital signal processor. In embodiments, other sensing inputs and\/or sensing devices, communication or connection from the on-platform interface to external systems and devices, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using sensing inputs\/sensing devices and useful external devices to be controlled, such as with an acoustic sensor and a weapons system, where an eyepiece being worn by a soldier senses a loud sound, such as may be an explosion or gun fire, and where the eyepiece then initiates the control of a weapons system for possible action against a target associated with the creation of the loud sound. For instance, a soldier is on guard duty, and gunfire is heard. The eyepiece may be able to detect the direction of the gunshot, and direct the soldier to the position from which the gunshot was made. In embodiments, other sensing inputs and\/or sensing devices, useful external devices to be controlled, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using sensing inputs\/sensing devices and applications for those useful external devices, such as with a camera and external application for instructions. The camera embedded in a soldier's eyepiece may view a target icon indicating that instructions are available, and the eyepiece accessing the external application for instructions. For instance, a soldier is delivered to a staging area, and upon entry the eyepiece camera views the icon, accesses the instructions externally, and provides the soldier with the instructions for what to do, where all the steps may be automatic so that the instructions are provided without the soldier being aware of the icon. In embodiments, other sensing inputs and\/or sensing devices, applications for external devices, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using sensing inputs\/sensing devices and feedback to user related to the external devices and applications, such as with a GPS sensor and a visual display from a remote application. The soldier may have an embedded GPS sensor that sends\/streams location coordinates to a remote location facility\/application that sends\/streams a visual display of the surrounding physical environment to the eyepiece for display. For instance, a soldier may be constantly viewing the surrounding environment though the eyepiece, and by way of the embedded GPS sensor, is continuously streamed a visual display overlay that allows for the soldier to have an augmented reality view of the surrounding environment, even as the change locations. In embodiments, other sensing inputs and\/or sensing devices, feedback related to external devices and\/or external applications, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using user action capture inputs\/devices and user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands, such as with a body movement sensor (e.g. kinetic sensor) and an arm motion. The soldier may have body movement sensors attached to their arms, where the motion of their arms convey a command. For instance, a soldier may have kinetic sensors on their arms, and the motion of their arms are duplicated in an aircraft landing lighting system, such that the lights normally held by personnel aiding in a landing may be made to be larger and more visible. In embodiments, other user action capture inputs and\/or devices, user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using user action capture inputs\/devices and command\/control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected, such as wearable sensor sets and a predictive learning-based user interface. A soldier may wear a sensor set where the data from the sensor set is continuously collected and fed to a machine-learning facility through a learning-based user interface, where the soldier may be able to accept, reject, modify, and the like, the learning from their motions and behaviors. For instance, a soldier may perform the same tasks in generally the same physical manner every Monday morning, and the machine-learning facility may establish a learned routine that it provides to the soldier on subsequent Monday mornings, such as a reminder to clean certain equipment, fill out certain forms, play certain music, meet with certain people, and the like. Further, the soldier may be able to modify the outcome of the learning through direct edits to the routine, such as in a learned behavior profile. In embodiments, other user action capture inputs and\/or devices, command and\/or control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using user action capture inputs\/devices and applications on platform that can use commands\/respond to inputs, such as a finger-following camera and video application. A soldier may be able to control the direction that the eyepiece embedded camera is taking video through a resident video application. For instance, a soldier may be viewing a battle scene where they have need to be gazing in one direction, such as being watchful for new developments in the engagement, while filming in a different direction, such as the current point of engagement. In embodiments, other user action capture inputs and\/or devices, applications on platform that can use commands and\/or respond to inputs, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using user action capture inputs\/devices and communication or connection from the on-platform interface to external systems and devices, such as a microphone and voice recognition input plus a steering wheel control interface. The soldier may be able to change aspects of the handling of a vehicle through voice commands received through the eyepiece and delivered to a vehicle's steering wheel control interface (such as through radio communications between the eyepiece and the steering wheel control interface). For instance, a soldier is driving a vehicle on a road, and so the vehicle has certain handling capabilities that are ideal for the road. But the vehicle also has other modes for diving under different conditions, such as off-road, in snow, in mud, in heavy rain, while in pursuit of another vehicle, and the like. In this instance, the soldier may be able to change the mode through voice command as the vehicle changes driving conditions. In embodiments, other user action capture inputs and\/or devices, communication or connection from the on-platform interface to external systems and devices, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using user action capture inputs\/devices and useful external devices to be controlled, such as a microphone and voice recognition input plus an automotive dashboard interface device.

For instance, a soldier may be driving a vehicle on a mission, across rough terrain, such that they cannot let go of the steering wheel with either hand in order to manually control a vehicle dashboard device. In this instance, the soldier may be able to control the vehicle dashboard device through voice controls to the eyepiece. Voice commands through the eyepiece may be especially advantageous, such as opposed to voice control through a dashboard microphone system, because the military vehicle may be immersed in a very loud acoustic environment, and so using the microphone in the eyepiece may give substantially improved performance under such conditions. In embodiments, other user action capture inputs and\/or devices, useful external devices to be controlled, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using user action capture inputs\/devices and applications for useful external devices, such as with a joystick device and external entertainment application.

In embodiments, other user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands, communication or connection from the on-platform interface to external systems and devices, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands and external devices to be controlled, such as through the tap of a foot accessing an external range finder device. A soldier may have a sensor such as a kinetic sensor on their shoe that will detect the motion of the soldier's foot, and the soldier uses a foot motion such as a tap of their foot to use an external range finder device to determine the range to an object such an enemy target. For instance, the soldier may be targeting a weapon system, and using both hands in the process. In this instance, commanding by way of a foot action through the eyepiece may allow for \u2018hands free\u2019 commanding. In embodiments, other user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands, useful external devices to be controlled, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands plus applications for those useful external devices, such as making a symbol with a hand and an information conveying application. The soldier may utilize a hand formed symbol to trigger information shared through an external information conveying application, such as an external information feed, a photo\/video sharing application, a text application, and the like.

The soldier may be wearing an eyepiece equipped with an accelerometer (or like capable sensor for detecting g-force headshake), where when the soldier experiences a g-force headshake that is at a dangerously high level, an audible alert is sounded as feedback to the user, such as determined either as a part of on- or off-eyepiece applications. Further, the output of the accelerometer may be recorded and stored for analysis. For instance, the soldier may experience a g-force headshake from a proximate explosion, and the eyepiece may sense and record the sensor data associated with the headshake. Further, headshakes of a dangerous level may trigger automatic actions by the eyepiece, such as transmitting an alert to other soldiers and\/or to a command center, begin monitoring and\/or transmitting the health of the soldier from other body mounted sensors, provide audible instructions to the soldier related to their potential injuries, and the like. In embodiments, other user movements or actions for controlling or initiating commands, feedback related to external devices and\/or external applications, and the like, as described herein, may also be applied.","In an example, control aspects of the eyepiece may include combinations of using command\/control modes and interfaces in which the inputs can be reflected plus applications on platform that can use commands\/respond to inputs, such as a graphical user interface plus various applications resident on the eyepiece. The eyepiece may provide a graphical user interface to the soldier and applications presented for selection.

As a first example, the user may use the eyepiece for training purposes to simulate medical situations that may arise in combat, training, on or off duty and the like. The simulation may be geared towards a medical professional or non-medical personnel.","By way of example, a low level combat soldier may use the eyepiece to view a medical simulation as part of a training module to provide training for response to medical situations on the battlefield. The eyepiece may provide an augmented environment where the user views injuries overlaid on another solider to simulate those common or capable of being found on the battlefield. The soldier may then be prompted through a user interface to respond to the situation as presented. The user may be given step-by-step instructions of a course of action in providing emergency medical care on the field, or the user may carry out actions in response to the situation that are then corrected until the appropriate response is given.","Similarly, the eyepiece may provide a training environment for a medical professional. The eyepiece may present the user with a medical emergency or situation requiring a medical response for the purpose of training the medical professional. The eyepiece may play out common battle field scenarios for which the user must master appropriate responses and lifesaving techniques.","By way of example, the user may be presented with an augmented reality of a wounded soldier with a gunshot wound to the soldier's body. The medical professional may then act out the steps he feels to be the appropriate response for the situation, select steps through a user interface of the eyepiece that he feels are appropriate for the situation, input the steps into a user interface of the eyepiece, and the like. The user may act out the response through use of sensors and or an input device or he may input the steps of his response into a user interface via eye movements, hand gestures and the like. Similarly, he may select the appropriate steps as presented to him through the user interface via eye movements, hand gestures and the like. As actions are carried out and the user makes decisions about treatment, the user may be presented with additional guidance and instruction based on his performance. For example, if the user is presented with a soldier with a gunshot wound to the chest, and the user begins to lift the soldier to a dangerous position, the user may be given a warning or prompt to change his course of treatment. Alternatively, the user may be prompted with the correct steps in order to practice proper procedure. Further, the trainee may be presented with an example of a medical chart for the wounded soldier in the training situation where the user may have to base his decisions at least in part on what is contained in the medical chart. In various embodiments, the user's actions and performance may be recorded and or documented by the eyepiece for further critiquing and instruction after the training session has paused or otherwise stopped.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may provide a user with various forms of guidance in responding to actual medical situations in combat. By way of example, a non-trained soldier may be prompted with step-by-step lifesaving instructions for fellow soldiers in medical emergencies when a medic is not immediately present. When a fellow soldier is wounded, the user may input the type of injury, the eyepiece may detect the injury or a combination of these may occur. From there, the user may be provided with lifesaving instruction with which to treat the wounded soldier. Such instruction may be presented in the form of augmented reality in a step-wise process of instructions for the user. Further, the eyepiece may provide augmented visual aids to the user regarding location of vital organs near the wounded soldier's injury, an anatomical overlay of the soldier's body and the like. Further, the eyepiece may take video of the situation that is then sent back to a medic not in the field or on his way to the field, thereby allowing the medic to walk the untrained user through an appropriate lifesaving technique on the battlefield. Further, the wounded soldier's eyepiece may send vital information, such as information collected through integral or associated sensors, about the wounded soldier to the treating soldier's eyepiece to be sent to the medic or it may be sent directly to the medic in a remote location such that the treating soldier may provide the wounded solider with medical help based on the information gathered from the wounded soldier's eyepiece.","In other embodiments, when presented with a medical emergency on the battlefield, a trained medic may use the eyepiece to provide an anatomical overlay of the soldier's body so that he may respond more appropriately to the situation at hand. By way of example only and not to limit the present disclosure, if the wounded soldier is bleeding from a gunshot wound to the leg, the user may be presented with an augmented reality view of the soldier's arteries such that the user may determine whether an artery has been hit and how severe the wound may be. The user may be presented with the proper protocol via the eyepiece for the given wound so that he may check each step as he moves through treatment. Such protocol may also be presented to the user in an augmented reality, video, audio or other format. The eyepiece may provide the medic with protocols in the form of augmented reality instructions in a step-wise process. In embodiments, the user may also be presented with an augmented reality overlay of the wounded soldier's organs in order to guide the medic through any procedure such that the medic does not do additional harm to the soldier's organs during treatment. Further, the eyepiece may provide augmented visual aids to the user regarding location of vital organs near the wounded soldier's injury, an anatomical overlay of the soldier's body and the like.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may be used to scan the retina of the wounded soldier in order to pull up his medical chart on the battlefield. This may alert the medic to possible allergies to medication or other important issues that may provide a benefit during medical treatment.","Further, if the wounded soldier is wearing the eyepiece, the device may send information to the medic's glasses including the wounded soldier's heart rate, blood pressure, breathing stress, and the like. The eyepiece may also help the user observe the walking gait of a soldier to determine if the soldier has a head injury and they may help the user determine the location of bleeding or an injury. Such information may provide the user with information of possible medical treatment, and in embodiments, the proper protocol or a selection of protocols may be displayed to the user to help him in treating the patient.","In other embodiments, the eyepiece may allow the user to monitor other symptoms of the patient for a mental health status check. Similarly, the user can check to determine if the patient is exhibiting rapid eye movement and further may use the eyepiece to provide the patient with calming treatment such as providing the patient with eye movement exercises, breathing exercises, and the like. Further, the medic may be provided with information regarding the wounded soldier's vital signs and health data as it is collected from the wounded soldier's eyepiece and sent to the medic's eyepiece. This may provide the medic with real time data from the wounded soldier without having to determine such data on his own for example by taking the wounded soldier's blood pressure.","In various embodiments, the user may be provided with alerts from the eyepiece that tells him how far away an air or ground rescue is from his location on the battlefield. This may provide a medic with important information and alert him to whether certain procedures should or must be attempted given the time available in the situation, and it may provide an injured soldier with comfort knowing help is on the way or alert him that he may need other sources of help.","In other embodiments, the user may be provided alerts of his own vital signs if a problem is detected. For example, a soldier may be alerted if his blood pressure is too high, thereby alerting him that he must take medication or remove himself from combat if possible to return his blood pressure to a safe level. Also, the user may be alerted of other such personal data such as his pupil size, heart rate, waking gait change and the like in order to determine if the user is experiencing a medical problem. In other embodiments, a user's eyepiece may also alert medical personnel in another location of the user's medical status in order to send help for the user whether or not he knows he requires such help. Further, general data may be aggregated from multiple eyepieces in order to provide the commanding office with detailed information on his wounded soldiers, how many soldiers he has in combat, how many of those are wounded, and the like.","In various embodiments, a trained medical professional may use the eyepiece in medical responses out of combat as well. Such eyepiece may have similar uses as described above on or off the home base of the medic but outside of combat situations. In this way, the eyepiece may provide a user with a means to gain augmented reality assistance during a medical procedure, to document a medical procedure, perform a medical procedure at the guidance of a remote commanding officer via video and\/or audio, and the like on or off a military base. This may provide assistance in a plurality of situations where the medic may need additional assistance. An example of this may occur when the medic is on duty on a training exercise, a calisthenics outing, a military hike and the like. Such assistance may be of importance when the medic is the only responder, when he is a new medic, approached with a new situation and the like.","In some embodiments, the eyepiece may provide user guidance in an environment related to a military transport plane. For example, the eyepiece may be used in such an environment when training, going into battle, on a reconnaissance or rescue mission, while moving equipment, performing maintenance on the plane and the like. Such use may be suited for personnel of various ranks and levels.","For illustrative purposes, a user may receive audio and visual information through the eyepiece while on the transport plane and going into a training exercise. The information may provide the user with details about the training mission such as the battle field conditions, weather conditions, mission instructions, map of the area and the like. The eyepiece may simulate actual battle scenarios to prepare the user for battle. The eyepiece may also record the user's responses and actions through various means. Such data gathering may allow the user to receive feedback about his performance. Further, the eyepiece may then change the simulation based on the results obtained during the training exercise to change the simulation while it is underway or to change future simulations for the user or various users.","In embodiments, the eyepiece may provide user guidance and or interaction on a military transport plane when going into battle. The user may receive audio and visual information about the mission as the user boards the plane. Check lists may be presented to the user for ensuring he has the appropriate materials and equipment of the mission. Further, instructions for securing equipment and proper use of safety harnesses may be presented along with information about the aircraft such as emergency exits, location of oxygen tanks, and safety devices.
