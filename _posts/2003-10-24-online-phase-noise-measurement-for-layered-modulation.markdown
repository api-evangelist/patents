title: On-line phase noise measurement for layered modulation
abstract: A method and apparatus for measuring the phase noise of an low noise block (LNB) and other devices while the device under test is on line is disclosed. Using a signal processing procedure over a short duration of a received signal, the technique demodulates the signal to expose the phase history of the underlying carrier for measurement. In an exemplary apparatus timing and carrier recovery on A/D samples are performed conventionally, a linear phase is estimated from minimum mean square fitting to the recovered carrier phase history, the single tone carrier is removed from the recovered phase to yield a residual phase. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) can be performed on the residual phase to produce a phase noise spectral measurement at an input of the demodulator.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to systems and methods for phase noise measurement in transmitted signals, particularly signals using layered modulations.","2. Description of the Related Art","Digital signal communication systems have been used in various fields, including digital TV signal transmission, either terrestrial or satellite. As the various digital signal communication systems and services evolve, there is a burgeoning demand for increased data throughput and added services.","The conventional method of increasing spectral capacity is to move to a higher-order modulation, such as from quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) to eight phase shift keying (8PSK) or sixteen quadrature amplitude modulation (16QAM). Unfortunately, higher-order modulations typically have a greater sensitivity to the presence of phase noise.","Along the propagation path of a transmitted signal in a wireless system, a low noise block (LNB) provides a link between the wireless and landline environments, among its other functions. The LNB translates the radio frequency (RF) input frequency to an intermediate frequency (IF) output through a low-cost local oscillator. Consequently, the LNB is usually the dominant source of phase noise along the communication signal path. It is important that LNB phase noise not exceed the specification for the allowable total communication link noise to perform at the expected level. However, measurement of LNB phase noise has been an expensive proposition because of the wireless interface. In the implementation of digital broadcast systems, particularly using higher-order modulations, measurement of phase noise in the signal can be important in testing components and system function.","In a conventional method of measuring phase noise, the RF input of the LNB may require an anechoic chamber to perform an adequate phase noise measurement. Furthermore, such a measurement is usually accompanied with a time-consuming testing procedure over a range of operating input frequency of interest. The invented method calculates a phase noise spectrum with a single capture of a short received signal. The software that calculates the LNB phase noise is both simple and efficient.","Accordingly, there is a need for systems and methods that allow an on-line measurement of phase noise, particularly in digital television applications. Further, there is a need for such methods and apparatuses to be convenient and inexpensive to use. As detailed hereafter, the present invention meets these and other needs.","Embodiments of the present invention offer a low-cost replacement solution for measuring LNB phase noise, allowing LNBs to be tested more frequently and at convenient places. The result is increased assurance of overall system performance at a reduced cost.","A method to measure phase noise of an LNB and other devices while the device under test (DUT) is on line has been developed. Using a signal processing procedure over a short duration of a received signal, the method demodulates the signal to expose the phase history of the underlying carrier for measurement.","The conventional method of phase noise measurement has been to drive the LNB with a reference signal that has sufficiently good spectral purity. One difficulty with this method has been the lack of a convenient way to inject the required RF signal into the front end of the LNB, so that output from the LNB may be appropriately observed. Because of the wireless RF input, an anechoic chamber may be required. The invention provides a much less expensive way to measure LNB phase noise within the spectral region of significant impact. The method may be performed wherever a received signal can be captured and processed with the required signal processing.","A typical system for measuring phase noise according to the invention comprises a tuner  for tuning a signal from a device and converting the signal to a baseband signal and at least one analog-to-digital converter (ADC)  for capturing data from the baseband signal. A timing processor determines timing data from the captured data of the baseband signal and a carrier processor determines phase history data from the dining data in a conventional manner. Next, a line fitting processor determines a linear phase by fitting a straight line to the phase history data and a subtractor subtracts the linear phase from the phase history data to reveal the residual phase of the signal. The system can further employ a fast Fourier transform (FFT) processor for determining the phase noise spectrum from the residual phase from the subtractor and the phase noise spectrum can be scaled to dBc\/KHz.","Typically, the line fitting processor can perform a minimum mean square (MMS) operation on the phase history data to determine the linear phase. The length of captured data can be based upon a lowest frequency of interest of the phase noise. More than one ADC can be used for example where the captured data comprises in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components.","The signal can comprise a satellite television signal. The signal can be received from a low noise block (LNB) down-converted in frequency for proper analog-to-digital conversion. Thus, the residual phase is substantially a performance measurement of the LNB.","In the following description of the preferred embodiment, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration a specific embodiment in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","1. Overview","The present invention is directed to an on-line phase noise measurement method and apparatus. This method and apparatus is useful in a video distribution system using digital broadcast signals, particularly in a layered modulation signal system. Notably, the method and apparatus does not require that the device under test (DUT) be removed from operation in order to be tested; the phase noise measurement occurs while the system remains on line and processing a signal comprising actual payload data. An exemplary system architecture that can utilize the invention is detailed as follows.","2. Video Distribution System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","114","110","120","102","104","110"]},"The uplink center  receives program material and program control information from the control center , and using an uplink antenna  and transmitter , transmits the program material and program control information to the satellite  via feeder link signal . The satellite  receives and processes this information, and transmits the video programs and control information to the subscriber receiver station  via downlink signal  using transmitter or transponder . The subscriber receiving station  receives this information using the outdoor unit (ODU) , which includes a subscriber antenna and a low noise block converter (LNB). The present invention is directed at testing of components of such a system for phase noise, particularly the LNB.","In one embodiment, the subscriber receiving station antenna is an 18-inch slightly oval-shaped Ku-band antenna. The slight oval shape is due to the 22.5 degree offset feed of the LNB (low noise block converter) which is used to receive signals reflected from the subscriber antenna. The offset feed positions the LNB out of the way so it does not block any surface area of the antenna minimizing attenuation of the incoming microwave signal.","The video distribution system  can comprise a plurality of satellites  in order to provide wider terrestrial coverage, to provide additional channels, or to provide additional bandwidth per channel. In one embodiment of the invention, each satellite comprises 16 transponders to receive and transmit program material and other control data from the uplink center  and provide it to the subscriber receiving stations . Using data compression and multiplexing techniques the channel capabilities, two satellites  working together can receive and broadcast over 150 conventional (non-HDTV) audio and video channels via 32 transponders.","While the invention disclosed herein will be described with reference to a satellite-based video distribution system , the present invention may also be practiced with terrestrial-based transmission of program information, whether by broadcasting means, cable, or other means. Further, the different functions collectively allocated among the control center  and the uplink center  as described above can be reallocated as desired without departing from the intended scope of the present invention.","Although the foregoing has been described with respect to a system in which the program material delivered to the subscriber  is video (and audio) program material such as a movie, such a system can be used to deliver program material comprising purely audio information or other data as well.","2.1 Uplink Configuration",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["108","108","102","104","206","208"]},"Typical video channels are provided by a program source A-C of video material (collectively referred to hereinafter as program source(s) ). The data from each program source  is provided to an encoder A-C (collectively referred to hereinafter as encoder(s) ). Each of the encoders accepts a program time stamp (PTS) from the controller . The PTS is a wrap-around binary time stamp that is used to assure that the video information is properly synchronized with the audio information after encoding and decoding. A PTS time stamp is sent with each I-frame of the MPEG encoded data.","In one embodiment of the present invention, each encoder  is a second generation Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG-2) encoder, but other decoders implementing other coding techniques can be used as well. The data channel can be subjected to a similar compression scheme by an encoder (not shown), but such compression is usually either unnecessary, or performed by computer programs in the computer data source (for example, photographic data is typically compressed into *.TIF files or *.JPG files before transmission). After encoding by the encoders , the signals are converted into data packets by a packetizer A-F (collectively referred to hereinafter as packetizer(s) ) associated with each program source .","The output data packets are assembled using a reference from the system clock  (SCR), and from the conditional access manager , which provides the service channel identifier (SCID) to the packetizers  for use in generating the data packets.

The digital data stream is then supplied to a forward error correction (FEC) decoder . This allows the IRD  to reassemble the data transmitted by the uplink center  (which applied the forward error correction to the desired signal before transmission to the subscriber receiving station ) verifying that the correct data signal was received, and correcting errors, if any. The error-corrected data may be fed from the FEC decoder module  to the transport module  via an 8-bit parallel interface.","The transport module  performs many of the data processing functions performed by the IRD . The transport module  processes data received from the FEC decoder module  and provides the processed data to the video MPEG decoder  and the audio MPEG decoder . As needed the transport module employs system RAM  to process the data. In one embodiment of the present invention, the transport module , video MPEG decoder  and audio MPEG decoder  are all implemented on integrated circuits. This design promotes both space and power efficiency, and increases the security of the functions performed within the transport module . The transport module  also provides a passage for communications between the microcontroller  and the video and audio MPEG decoders , . As set forth more fully hereinafter, the transport module also works with the conditional access module (CAM)  to determine whether the receiver  is permitted to access certain program material. Data from the transport module  can also be supplied to external communication module .","The CAM  functions in association with other elements to decode an encrypted signal from the transport module . The CAM  may also be used for tracking and billing these services. In one embodiment of the present invention, the CAM  is a removable smart card, having contacts cooperatively interacting with contacts in the IRD  to pass information. In order to implement the processing performed in the CAM , the IRD , and specifically the transport module  provides a clock signal to the CAM .","Video data is processed by the MPEG video decoder . Using the video random access memory (RAM) , the MPEG video decoder  decodes the compressed video data and sends it to an encoder or video processor , which converts the digital video information received from the video MPEG module  into an output signal usable by a display or other output device. By way of example, processor  may comprise a National TV Standards Committee (NTSC) or Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) encoder. In one embodiment of the invention both S-Video and ordinary video (NTSC or ATSC) signals are provided. Other outputs may also be utilized, and are advantageous if high definition programming is processed.","Audio data is likewise decoded by the MPEG audio decoder . The decoded audio data may then be sent to a digital to analog (D\/A) converter . In one embodiment of the present invention, the D\/A converter  is a dual D\/A converter, one for the right and left channels. If desired, additional channels can be added for use in surround sound processing or secondary audio programs (SAPs). In one embodiment of the invention, the dual D\/A converter  itself separates the left and right channel information, as well as any additional channel information. Other audio formats may similarly be supported. For example, other audio formats such as multi-channel DOLBY DIGITAL AC-3 may be supported.","A description of the processes performed in the encoding and decoding of video streams, particularly with respect to MPEG and JPEG encoding\/decoding, can be found in Chapter 8 of \u201cDigital Television Fundamentals,\u201d by Michael Robin and Michel Poulin, McGraw-Hill, 1998, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.","The microcontroller  receives and processes command signals from a remote control, an IRD  keyboard interface, and\/or other suitable input device . The microcontroller  receives commands for performing its operations from a processor programming memory, which permanently stores such instructions for performing such commands. The processor programming memory may comprise a read only memory (ROM) , an electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM)  or, similar memory device. The microcontroller  also controls the other digital devices of the IRD  via address and data lines (denoted \u201cA\u201d and \u201cD\u201d respectively, in ).","The modem  connects to the customer's phone line via the PSTN port . It calls, e.g. the program provider, and transmits the customer's purchase information for billing purposes, and\/or other information. The modem  is controlled by the microprocessor . The modem  can output data to other I\/O port types including standard parallel and serial computer I\/O ports.","A typical video distribution system can also comprise a local storage unit such as the video storage device  for storing video and\/or audio data obtained from the transport module . Video storage device  can be a hard disk drive, a read\/writable compact disc of DVD, a solid state RAM, or any other suitable storage medium. Further, the video storage device  can comprise a hard disk drive with specialized parallel read\/write capability so that data may be read from the video storage device  and written to the device  at the same time. To accomplish this, additional buffer memory accessible by the video storage  or its controller may be used. Optionally, a video storage processor  can be used to manage the storage and retrieval of the video data from the video storage device . The video storage processor  may also comprise memory for buffering data passing into and out of the video storage device . Alternatively or in combination with the foregoing, a plurality of video storage devices  can be used. Also alternatively or in combination with the foregoing, the microcontroller  can also perform the operations required to store and or retrieve video and other data in the video storage device .","The video processing module  input can be directly supplied as a video output to a viewing device such as a video or computer monitor. In addition, the video and\/or audio outputs can be supplied to an RF modulator  to produce an RF output and\/or 8 vestigial side band (VSB) suitable as an input signal to a conventional television tuner. This allows the receiver  to operate with televisions without a video output.","Each of the satellites  comprises a transponder, which accepts program information from the uplink center , and relays this information to the subscriber receiving station . Known multiplexing techniques are used so that multiple channels can be provided to the user. These multiplexing techniques include, by way of example, various statistical or other time domain multiplexing techniques and polarization multiplexing. A single transponder operating at a single frequency band can carry a plurality of channels identified by respective service channel identification (SCID).","The IRD  can also receive and store a program guide in a memory available to the microcontroller . Typically, the program guide is received in one or more data packets in the data stream from the satellite . The program guide can be accessed and searched by the execution of suitable operation steps implemented by the microcontroller  and stored in the processor ROM . The program guide may include data to map viewer channel numbers to satellite transponders and service channel identifications (SCIDs), and also provide TV program listing information to the subscriber  identifying program events.","The functionality implemented in the IRD  depicted in  can be implemented by one or more hardware modules, one or more software modules defining instructions performed by a processor, or a combination of both.","A video distribution system used with the invention can also provide the modulation of signals at different power levels and advantageously for the signals to be non-coherent from each layer. In addition, independent modulation and coding of the signals may be performed. Backwards compatibility with legacy receivers, such as a quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) receiver is enabled and new services are provided to new receivers. A typical new receiver uses two demodulators and one remodulator (which can be combined in one or more processors). Such layered modulation systems are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/844,401, filed Apr. 27, 2001, by Ernest C. Chen, entitled \u201cLAYERED MODULATION FOR DIGITAL SIGNALS,\u201d which is incorporated by reference herein.","In a typical backwards-compatible embodiment of the present invention, the legacy QPSK signal is boosted in power to a higher transmission (and reception) level. The legacy receiver will not be able to distinguish the new lower layer signal, from additive white Gaussian noise, and thus operates in the usual manner. The optimum selection of the layer power levels is based on accommodating the legacy equipment, as well as the desired new throughput and services.","The new lower layer signal is provided with a sufficient carrier to thermal noise ratio to function properly. The new lower layer signal and the boosted legacy signal are non-coherent with respect to each other. Therefore, the new lower layer signal can be implemented from a different TWTA and even from a different satellite. The new lower layer signal format is also independent of the legacy format, e.g., it may be QPSK or 8PSK, using the conventional concatenated FEC code or using a new Turbo code. The lower layer signal may even be an analog signal.","The combined layered signal is demodulated and decoded by first demodulating the upper layer to remove the upper carrier. The stabilized layered signal may then have the upper layer FEC decoded and the output upper layer symbols communicated to the upper layer transport. The upper layer symbols are also employed in a remodulator, to generate an idealized upper layer signal. The idealized upper layer signal is then subtracted from the stable layered signal to reveal the lower layer signal. The lower layer signal is then demodulated and FEC decoded and communicated to the lower layer transport.","Signals, systems and methods using the present invention may be used to supplement a pre-existing transmission compatible with legacy receiving hardware in a backwards-compatible application or as part of a preplanned layered modulation architecture providing one or more additional layers at a present or at a later date.","4.

The carrier processor  produces a tracked and unwrapped carrier phase history  from the timing-tracked data of the timing processor . Unwrapping the carrier phase history eliminates the effect of the ambiguity (or discontinuity) as the phase transitions between values of +180\u00b0 to \u2212180\u00b0.
