{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM OF PRIORITY","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims priority to, and incorporates by reference, the entire disclosure of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/463,274, filed on Apr. 16, 2003. This application is co-pending with a related patent application entitled \u201cMethods and Systems for Reducing the Spread of Files on a Network\u201d Ser. No. 10\/826,620, by the same inventor and having assignee in common, filed concurrently herewith and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","The disclosed methods and systems were developed with support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; contract number MDA972-01-C-0080. The United States Government may have certain rights in the disclosed systems and methods.","The disclosed methods and systems relate generally to communications networks, and more particularly to methods and systems for monitoring data transmitted over such networks.","Communications networks typically include a number of interconnected communications devices. Connections among the devices in some communications networks are accomplished through physical devices such as wires or optical links. Such networks can be referred to as \u201cwired\u201d networks. Connections among other devices in other communications networks can be accomplished through radio, infrared, or other wireless links. Such networks can be referred to as \u201cwireless\u201d networks. Accordingly, networks can thus include and\/or otherwise be comprised of wired and\/or wireless connectors and\/or networks.","In varying degrees, network users often receive unwanted communications messages. While some unwanted messages can be benign, e.g., advertisements, the amount of unwanted traffic can consume valuable resources. Additionally, some unwanted messages, e.g., computer worms and viruses, can maliciously destroy other data at a receiving node and\/or disable the operation of the node, while causing the node to forward the unwanted message to further unsuspecting nodes. Methods are known in the art for identifying and blocking receipt of some unwanted messages, e.g., virus scanning software. Generally, such methods include analyzing the contents of such messages.","Communications messages (e.g., data packets) transmitted across communications networks can be intercepted. Intercepted messages can yield valuable information and the process of intercepting and analyzing messages can be referred to as \u201ctraffic analysis\u201d. In general, traffic analysis can seek to understand something about the message traffic on a network by observing the traffic and analyzing that traffic to extract information. However, to guard against unwanted traffic analysis, messages can be encrypted. For example, both the content and the destination of a message can be obscured through encryption.","Commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/212,324 entitled \u201cEncoding Signals to Facilitate Traffic Analysis\u201d, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, describes methods and systems that acquire information about communications among nodes in a network by intercepting pieces or \u201cchunks\u201d of data in the network by a tap located among the nodes in the network. Characteristic information about the intercepted chunks of data can be obtained. The characteristic information can include times of arrival of the chunks of data at the tap and identifiers of the source nodes that transmitted the chunks of data. A signal can be constructed to represent the characteristic information over time.","Commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/243,489 entitled \u201cMethods and Systems for Passive Information Discovery Using Lomb Periodogram Processing\u201d, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, describes methods and systems for processing communications signals in a network that can obtain time of arrival information for chunks of data in the network and construct a signal to represent the time of arrival of the information. The signal can consist of data that is non-uniformly spaced. The system can process the signal using a Lomb technique to obtain periodicity information about the signal.","Commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/359,995 entitled \u201cEnd-To-End Route Discovery From Link Activity Traces\u201d, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, describes methods and systems for determining shortest routes between pairs of nodes in a network that can obtain time of arrival information for chunks of data in the network and construct a network graph from the time of arrival information. The network graph can include links between pairs of nodes, with the links including time series of data. The methods and systems can also include finding shortest routes between pairs of nodes in the network graph. One shortest route can be chosen for a pair of nodes that can have multiple shortest routes of the same length based on the time series of data in the links.","The information obtained using the above described methods and systems can be based on the time of arrival for chunks of data and not on the contents of the data. Thus, the information can be available for encrypted messages. Methods and systems can be developed to aid in identifying unwanted messages using this information and further to track the spread of the messages on the network.","The disclosed methods and systems include tracking routing of traffic on a network by presenting signals corresponding to a time-series of traffic on links of the network through a band-pass filter to obtain band-limited signals, the band pass filter centered substantially about a frequency corresponding to traffic to be tracked. The methods and systems can also include determining coherence values of the band-limited signals, where the coherence values correspond to ingress and egress pairs of links at nodes of the network; and, based on a comparison of the coherence values to a threshold, forming at least one map of the routing of the traffic to be tracked for corresponding pairs of links.","In some embodiments, the time-series associated with the ingress and egress links at the network nodes can be windowed. The signals corresponding to the time-series of the links over a window can be passed through a band-pass filter centered on a given or determined traffic frequency emanating from code executing on the network, e.g., a frequency suspected to be generated by traffic emanating from a worm on the network. The normalized coherence for ingress-egress pairs can be computed. Higher coherence for a pair can signify increased likelihood that traffic corresponding to the frequency was routed through the pair. Determining coherence over a range of windows and across all nodes in the network can provide a map or graph indicating the routing of traffic corresponding to the frequency.","In one embodiment, a method of tracking routing of traffic on a network can include passing signals corresponding to a time-series of traffic on links of the network through a band-pass filter centered around a frequency corresponding to traffic to be tracked so as to obtain band-limited signals, determining coherence values of the band-limited signals corresponding to ingress and egress pairs of links at nodes of the network, and forming maps of the routing of the traffic to be tracked for pairs of links having coherence values above a threshold value.","The method can include tracking times of arrival data and transforming the times of arrival data into the time-series of traffic. The method can include configuring the frequency based on virus protection data. The method can include obtaining spectral analyses of the time-series, for each pair of sending node and receiving node, marking transmissions of data packets for the pair as marked transmissions when the spectral analyses indicate peak frequencies associated with the marked transmissions are different from peak frequencies associated with others of the transmissions for the pair over a window of the time-series of a predetermined duration, determining the frequency based on a frequency associated with at least two of the marked transmissions when the two marked transmissions have at least one common sending node or a common receiving node, and are within a specified number of the windows of each other. The method can include isolating nodes having coherence values above a predetermined value, or isolating a predetermined number of nodes having coherence values greater than other nodes not isolated.","The method can include parsing the time-series into windows, obtaining Lomb periodograms for the windows, comparing peak frequencies in successive ones of the periodograms for a sender node to determine if one of the periodograms includes a peak above a threshold at a first frequency different from said peak frequencies in a preceding one of the periodograms, determining if at least one peak above the threshold at the first frequency occurs in one of a predetermined number of previous periodograms for the sender node, determining if the at least one peak at the first frequency occurs in at least one of a specified number of periodograms obtained at a receiver node for other sender nodes of the network, using the first frequency to center the band-pass filter when the at least one peak at the first frequency does not occur in one of the predetermined number of previous periodograms for the sender node and when the at least one peak at the first frequency occurs in at least one of the specified number of periodograms obtained at the receiver node for other sender nodes of the network.","In one embodiment, a method of determining routing of traffic on links between nodes of a network can include obtaining time-series of the traffic, determining, based on the time-series, a tracking frequency corresponding to traffic to be tracked, passing signals corresponding to the time-series through a band-pass filter centered around the tracking frequency to obtain band-limited signals, determining coherence values of the band-limited signals corresponding to ingress and egress pairs of links at nodes of the network, and forming maps of the routing of the tracked traffic for pairs of links having coherence values above a threshold value.","In determining the tracking frequency, the method can include parsing the time-series into windows, obtaining Lomb periodograms for the windows, comparing peak frequencies in successive ones of the periodograms for a sender node to determine if one of the periodograms includes a peak above a threshold at a first frequency different from the frequencies in a preceding one of the periodograms, determining if at least one peak above the threshold at the first frequency occurs in one of a predetermined number of previous periodograms for the sender node, determining if the at least one peak at the first frequency occurs in at least one of a specified number of periodograms obtained at a receiver node for other sender nodes of the network, and using the first frequency as the tracking frequency when the at least one peak at the first frequency does not occur in one of the predetermined number of previous periodograms for the sender node and when the at least one peak at the first frequency occurs in at least one of the specified number of periodograms obtained at the receiver node for other sender nodes of the network. The method can include isolating nodes having coherence values above a predetermined value, or isolating a predetermined number of nodes having coherence values greater than other nodes not isolated.","In one embodiment, computer-readable medium can contain instructions for controlling a processor to track routing of traffic on a network by passing signals corresponding to a time-series of traffic on links of the network through a band-pass filter centered around a frequency corresponding to traffic to be tracked to obtain band-limited signals, by determining coherence values of the band-limited signals corresponding to ingress and egress pairs of links at nodes of the network, and by forming at least one map of the routing of the traffic to be tracked for pairs of links having coherence values above a threshold value. The computer-readable medium can include instructions for controlling a processor to track routing of traffic on a network by tracking times of arrival data, and by transforming the times of arrival data into the time-series of traffic. The computer-readable medium can include instructions for controlling a processor to track routing of traffic on a network by configuring the frequency based on virus protection data.","The computer-readable medium can include instructions for controlling a processor to track routing of traffic on a network by obtaining spectral analyses of the time-series, by, for each pair of sending node and receiving node, marking transmissions of data packets for the pair as marked transmissions when the spectral analyses indicate peak frequencies associated with the marked transmissions are different from peak frequencies associated with others of the transmissions for the pair over a window of the time-series of a predetermined duration, and by determining the frequency based on a frequency associated with at least two of the marked transmissions when the at least two marked transmissions have at least one common sending node or receiving node, and are within a specified number of the windows.","The computer-readable medium can include instructions for controlling a processor to track routing of traffic on a network by parsing the time-series into windows, obtaining Lomb periodograms for the windows, comparing peak frequencies in successive ones of the periodograms for a sender node to determine if one of the periodograms includes a peak above a threshold at a first frequency different from the peak frequencies in a preceding one of the periodograms, by determining if at least one peak above the threshold at the first frequency occurs in one of a predetermined number of previous periodograms for the sender node, by determining if the at least one peak at the first frequency occurs in at least one of a specified number of periodograms obtained at a receiver node for other sender nodes of the network, and by using the first frequency to center the band-pass filter when the at least one peak at the first frequency does not occur in one of the predetermined number of previous periodograms for the sender node and when the at least one peak at the first frequency occurs in at least one of the specified number of periodograms obtained at the receiver node for other sender nodes of the network.","The computer-readable medium can include instructions for controlling a processor to isolate nodes having coherence values above a predetermined value, or to isolate a predetermined number of nodes having coherence values greater than other nodes not isolated. The computer-readable medium can include instructions for controlling a processor to track routing of traffic on a network by configuring the frequency based on virus protection data.","In one embodiment, a system for tracking routing of traffic on a network can include means for passing signals corresponding to a time-series of traffic on links of the network through a band-pass filter centered around a frequency corresponding to traffic to be tracked to obtain band-limited signals, means for determining coherence values of said band-limited signals corresponding to ingress and egress pairs of links at nodes of the network, and means for forming at least one map of the routing of said traffic to be tracked for pairs of links having coherence values above a threshold value. The system can include means for configuring the frequency based on virus protection data. The system can include means for isolating nodes of the network based on at least one of having coherence values above a predetermined value and being one of a predetermined number of nodes having coherence values greater than other nodes not isolated.","In one embodiment, a computer program, disposed on a computer readable medium, can enable tracking of traffic routing on a network. The computer program can include instructions for causing a processor to obtain time-series of the traffic, to determine, based on the time-series, a tracking frequency corresponding to traffic to be tracked, to pass signals corresponding to the time-series through a band-pass filter centered around the tracking frequency to obtain band-limited signals, to determine coherence values of the band-limited signals corresponding to ingress and egress pairs of links at nodes of the network, and to form at least one map of the routing of the traffic to be tracked for pairs of links having coherence values above a threshold value.","The computer program can include instructions for causing a processor to parse the time-series into windows, to obtain Lomb periodograms for the windows, to compare peak frequencies in successive ones of the periodograms for a sender node to determine if one of the periodograms includes a peak above a threshold at a first frequency different from the peak frequencies in a preceding one of the periodograms, to determine if at least one peak above the threshold at the first frequency occurs in one of a predetermined number of previous periodograms for the sender node, to determine if the at least one peak at the first frequency occurs in at least one of a specified number of periodograms obtained at a receiver node for other sender nodes of the network, and to use the first frequency as the tracking frequency when the at least one peak at the first frequency does not occur in one of the predetermined number of previous periodograms for the sender node and when the at least one peak at the first frequency occurs in at least one of the specified number of periodograms obtained at the receiver node for other sender nodes of the network. The computer program can include instructions for causing a processor to isolate nodes having coherence values above a predetermined value, or to isolate a predetermined number of nodes having coherence values greater than other nodes not isolated.","To provide an overall understanding, certain illustrative embodiments will now be described; however, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the systems and methods described herein can be adapted and modified to provide systems and methods for other suitable applications and that other additions and modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the systems and methods described herein.","Unless otherwise specified, the illustrated embodiments can be understood as providing exemplary features of varying detail of certain embodiments, and therefore, unless otherwise specified, features, components, modules, and\/or aspects of the illustrations can be otherwise combined, separated, interchanged, and\/or rearranged without departing from the disclosed systems or methods. Additionally, the shapes and sizes of components are also exemplary and unless otherwise specified, can be altered without affecting the disclosed systems or methods.","Referring to , there is shown an exemplary network . The network  can include a number of network nodes  connected by a number of network links . The network  can also include one or more network nodes that serve as routers. For the exemplary embodiment of , network  can include seven nodes  connected in a particular configuration, with nodes n-n serving as routers. The illustrated configuration can be understood to be exemplary, and other configurations can be contemplated that can include varying numbers and configurations of nodes , links , and\/or routers.","Network nodes  can be configured to send and\/or receive information according to a communications protocol, such as TCP\/IP. Although not specifically shown, some nodes  can be configured to provide a route for information to a specified destination. Other nodes  can be configured to send the information according to a previously-determined route. The network nodes  can communicate via discrete \u201cchunks\u201d of data that can be transmitted by \u201csenders\u201d . The chunks can include separate pieces of data and\/or data elements that extend over a period of time. A chunk can be individually detectable or distinguishable. For example, router nodes n-n can determine when a chunk starts and\/or ends. A chunk of data need not exactly correspond to a packet of data. A chunk may represent part of a packet (e.g., a fragment or an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cell of certain protocol description units), or multiple packets (e.g., two packets concatenated).","A sender node  can be understood herein to be the most recent node  to transmit a particular chunk. As an example, node n of  can originate a chunk and forward the chunk to node n of  via router node n of . For the exemplary configuration of , router node n can intercept the chunk as it is transmitted from mode n to node n. Thus, node n and\/or n can be considered a sender node.","Network links  can include electronic links (e.g., wires or coaxial cables), optical links (e.g., fiber optic cables), and\/or wireless links. In a wired network , the links  can provide a connection between two nodes  (e.g., nodes n and n). Router nodes, e.g., node n, can be a part of the links  and can observe the information carried on them. Routers n-n can include devices that can intercept chunk transmissions on the network  at a physical layer, a link layer, a network layer, or at higher layers of the network  being monitored. For example, router n can include a physical connection to a corresponding link  between nodes n and n and circuitry to detect chunks of data on the link . The layer at which interceptions occur can be determined by those skilled in the art, and can be chosen based on knowledge of, and access to, the network links .","The router nodes can include, for example, a transceiver for sensing the chunks of data and can also include other circuitry (e.g., clock circuitry) for determining times of arrival and\/or duration of the chunks. The router nodes can include a processor for computing other information associated with the chunks, such as information contained within a header of the chunk of data (e.g., the identity of a sending node  and\/or a receiving node ).","In the example of , router node n can observe traffic on the link  between nodes n, n, n and n. Router node n can record information about the chunks that it observes in a \u201ctracefile.\u201d A tracefile can contain information for observed chunks, and accordingly, can be understood to be an associated grouping of such data, where such data can be associated and\/or grouped using a variety of mechanisms and\/or schemes. For example, the information can include the time a chunk is\/was observed and the identity of the sender node(s)  of the chunk. The identity of the sender node(s)  can include, for example, the exchange point address of an Internet Protocol security (IPsec) gateway, the upstream or downstream transmitter on the point-to-point link , or information such as \u201cthe same sender node  as the one that also transmitted [specified other] chunks.\u201d If available, the tracefile can also include additional information about the length or duration of the chunk, the destination node , or information concerning the contents of a chunk. In addition, available information can include the location of a router node along the link  relative to the nodes  at either end of the link , e.g., nodes n and n.","It can be understood that errors can occur in the information observed by router nodes n-n. For example, router node n can mistakenly believe it has seen a chunk when no chunk was transmitted due to bit errors on network . Such error events, including the false transmission detection of the previous example, or missed transmissions, or misclassification of a sender node , can be viewed as adding noise to the signals generated by the router nodes n-n. Other sources of noise in the signal generated by the router nodes n-n can include interference from other signals (e.g., packets belonging to another flow, or jitter in timing due to sharing of a bottleneck among multiple flows).","Router nodes n-n can listen passively and not participate in the monitored network  at the Media Access Control (MAC) (or higher) layers. Such passive listening can be referred to as covert information collection. In some cases, for example with 802.3, or 802.1 lb Local Area Networks (LANs), the router nodes n-n can snoop at the MAC layer and extract some information about higher layer protocols. In other networks, such as Synchronous Optical Networks (SONET), the information about the MAC or higher layer protocols can be limited, or unavailable.","Although  illustrates multiple router nodes, network  can include one or more router nodes, which can be interconnected. Router nodes can work independently using purely local information. Distributed algorithms and\/or processing schemes can allow sharing of information among router nodes. In such a case, the router nodes can have a globally synchronized clock that allows information from multiple router nodes to be combined. A clock resolution of the router nodes n-n can be finer than the data sampling resolution of the router nodes n-n, so that information about transmissions (e.g., the start time, duration, inter-transmission gap, and even the presence of short transmissions) can be obtained without missing some of the information.","In addition, a router node (or a network of router nodes) can store the detected transmissions for an amount of time such that information concerning longer duration events can be obtained. For example, to determine the round-trip time of a transport layer flow, the history stored at router node n can be equal to or greater than one roundtrip time. The total volume of data stored can depend on the capacity of the links  to the router node n and a maximum roundtrip time of flows seen on the links . Router nodes n-n can assign a unique identifier to each sender node . For example, the identifier can be based on the address of the IPsec gateway, though other identifiers can be assigned by router'nodes n-n.","It can be understood that network  can include a wireless network. In a wireless network , nodes  can communicate via wireless transmission, including point-to-point, broadcast, and\/or other known wireless transmission methodologies. Sender nodes  can transmit using various types of wireless physical layers, such as terrestrial Radio Frequency (RF), satellite bands, and\/or free space optical. In a wireless network, nodes  can include radio routers and\/or client radios. The links  of  can represent wireless links at a point in time, and it can be understood that wireless links  can be reconfigured as the various nodes  communicate with other nodes . For example,  illustrates a link  between node n and node n. At another point in time, the communications between node n and node n can be completed and node n can establish a communication with node n, as illustrated by dashed line ","In such a network, router nodes can include wireless router nodes that can intercept wireless transmissions on the network . Wireless router nodes can observe some (potentially very large) fraction of the wireless spectrum, and thus can observe transmissions from a wide range of wireless sender nodes . As illustrated by dashed line  shown in , wireless router nodes can have a limited effective reception range. Dashed line  can indicate an effective reception area through which router node n can receive communications from the nodes . Some nodes , such as nodes n and n in , can be out of the effective reception area and will not be monitored by router node n. Nodes n-n, which can be within the range illustrated by dashed line , can be monitored by router node n.","For wireless nodes , node identity information observed by the router nodes can include, for example, an RF signature and\/or the location of a radio transmitter node . For a wireless router node, e.g., n, additional information can include the geographic location of the router node n, as determined by, for example, a global positioning system (GPS) receiver. As previously described, although  illustrates multiple router nodes n-n, network  can include one or more router nodes. For a wireless network, the number of router nodes placed in the network  can be determined by the desired coverage level of network . Wireless router nodes can have a globally synchronized clock that allows information from multiple router nodes to be combined.","In the presence of mobile nodes , e.g., in ad hoc wireless networks or Mobile IP, router nodes can include mobile router nodes, though stationary nodes can be utilized. Wireless router nodes can be placed randomly over a specified geographic area, or can be placed in a predetermined pattern. Alternately, wireless router nodes can be placed near respective sender nodes . Sender nodes  can move into or out of range of one or more wireless router nodes. Sender nodes  typically can dwell in the range of one or more router nodes long enough for transmission to be observed and the sources identified and recorded. For wireless sender nodes , the unique identifier can be based on the RF signature of the wireless sender node .","Referring to , there is a flow chart of a method  that can track routing of traffic on a network, such as network  of . The method  can include identifying traffic frequency emanating from code and\/or processor instructions executing on a network. The method can begin  by obtaining traffic flow data for the network  at one or more router nodes, as shown at nodes n-n in . It can be understood that other known means of obtaining traffic flow data can be used and the implementation of method  need not be restricted to the use of router nodes n-n. For example, one or more taps can be provided that can determine when a chunk starts and ends. Such taps can include physical connections to corresponding links  and circuitry to detect chunks of data on the links . As in the case of router nodes n-n, the taps can include transceivers for sensing the chunks of data and can also include other circuitry (e.g., clock circuitry) for determining times of arrival and duration of the chunks. The taps can include processors for computing other information associated with the chunks, such as information contained within a header of the chunk of data.","Using the traffic flow data, method  can track (), e.g., in a number of tracefiles, the time of arrival of packets at a router, or node , from the various sender nodes  seen by the router, with a sender node  having a corresponding tracefile. The tracefiles can be transformed () into a time-series. Those of skill in the art can appreciate that numerous methods can be employed to obtain a time-series from data, such as the traffic flow data in the above mentioned tracefile, including those described in detail in referenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/212,324. In one embodiment for representing the time of arrival of chunks, a time quantization can be chosen, time can be \u201cbinned\u201d and\/or separated\/grouped into time increments and\/or intervals at that quantization and a marker can be placed in the bins that contain a detected chunk. A non-uniform signal can be represented as a non-uniformly-spaced sequence of impulses. The impulses can indicate leading edges of the discrete events in the tracefile for a router node, such as node n in .","In tracking file routing where the ingress-egress frequencies of the data stream are not known, e.g., in tracking worms that may enter the network, the time-series from 206 can be parsed () into discrete processing time windows and\/or intervals of a predetermined duration, and\/or size. The window size can depend on the characteristics of the network  and can be chosen to ensure that a window can include sufficient data for processing. As an example, a window size can be taken as twice a round-trip time via a satellite link, 2*300 ms=600 ms. If a router node is on a 1 Gigabit\/second link, the window size translates to 600 Megabits of memory for the window. Method  can compute  the Lomb Periodogram for a given window and\/or source, and\/or sender node . As known in the art, the Lomb technique provides a spectral analysis technique specifically designed for non-uniformly sampled data. Inherently, packet arrival times in computer networks, such as network  can be unevenly spaced, resulting in a non-uniformly sampled natural signal encoding. As described in further detail in referenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/243,489, the Lomb technique can compute a periodogram by evaluating data only at the times for which a measurement is available.","Successive periodograms for the same source, or sender node , can be compared () with one another. Generally, the comparison can include obtaining a predetermined number (x) of strongest peaks of a periodogram, e.g., 10-100 peaks, and comparing them to the x strongest peaks of the previous periodogram. If a new peak is identified above a predetermined threshold, as determined at , it can be determined  if the identified peak occurred in one of a predetermined number of previous periodograms for the sender node. Generally, the number of previous periodograms can be chosen to provide an extended timeframe, e.g., in the range of seconds, during which the router can have experienced a full range of data types. As an example, the number of timeframes can depend on a network operator's requirements for false positives, with fewer false positives requiring the use of more timeframes. In one example, two timeframes can be used. In another example, the number of timeframes can be equal to the total available memory of the router node divided by the window size as described above.","If the identified peak has not occurred in one of the number of previous periodograms, the identified peak can be marked () for further analysis. If one or more marked peaks from other sender nodes , or from other routers in the network neighborhood have matching frequencies within nearby windows, as determined at , the matching frequency can be used to track the routing of the associated code on the network. Generally, a nearby window can be the two or three windows, or timeframes, previous to the window in which a marked peak was identified, though other numbers of windows can be contemplated. It can be understood that other methods can be used for identifying and\/or obtaining the frequency for traffic to be tracked, including historical data traffic analysis and\/or network simulations. Optionally, the frequency can be known, as determined at , such that the frequency can be configured , such as by a system administrator, or other system operator or person having configuration authority. In one embodiment, the frequencies for traffic to be tracked can be known based on virus protection data, such as data provided through anti-virus alerting services and\/or programs.","A band-limited signal can be generated  from the time-series determined at  by passing and\/or presenting the signal corresponding to the time-series to and\/or through a band-pass filter centered substantially about the frequency from 220 or 224. As is known, such a signal can capture the effect of the frequency from 220 or 224, though other frequencies may have more power in the band. As also known in the art, one can window the time-series to improve computational efficiency for passing the signal through the band-pass filter. In one embodiment, the band-pass filter windows can correspond with the periodogram windows. In one embodiment, the windows can be in a range of 500 ms. It can be understood that the periodogram and band-pass filter windows can be different and that different ranges of windows can be used.","A coherence, including for example, a normalized coherence, of and\/or between the band-limited signals corresponding to ingress and egress pairs of the routers can be determined . Those of skill in the art can appreciate that numerous methods can be employed to obtain coherence, including those described in detail in referenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/359,995. As described therein, one measure of link coherence can include the cross spectral density of the link signals, whose value can be mapped between 0 and 1. The coherence determined at  can be indicative of the path through the network  taken by the chunks corresponding to the frequency determined at , or configured at . A coherence value close to 1.0 can indicate a high probability that the chunks came into and went out of the associated router through the corresponding ingress and egress link pair.","In the disclosed methods and systems, it can be determined if additional windows and\/or ingress-egress pairs can be processed (), and if so, a band-limited signal can be generated  for the next window if additional windows remain to be processed, for the next ingress-egress link pair, if additional link pairs remain to be processed. When no additional windows or link pairs remain, a map or graph for the routing of the code generated traffic can be formed from the ingress and egress link pairs having coherence values above a predetermined threshold . The map or maps can be based on one or more windows, with successive maps indicating the spread of the code generated traffic through the network over time. The threshold can be configurable, with higher thresholds implying smaller numbers of false positives, but with higher numbers of missed detection. A lower coherence threshold can imply a higher number of false-positives, but fewer missed detections. The numbers of false positives and missed detections can also depend on the speed at which the file being tracked spreads through network  and on the number of nodes over which it spreads.","In one embodiment, the code generated traffic can be associated with unwanted communications. For example, a worm or virus can disrupt router node and\/or network operations and can be spread through a network, such as network . The map generated at  can be useful in determining which routers or nodes to isolate from the network to prevent further spread of the worm or virus. In one embodiment, a number of nodes having the highest coherence values can be isolated or quarantined, as indicated in phantom at . The number of nodes to be quarantined can be predetermined or the nodes to be quarantined can be selected based on the map.","Accordingly, the disclosed methods and system can provide for a continuous monitoring function that can obtain traffic flow data while the network is operable or active. Thus, for the  example embodiment, such method  can return to obtain additional data at  until monitoring is no longer desired, as determined at . Additionally, the  embodiment  can return to obtain data at  via , if no new peaks are determined at , or if the new peaks have occurred in previous periodograms, as determined at , or if no peaks with matching frequencies are determined at .","In addition, the techniques described herein can be implemented in hardware or software, or a combination thereof. The systems and methods can be implemented in one or more computer programs executing on one or more programmable computers, such as may be exemplified by nodes , among others, that include a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including volatile and\/or non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements), one or more input devices, and one or more output devices.","The computer programs, or programs, may be preferably implemented using one or more high level procedural or object-oriented programming languages to communicate with a computer system; however, the program(s) can be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. The language can be compiled or interpreted. By way of example only, the computer program(s) can be preferably stored on a computer readable medium, storage medium or device (e.g., CD-ROM, hard disk, or magnetic disk) readable by a general or special purpose programmable computer for configuring and operating the computer when the storage medium or device is read by the computer to perform the procedures described herein. The system can also be considered to be implemented as a computer-readable storage medium, configured with a computer program, where the storage medium so configured causes a computer to operate in a specific and predefined manner.","Unless otherwise stated, use of the word \u201csubstantially\u201d can be construed to include a precise relationship, condition, arrangement, orientation, and\/or other characteristic, and deviations thereof as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, to the extent that such deviations do not materially affect the disclosed methods and systems.","Throughout the entirety of the present disclosure, use of the articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d to modify a noun can be understood to be used for convenience and to include one, or more than one of the modified noun, unless otherwise specifically stated.","While the method and systems have been disclosed in connection with the preferred embodiments shown and described in detail, various modifications and improvements thereon will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art. As an example, those with ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the arrangement and connectivity of the components shown in the figures are merely for illustrative purposes, and can be varied accordingly and components may be combined or otherwise reconfigured without departing from the scope of the disclosed systems and methods.
