CCDs are based on a Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) technology where charge is transferred from one capacitive well to another thus requiring large capacitances and power. Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) imagers are a viable alternative to CCDs. CMOS technology is currently used in almost all of the microprocessors, integrated circuits and memory products. Taking advantage of the available CMOS tools of rapid simulation, testing and fabrication, lower cost, lower power, higher performance imagers can be developed. Photodiodes and phototransistors are common types of detectors used in CMOS imagers. However, they are limited in sensitivity.","Darlington phototransistors have also been recognized as photodetectors. A Darlington phototransistor is an integrated two-stage amplifier device that can obtain a larger current capacity than a typical phototransistor. In the usual Darlington phototransistor, the emitter of a typical phototransistor is connected directly to the base of another transistor that shares a common collector. The collector-emitter current of the one phototransistor is the base current for the second transistor. Thus, the light-induced current is effectively amplified by \u03b2. With known Darlington phototransistors, the second transistor can be driven into saturation with moderate levels of actuating light, which is beneficial over usual phototransistors. However, this is where the benefits of known Darlington phototransistor end.","Therefore, there exists a need in the art to provide a means to produce visible imaging devices that are cheaper, are readily simulated and tested, are lower power, and are more sensitive than existing devices. The present invention addresses such a need.","Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide a cheaper, readily simulated and tested, lower power, and more sensitive visible imaging device. This and other objects of the present invention are accomplished by coupling a phototransistor to a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT). This design provides a high sensitivity and a fast response by coupling the BJT to the phototransistor in a \u201cDarlington\u201d configuration to effectively increase the gain of the photocurrent. According to the present invention, the emitter of the phototransistor is connected to the base of a bipolar transistor. The emitter of the bipolar transistor is then connected to an integration capacitor, I. Therefore, with the present invention the photocurrent is effectively increased by 100 times. The emitter current of the phototransistor becomes the base current of the bipolar transistor. The \u03b2 value of q is around 100, thus the emitter current of bipolar transistor is 100 times the base current of bipolar transistor or the photocurrent.","This circuit is particularly well suited for the readily available CMOS and Bipolar Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (BiCMOS) processes prevalent today.","The present invention is based on a Darlington phototransistor that takes in incident light and converts it into electrical current so that is acts as a photodetector. The present invention is made of two main elements that serve as the photodetector. Here, a phototransistor is coupled to a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) in a Darlington configuration. This design provides a high sensitivity and a fast response by coupling the BJT to the phototransistor to effectively increase the gain of the photocurrent. This circuit is particularly well suited for the readily available CMOS and Bipolar Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (BiCMOS) processes prevalent today.","In the present invention, the Darlington phototransistors are sensors that produce a photocurrent that is proportional to the incident photons absorbed. Photons are absorbed in the base-emitter and the base collector areas thereby producing electron-hole pairs. The electron-hole pairs are then split apart by the electrical field present at the p-n junctions (depleting areas). The holes are then pulled into the p region and electrons into the n-type region. The action of the holes and electrons moving to their prospective n and p regions contribute to a base current. The collector current is determined by the expression:\n\nI=\u03b2I\n","Where Iis the collector current and Iis the base current. The \u03b2 value (also commonly referred to as hvalue) is determined by two factors: the width of the base region and the relative dopings of the emitter region and the base region. To achieve a high \u03b2 value (which is desirable in this case) the base should be thin and lightly doped while the emitter should be heavily doped. When using commercial foundry processes, there is no ability to control the various dopings and diffusions (these are controlled and defined by the foundry). However, it is possible to control the geometry of the base areas and emitter areas. For typical CMOS processes today, a \u03b2 value of 100 should be achievable. The emitter current can be derived by the following equations:\n\n(Kirchoff's current rule)\n\n\/\u03b2\n\n(1+1\/\u03b2)\n","Therefore for large values of \u03b2, Iis approximately equal to I.","In terms of photon-generated electrons (photocurrent), the bipolar Darlington phototransistor detector should generate one hundred electrons for every photon absorbed into the structure. Efforts were made to increase the sensitivity of phototransistors according to the present invention or to boost the photocurrent gain by building CMOS amplifiers to couple to these devices, however, this added complexity and power consumption to the pixel design. In the design of the present invention, the gain of the photocurrent is increased by a factor of 100 using a simple scheme that adds minimum complexity and power.","As shown in , the emitter of the phototransistor q is connected to the base of a second bipolar transistor q. The emitter of the second bipolar transistor is then connected to the integration capacitor, I. Therefore, with the present invention the photocurrent is effectively increased by 100 times. The emitter current of the phototransistor q becomes the base current of the bipolar transistor q. The \u03b2 value of q is around 100, thus the emitter current of q is 100 times the base current of q or the photocurrent.","A 30\u00d730 visible imaging array of Darlington phototransistors was made in accordance with the present invention.  shows a layout of the Darlington phototransistor unit pixel made. The unit pixel  includes a Darlington phototransistor coupled to an integration capacitor C. Metal  covers the whole array except areas where the phototransistor regions are. The light shield is necessary to prevent unwanted photoelectric effects. In the Darlington phototransistor design of the present invention, only the n well base and p implanted emitter are exposed to light. The layout of the Darlington phototransistor portion of the unit pixel is detailed in ","The visible imaging array of the present invention has been made using the AMI CMOS 1.2 um double poly, 2 metal, N well process. The chips were fabricated through the MOSIS foundry service, which is a Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) sponsored multiproject, shared cost fabrication service. The size of the array was 2.2 mm\u00d72.2 mm consisting mainly of the 30\u00d730 pixel circuitry, row and column shift registers, and output amplifier (All as shown in ). The function of the row and column shift registers (PhiReset to Phi)is to take the signal response from all the pixels and serially shift them out onto one output.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["b ","a ","a ","a"],"b":["3","3"]},"The substrate  is p-type material, which will act as the collector. The n-well diffusion region  is created to make the base. To make the emitter , a p-type diffusion is implanted inside the n-well . The n-well base  surrounds the p-implanted emitter . The base  of the phototransistor is left floating or in other words is not tied to a voltage bias. The collector, which is the substrate of the present invention, is tied to the ground.

C and C act as the integration. After a certain integration period, where the Darlington phototransistor is allowed to charge up C and C, the charge is sampled and held or transferred onto the hold capacitor C. Asserting Phi low momentarily does this. Phi is normally high or in other words MOSFET m is normally open. Once the charge has been transferred to the hold capacitor, PhiReset is strobed low thus resetting the integration capacitor C and C to Vdd. At this point, C and C can start integrating again, and at the same time the charge on the hold capacitor of each pixel can be read out. MOSFETs M and M (See ) in the unit pixel design makes up the source follower amplifier that prevents the parasitic capacitances of the column bus to load down the Darlington phototransistor circuitry. As shown in , the emitter of the phototransistor is connected to the base of Q.","The second mode of operation that is available with the present invention is the extended charge handling capability. This is done using the switched capacitor scheme. C, C and C along with MOSFET M, M and M (See ) in the pixel makes up the switched capacitor circuit. The idea behind the switched capacitor circuit is that the signal from the photodarlington detector is sampled linearly over several subframes while the detector noise adds as the square root. A portion of each sub-frame is sampled and stored on the hold capacitor C, then the remaining portion is reset and a new subframe is begun. The switched capacitor approach will effectively allow for an increase in the charge handling capability by improving the signal to noise ratio (i.e. the signal adds linearly while the noise adds as the square root.)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["2","2"]}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and other objects of the invention will become readily apparent in light of the Detailed Description Of The Invention and the attached drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","a ","a"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
