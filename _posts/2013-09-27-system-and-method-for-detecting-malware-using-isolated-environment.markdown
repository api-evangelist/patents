title: System and method for detecting malware using isolated environment
abstract: Disclosed system and methods for detecting malicious applications. The system provides a library of handler functions. The handlers functions control access of one or more applications to protected resources on a user device. The system also modifies the one or more applications to access the library of handler functions instead of corresponding application program interface (API) functions of the user device. The handler functions receive API function calls from a modified application. The system analyzes the received API function calls for malicious behavior characteristics. When the API function calls do not exhibit malicious behavior characteristics, the handler functions perform the API function calls to the protected resources. When the API function calls exhibit malicious behavior characteristics, the system prevents access of the modified application to the protected resources.

The most popular of these are telephones, smartphones, notebooks, tablets and navigation systems. Mobile devices are primarily used for communication and entertainment. In parallel with the development of these devices, new wireless communication systems, networks and protocols are also being developed. The transmission of data from one device to another and the exchange of information are tasks that even an inexperienced users can perform without difficulty. But the development of new technologies brings not only benefits, but also creates problems.","On one hand, the development of mobile devices and wireless communication systems simplifies human interaction facilitates exchange of information, and erases geographical boundaries. On the other hand, new technologies create new security problems. The ease of copying and exchanging of information causes leaks, whether deliberate or accidental, of confidential personal or business information from organization networks. Therefore, information security specialists responsible for administration of information security infrastructure need to extra vigilant in protecting corporate IT systems in order prevent information leaks and various security breaches.","In addition, the growth in popularity of mobile platforms, such as Android and iOS, is attracting the attention of hackers who have various goals\u2014from a desire to play jokes or show off, to the theft of confidential information for the purpose of extortion and blackmail. As a result of this, computer threats, such as viruses, worms and other types of malware, which were previously characteristic of desktop computers are beginning to appear on mobile platforms as well. New threats unique to mobile devices are also appearing, such as Trojan horses, which after being installed on a mobile device, send SMS messages to telephone numbers or use geolocation services to track the movements of the device user.","Therefore, there is a need for a security system to protect mobile devices from malware, information leaks, unauthorized access and other security threats.","Disclosed system, method and computer program product for protecting computer resources from leaks and unauthorized access. In one aspect of the invention, a protection system includes an isolated environment, such as a container, into which one or more applications that seek access to protected system resources on a user device may be placed. The system also provides a library of handler functions. The handlers functions control access of one or more applications to the protected resources. The system also modifies the one or more applications to access the library of handler functions instead of corresponding application program interface (API) functions of the user device. The handler functions receive API function calls from a modified application. The system analyzes the received API function calls for malicious behavior characteristics. When the API function calls do not exhibit malicious behavior characteristics, the handler functions perform the API function calls to the protected resources. When the API function calls exhibit malicious behavior characteristics, the system prevents access of the modified application to the protected resources.","In one example aspect, one or more actions preventing access of the application to the protected resources include blocking API function calls from the application, terminating execution of the application or sending a warning notification to a user.","In one example aspect, modifying an application includes replacing one or more classes or methods of the application that perform API function calls to the protected resources with one or more function calls to corresponding handler functions contained in the library. In another aspect, replacing one or more classes or methods of the application includes replacing one or more classes or methods contained in an application file having *.dex extension.","In one example aspect, placing a plurality of applications into the container and associating the same security policy with all applications in the container.","In one example aspect, the protected system resources include one or more of network resources, file system, operating system, and other applications or programs.","The above simplified summary of example aspects serves to provide a basic understanding of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description of the invention that follows. To the accomplishment of the foregoing, the one or more aspects of the invention include the features described and particularly pointed out in the claims.","Example aspects of the present invention are described herein in the context of system, method and computer program product for protecting computer resources from leaks and unauthorized access. Those of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the following description is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. Other aspects will readily suggest themselves to those skilled in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. Reference will now be made in detail to implementations of the example aspects as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The same reference indicators will be used to the extent possible throughout the drawings and the following description to refer to the same or like items.","In order to provide security for a user device, such as mobile device, it is desirable to oversee all of the data being transmitted from the device, keep track of data arriving at the device, and keep track of events on devices and the data with which these devices are working. A mobile device is generally under the control of a mobile operating system (OS). The most popular mobile OS being Google Android, Apple iOS, Symbian, BlackBerry OS and Windows Phone. The applications which can be installed on the devices have access to the resources of the mobile device and to the communication ports via interfaces that are provided by the OS. The resources of a mobile device include those means of data processing system, of the device that can be assigned to data processing for a particular unit of time. The primary resources of the data processing system are the processors, RAM, sets of data and networking and peripheral devices. The interface provided by the OS to interact with the resources of the device may be realized as application programming interface (API) functions. In this way, the application can perform operations with files, interact with memory, network, peripherals, etc. One of the ways of monitoring and controlling access of applications to the critical (i.e., protected) resources of a mobile device is to modify the code of the application that calls critical API functions. Hereinafter, the term critical refers to functions and resources that should be protected from unauthorized access certain system files and network ports).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B"],"b":["101","102","103","101","104","102"],"i":["a ","a "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["102","102","101","201","102","201","101","202","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["102","102","202","101","301","301","101","201","301","104","101","101","301","102","201","301","101","202","101","104","101","202","104","102","101","101","101"],"i":["b ","b ","b","b ","b ","b ","a ","b "]},"In one example aspect, a group of two or more applications may be placed in the same container .

The modification may be done at the stage of loading the application, or the copy of an already installed application may be modified. If a critical action is attempted, the application will not be able to perform it, since the original class has been replaced by the class described in the library . Therefore, the corresponding method will first be called from the library  and a check will be done for compliance of the action being performed with the security policy.

An application cannot directly call critical functions, the calls to the critical functions are performed by handler functions. The library  transmits to the analysis module  information about the functions being called (e.g., the names of functions and the parameters of the calls), and the analysis module  may compare the information obtained from the library  with malware templates from the local database . If on the basis of the analysis by the analysis module , behaviour characteristic of malicious software is detected, the system  may take appropriate actions in accordance with the security policies specified in the database . For example, the library of handler functions  may block calls to the critical functions (i.e., the library does not call the original API function in the OS ), the application will be halted or dosed, the user may receive a warning message, etc. in one aspect, the analysis module , library  and local database  may updated from the security server , which enables a timely response to new threats (e.g., expanding the list of critical functions, adding new malware templates and security rules to the local database ).","In one example aspect, the analysis module  may not use the local database , but instead may access a remote database  on the security server . In another aspect, the analysis module  itself can reside remotely on the security server . In this case, the library  on the local device will gather information about the operation of the application being analyzed and forward this information to the remote security server , where the information received will be analyzed by the remote analysis module , in another aspect, the security module  and local database  can be integrated with the library .","The described system for the detection of malicious software may be used, for example, to intercept attempts by malicious applications to send text messages. In this case, the following methods (i.e., functions) may be critical to the operation of the application:","android.telephony.gsm.SmsManager.sendTextMessage( )","android.telephony.gsm.SmsManager.sendMultipartTextMessage( )","android.telephony.gsm.SmsManager.sendDataMessage( )","android.telephony.SmsManager.sendTextMessage( )","android.telephony.SmsManager.sendMultipartTextMessage( )","android.telephony.SmsManager.sendDataMessage( )","java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke( )","To control access of the application  to these methods, the application calls to the above-listed methods may be modified. After placing the application  in the container , the critical methods may be replaced in the application. For example, the method:","android.telephony.SmsManager.getDefault( ).sendTextMessage(\u201c<phone_number>\u201d, null, \u201c<message_text>\u201d, null, null);","may be replaced with the call to the following method:","com.kaspersky.container.hooks.android_telephony_SmsManager.sendTextMessage (android.telephony.SmsManager.getDefault( ), \u201c<phone_number>\u201d, null, \u201c<message_text>\u201d, null;
