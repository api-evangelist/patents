title: Method and system for managing access to media files
abstract: Access to selected content in different file formats can be managed by conducting, in a single purchase transaction, a user purchase of access rights that allow a user to acquire multiple copies of the same selected content in media files having different file formats. An authorization signal is communicated to a content provider or multiple content providers who did not conduct the purchase transaction. The authorization signal contains information that allows the content provider or the multiple content providers to authorize the user to acquire multiple copies of the same selected content in different file formats without requiring the user to conduct multiple transactions. Each copy of the selected content acquired from a content provider is in a media file having a different file format.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/832,090, filed Apr. 26, 2004, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","The widespread use of the Internet has greatly enhanced the way users acquire and use electronic media. There are now many different types of media players that allow users to locate, obtain, and play media files that contain music, movies, computer programs, pictures, games, and other content. For instance, a user may search for a particular song at the Apple Music Store, which is found at http:\/\/www.applemusic.com, and purchase rights that allow the user to download a media file containing the song. Once the user obtains the media file, the user may play the song on a compatible media player application, such as the iTunes\u00ae player by Apple of Cupertino, Calif. Other media player applications that allow users to purchase and play media files include the RealOne\u2122 player by RealNetworks, Inc., of Seattle, Wash.; and the Windows Media Player\u2122 by Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash.","While existing systems have enhanced the way users acquire and use media, existing systems present some limitations. One limitation is caused by the fact that specific media player applications are limited to certain types of file formats. For instance, if a user obtains a media file in a Windows\u00ae media format, e.g., a .WMA file, for use in the Windows Media Player\u2122, the obtained media file may be incompatible with other media players, such as the RealOne\u2122 player or the iTunes\u00ae player. Although it is possible for a user to convert an original media file having a Windows\u00ae media format into a format that is compatible with another player, such a remedy is not always desirable because the conversion process causes some degradation in the quality of the recording.","The above-described limitation caused by incompatible file formats is more apparent when existing media players are required to manage rights to a copyright-protected work contained in a media file. For instance, if a user purchases a copyright-protected audio file from the Apple Music Store, the user receives the audio file in a particular format, such as Apple's new AAC format. Copyright protection of the content contained in the audio file is preserved since the proprietary AAC format cannot be played by other media players. In addition, the compatible media player application, the iTunes\u00ae player, limits the number of copies that can be produced from the original media file. Thus, if the user would like to play the purchased song on another media player application, such as the Windows Media Player\u2122, the user would have to purchase rights to the same song from another provider having an audio file format that is compatible with the Windows Media Player\u2122. Although it may be possible for the user to convert the AAC file to another format suitable for another media player, the quality of the converted audio file would be subject to some degradation. In addition, conversion of an AAC file to another file format may violate one or more copyrights that apply to the purchased file. As a result of the above-described limitations, consumers of copyright-protected media files may not have the ability to utilize more than one media player application for certain media files. In addition, users may be forced to purchase multiple copies of a song if they wish to utilize more than one media player application.","Accordingly, the prior art is lacking an effective method and system for efficient distribution and management of media files. In addition, the prior art is lacking an effective method and system for managing access rights to copyrighted works contained in media files.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","System and methods are provided for managing access rights to media files communicated over a network. In accordance with at least one embodiment, a system method are configured to manage user access rights to works, also referred to herein as \u201ccontent,\u201d that are contained in media files and typically subject to copyright. Instead of providing access to a single media file having a particular format, purchasers of content are authorized to acquire a number of different media files having different file formats for the same content without requiring the purchaser to pay multiple times for the copies of the content. By providing controlled access to content stored in multiple file formats, users may readily acquire media files that can be played on a number of desired media player applications. Many other benefits, such as an improved consumer pricing arrangement, may also result from such management of access rights for content.","In at least one embodiment, a user may purchase rights to access media files of selected content that may include, for example, a song, album, movie, etc. Once the user purchases rights to access media files of the selected content, information that identifies the user and information that describes the selected content is communicated to one or more content providers. The information may be in the form of a token that signifies the user's right to access the selected content. By receiving this information, each content provider can verify that the user is authorized to access a number of files that contain the selected content. The user may then directly contact any one of the content providers to acquire media files that contain the selected content. A user's right to access the media files with the selected content may be communicated to the content providers at the time of the user's purchase transaction or at a later time, e.g., when a user contacts a particular content provider and requests access to the media files. In other embodiments, a content provider may allow a user to access media files as a result of an authorization signal sent in response to an authorization request. Access to a media file may include, but is not limited to, downloading an actual media file containing the selected content, accessing a non-recordable data stream containing the work, accessing a recordable data stream containing the work, etc.","As a result, the user's access to the selected content is not limited to a single proprietary file format merely because one content provider is limited to such a file format. Embodiments described herein allow users to obtain the selected content in more than one file format by accessing different media files, possibly from different content providers, containing the content. Among many other benefits, access to different content providers allows users to readily access a number of different formats of media files containing the selected content without requiring users to pay multiple times for copies of the same content. Thus, users do not incur an increased cost simply because they desire to play the selected content on a number of different media players.","Thus, according to an embodiment, provided herein is a computer-implemented method for managing access to selected content that is stored in electronic media files having different file formats. The method is performed under control of instructions that are executed by one or more computer processors in a computing system and includes conducting, in a single purchase transaction, a user purchase of access rights that allow a user to acquire multiple copies of the same selected content in media files having different file formats. The method further includes communicating an authorization signal to a content provider server of a content provider who did not conduct the purchase transaction. The authorization signal contains information that allows the content provider to authorize the user to acquire, from the content provider server, multiple copies of the same selected content without requiring the user to conduct multiple transactions to purchase access rights for the multiple copies of the selected content. Each copy of the selected content acquired from the content provider server is in a media file having a different file format.","Prior to communicating the authorization signal, an authorization request may be received. The authorization signal may be communicated to the content provider server in response to receiving the authorization request. The authorization request may identify the user and the selected content.","In at least one embodiment, the authorization request is received from a content provider. In an alternative embodiment, the authorization request is received from a media player application executing on a client computer associated with the user. In regard to the latter, the method may further comprise identifying the content provider as having the selected content in a media file format that is compatible with the media player application and communicating the authorization signal to the identified content provider.","Also described herein is a tangible computer-readable medium having computer-executable instructions stored thereon for managing access to selected content stored in different file formats. The instructions, if executed, cause a computing device to conduct, in a single purchase transaction, a user purchase of access rights that allow a user to acquire multiple copies of the same selected content in media files having different file formats. The instructions further cause the computing device to communicate an authorization signal to a content provider server of a content provider who did not conduct the purchase transaction, wherein the authorization signal contains information that allows the content provider to authorize the user to acquire, from the content provider server, multiple copies of the same selected content without requiring the user to conduct multiple transactions to purchase access rights for the multiple copies of the selected content. Each copy of the selected content acquired from the content provider server is in a media file having a different file format.","The instructions, if executed, may further cause the computing device to store transaction information associated with the user purchase in a memory; receive an authorization request from the content provider; and, in response to receiving the authorization request, retrieve the transaction information from the memory; determine whether the user is authorized to access the selected content based on the transaction information; and communicate the authorization signal to the content provider server.","The authorization request may contain data identifying the user and the instructions, if executed, may cause the computing device to use the data in the authorization request when determining whether the user is authorized to access the selected content.","Further described herein is another computer-implemented method for managing access to selected content that is stored in electronic media files having different file formats. The method includes conducting, in a single purchase transaction, a user purchase of access rights that allow a user to acquire multiple copies of the same selected content in media files having different file formats. The method further includes communicating an authorization signal to multiple content provider servers of multiple content providers who did not conduct the purchase transaction, wherein the authorization signal contains information that allows each of the multiple content providers to authorize the user to acquire, from at least one of the content provider servers, a copy of at least one media file containing the same selected content without requiring the user to conduct multiple transactions to purchase access rights for each copy of the selected content. Each copy of the selected content acquired from a content provider server is in a media file having a different file format.","Prior to communicating the authorization signal, an authorization request may be received and the authorization signal is communicated to the multiple content provider servers in response to receiving the authorization request.","The authorization request may identify the user and the selected content. In at least one embodiment, the authorization request is received from a content provider. Alternatively, the authorization request is received from a media player application executing on a client computer associated with the user. The authorization signal may be communicated to at least one content provider server storing the selected content in a media file format that is compatible with the media player application.","According to yet another embodiment, a computer system for managing access to selected content stored in electronic media files having different file formats comprises a transaction information database and a merchant server operated by a merchant in communication with the transaction information database. The merchant server is configured to conduct, in a single purchase transaction, a user purchase of access rights that allow a user to acquire more than one copy of the same selected content from more than one content provider, each acquired copy of the selected content being in a different file format, such that the user is not required to conduct multiple transactions to purchase access rights for each of the copies of the selected content in the different file formats. The merchant server is further configured to communicate an authorization signal to a plurality of content provider servers operated by content providers who did not conduct the purchase transaction, wherein the authorization signal contains information that allows each of the content providers to authorize the user to acquire, from at least one of the content provider servers, a copy of at least one media file containing the same selected content, wherein each copy of the selected content acquired from a content provider server is in a media file having a different file format. The content providers are each different than the merchant and the merchant does not operate the plurality of content provider servers.","The merchant server may be further configured to receive an authorization request for user access to a media file containing the selected content; evaluate transaction information in the transaction information database to determine whether the user is authorized to access the media file containing the selected content; and communicate the authorization signal to the plurality of content provider servers in response to determining that the user is authorized to access the media file.","The following description provides an enabling description of a system, method and computer-readable medium for managing access to media files communicated over a network such as the Internet. The following description first provides an overview of a computing environment in which the present invention may be implemented. Following that, a description of a rights management routine is described and shown in accompanying flow diagrams. The illustrative examples described herein are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Similarly, any process steps described herein may be interchangeable with other steps or several combinations of steps in order to achieve the same result.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["106","103","104","104","104","104","101","106","100","103","105","104","104","104","104","102","102","102","102"]},"Each content provider may store media files containing copyright-protected works in content databases A, B, C, and D and distribute those media files in specific formats. For instance, if the first content provider server provider A is Microsoft, the media files stored in its respective content database A may include media files in Microsoft's WMA format. Similarly, if the second content provider B is RealNetworks, the media files stored in its respective content database B may include media files in RealNetworks' RA or RM format.","As described in more detail below, the user  may use the client computer  to purchase rights to access and\/or obtain selected content and other products listed in a product database  maintained by the merchant . Purchase transaction information is stored in a transaction information database E of the merchant server . The transaction information, or a portion or representation thereof, is also communicated to one or more of the content providers A, B, C, and D and stored in a number of respective transaction information databases A, B, C, and D. The user may then contact the respective content provider(s) A, B, C, and D to obtain access to the media files containing the selected content. Using the information stored in the transaction information databases A, B, C, and D, each content provider can determine if the user  has rights to access particular media files stored in the content databases A, B, C, and D.","The client computer and the servers, depicted in , are configured to electronically communicate via the network . The network  may be a LAN or a larger network, such as a wide area network (WAN) or the Internet. The computing environment shown in  may be configured to communicate media files, Web page documents, commands, and data between the client computer and the servers. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art and others, the computer systems shown in  provide a simplified example of one suitable environment for implementing the present invention. The present invention is not limited to this particular form of implementation.","When software formed in accordance with this invention is implemented in computer systems of the type illustrated in , the invention provides a way for users to purchase, download, and play media files. For instance, a user can purchase rights to access media files of selected content, which may include a song, album, movie, etc. Once the user purchases rights to access media files containing the selected content, information that identifies the user and the selected content is communicated to a plurality of content providers. By using the information that identifies the user and the selected content, each content provider can readily determine if the user is authorized to access the media files that contain the selected content. The user may directly contact any one of the service providers to access the media files that contain the selected content.","As a result of the above-described process, the user's access to the selected content is not limited to a single file format, even if an individual content provider distributes the selected content in a proprietary file format. If the user desires an alternative file format for use with another media player application, the user simply contacts another service provider to access a media file in the desired format. Among many other benefits, access to different content providers allows users to readily access a number of different formats of media files containing the selected content without requiring the user to pay multiple times for multiple copies of the same work. Thus, the user does not incur an increased cost simply because he or she desires to play, view, or execute the selected content on a number of different media players.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["103","103","103","101","160","160","103"]},"The server  also includes a processing unit , a video display adapter , and memory , all communicatively connected together and to the network interface  by a bus . The memory  generally comprises RAM, ROM, and\/or permanent memory, such as a hard disk drive, tape drive, optical drive, floppy disk drive, or combination thereof. The memory  stores an operating system  for controlling the operation of the server . As is known to those of ordinary skill in the art, the operating system may be formed by a general-purpose server operating system such as a Microsoft server operating system, UNIX or LINUX\u2122. A binary input\/output system (\u201cBIOS\u201d)  for controlling the low-level operation of server  is also stored in the memory .","The memory  additionally stores the program code and data for providing network services that allow users to request, receive, and view information and data files stored at the server . Accordingly, the memory  may store a Web server application , which may be provided by any one of a number of commercially available software packages. The Web server application  comprises computer executable instructions that, when executed by the processing unit , generate configurable markup documents, such as the sample Web page shown in , which is described in more detail below. The Web server application  may be configured to communicate with a commercially available database application  and a control application  to facilitate various functions of the present invention, as described below.","The server  may further include an input\/output interface  connected to the bus  for communicating with external devices, such as a mouse, keyboard, scanner, or other input devices not shown in . Likewise, the server  may include additional mass storage facilities, such as CD-ROM\/DVD-ROM drive  and large capacity mass memory , such as a hard disk drive, tape drive, optical disk drive, or combination thereof, also connected to the bus . The server  may utilize the mass memory  to store several databases. In one embodiment, the mass memory  of the server  contains a transaction information database E, which stores information that identifies different users. The transaction information database E also stores information that identifies content, such as a specific songs, albums, movies, etc., purchased by each user. As described in more detail below, information stored in the transaction information database E of the server  is communicated for storage in other transaction information databases A, B, C, and D.","The content provider servers A, B, C, and D shown in  may take the form of any suitable computer architecture, such as the computer architecture illustrated in , if appropriate. The content provider servers A, B, C, and D may each include a network interface for communicating with other computing devices via the network . The network interface may be configured for use with any wired or wireless network connection, and may be used with any suitable communication protocol, such as the TCP\/IP protocol. In general, each of the content provider servers A, B, C, and D includes a processing unit, a display, and a memory unit. The memory unit stores the program code necessary for operating a Web site and for providing access to media files stored in a memory device. In the particular embodiment described thus far, the memory unit of each content provider server A, B, C, and D may include the content databases A, B, C, and D for storing the media files, and the transaction information databases A, B, C, and D for storing transaction and user information received from the server .","The client computer  shown in  may take the form of any one of a number of different computer products. For example, the client computer  may include aspects of the computer architecture illustrated in , if appropriate. The client computer  may include a network interface for providing communication with the network . The network interface may be configured for use with any wired or wireless network connection and may be used with any suitable communication protocol, such as the TCP\/IP protocol. In general, the client computer  includes a processing unit, a display, and a memory unit. The memory unit of the client computer  stores the program code necessary for operating the client computer . The memory unit of the client computer  may also store an application for browsing Web pages, such as Microsoft's Internet Explorer\u00ae Web browser.","The above-described computer systems store software programs that, when executed, implement aspects of the present invention. For illustrative purposes, the following describes an embodiment of the present invention that allows a user to access media files containing purchased content. In this example, the user purchases rights from a merchant. In turn, the merchant communicates information to one or more content providers enabling them to independently authorize access of at least one media file containing the selected content to the user. The user then accesses media files containing the selected content from one or more content providers. Although the illustrative example described herein depicts a Web-based implementation, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the scope of the invention may include other implementations regardless of the configuration, size, or form of the computing system.","Referring now to the flow diagram of , the sequence diagram of , and the pictorial diagram of , one exemplary embodiment of a media rights management routine  will now be described. The media rights management routine  begins at block  where the routine communicates a transaction Web page that enables a user to purchase rights to access media content. Generally described, the transaction Web page facilitates the communication of media information from a server  to a client , which allows the user to identify media content to be purchased. The transaction Web page also allows the user to select desired content and transact a purchase of the selected content with a merchant. It should be understood that a purchase transaction in the context of the present invention is not limited to transactions involving monetary transfer, but may involve any form of interaction in which access rights to selected media content are granted to a user.","For illustrative purposes, a sample transaction Web page  for use in the process of block  is shown in . The sample transaction Web page  comprises a first text field , which provides an overview of the content that is offered for sale. In this example, the first text field  generally describes the media content as \u201cMusic by Blur.\u201d The sample transaction Web page  also comprises a second text field , which provides a detailed description of the media content. In this example, the second text field  includes a list of songs. The list of songs describes each song's track name, artist, album, and genre. Although this illustration shows one example where specific types of information are used to describe the content offered for sale, other types of information suitable for describing the content falls within the scope of the present invention. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the information describing the media content may come from a database associated with the merchant, such as the product database  shown in .","The sample transaction Web page  also comprises control features that allow users to select and purchase rights to access selected content. In this example, the control features include a set of selection buttons  that allows users to select desired content and a control button  that allows users to complete a purchase transaction. User actuation of the control button  causes transaction information, which may include one or more items such as a purchase order describing the user and the selected content, to be communicated from the client  to the server . In one embodiment, the transaction information is arranged as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that the client  generates and transmits to the server . In other embodiments, the transaction information may be arranged and transmitted differently. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, a control application  of the merchant server  in  may operate in conjunction with existing electronic commerce software applications to implement the control features that complete the purchase transaction between the user and the merchant.","The transaction Web page  may also include other features. For instance, the transaction Web page may be configured with program code that allows users to conduct a keyword search for desired content. The transaction Web page may also be configured with other electronic commerce-related features, such as a login feature and a shopping cart feature. In one embodiment, a standard local login feature may be used (e.g., in which a user enters a user name and password that is checked against a local database of authorized users). Alternatively, a login feature of the transaction Web page may utilize one or more commercially-available universal login services, such as Microsoft's .Net Passport\u00ae service.","Returning to , the rights management routine  continues at block  where the client  communicates the transaction information to the server . In one embodiment, the transaction information identifies the selected content purchased by the user. For example, if the selected content includes a song, the transaction information may include general media information, such as the song's title, artist, album, genre, etc. Specifically referring to the example shown in , the selected content is the first song on the list, which is entitled \u201cTender.\u201d Thus, in this example, the transaction information may include: TRACK NAME=Tender; ARTIST=Blur; ALBUM=13; GENRE=ROCK\/POP. Alternatively or in addition to the general media information, the transaction information may include a unique identifier associated with the selected content, such as a Universal Product Code (UPC) or the like.","In addition to information that identifies the selected content, the transaction information may also identify the user. In such an embodiment, a proprietary or public user identification code, such as one produced by Microsoft's .Net Passport\u00ae service, may be used. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the process of block  may be implemented by any known communication method, such as those employing URLs to communicate transaction information from a client to a server. Although this description illustrates one specific example of a Web-based implementation of a purchase transaction, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that implementations of the present invention may include other suitable systems configured to transact a purchase and sale between a user and a merchant.","Continuing at block , the rights management routine  stores the transaction information in a database associated with the merchant, such as the transaction information database E of . In one embodiment, the transaction information may be stored in a plurality of database records, where each database record identifies the user and the selected content purchased by the user. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, existing database programs may be used for implementing the process of block .","As shown in block , the rights management routine  communicates transaction information to a number of content provider servers. More specifically, transaction information is communicated from the merchant server  to one or more of the content provider servers A, B, C, and D. The transaction information communicated in block  includes a sufficient amount of information to allow each content provider server A, B, C, and D to determine if the user has obtained valid rights to access the selected content (e.g., by purchasing the selected content) that may be contained in media files stored in a local database of each content provider, such as the content databases A, B, C, and D. In one embodiment, the merchant server  may communicate transaction information that identifies the user and the selected content purchased by the user. The transaction information may be in the form of a token that uniquely identifies the user in the system, but includes measures to protect the privacy of the user. The process of block  may utilize any suitable method for communicating data between two computers, which may involve secured or encrypted data communications. The transaction information may be communicated to content providers at the time the user obtained valid rights to access the selected content (e.g., at the time of purchase) or at a later time (e.g., when the user contacts a particular content provider and requests access to the selected content).","In an example where a user has previously established one or more accounts with content providers A, B, C, and D, the user may log into the merchant server  and instruct the server  to associate those content providers with the user's purchase of content from the merchant . In one possible embodiment, the user may associate content providers in the server  by providing the merchant  the user's account name and password for each of the desired content providers. This information is communicated to the server  in a secure data communications link. In another embodiment, the user may simply provide an account name (or other account identification) for the desired content provider(s) that the server  may reference when communicating transaction information to the content providers. In yet another embodiment, user identification and authentication provided by a globally-recognized login service (such as Microsoft's .Net Passport\u00ae service) may be used. The user may further log into the server , as desired, to add or delete a content provider from their account with the merchant .","When the merchant  notifies the content providers listed in the user's account of the user's right to access media files containing particular content, the merchant server  sends a message (preferably via a secure data communications link) that contains the user's account name and password or some agreed representation thereof to the particular content provider, along with information identifying the content that the user is authorized to access. Using standard data communications protocols, each of the content providers receiving this message from the merchant  can recognize indicia in the transmission indicating the merchant server  as the source of the message. This indicia provides additional security confirming the authenticity of the merchant's message. As described below, each of the content providers receives the transaction information (or other authorization signal) from the merchant  and honors it by permitting the user to access the content in the content provider's server.","Alternatively, the merchant  may provide an application programming interface (API) that the content providers A, B, C, and D may use to enable their customers to log into the merchant server  from the content provider's Web site or client media player. Preferably, the login provided by the API would be a secure, Web-based service provided by the merchant server  so that communication of the user's identification and password with the merchant server  is hidden from the content providers. Once a user is logged into the merchant server , and information provided regarding the particular content provider A, B, C, or D, the merchant server  returns a token to the content provider which the merchant  and the content provider agree to represent the particular user. From then on, if the user purchases selected content from the merchant , the merchant server  communicates the user's unique token, along with an indication of the purchased content.","The transaction information may be communicated to each content provider server in response to an event or on a regular timed basis. For instance, the transaction information collected by the merchant server  may be periodically transmitted to each content provider server in response to the receipt of a control signal generated by a database synchronization program, timing program, etc. In an alternative embodiment, instead of communicating transaction information, the merchant  may communicate an authorization signal to one or more content provider servers allowing access to media files in the content provider's servers. Details of such an alternative embodiment are described below in regard to .","After the processing of block , the rights management routine  continues at block  where each content provider server A, B, C, and D stores the received transaction information. In the process of block , the received transaction information may be stored in a number of local databases associated with each content provider, such as the transaction information databases A, B, C, and D shown in . As a result of the process of block , the transaction information databases A, B, C, and D of each respective content provider A, B, C, and D, may have all or less than all of the media and user information stored in the transaction information database E of the merchant. Storage of the transaction information enables each content provider server to independently determine if individual users of the system have access rights to its stored content. After the processing of blocks -, the user may directly contact the content providers to access media files containing the user's selected content.","Next, as shown in block , the user communicates a request to access a media file containing the selected content. In the process of block , the access request is sent from the client  to a server of an individual content provider, such as a server A, B, C, or D. A user may communicate an access request by using a commercially-available software application, such as a Web browser application or a media player application. The user may send the access request to a particular content provider that provides media files in a desired media format. For example, as shown in the sample of sequence diagram of , if a user desires to play his or her purchased media content on an iTunes\u00ae media player, the user may send the access request to the third content provider server C to access a media file having a compatible media format, such as Apple's AAC format. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a media player, such as the iTunes\u00ae media player, may be configured with program instructions that allow a user to log into a content provider and communicate an access request for selected content. Media players may also be configured to work with a universal login service, such as Microsoft's .Net Passport\u00ae service, to communicate an access request to a content provider. In one embodiment, the access request may contain information that identifies the user and the content requested by the user. Since the third content provider C has received transaction information from the merchant server , the third content provider C can readily determine if the user has obtained valid rights to access one or more media files containing the content described in the access request.","In response to receiving the access request, the routine continues at block  where the content provider server authorizes the access request. In the present example, the content provider server C determines if the access request contains information that corresponds with relevant transaction information stored in the transaction information database C. If the relevant transaction information indicates that the user identified in the access request has obtained rights to access the content identified in the access request, the access request is authorized.","Once the access request has been authorized, the rights management routine  continues to block  where the content provider server (in this example, the third content provider server C) provides access to a media file containing the selected content. In accordance with the present invention, access to a media file may include, but is not limited to, downloading an actual media file containing the selected content, accessing a non-recordable data stream containing the work, accessing a recordable data stream containing the work, etc. The format of the media file should be a file format that is compatible with the media player desired by the user. In this part of the process, the media file may be delivered by one of a number of known methods for downloading or streaming a media file. In addition, the media file may be communicated by the use of any known file transfer protocol. Additional disclosure of methods for communicating media and product information between client and server computers is included in U.S. Pat. No. 7,117,167, titled \u201cSYSTEMS, METHODS, AND COMPUTER-READABLE MEDIA FOR CONTROLLING DELIVERY OF DIGITAL PRODUCTS TO USERS,\u201d filed Mar. 22, 2001, and issued Oct. 3, 2006, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","Also shown in the subsequent process blocks - of , additional media files stored at other content providers can be accessed by the user. Thus, even after the user has accessed a first media file containing the selected content, the user may send an additional access request to another content provider to access other media files containing the selected content. This type of request may be invoked if the user desires a media file having a different format. For example, with reference to the example shown in , the user may contact the first content provider A if the user desires media files that are compatible with a Microsoft media player; the second content provider B if the user desires media files that are compatible with a Real media player; or the fourth content provider D if the user desires media files in more generic formats.","As shown in process block  of , a subsequent access request may be communicated from the client  to one or more content provider servers A, B, C, or D. Similar to the first access request (block ) communicated to provider server A, the subsequent access request  may be invoked by a commercially available software application, such as a Web browser application or a media player application. As shown in process blocks  and , the content provider servers respond to the receipt of the subsequent access request by authorizing the request and providing access to one or more media files containing the requested content. Process blocks  and  may be executed in a manner similar to the above-described processes of blocks  and . Upon the completion of the process of block , the rights management routine  terminates.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":"300"},"In this alternative embodiment, the process of transacting a purchase of access rights to selected content may be carried out in a manner as described above. Thus, the communication of media information () and transaction information () are carried out in a manner similar to the above-described processes of blocks  and  shown in . After the purchase transaction is complete, the user associated with the client computer  may issue an access request to any one of the content providers. In the example shown in , the client computer  communicates an access request () to the third content provider server C. An access request () may include information that identifies the user and the selected content.","In response to receiving the access request, the third content provider server C communicates an authorization request () to the merchant server . In this embodiment, the authorization request () sends sufficient information so that the merchant server  can determine if the user is authorized to access the content identified in the access request (). For instance, the authorization request () may include information that identifies the user and the selected content.","In response to receiving the authorization request (), as shown in block , the merchant server  determines if the user is authorized to access the content identified in the access request (). As described above, the merchant server  may analyze the received transaction information () to determine if the user has obtained rights to receive access to the selected content. If the merchant server  determines that the user may access the selected content, the merchant server  sends an authorization signal notifying the requesting content provider that the user may access one or more media files containing the content. The authorization signal may include any information that allows any one of the content provider servers to determine that the requesting user has access to the selected content. For instance, the authorization signal may include information that identifies the user and the selected content. Alternatively, the authorization signal may include information such as a reference to the access request () sent by the content provider, etc. As shown in communication line , the merchant server  communicates an authorization signal to the third content provider server C.","In yet another alternative, an authorization request may be received directly from a client computer associated with the user that is executing a media player application. An authorization signal is then communicated to a content provider in the user's account known to provide media files having a file format compatible with the user's media player application.","In yet another embodiment, the authorization request () may only contain sufficient information to uniquely identify the user. When the merchant server  receives an authorization request () from a content provider, it returns an authorization signal () that identifies all of the new content that the user has been authorized to receive since the last authorization request made by the content provider. In this embodiment, it is not necessary that the merchant server  know the specific content the user is requesting from the content provider. Rather, the merchant server  simply keeps a record of authorization requests it receives from content providers with respect to the user and ensures that the content provider is updated in regard to the content that the user is authorized to access. In some respects, this embodiment may be envisioned as a type of \u201cpull\u201d system in which the content provider initiates a date transfer from the merchant when the user contacts the content provider seeking access to selected content. The merchant server  responds with a list of content that has been newly authorized since the last update provided to the content provider.","In response to receiving the authorization signal (), the content provider server provides access to a media file containing the requested content. The merchant server  provides a central control for user access credentials for each content provider server. The user may send an access request to each content provider server to receive a number of different media files containing the requested content and the content provider servers communicate with the merchant server  to ensure that user is authorized to receive the requested content.","Other optional implementations of the invention become apparent from the foregoing described embodiments. For example, purchases of selected content from individual content providers A, B, C, and D may provide a basis for transmission of a broadcast message to the other content providers of the user's right to access media files containing the selected content from the other content providers. In one particular implementation, a content provider completing a sales transaction for selected content with the user may communicate information regarding the user (e.g., in the form of an account name\/password or a previously established token, as described earlier) to the merchant , along with an indication of the purchased content, which the merchant  may then use to send a message to the other content providers communicating the user's right to access the purchased content.","As illustrated by the above-described embodiments, the present invention allows purchasers of copyright-protected content to receive different files having different file formats of the purchased content without requiring the purchaser to pay multiple times for the separate copies of the content. By providing controlled access to content stored in multiple file formats, the present invention allows users to readily purchase and receive media files that may be played on different desired media player applications. Many other benefits, such as an improved consumer pricing arrangement, may also result from such management of access rights of copyrighted content.","For example, one preferred embodiment of the invention enables users to purchase selected content in a transaction and allows the users to access media files containing the selected content from multiple content providers without having to pay multiple times to access the media files. Pricing arrangements for the selected content should be established such that the merchant, the content providers, and the owner of the copyrighted content are fairly treated. Many compensation models may be devised for use with the invention. The following examples are provided for illustrative purposes, and do not limit the invention.","In one compensation model, the merchant and the copyright owner divide the payment provided by the user and the content providers agree to deliver the selected content upon user request without further charge to the user with the hope of acquiring new customers. In another compensation model, the merchant, the copyright owner, and the content providers each receive a portion of the payment made by the user for the selected content. In yet another compensation model, the user may designate the content providers from whom the user desires to obtain the selected content. There is no charge to the user for delivery of content from a first content provider, but the user may be charged incremental fees for designating additional content providers. In this model, the merchant and the copyright owner may divide the base purchase charge paid by the user with the content providers dividing the additional incremental fees charged to the user for access to two or more content providers.","In still another compensation model, the merchant may receive payment from a user for selected content, of which a portion is shared by the merchant and the copyright owner, and the remaining portion is maintained in an \u201cescrow\u201d account that is paid to the content providers that actually deliver the selected content to the user. The particular formulas used to determine the portions received by the merchant, the copyright owner, and the content providers may vary according to the particular implementation of the invention and the agreements established between the parties.","While several embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described above, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention. The scope of the invention should be determined from the following claims and equivalents thereto."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The foregoing aspects and many of the attendant advantages of this invention will become more readily appreciated as the same become better understood by reference to the following detailed description, when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
