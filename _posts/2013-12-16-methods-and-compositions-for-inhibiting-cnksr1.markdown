Treatment also includes prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment.","Single point mutations of at least one of the RAS genes (KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS) are found in many human cancers, particularly in colon, lung and pancreatic cancer. RAS mutations are most commonly found in KRAS (about 85%), less commonly in NRAS (about 12%) and rarely in HRAS (about 3%). KRAS encodes two splice variants, A and B, with divergent C-terminal sequences due to the alternate utilization of exon 4. Mutant KRAS (mut-KRAS) may be present in up to about 25% of all human tumors. Mut-KRAS may play a critical role in driving tumor growth and resistance to therapy. An agent with even a modest effect on mut-KRAS activity, or one that exhibits selective inhibition of a subset of mut-RAS could have a major impact on therapy, and decrease cancer patient suffering and morbidity. Thus, finding new agents that inhibit the growth of mut-KRAS tumors is arguably the most important unmet need in cancer therapy today.","Early attempts to develop GTP-competitive antagonists to RAS protein, analogous to ATP-competitive antagonists of protein-tyrosine kinases, were found to be impractical because of the picomolar binding of GTP to RAS. The next approach, and one that gained considerable traction, was to prevent the membrane binding of RAS by blocking RAS farnesylation using cell permeable CAAX peptidomimetics or small molecule farnesyl transferases (FT) inhibitors. Several potent agents were developed that showed dramatic activity in HRAS cell lines and mouse tumor models. However, it was found that the activity was limited to oncogenic HRAS which is found in only a small portion of human tumors, and that oncogenic NRAS and KRAS were resistant to FT inhibition because of alternative geranylgeranylation. Other efforts to develop antisense or siRNA inhibitors of KRAS, or inhibitors of Rce1 and Icmt responsible for CAAX signal processing have so far not provided effective KRAS antitumor agents. The currently favored approach is to block downstream signaling targets activated by KRAS such as PI-3-K, RAF and mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), and several clinical trials underway with combinations of these inhibitors. However, a limitation of the approach may be that different mut-KRAS amino acid substitutions engage different downstream signaling effectors, and it may be necessary to have a number inhibitors available for each of the pathways. It may be preferable to have an inhibitor that works with all forms of mut-KRAS and the approach we have adopted is to identify genes that are activators of mut-KRAS activity to provide molecular targets for the development of selective mut-KRAS inhibitors.","Following the strategy to identify genes that positively regulate mut-KRAS activity, CNKSR1 (connector enhancer of kinase suppressor of RAS 1) has been identified. The CNKSR1 protein is associated with KRAS in the membrane signaling nanocluster, and knockdown of CNKSR1 may cause inhibition of mut-KRAS tumor cell growth and signaling without inhibition of wt-KRAS cell growth. Furthermore, CNKSR1 has a potentially druggable pleckstrin homology (PH) domain.","Embodiments of the invention are directed toward compounds of the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0116","num":"0116"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00030","num":"00030"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00030","he":"27.69mm","wi":"54.95mm","file":"US09340532-20160517-C00030.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}],"sup":["1 ","2 ","3 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0117"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00031","num":"00031"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00031","he":"78.40mm","wi":"71.80mm","file":"US09340532-20160517-C00031.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Embodiments of the invention are directed toward compounds of the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0119"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00032","num":"00032"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00032","he":"27.69mm","wi":"54.95mm","file":"US09340532-20160517-C00032.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}],"sup":["1 ","2 ","3 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0120"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00033","num":"00033"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00033","he":"97.03mm","wi":"71.04mm","file":"US09340532-20160517-C00033.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Some embodiments are drawn toward compounds of formula IA:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0122"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00034","num":"00034"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00034","he":"30.99mm","wi":"68.92mm","file":"US09340532-20160517-C00034.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0124","num":"0127"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00035","num":"00035"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00035","he":"17.86mm","wi":"19.47mm","file":"US09340532-20160517-C00035.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":"Ris \u2014C(O), \u2014C(O)O(C-Calkyl), \u2014C(O)OH, \u2014CHOH, \u2014CH(OH)(CH)NH, \u2014CH(OH), \u2014C(OH)CNO, \u2014(CH).

Therefore the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description and the preferred versions contained within this specification.","RAS proteins may self assemble together with other membrane-associated proteins, effectors and scaffolding proteins into plasma membrane tethered microdomains known as nanoclusters. The nanoclusters may be small (about 6-20 nm diameter) short lived (t1\/2 less than about 0.4 s) signaling platforms, and may contain 6 or more proteins. Nanoclusters can differ depending upon the charge and covalent lipid modification of the C-terminal hypervariable (hv) region of the individual RAS isoforms. Downstream signaling effectors may be activated by the about 40% of the RAS which is associated in nanoclusters, while the remaining RAS is randomly arrayed over the cell surface.","RAS proteins undergo several steps of translational modification which can determine their membrane localization (). RAS may share a C-terminal CAAX motif that can undergo cysteine residue preneylation (C15 farnesylation or C20 geranylgeranylation) followed by removal of the AAX residues by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Rce1 (RAS and a-factor converting enzyme-1) and carboxylation by Icmt (isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase). These CAAX modifications by themselves may not be sufficient for RAS plasma membrane association and a second signal may be required. HRAS, NRAS and KRAS4A can undergo C16 palmitoylation on cysteine residues in their hv regions catalyzed by ER PATs (protein acyltransferases). In KRAS4B, the second membrane localization signal can be provided by a lysine rich polybasic amino acid sequence in its hv region that can facilitate an interaction with the negatively charged head groups of and phosphatidylinositol (PI) on the inner surface of the plasma membrane. PIP3 can be clustered in lipid raft nanodomains together with high levels of PI3K protein, to give regions of high signaling activity. The binding of the CNKSR1 PH-domain to PIP3 could serve to position the KRAS nanocluster in close proximity to the PI3K signaling nanodomain leading to activation of PI3K, a downstream signaling effector for KRAS. Some forms of mut-KRAS can have a higher affinity for binding to PI3K than wt-KRAS, due to a mutation induced change in the structure of the KRAS switch 1 and 2 binding regions that form direct contact with the PI-3-K catalytic domain causing allosteric activation. This could explain the greater sensitivity of mut-KRAS to inhibition by siRNA knockdown of CNKSR1 or PH-domain inhibition, than wt-KRAS.","The PH-domain is an about 100 to about 120 amino acid three dimensional superfold found in over 500 human proteins. The core of each PH-domain consists of seven \u03b2-strands and a C-terminal a-helix. While PH-domains may show a highly conserved 3 dimensional organization, the sequence identities among different proteins are only about 7% to about 23%. This is important because with this sequence diversity, selective agents can be identified that will be specific for each protein. PH-domains can bind to phosphotyrosine and polyproline sequences, G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins and phosphoinositides (PIs). While for the majority of PH-domain proteins PI binding is weak and non-specific, the PH-domains of many proteins that are components of signal transduction pathways regulating cancer cell growth and survival show high affinity for PIP3 and sometimes PIP2. CNKSR is one such protein that has high affinity binding for PIP3. In embodiments, the binding of a small molecule to a PH-domain may inhibit protein function.","In other embodiments, identifying small molecule PH-domain inhibitors using a computational platform may speed identification of potential inhibitors and the decrease the costs of optimizing a drug lead. In such embodiments, the in silico molecular docking of libraries of several million chemical structures using the known crystal or homology model structures of the PH-domain of the protein of interest may be used to identify inhibitors of CNKSR1. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy can measure the extent of binding of the compounds to the PH-domain of the protein, and in vitro cellular assays can determine biological efficacy. Once active moieties are identified there may be recursive refinement of the model through repeated in silico docking and SPR spectroscopic measurements of binding until lead compounds are obtained. Such embodiments may be used to discover highly specific and potent PH-domain inhibitors of CNKSR1.","This role of CNKSR1 as a molecular target for drug development is shown in  where transfection with siRNA to CNKSR1 (siCNKSR1) may inhibit growth of mut-KRAS MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic cells but not the growth of MiaPaCa-2 cells, where an allele of mut-KRAS has been disrupted by homologous recombination. siCNKSR1 may also inhibit growth of mut-KRAS HCT116 colon cancer cells but not the growth of HKE2 HCT116 cells, where mut-KRAS has been disrupted by homologous recombination.

The docking program PHuDock\u00ae can be used to identify potential inhibitors of CNKSR1.

In this study a ligand-based method that takes into account molecular shape of a query molecule and the pharmacophoric features (acceptor, donor, hydrophobic, aromatic, etc.) of its functional groups was launched. The underlying hypothesis is that molecular entities such as inositol X-phosphate may bind in the pocket of the PH-domain. Thus, providing a competing molecule for that site could diminish its activity in a noticeable manner.","The X-Ray structure of a PH-domain target bound to inositol tetraphosphate (IP4) was retrieved from the RCSB (code: 1UNQ) and prepared within MAESTRO utilizing the Protein Preparation Wizard module. The ligand was extracted and used as a query for virtual screening using the shape screening module of the aforementioned software. Databases of commercial vendors were downloaded as SDF files and converted into 3D structures with Ligprep at pH 7 and calculating protomers and tautomers using EPIK. Basic Lipinski's rules of drug-likeness were used to filter out offending compounds. The phase shape program within MAESTRO was employed to screen the aforementioned databases. Briefly, conformers were generated \u201con the fly\u201d and up to 1000 low energy conformations per each entry in the commercial databases were retained and screened. The atom type used was Phase QSAR Model due to its remarkable good shape screening capabilities seen in previous cases. Conformers with similarity below 0.7 were discarded and the results ranked based on shape similarity. A large database of approximately 3000 compounds was retrieved from the method and every single compound was visually inspected to maximize hydrogen bond pattern, maximum overlap of functional groups and overall shape and geometry of the molecules.

For measurement of active RalA and RalB, Ral and RalB activation kits were used (Biorad). Band density was measured using the Renaissance chemiluminescence system on Kodak X-Omat Blue ML films (Eastman Kodak).","A commercially available docking package, GOLD (GOLD [3.2], CCDC: Cambridge, UK, 2007) was used to evaluate the docking of compounds 1-7 into the binding pocket, see e.g. Table 5. Other docking was performed using modeling algorithms with state-of-the-art commercial drug discovery software (Schrodinger suite). GLIDE was chosen as the docking algorithm used to select and optimize compounds, providing a GlideScore as a rough estimate of binding affinity that was used to rank and select the best compounds. Additionally, ligand-based approaches provided an alternative to structure based drug discovery. Ligand-based virtual screening methodologies can take into account shape and electrostatics (like ROCS) and the pharmacophoric features (acceptor, donor, hydrophobic, aromatic, etc.) of its functional groups. Inositol tetraphosphate (IP4) binding to the PH-domain of CNKSR1 provided a good starting point for shape screening. Both structure-based and ligand-based approaches were used to find novel compounds (Table 7) and to refine and improve lead compounds (Tables 8, and 9). SPR interaction analyses for Compounds 1 through 7 were performed with a Biacore 2000, using Biacore2000 Control Software v3.2 and BIAevaluation v4.1 analysis software (Biacore) as described in Mol Cancer Ther 7:2621 (2008).
