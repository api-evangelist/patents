U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/626,654, filed on 30 Sep. 2011, entitled System and Methods for Collaborative Online Multimedia Production, Maha Achour and Doug Anarino, inventors.","All of the above-listed patent documents are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties, including figures, tables, claims, and all other matter filed or incorporated by reference in them.","This disclosure is related to the field of collaborative online video production applications, and in particular, a multimedia system for video productions with embedded script and commands.","Many of today's multimedia tasks are performed using audiovisual capturing tools to generate content that is then fed to expensive and sophisticated centralized editing and composing systems for titling, sequencing, super-positioning, effects generation and rendering before final release. Such a centralized approach discourages distributed multimedia production techniques and do not facilitate content feeds generated by professional and amateur entertainers, artists, media creators, and producers distributed across the globe. This is particularly the case with current video production systems where the script is a manuscript separate from the video creation process.","By using conventional video editors to implement an online video production application, the production team tasks are not balanced among users as the editor bears the most challenging and time-consuming tasks. Additionally, the production crew still needs to be present during video shoots. For instance, editors typically perform a variety of tasks in processing videos uploaded by crew members, including, but not limited to, (i) remove the green or blue screen and smooth the edges trim the video and adjust the video length in compliance with the script and\/or producer\/editor requests; and (iii) identify each video and associate it with its corresponding scene or shot within the video editor timeline.","With the emergence of online video content distributions, many amateur artists have attempted to produce their own videos using hardware and software tools available to them. Such approaches not only require having access to these systems and learning how to use them but also require that all video elements\u2014from actors and background setup to sound and effects\u2014be present in the same location and at the same time. Such stringent requirements are difficult to accommodate when scriptwriters, producers, actors, cameramen, stage artists, and musicians are working asynchronously wherever they happen to be at the time. Hence, there is a need for a systematic mechanism by which videos are seamlessly placed directly in the video editor timeline after removing the green and\/or blue backgrounds. Similarly, multiple users may decide to collaborate in real-time on complex scenes, layered storyline, or live feeds. Furthermore, mobile applications of this novel web application (App) may be downloaded on mobile devices to notify users about a new or ongoing video production in their current geographical locations to upload specific videos, background screen, news shots, sounds, music, cover events, collaborative storytelling, and so forth. Or, users may initiate a production triggered by advantageous situations. For example, major news, social, or personal events in specific location will notify all or pre-selected users using such mobile app to collaborate on scripting, shooting, editing, and producing videos on the fly.","Presented herein is a novel platform that alleviates such requirements by opening up the video creation, production, and distribution process to a collaborative process. Such methods and applications may be used to democratize digital video processes and thus empower a whole new generation of artists, writers, content, and markets by exponentially increasing the number of professional and amateur video creators and industry players contributing to the whole video digital content and economy. Unlike conventional online video editors, online video production communities using this novel web application have interaction with script writers. Hence, the script is seamlessly embedded into the video editor to simplify the production process and balance production roles among users. Eventually, diverse global user communities may be formed that include a variety of participants, such as students, writers, actors, cameramen, artists, filmmakers, musicians, educators, journalists, travelers, activists, sports enthusiasts, and bloggers. Such a novel production environment enables practically anyone who wants to create original video content. Furthermore, the script may encompass placeholders, command lines, and producer\/editor comments to automatically upload videos captured by socially connected users into the pre-assigned slots in the video editor timeline to enable collaborative storytelling and make video production a social experience. These users may do so by using the App version on their mobile devices. Such novel platform creates aggregate value by offering an environment for collective efforts and collaboration instead of today's tiny and disconnected individual efforts or expensive and inflexible production studio styles. This \u201cCommunity-Driven\u201d web application also brings together amateur, professionals, and celebrities, where feedback or cameo appearances by celebrities and professionals may be the ultimate reward to amateur users.","A mobile App has both client side portion and software on network servers which receive a plurality of video, audio, images, commands, text, and comments data streams from a plurality of mobile stations to produce videos on the fly or in a time delayed fashion. Users may select to keep copies of their own files on their mobile device. Unsophisticated users may configure their mobile App from a pre-selected menu to setup the complete or a portion of the simplified video production portal application from both the client and server sides depending on their roles in the production process. For instance, a football event may trigger a video project where users are scattered around the football field. Production owner uses the script tool to create scenes and shots using script tool, where scenes my represent the quarters in the game, introduction, summary, best plays, highlights, key players, and so forth. Actors are now cameraman using their mobile devices to follow the script. Mobile App will be configured based on their role and will allow them to simultaneously view video shots to interchange roles on the fly depending on game progress.","In some embodiments, a system , as illustrated in , includes a Distributed Multimedia Production (DMP) platform  communicatively coupled to the Internet  and one or more databases, DB(), D(), . . . DB(N) . These system elements may be distributed among a collection of servers located around the globe. The configuration of system  allows collaborative processing incorporating multiple distributed participants. The DMP  enables a new generation of socially-connected professionals and amateurs to collaborate on high-quality video productions. Participants are able to work together in the process of generating the video, as well as to make the resultant work available online and accessible to mobile devices. The collaborative and distributed type web applications described herein provide online tools to write scripts, add commands, shoot videos, edit, produce, market, and distribute quality videos in a systematic, flexible, seamless, and simple way so as to make each user's experience enjoyable, rewarding, and exciting.","In one example the DMP platform  is a collaborative web application having modules for compiling a composition, authorizing users, providing tools to users, and payment or subscription processing. Other modules may be added as a function of the capabilities and desires of the collaborators. The DMP platform may be implemented as a cloud service, where functions are provided as a networked solution. The DMP platform may be implemented as distributed modules, where software is downloaded or otherwise provided to the collaborators. The modules of DMP  include tools  which provide applications and utilities for each of the users. These tools  will typically include tools specific to the functions performed. In this way, tools  may include a set of tools for authors, a set of tools for videographers, a set of tools for editing, a set of tools for compilation, and other functions. The tools  may further provide access to other applications which are not included in the DMP  but are available through a networked connection, such as Internet . In some examples, participants are able to access external applications and tools, such as third party applications or Tools as a Service (TAS) applications, whereby, tools  may interface with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) seamlessly. In this way, the participant may select the feature or application desired, and tools  will set up the connection automatically and allow access to the application.","Users may access tools  according their role or identify, as well as according to the production arrangement. The tools may be provided as services or may be downloadable as widgets for use at the collaborators computing or mobile device. The tools  may further provide interfaces and APIs to the user for interfacing with external devices, such as cameras, lighting equipment, sound equipment, digitizing devices, website, other resources and software programs. The tools module  may further provide drivers for control of external devices and software desired for use on the collaborative project. The tools module  maintains these various mechanisms and works in cooperation with the other modules within DMP , such as the authorization module , compilation module , and payment module .","The compilation module , according to some embodiments, allows users to build the multimedia work by compiling the various components generated and contributed by each of the collaborative users. The compilation module  processes uploaded files and video to allow fast online processing. For instance, characters, scenes, shots within scenes, commands, dialogues, actions, and comments are created and included during the script writing process to build videos initial structure. Such structure is automatically integrated into video editor timeline. Comments may be part of the shot metadata that users, specifically actors and cameraman, can input to describe building blocks of elements used to create the scene such as type of furniture, clothing, jewelry, accessories, and so forth, to enable viewers to select these items while watching the video to determine vendors selling these items online, in stores, or in nearby stores depending on user's location. This embedded advertising becomes part of the revenue models for this novel web application. Furthermore, high-quality videos are converted to low-resolution files during the upload process to enable users to edit them on the fly, green or blue background screens are automatically removed, and videos are trimmed to assign each trimmed video file to its corresponding slot in the video editor timeline After the video editing process is complete, the compiler renders the video to its original high quality resolution for online, broadcast, or cable distribution. Information included in the script, such as characters, scenes, shots within scenes, commands, dialogues, actions, and comments, may be integrated with the video during the rendering process to provide keywords and descriptions that may be used to promote the video, associate relevant commercials and advertisement during viewing, and help search engines identify clips within the video. This data may be stored in a new format with the video data, or may be stored in a separate file mapped to the video data. A web application may include HTML and style sheet documents, which provide the graphics and look of the webpage, which are downloaded to users' drive and cached. It may also include text files, which are validated by the browser, such as XML, java, flash or other files. The authorization module  identifies users by identity, such as by roles or contribution, and applies rules for processing and enabling operations. The authorization module  assigns and monitors rights are based on a processing scheme. In some embodiments the processing scheme is predetermined prior to starting a collaborative project or work. In some embodiments the processing scheme may be dynamically modified by an administrator. The authorization module  works in coordination with the payments module  to bill participants and to verify payment for each collaborative process according to the processing scheme. The payments may be based on collaboration parameters, such as by data content or by time used. Further, the payment module may enable a profit-sharing or other arrangement. The payments module  provides the payment status information to the authorization module ; in response, the authorization module  may enable or prohibit users with respect to the various functions of the DMP .","The DMP  may be further offered as a cloud service, such as Software as a Service (SAS). In such an environment, the DMP  platform may upgrade the various modules without interruption or action by the users. The collaboration of users is then facilitated through the cloud service(s), enabling collaborators to work together asynchronously but with the most recent versions and information. The cloud service may access other information available through the Internet, and may also access proprietary databases of the collaborators. Where the service is provided as a platform or application in the cloud, the service is then available for easy access from any device having capability to access the Internet or network. The ability to collaborate from anywhere provides users with enhanced flexibility. Similarly, multiple users may decide to collaborate in real-time on complex scenes, layered storyline, or live feeds.","The DMP  may be used for Internet productions and publications, such as video and TV applications available at sites on the web. The DMP  is configured for use and communication with Internet protocols. The DMP  may post or publish video content and monitor its use and viewing statistics. This information may be used as feedback in further development of a given project or as survey type information for future projects. The DMP  may be used to create casting calls or review screen play snippets. This may extend to film festivals for coordination and planning of events.","Individual films may be created on or provided to the DMP , for review, scheduling and selection by a film review committee. In this scenario, the reviewers could provide critique and edits to the film, having ability to manipulate scene information. This is available as the project is configurable by the DMP .","In some examples, a DMP  eliminates costly tools, equipment and royalties by providing or recommending video capture kits with camera, microphone, green screen, lights, and so forth, as well as providing royalty free stock footage and soundtracks. The DMP  enables asynchronous shots taped by actors to be assembled into a single shot within a scene, in accordance to script information, to provide streamlined production processes. The production processes provides simple writing tools which expands an idea to a detailed screenplay. Further, the DPM  provides powerful editing tools to layer video elements, incorporate and modify video and audio elements, title and subscript scenes, add effects and transitions into a high-quality video production. Similarly, multiple users may decide to collaborate in real-time on complex scenes, layered storyline, or live feeds.","In one example, social networking tools allow writers, producers, actors, cameramen, and artists to collaborate and share work at any stage using a computing or mobile device. Such a collaborative platform may be used to create videos including short videos of offbeat comedy skits, spoofs, training videos, commercials, infomercials, documentaries, full length movies. In some examples these collaborations may produce videos of short duration, less than ten minutes, or long durations. The collaborative platform accommodates multiple contributors. A producer, writers, editors, actors, cameramen, artists, musicians, sound engineers, and others may all participate and contribute at different stages of the video production. The roles of the participants may include producers, writers, actors, cameramen, engineers, editors, and so forth.","In some embodiments, a producer is an authenticated owner of a particular production having ultimate control over its metadata, access rights, scene releases and credits. The producer may post a call for writers, actors, cameramen, or others for the project. The producer selects and authenticates writers, actors and other participants. Writers are authenticated users granted access to a page for editing the script, referred to as the Edit Script page, for a particular scene or all scenes in a production. There may be multiple writers for a single project. The writers may have a partition that allows them to collaborate among themselves prior to posting their writings for viewing, critique, and learning by others. Once the writings are so posted, an editor or producer will review, comment and revise the writings. Script may include characters, scenes, shots within scenes, commands, dialogues, actions, and comments. An editor is an authenticated user granted access to a page for editing the video, referred to as the Edit Video page, for a particular scene or all scenes in a production. The actors then act out the writings, or script; the actors are authenticated users having a defined character role in a particular scene and therefore are granted access to a page to upload clips, referred to as the Upload Clip page, for that scene. Actors may include celebrities providing cameos which may be integrated into the video project. An artist is an authenticated user given the task to generate background images and videos for given scenes when directors\/editors cannot identify suitable ones in the application database. Engineers and musicians are authenticated users given the task to generate sound effects, video effects and music for given scenes when directors\/editors cannot identify suitable ones in the application database. Administrators are DMP personnel having access to certain editorial functions. Super Administrators are DMP technical personnel having access to user accounts and low-level functions, as well as having control to configure the DMP according to a processing scheme.","When a production is first created, its producer (or potentially the owner) has access to many functionalities, including multiple access rights, but they can also assign those rights to other users. The access rights include:\n\n","This function is based on the type of user and currently selected element. Below are few of the types of script elements supported:\n\n","Lighting settings may be set in a similar way without being the same as actor\/camera settings.  illustrates a table depicting an actor's positions and angles with respect to their own camera\/green screen and to each other. Such guidelines may be integrated with the script to facilitate the video production process.","In developing a production, a script writer may include additional fields to enable seamless integration with video editor and to allow actors to easily determine how to shoot and time their videos.  illustrates an example scenario of a frame  having multiple fields.","A timeline track displaying information from the script alongside the actual clips being tied together may be used as a control, but moves in tandem with the actual time line content as it's zoomed and scrolled (like the Ruler control). For instance, an editing panel may appear when a shot clip is selected in the timeline, offering the following elements:\n\n","The collaborative online video production application and its associated payment stream models. These new types of online payment streams are based on the application ecosystem ranging from the collaborative environment, video content, talented users, target audiences, to partners. In some embodiment, the payments module  calculates fees for accessing talents promoted by the application. Access may be by internal or external users\/consumers. For instance, a producer may want to hire a video editor, script writer and actors to manifest their vision for a production. The payments module  may further incorporate a payment transaction charge as a flat rate, one-time payment, royalties, or a full license to the application. Subscriptions may be implemented to provide different rates to groups and video production channels of relevance to the consumer. A reward program may be implemented by ranking videos and types of users. A reward program may consist or linked to points collected by users depending on their contributions and or revenue generated by their videos. In one embodiment the DMP  matching users with each other or with the consumer, branding videos to further promote very successful (viral) videos.","The DMP  may be used for engagement and interactivity with the audience, such as fans, sponsors, partner, and so forth. The system  further allows for partnerships with third party distributors, vendors, and services. The DPM further provides expanded access to royalty-free stock content library and to effects, transitions, themes and so forth.","Some embodiments implement transaction fees for payment transfers between accounts. Advertising may be displayed on the DMP site and in correspondence, with the ability to block ads on the site and in correspondence. Advertising returns may be applied by the payments module  where site content is displayed or otherwise used on third party sites and services, and wherein the ability to retain or regain ownership of user content is provided through the DMP . Further, the DMP  may be used to account for and process hosting fees for podcast channels","The following describes a video production system , illustrated in , which distributes video production so as to satisfy requirements of collaboration among script writers, producers, actors, cameramen, stage artists, and musician are scattered all around the globe and may be unaware of each other's presence. In this embodiment, an online produCtion of distributed mUltimedia tool referred to as a CRU or CRU tool, alleviates many of the video production challenges by opening up the video creation, production, and distribution process to a group of users, and may even open the process to the general public. The CRU tool democratizes the digital video process to empower a whole new generation of artists, writers, contents, and markets by exponentially increasing the number of professional and amateur video creators and players contributing to the whole digital video content and economy. The CRU platform  includes a variety of elements and functionalities. As illustrated in , the system  includes multiple CRUs , , , each coupled to multiple environments. The CRUs are coupled to environments including a viewer interface , customer interface , and advertiser interface . The CRUs are further coupled to a production environment including a variety of elements and functions.","One production function is referred to as the Script Dicer module , which enables script writers to enter their scenes, lines, storyline in a creative, collaborative way to enable actors and producers\/directors to seamlessly assemble the video. Such script dicing includes, but is not limited to, tagging\/linking each scene, actor line, location, time.","Another production functionality is the Actor Video\/Audio Captor module , where each participating actor is offered a toolkit used to homogenize the scenes. These kits may be provided for under a variety of scenarios, including for fee or as part of a complementary software development kit. Such kit may include a green\/blue\/unicolor background screen, microphone, video capturing camera, and\/or an illumination light source. Depending on the scene, actors may be given guidance on how to position the camera and illumination source. The actor toolkit may include a driver to seamlessly interface with the CRU cloud.","The Producer\/Director Control module  functionality component of the CRU platform enables a producer\/director to integrate all video elements by making associating actors, cameramen, background video or images, and music to each scene before final editing and production.","Another production function is the music module  that enables a musician to upload, create, and edit the soundtrack that is suitable to video scenes. It also includes a database of music tracks from which to select. Such music tracks may be labeled\/tagged, and are not necessarily limited, by type, instrument, length, modularity, genre, and so forth.","Still another production functionality is the Background\/Stage module  which enables photographers, cameramen, artists or amateurs to upload, create, and edit static, animated, or videos suitable for scene background. It also includes a database of such material from which to select, such as when a unique background is not desired. Such background images\/videos are labeled\/tagged, but not necessarily limited, by type, day time, size, duration (such as for videos), modularity, and genre. Many factors are considered when combining actors' videos with background scenes to homogenize the video. For instance, lighting and camera angle are some factors that are typically taken into consideration during selection and integration process. The system  allows artists and amateurs to upload their images and videos using different angles or 360 degree viewing capabilities as it is the case of three dimensional maps.","The system , including CRU platforms and services, brings the collaborative video making experience to multiple people without requiring them to go through years of education and experience to penetrate such industry and create new industries based on the creativity and free exploration CRU users enjoy on an individual basis or collectively.","With the proliferation of social networks and video sharing and distribution sites, the systems ,  allow amateur online users to quickly, seamlessly, and collectively combine their ideas and concepts to produce the target video production. In some embodiments a master and slave node hierarchy is used to balance control between online users.","A master user has the responsibility to invite participants, assign roles, and oversee content capturing and production processes. Each user is able to see all contents generated by users in real-time or archived, but only master note is capable of activating a subset of users to interact on given scenes of the video.","In these collaborative systems, a set of tools may include a green\/blue background, video\/audio capturing mean such as video camcorders, software interface an drivers. The user interface is a Graphic User Interface (GUI) and hardware interfaces which are linked to the CRU.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["300","302","304","306","308","310"],"sub":["j","j","j"]},"Editing, integrating, and rendering online video may be accomplished by reducing video quality during the upload process, using distributed servers that process and run specific or general editing, integrating, and rendering requests to recover original video quality. In one embodiment a CRU video editor includes a unique feature that dynamically adapt the video capturing and illumination angles of the different videos that will be eventually combined to create the final scene.","In terms of the services offered using CRU engine. Any user can initiate the video creation process, such as an amateur who can simply post their simple ideas. Such posting may also initiate an alert signal or message to script writers, directors, actors, cameramen, and musicians (other participants) interested in similar ideas to further advance the collaborative video process. Industry players looking to create commercials for their products can use CRU to create competition among users to create winner commercial.","Advertisers of products and services having a relationship to a particular video theme or genre, or desiring to make a connection with a particular audience, are able to advertise their products or services, and act as participants. By incorporating an advertising function provides a revenue stream for video producers. The CRU platform may be provided as a free service to all users at all levels. In some embodiments, users may search certain levels, such as actor, script writer, musician, director level after they achieve a particular goal. In one scenario, the goal may reflect successful accumulation of a number of points. This may be based on the number of released videos from a given user's contributions.","A CRU participant may advertise a video project on the social network(s), where their interest graph identifies potential participants. Social networks may also be used to advertise the video after completion. The CRU may incorporate its own video distribution channels as well as conventional hooks to social media. The CRU engine keeps track of CRU videos activities and revenue regardless of where they reside.","A CRU system may include an internal system to enable CRU users to monetize their contributions and develop a reputation within the CRU community. This will attract others and create groups of users active in the video production business.  illustrates the functional building blocks of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) expressed in a home page .","In this embodiment, the home page presents a variety of different functionalities for users. A user may share an idea to solicit interest from script writers, Directors, Actors, cameramen, musicians, sound effect, visual effects, or background scenes and videos. A user may further insert a screenplay script manually or dynamically by uploading script files. The user may select a role, as in selection box . For example, a user may select a role as a director, actors, cameramen, sound engineer, score composer, or music content creator, or artist creating visual effects, background images, videos, and so forth.","In one scenario, a director allocates roles based on the script and has the right to modify the script at his leisure while notifying other project members, who also may provide their inputs to the script for the director's review and acceptance or rejection. In this scenario, the director receives the modifications and additions, but has the right to modify the script so as to avoid simultaneous or conflicting changes. Each actor may have multiple insertion points in a script in a given film. Additionally, the script may include lines that will be eventually filled by the actor during video shoots. For example, a director may decide to shoot the same scene using different angles or facial expressions and then decide which ones to use during editing.","A database of information may include multiple partitions, and is used for storing ideas, scripts, names of directors and actors, cameramen, sounds, visuals, which are selected in the: this will be transparent to users as some of them will have access to view and utilize other projects contents, such as after paying a higher subscription fee. This fee may be shared with other users who produced these videos. These elements are accessed by selection of the database selection box .","On the homepage GUI , users can view cool videos, and then may be encouraged to either register or login to learn about how these videos are created. The homepage  further includes tools, accessed through a tool selection box . The tools are for development, editing, effects editing, publishing, and so forth.","Casting agents may also be given the opportunity to register and login to view the actor's audition videos and are encouraged to give feedback. Casting agents interested in communicating directly with actors may be asked to pay a fee to access such a service. Such payment scheme may assign fees to be collected when actors purchase their video kits. The kits may be part of the tools, and provided as a development tool kit. The video creation process is presented in a linear fashion, where the users may follow a plan to build the video, or participants may add their portions asynchronously, allowing the video to develop through an iterative process.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","602"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0098"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","702"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0099"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","802"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","902"]},"Actors use the recommended video kit elements to record the different videos assigned by director. The GUI will guide them on where to position the light, camera, and other items such as fan, eyeglasses, item in hand. As illustrated in , the user GUI  presents options to the actor to select a scene, sounds, and so forth. This illustrates the slave mode of the system, which allows actions in response to the master. For voice over functions the user may play the video and add the voice when appropriate, such as in an animated project.","In one embodiment, illustrated in , a video project is put together to illustrate multiple video portions and application of the audio portions. Textual information may be provided to instruct actors are other participants. An \u201cauto\u201d button may be checked to allow the video editor to automatically adapt to uploaded video durations. Various fields may be used to label each shot as part of a given scene. Adjustment controls, such as horizontal, vertical, and deep sliders may be used to provide actors with desired shooting angles. In the present example, the camera is shooting horizontally from \u221214 degree angle and the shot duration is set to 1.8 seconds. The script dialogue, shots, and actions are embedded into the video editor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0103"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1100","1100","1100","1100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0104"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1200","1200","1200"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0105"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["1300","1302","1304","1406","1308","1310"]},"In these and other embodiments, a video production web application incorporates a collaborative environment providing invitations to participants, similar to a call for papers or review in an academic setting. The invitation may be provided to a designated group or to a general public audience. The master initiates a session by uploading or incorporating a script to the system, thus triggering an invitation mechanism to invite users to participate in video application. The script may include characters, scenes, shots within scenes, commands, dialogues, actions, and comments. The Invitation is sent to potential participants. This may involve sending an email to a user account, or to a social media contact. In one embodiment, the invitation is posted for review and acceptance by multiple potential participants, such as posting on a social media site. For example, a director may assign the producer role to a video production owner, who then selects crew from respondents. The producer then assigns roles to individual participants selected from the respondents. If there are no satisfactory respondents, then the producer or master may send out a specific invitation to one or more desired participants to fill a role.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0107"},"figref":"FIG. 14A","b":["1400","1402","1404","1406","1408","1410","1412","1400"]},"The script writer tool  is used to create, edit, and modify the components of a script, such as action, command, and dialogue. The action describes the scene and motions, the command provides further instructions, while the dialogue provides the lines the characters speak. In one embodiment, the dialogue is provided on the scene for adding in audio after filming, such as karaoke videos.","The script writer tool  enables the script writer to format according to multiple aspects, such as to adjust the typeface\/font, line spacing and type area, language, as well as to specify the page per minute of screen time. This enables the script writer to adjust the script according to venue, such as for an American or European movie. The script writer may further edit according to prose, such as to focus on audible and visual elements. The prose selected by the script writer will provide explanations for the participants.","The script writer tool  may further include a storyboarding module to enable the script writer to develop a story line which can be translated into the final video scenes. The storyboard module may start with an editable template that enables the user to quickly build a story line, such as to have drag and drop features, people, actions, and scenes. The storyboard module may be useful in creating an animated portion of a movie or an entire animated movie.","In one embodiment, the script writer tool  includes a digital rights management module,  which may incorporate multiple modules. A first module may be used to verify the material incorporated into the script is not infringing the copyrighted material of others, such as to compare to a database external to the script writer tool . A second module may be used to apply a Digital Rights Management (DRM) security mechanism, such as encryption or other means.","The script file storage unit  stores the script created and uploaded by a writer, director or other with privileges allowing inputs to the script. The script file may be edited by multiple authorized collaborators. Each script includes a variety of components, such as characters, scenes, actions, background, music and audio information and so forth. The script component extraction module  identifies these components in the script file and uses this information to identify the roles that will be used to prepare the video film project. For example, the script component extraction module  identifies a character, and then enables the director or casting director to select a collaborator to fill this role. The selected collaborator, or actor, is then given privileges which allow the collaborator to access the script, the characters lines, definition and actions, as well as to upload their contributions. In this example, the actor's contribution may be a video of the actor acting out their lines. The script component extraction module  identifies the time when the actor's lines are to occur in the video project.","The script component extraction module  creates various files for the components of the script file. These files are then used to compile the contributions of the various contributors into a final product. The script component extraction module  works in coordination with the timeline incorporation module , which receives the contributions of the collaborators and incorporates them into the timeline. In this way the script provides the plan for the video project. The components include characters, instructions, settings, and definitions, wherein the collaborators use the components to create their contributions. The received contributions are then implemented into the video project.","The script writer tool  enables collaborators to edit the script, when the collaborator has editing privileges. The editing module  enables such editing of the script file. There are a variety of ways for multiple collaborators to edit the script. In a first embodiment, the collaborator edits are identified as changes to the script. The director may accept or reject the edits. The edits may be presented to multiple collaborators for group acceptance and discussion. Once accepted, the edits become part of the script.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0115"},"figref":"FIG. 14B","b":["1450","1400","1450","1452","1454","1456","1450"]},"The system adds the results of the script writer tool  to the video production environment, and adds scenes, shots, and characters to the video production page.  illustrates a video editor , having modules for script and related information , image, video and audio file handling , editing tools , timeline editor , and video viewing window .

The mobile application for the collaborative video production product provides a video display portion , timeline portion  which corresponds to the video displayed, and a control portion . The control portion  may include a variety of controls, from drag and drop instructions that allow the user to edit the video by dragging control elements to the video to social network interfaces that allow sharing of the video editing real time. In one scenario the video or multimedia project is displayed for multiple users in real time. The collaborators may discuss the video using their mobile devices, or one or more collaborators may be using their PC or other computing or mobile device. In one embodiment a user having a mobile e-reader may send script or other information to other users from the e-reader. Some mobile devices have capability to perform readability and other statistical calculations, which may be performed on the video project and then provided as feedback to other users. Still other embodiments may provide analysis and use information which may be used to refine the video project, or to identify advertisers. In one embodiment, the collaborators access a third party service which identifies images in the video project and match these to brands and products. This information may be used to procure advertising revenue from these companies. Still further, the mobile application may connect to social media allowing easy upload and presentation on Internet and other applications. The collaborators may solicit feedback and suggestions from viewers to refine and improve the video. The mobile application may store the video project and associated data in a cloud environment, where multiple collaborators can access and edit the project.","In one embodiment templates are provided on which a multimedia production may be built, such as for a horror movie, the various scene selections may be provided as well as character information, scary voices and noises, as well as links to information on this genre. Users may also build templates, such as for a series of movies or productions with a common theme, such as a science series. Educators may use the collaborative system to build projects with students, where the educator enters the script information, which may narrative or text book scripting such as for a documentary, and students access this information and add to the project. The end result is a multimedia presentation illustrating concepts learned.","Sports casters may use such a system to incorporate footage taken by local photographers and incorporate into nationwide or worldwide video feeds, and other projects. The sports caster provides a script identifying the information desired for the video or sports cast, identifying specific views from specific locations, footage of specific teams and players, and so forth, wherein the sports casters send out a request of participants. As local participants respond, they are able to send their video footage to the sports caster specifically identifying which information they are providing. The sports caster does not have to go through the videos to manually position in the film, but they are already marked according to their location on the timeline according to the script. The editor then merely watches the films to select the one desired.","When movie fans, amateurs, want-to-be actors, cameramen, directors, editors, special effects, artists, musicians, and so forth, all join forces to create their own video production with unlimited freedom, a whole new generation of video content emerge.
