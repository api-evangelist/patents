{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is the United States national phase application of International Application PCT\/JP2009\/051830 filed Jan. 28, 2009.","The present invention relates to a resin sheet for circuit boards, a sheet for circuit boards and a circuit board for displays. More particularly, the present invention relates to a resin sheet for circuit boards and a sheet for circuit boards which are used for producing circuit boards having embedded circuit chips for controlling each pixel of displays, in particular, flat panel displays efficiently with excellent quality and productivity and exhibit excellent heat resistance after being cured, and a circuit board for displays comprising embedded circuit chips.","Heretofore, in flat panel displays such as, typically, liquid crystal displays, a very small electronic device such as a thin film transistor (TFT) is formed in the vicinity of each pixel constituting the face of a display in accordance with the same process as that used for producing semiconductor integrated circuits, in which insulation films, semiconductor films and the like are successively laminated, for example on a glass substrate in accordance with the CVD process (the chemical vapor deposition process), and switching on, switching off and control of the contrasting density of each pixel are conducted using the device. In other words, the very small electronic devices such as TFT are prepared directly on the glass substrate. However, the above technology has problems in that it is inevitable that the cost is increased due to the complicated process having many stages, and that the apparatus for the CVD process for forming the films on the glass substrate becomes great as the area of the display is increased, and the cost is increased markedly.","To overcome the above problems, a technology in which very small integrated circuit chips of crystalline silicon are attached to a printing plate in a manner similar to that used for printing ink, then, transferred to prescribed positions on a glass substrate for displays by a means such as printing technology and fixed there so that the cost can be decreased, is disclosed (refer, for example, to Patent Reference 1). In this technology, a film of a macromolecule is formed on the glass substrate in advance, the very small integrated circuits of crystalline silicon are transferred to the film by printing technology or the like, and the chips are embedded into the film of a macromolecule in accordance with a process such as the heat molding and the heat pressing. However, problems such as deformation of the film and formation of bubbles in the film tend to arise and, moreover, the process is not efficient due to the time required for the heating.","A sheet for circuit boards which enables to embedding circuit chips without heating by using a resin sheet for circuit boards comprising a macromolecular material of the energy curable type in place of the film of a macromolecule described above and controlling the storage moduli of the resin sheet during and after the embedding of the circuit chips, is disclosed (refer, for example, to Patent Reference 2).","A circuit board for displays having embedded circuit chips can be produced efficiently with excellent productivity by using the resin sheet for circuit boards described above. However, the cured products of the resin sheets comprising conventional macromolecular materials of the energy curable type do not always exhibit satisfactory heat resistance, and a problem arises in that cracks are formed in wiring formed on the cured products having embedded circuit chips.\n\n","Under the above circumstances, the present invention has an object of providing a resin sheet for circuit boards and a sheet for circuit boards which are used for producing circuit hoards having embedded circuit chips for controlling each pixel of displays, in particular, flat panel displays efficiently with excellent quality and productivity and exhibit excellent heat resistance after being cured, and a circuit board for displays comprising embedded circuit chips.","As the result of intensive studies by the present inventors to achieve the above object, it was found that the object could be achieved by using a resin sheet obtained from a macromolecular material of the energy ray curable type as the resin sheet for circuit boards and adjusting the concentration of double bond in the resin sheet before being cured by irradiation with an energy ray in a specific range. The present invention has been completed based on the knowledge.","The present invention provides:","[1] A resin sheet for circuit boards obtained from a macromolecular material of an energy ray curable type and used for embedding circuit chips; wherein said resin sheet before being cured by irradiation with an energy ray has a concentration of double bond of 4.5 to 25 mmol\/g;\n\n[2] The resin sheet for circuit boards according to [1], wherein said resin sheet after being cured by irradiation with an energy ray has a storage modulus E\u2032 of 1.0\u00d710Pa or greater at 150\u00b0 C. as measured in accordance with the method of Japanese Industrial Standard K7244-4;\n\n[3] A sheet for circuit boards comprising the resin sheet for circuit boards according to any one of [1] and [2], wherein one face of the resin sheet for circuit boards is formed on a support; and\n\n[4]. A circuit board for displays which is obtained by embedding circuit chips into a face of the resin sheet for circuit boards in the sheet for circuit hoards according to [3], followed by curing the resin sheet for circuit boards by irradiation with an energy ray.\n","In accordance with the present invention, a circuit board for displays having embedded circuit chips which exhibits sufficient heat resistance can be obtained by using a resin sheet having a concentration of double bond in a specific range before being cured as the resin sheet for circuit boards which is obtained from a macromolecular material of the energy ray curable type and used for embedding circuit chips.","In the Figures, reference numerals mean as follows: : a support; : a resin sheet for circuit boards; : a circuit chip; : a release sheet; and : a circuit board for displays.","The resin sheet for circuit boards of the present invention will be described in the following.","[Resin Sheet for Circuit Boards]","The resin sheet for circuit boards of the present invention is a resin sheet for circuit boards obtained from a macromolecular material of the energy ray curable type and used for embedding circuit chips, which has a concentration of double bond of 4.5 to 25 mmol\/g before being cured by irradiation with an energy ray.","When the concentration of double bond is smaller than 4.5 mmol\/g, heat resistance of the cured product obtained from the resin sheet for circuit boards becomes insufficient and, as the result, cracks are occasionally formed in wiring formed on the circuit board having embedded circuit chips. On the other hand, when a resin sheet for circuit boards having a concentration of double bond exceeding 25 mmol\/g is prepared, the amounts of monomers and oligomers which are low molecular components in the sheet must be increased, and the sheet tends to be deformed before being cured. It is preferable that the concentration of double bond is 5 to 20 mmol\/g and more preferably 6 to 15 mmol\/g. Although the reason why the formation of cracks in wiring can be prevented by using the resin sheet for circuit boards of the present invention is not completely elucidated, it is considered that the advantageous property is exhibited since the change in the dimension accompanied with the change of the temperature of the cured product of the resin sheet for circuit boards is suppressed (the temperature is elevated at 150\u00b0 C. or higher during formation of the wiring and lowered at the room temperature after the wiring has been formed).","The concentration of double bond is the value obtained by the measurement in accordance with the following method.","<Method for Measuring the Concentration of Double Bond>","The concentration of double bond in the resin sheet for circuit boards is obtained by the measurement of H-NMR. Using hexamethyldisiloxane as the internal standard substance, the internal standard substance and a resin sheet for circuit boards before being cured which is used for the analysis are weighed to the order of milligram. The weighed substances are dissolved into deuterated chloroform or deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide, and the measurement of H-NMR is conducted. The amount by millimole of the functional group having double bond is obtained from the obtained spectrum. The obtained value is divided by the mass of the resin sheet for circuit boards, and the concentration of double bond (mmol\/g) is obtained.","In the present invention, the concentration of double bond can be controlled by the types and the amounts of the polyfunctional polymerizable oligomers in the polymerizable oligomers and polyfunctional polymerizable monomers in the polymerizable monomers contained in the macromolecular material of the energy ray curable type, as described below.","In the resin sheet for circuit boards of the present invention, it is preferable that the storage modulus E\u2032 is 1.0\u00d710Pa or greater at 150\u00b0 C. after being cured by irradiation with an energy ray. When the storage modulus E\u2032 is 1.0\u00d710Pa or greater, the resin sheet exhibits excellent heat resistance after being cured by irradiation with the energy ray, and the formation of wiring on the surface, for example, in accordance with the sputtering process is made possible.","There is no specific upper limit for the storage modulus E\u2032 at 150\u00b0 C. The upper limit is, in general, 1.0\u00d710Pa.

The second embodiment and the third embodiment are preferable when a support such as a plastic support in the film form is used.","[Circuit Board for Displays]","The circuit board for displays of the present invention can be prepared by embedding circuit chips into the face of the resin sheet for circuit boards in the sheet for circuit boards obtained as described above, followed by curing the obtained product by irradiation with an energy ray.","The process will be described more specifically in the following. Circuit chips for embedding are placed on a release sheet or the like. The sheet for circuit boards is placed on the circuit chips in a manner such that the face having the resin sheet for circuit boards is brought into contact with the circuit chips. (When the resin sheet for circuit boards is laminated with a release sheet, the release sheet is removed in advance). The circuit chips are embedded by application of a load of about 0.05 to 2.0 MPa preferably at a temperature of 0 to 150\u00b0 C. and more preferably 5 to 100\u00b0 C., and the resin sheet for circuit boards is cured by irradiation with an energy ray. The release sheet on which the circuit chips are placed in the above is removed, and the circuit board for displays of the present invention can be obtained. When the circuit chips are embedded under heating, the irradiation with an energy ray can be conducted while the resin sheet for circuit boards is heated or after the resin sheet for circuit boards is cooled at the room temperature.","As the energy ray, in general, ultraviolet light or electron beams are used. Ultraviolet light is obtained from a high pressure mercury lamp, a fusion H lamp or a xenon lamp. Electron beams are obtained from an electron beam accelerator. Ultraviolet light is preferable between these energy rays. The amount of the energy ray used for the irradiation is suitably selected so that the storage modulus of the cured layer is within the range described above. For example, when ultraviolet light is used, it is preferable that the amount of light is 100 to 5,000 mJ\/cm. When electron beams are used, it is preferable that the amount of irradiation is 10 to 1,000 krad.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIGS. 1(","i":["a","c"],"b":"1"},"The resin sheet for circuit boards of the present invention  obtained from a macromolecular material of the energy ray curable type in the uncured condition is placed on a support  and, separately, circuit chips  are placed on a release sheet  [(a)]. Then, the laminate of the resin sheet for circuit boards  and the support  prepared above is placed on the circuit chips  on the release sheet  in a manner such that the resin sheet for circuit boards  is brought into contact with the circuit chips . The circuit chips are embedded into the resin sheet for circuit boards under application of a load, and curing is conducted by irradiation with an energy ray [(b)]. By this operation, the resin sheet for circuit boards  in the uncured condition is converted into a cured layer, and the circuit chips  are embedded and fixed into the cured layer. The circuit board for displays of the present invention  can be easily separated from the release sheet  after this operation [(c)]. The circuit chips  may be placed on the resin sheet for circuit boards  and embedded into the resin sheet by application of a load in a similar manner.","In accordance with the process described above, the circuit chips are not embedded into a film of a macromolecule by heating but embedded into the macromolecular material of the energy ray curable type, and the curing is conducted thereafter to fix the embedded circuit chips. Therefore, the problems arising in the use of the film of a macromolecule can be prevented, and the process is efficient since the time of the operation can be decreased.","In the present invention, the circuit board for displays having embedded circuit chips which is suitable for the production in accordance with the process described above and exhibits excellent property for embedding and excellent heat resistance can be provided.","(Formation of Wiring)","In general, wiring (circuits) is formed on the surface of the circuit board for displays in which circuit chips are embedded and fixed by the curing treatment as described above.","The process for forming the wiring is not particularly limited, and a desired process can be selected from conventional processes. For example, the formation of the wiring can be conducted in accordance with the photolithography. An example of the process is as follows. The sheet for circuit boards which has embedded circuit chips and has been treated by curing is coated with a photoresist fluid of the positive type or the negative type, and a photoresist layer is formed. After the photoresist layer is exposed to light via a prescribed mask pattern, the development treatment is conducted using an alkaline developer fluid such as an aqueous solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide, and a resist pattern is formed.","Then, a chromium film having a prescribed thickness is formed on the resist pattern formed above, for example, in accordance with the sputtering process using a chromium target as the wiring material. The obtained sheet for circuit boards is dipped into an etching fluid such as ethanol for etching the resist, and the desired wiring of chromium can be formed.","In the present invention, since the resin sheet for circuit hoards exhibiting excellent heat resistance after being cured is used, problems such as formation of cracks in the wiring during formation of the wiring can be prevented.","The present invention will be described more specifically with reference to examples in the following.
