{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["In general, embodiments of the invention relate to methods, systems, apparatus and computer program products for testing analytics and, more particularly, automating the collection and storage of test data, automating test performance indicator determinations across a multitude of segments within the test participant population and automating test result information delivery.","In current business environments testing analytics is not fully leveraged to drive insight at the lowest level of detail into how to optimize investment strategies, minimize net credit losses and maximize customer relationships to create and maintain a competitive advantage, specifically market testing is a means by which business seek to remedy some of these deficiencies.","The testing process typically comprises a control group and a test group. At the onset of the test, measures are taken to insure that the control group population and the test group populations are the same. A similarity analysis is performed to ensure the same populations and eliminate any differences in the control group versus the test group populations. The same metrics are tracked over the duration of test campaign to indicate a change in test performance of the control group population versus the test group population. The metrics tracked during the test campaign, also referred to herein as the back end test metrics, as well as the front end test metrics are subsequently implemented to determine test performance indicators, such as lift and confidence associated with a specific test metric. The lift calculation provides an indication of the boost (or decline) in the test metric attributable to the test and the confidence calculation provides an insight into the predicted repeatability of the test.","In the current business environment testing and analytics results related to testing tend to be ineffectively leveraged due or otherwise lost due to organizational changes or business entities operating in silo-like environments. In addition to the inability to track performance across multiple business lines\/entities, problems persist in testing related to invalid testing, such as statistical insignificance of test and control quantities and the like. Moreover, current inefficient manual test data mining procedures result in the failure to identify lost opportunities.","Additionally, current manual processes do not provide for the requisite efficiency and timeliness needed to determine test performance indicators across any and all segments of the test dataset, such as test participant population dataset or the like. Individual manual calculations must be performed, meaning all too often valuable test information goes undetected due in part by the inability to perform all of the required calculations needed to uncover these performance results.","Thus, a need exists to creating attesting analytics tool that can be leveraged across multiple business lines\/entities to accelerate testing insight. In this regard, the desired system should provide for automated collection and storage of data to create a historical database of tests, expected test results, test performance data and testing impacts. Additionally, the desired system should provide for automated data transformation and synchronization to allow for data to be organized for the purpose of data mining and requisite analytic test performance reporting and synchronized to link test participants to front end and back end performance data. Further, the desired system should automate the determination of test performance indicators, such as lift and confidence, across any and all segments of the test dataset and automate the process whereby test results are presented to the user and provide multiple options to the user for generating reports, mining data and the like.","The following presents a simplified summary of one or more embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of such embodiments.

The automated collection and storage of test data provides a historical library of tests, test objectives, test performance data and test impacts that survives and adapts to testing entity changes, such as organizational changes, additions to the organizations or the like. The automated test performance indicator determinations across a multitude of segments within a test participant population allows a testing entity to apply real time statistical significance\/performance indicator calculations, such as lift and confidence calculations across multiple dimensions. Such statistical rigor allows for performance indicators to be determined across any combination of participant segments or other data sets. In addition, the invention provides for a testing entity to readily access test result data and drill-down or otherwise efficiently access data to the lowest data level, such as the participant level or the like.","Referring to  a block diagram is depicted of a system  for providing testing analytics, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The system includes a testing analytics module , which includes a testing analytics integrator  and a testing analytics engine . The testing analytics integrator  is configured to receive test data from various networked sources. The test data includes, but may not be limited to, test criteria data , test campaign data , test performance data  and test response data .","The test criteria data  includes test expectation data  which may define expected results for one or more test metrics (i.e., measurable parameter). In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the test expectation data is an expected lift and\/or expected confidence calculation for the specified test metric. Lift is defined herein as the difference observed in the test population versus the control population for the specified test metric. For example, if the specified test metric is net profit, the lift is the difference between the net profit observed by the test population versus the net profit observed by the control population. The confidence calculation is a statistical determination of the probability that the lift will be repeated if the test is applied to the entire population or the segment of the entire population to which the test was applied.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention test criteria data  may be provided via an online web-based test form, which is accessed by a user\/test requester to initiate the test process. See  and the related discussion for an example of test criteria data  provided by a test form. In addition to test expectation data , the test form may define other test criteria data , such as test requestor identity, purpose of the test, test campaign period, test product(s) effected, test category, sub-test category, primary test metric, secondary test metric and the like. The web-based nature of the test form provides for the test criteria  to be instantaneously communicated to the testing analytics integrator  upon the user\/test requestor inputting the requested data and subsequently submitting the data.","In one embodiment of the invention, test data stores  collect and store test campaign data , test performance data  and test response data . Test data stores  may comprise one or a plurality of storage devices, such as storage servers or the like. Test campaign data  includes test participant data , which includes a listing of the participants in the test population and the control population. As previously noted \u201cparticipants\u201d as herein described and claimed is not limited to individuals but may also include other entities, such as accounts, products, services or the like. In addition, in certain embodiments of the invention, the test participant data  may include categorical information pertaining to the test participants or the information on one or more categories\/segments to which the participant belongs or is otherwise associated with. For example, if the participant is an individual, the categorical information may include behavior segmentation, risks scores pricing, affinities\/affiliation of the participants and the like. In accordance with embodiments of the invention and as discussed infra, the categorical information and\/or the specific categories\/segments to which the participant belongs may be implemented at the testing analytics module  to determine individual test performance indicators , such as lift, confidence calculation or the like, for specific segments of the test population. In other embodiments of the invention, in which the test participant data  does not include categorical information and\/or the specific categories\/segments to which the participant belongs, the testing analytics module  may be configured to access other organizational or third party databases (not shown in ) to determine the categorical information and\/or the specific categories\/segments to which the participant belongs.","The test performance data  includes back end test metric  performance data related to the test participants. Back end test metric are measurement parameters taken during the test campaign and\/or at the completion of the test campaign. For example, if the test participants are accounts and, specifically, financial institution accounts, the back end test metrics  include the financial performance over the duration of the test campaign for the test population accounts and the control population accounts. In this example, the back end metrics  may include revenues, fees, profitability and the like, which are subsequently implemented at the testing analytics module  to determine test performance indicators , such as lift and\/or confidence calculation for each individual back end test metric.","The test response data  includes front end test metric  performance data, which indicate how the participant responded to the test. Front end test metrics are measurement parameters defined at the onset of the test. For example, if the test includes an offer to the participant, how the participant responds to the offer may define a front end test metric or an account balance transfer and the balance transfer amount may define a front end test metric.","In one embodiment of the invention, the test campaign data , the performance data  and the test response data  are communicated to the testing analytics module  on a predetermined schedule, such as daily, weekly, monthly or the like. In other embodiments of the invention, the test campaign data , the performance data  and the test response data  may be communicated in real-time as the data becomes available or, in other instances, the testing analytics module  may be configured to request current data on an as-needed basis, such as prior to determining test performance indicators  or the like. The testing analytics module  may store the data by participant and\/or by date prior to performing further processing on the test data.","In addition to receiving the test data, in certain embodiments of the invention, the test analytics integrator  is configured to perform other functions such as organization\/integration of the test data, transformation of raw test data into user-readable data, and synchronization of test data. In one embodiment of the invention, automated organization of the data includes organizing and storing the data in a relational data schema and\/or an Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) cube (also referred to in the art as a multidimensional cube or a hypercube). Organization of the test data in the relational data schema and\/or OLAP cube provides analytic performance for data reporting purposes. In other embodiments of the invention, synchronization of the data includes linking test participants to performance data, such as back end test metrics, front end test metrics or the like.","The testing analytics engine  is configured to determine the test performance indicators , which are associated with a test metric and one or more predefined segments of the test data, such as one or more segments of the overall test participant population. It should be noted that a segment may be defined as any portion of the test data and\/or overall test participant population, including the entire data set\/test participant population. The test performance indicators, such as lift, confidence calculation or the like, are determined based on the test expectation data, the test participant data, and the test performance data. In this regard, the test analytics engine  is configured to determine running sums for all front end and back end metrics (i.e., performance data) that is used for calculations of lift and\/or confidence. In one embodiment of the invention, the testing analytics engine  is configured to determine test performance indicators  for each predetermined segment of the test data, such as each predetermined segment of the overall test participation population.","As previously noted, in specific embodiments of the invention, the segments may be defined within the test participant data  or determined based on category\/segment information included in the test participant data . In other embodiments the segments may be determined by the testing analytics module  by accessing organization databases or third party databases to determine categories\/segments and\/or information related to category\/segments. In still further embodiments of the invention, segments may be defined, either from a listing or ad hoc, by the user\/administrator.","In specific embodiments of the invention, the determination of test performance indicators  for each of the segments may be automatically determined for all defined segments upon receiving the requisite test data. In other embodiments, the determination of test performance indicators  may occur based on the user\/administrator selecting a segment from a list of segments or creating a segment based on user\/administrator selected segment criteria.","Referring now to  a block diagram is illustrated of a system  for automated information delivery by a test analytics module , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The test analytics module  is configured to provide users access to data through a test analytics graphical user interface (GUI) application . As depicted, the GUI application  may be a standalone application external from the testing analytics module or, in alternate embodiments, the GUI application may be included within the test analytics module. The testing analytics GUI application provides analytical capabilities to generate and display scorecards, dashboards, data mining functionality, OLAP performance reporting, relational querying at test participant level, event triggering distribution of reports, report scheduling, self-serve report creation and the like.","In accordance with specific embodiments of the invention, the testing analytics GUI application  may include governance scorecard , test performance dashboard , data mining dashboard  and\/or custom report interface .

The segment performance test data may be presented in the form of a graphical representation of lift versus confidence for each predefined segment. In one embodiment, each segment is represented on the graph by a bubble icon. The bubble icons may be activated (i.e., clicked-on or otherwise engaged) to drill down or otherwise present detail segment test performance data, such as test data for each individual participant within the test segment. In addition, the size of the bubbles may represent a test rollout estimate, such as the potential rollout earnings across the entire segment within the organization or overall population.
