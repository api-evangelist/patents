{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Consumers are increasingly using automated mechanisms to perform every day transactions. Kiosks exist to avoid enterprise personnel and lines. These automated kiosks allow consumers to perform transactions with an enterprise or agency with little to no human intervention. Individuals also perform transactions online and are capable of using their smart phones to check out of stores.","Some transactions, via mobile phones or other portable devices, also require security with delivery of secure content from an enterprise to a customer. For example, automated processing of boarding passes from airlines requires direct delivery of the boarding pass from the airlines to the phone, laptop, or tablet of a customer.","Often this secure content is represented as a barcode, the barcode distributed to a smart phone of a user and the user presents the barcode to complete a transaction, such as entry to an airport gate, entry to an event, and the like. The barcode is an image that is scanned to reveal specific information to a barcode reading device.","The problem with barcode processing is that the barcode is rendered to an image by a server based on predefined settings for a particular smart phone and then distributed to the smart phone as an image. The predefined settings may not accurately reflect the capabilities and specific configuration of a user's smart phone so that the barcode is sometimes not capable of being scanned from the smart phone.","In addition, the server that provides the rendering of a barcodes to mobile devices can become loaded when multiple users are simultaneously requesting barcodes. Moreover, the network connections to and from the server can become bottlenecked with bandwidth issues because the transmission of image data is voluminous.","In various embodiments, techniques for optimization of barcodes are presented. According to an embodiment, a method for barcode optimization is discussed.","Specifically, barcode control information is received from a barcode distributor. Next, image and resolution settings and capabilities are dynamically and in real time acquired from a device. Finally, the barcode control information is translated into a barcode image on the device for access from the device based on the image and resolution settings and capabilities.","The aforementioned industry problems are resolved by providing data to a client-side application that can be used to render a barcode. The client-side application processes on a mobile device of a user and renders the barcode based on the data provided and based on dynamically resolved capabilities of the user's mobile device.","The techniques herein transfer optimization processing of barcode rendering from the server-side to the client-side. To achieve this, a raw barcode (a version not capable of being scanned) is transmitted in an un-optimized form to a mobile device of a user, such as a mobile phone, laptop, and\/or tablet.","As discussed herein there are a few ways to achieve the client-side barcode rendering.","First, the barcode may be transmitted in a vector format (rather than a traditional raster format). This allows logic in a Web page at the client-side mobile device to scale the barcode image based on a scaling factor. The scaling factor can be calculated by a script on the Web page that interrogates the user's mobile device to find out what screen size and\/or resolution settings that the mobile device has.","Second, the Web page may contain the data that is to be encoded in the barcode (rather than the barcode image itself). The Web page can also include scripting utilities that describe how to render the barcode based on the capabilities of the user's mobile device. The barcode data that is transmitted may include the syntax and semantics that are to be used. Alternatively, the barcode data may include a sequence of bits indicative of whether each square should be black or white. The script on the Web page can then render the barcode based on a scaled version of the black\/white sequence pattern optimized for the user's mobile device.","Transferring the processing of barcode rendering from a server-side processing module to client-side processing module avoids the need for a rules database for mobile devices on a server and potentially results in less data to transfer over the network and less server-side processing power.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100"]},"The processing of the client barcode renderer is presented from the perspective of an agent that processes as an application on a user's mobile device to render barcodes. Conventionally, barcodes are rendered from a server and pushed to the user's mobile device, which is less than ideal in many situations. Here, the client barcode renderer processes on a user's mobile device and dynamically renders barcodes for the user based on capabilities and settings for the mobile device to optimize the barcode that is rendered on the mobile device.","In an embodiment, the client barcode renderer is a browser application that is pushed to and executes on the mobile device from within a browser of the mobile device. In such a case, it may be that a server provides the barcode control data in a format that can be interpreted by standards, such as scalable vector graphics and the like.","As used herein, \u201coptimization\u201d refers to customizing barcode image details based on capabilities and\/or configuration settings of a particular user's mobile device.","At , the client barcode renderer receives barcode control information from a barcode distributer. Example processing associated with a barcode distributer is presented below with reference to the . The barcode control information is not a barcode and is not image data that is capable of being scanned; rather, the data is in a format that can be translated on the device (mobile device that is also processing the client barcode renderer) into a barcode image that then can be read or scanned by a barcode reader\/scanner from a display of the device.","According to an embodiment, at , the client barcode renderer acquires the barcode control information in a vector format from the barcode distributer (discussed with reference to the  below).","In another case, at , the client barcode renderer acquires the barcode control information as data that is to be represented in the barcode image.","So, continuing with the embodiment of  and at , the client barcode renderer obtains some of the data as syntactical and semantic descriptions for describing how the client barcode renderer is to render the data to the barcode image.","In another scenario of  and at , the client barcode renderer identifies bits of the data as representing squares of predefined pixel sizes. An indication as to whether a particular square is to be black is identified via set bits or was to whether a particular square is to be white is identified via unset bits.","At , the client barcode renderer acquires image and resolution settings and capabilities from the device. This is the same device that the client barcode renderer is processing on and is a mobile device of the user, such as a mobile phone, a laptop, a tablet and the like.","According to an embodiment, at , the client barcode renderer obtains the image and resolution settings and capabilities as one or more of: a screen size for a display of the device and a resolution capability attribute for the screen size and the display.","Continuing with the embodiment of  and at , the client barcode renderer identifies the resolution capability attribute as a value for pixel resolution and spatial resolution for the display.","In still another case, of  and at , the client barcode renderer identifies a scaling factor for the barcode image based on the screen size and resolution for the display of the device.","It is noted that the client barcode renderer can utilize existing application programming interface (API) commands of an operating system (OS) for the device to acquire existing settings and for acquiring device capabilities with respect to image processing. Alternatively, another application that has access for acquiring these values can be used by the client barcode renderer to obtain the values. In such a case, the client barcode renderer interacts with an API of that application.","At , the client barcode renderer translates the barcode control information into a barcode image on the device for access from the device, via a display of the device, based on the image resolution settings and capabilities.","It is noted that a setting is viewed as a value that a user currently has the device configured for whereas a capability is a limit for an image attribute value that the device is capable of handling. In this manner, each user's existing settings can be inspected to tailor the translation of the barcode image for optimal scanning on the device.","According to an embodiment, at , the client barcode renderer changes a setting of the device to an increased setting for higher resolution when the device is identified as having a lower setting than is permitted by the device. Here, the user has the device configured for a lower image processing resolution than the device is capable of handling and the client barcode renderer changes the device setting to increase resolution of the barcode image being translated. It may also be that the client barcode renderer can reset the setting back to a lower resolution once the barcode image is translated and\/or presented to a barcode scanner\/reader.","In one scenario, at , the client barcode renderer stores the barcode image on the device for subsequent access. That is, the barcode image may not be immediately needed by the user or may be used multiple times by the user. Therefore, the client barcode renderer can store the barcode image for retrieval on the device as needed.","In yet another situation, at , the client barcode renderer renders the barcode image to a display of the device for scanning by a barcode reader\/scanner.","In an embodiment, at , the client barcode renderer changes an orientation and a brightness setting for presenting the barcode image on the device. This can be done when the barcode image is being rendered to the display of the device for reading\/scanning.","In still another case, at , the client barcode renderer stores the image resolution settings and capabilities in a file within the device for subsequent recall when translating other barcode images. This can be useful as so that subsequent barcode translations do not require reacquiring the image resolution settings and capabilities.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200"]},"In an embodiment, the barcode distributer describes processing actions from the perspective of a specific server that is interacting with the client barcode render described above with reference to the . So, in an embodiment, the barcode distributer interacts with the client barcode render represented by the method  of the  and discussed in detail above.","At , the barcode distributer receives a request for a barcode. This can occur in a few different manners.","For example, at , the barcode distributer receives the request from an enterprise service that is transaction with a user via a mobile device.","In another situation, at , the barcode distributer receives the request from a user or a barcode renderer, such as the barcode renderer described above with reference to the .","At , the barcode distributer defines the barcode in terms of control data. That is, the barcode control data is not image data that can be scanned and it is the barcode control data that is a barcode renderer over the network not a barcode image.","According to an embodiment, at , the barcode distributer decrypts an image for the barcode into the control data.","In another case, at , the barcode distributer translates the barcode into: a vector format, a bitmap format, or a symbol format for representation as the control data.","At , the barcode distributer transmits the control data to a barcode renderer over a network for subsequent translation by the barcode renderer on a mobile device into the barcode.

Example processing associated with the barcode render  was presented above in detail with respect to the .","The barcode render  is configured to interact with the barcode distributer  to acquire barcode control data. Again, the barcode control data is not a barcode and cannot be scanned or read by a barcode scanner\/reader.","The barcode render  is also configured to obtain image resolution and settings for the first machine of the barcode render  for purposes of tailoring and customizing the translation of the barcode control data into a barcode that can be scanned or read by a barcode scanner\/reader from a display of the first machine.","The barcode distributer  processes on a physical machine or a Virtual Machine (VM) (second machine) and is operational over a network.
