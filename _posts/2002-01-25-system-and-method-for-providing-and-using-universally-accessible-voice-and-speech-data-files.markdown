title: System and method for providing and using universally accessible voice and speech data files
abstract: A system and method provides universal access to voice-based documents containing information formatted using MIME and HTML standards using customized extensions for voice information access and navigation. These voice documents are linked using HTML hyper-links that are accessible to subscribers using voice commands, touch-tone inputs and other selection means. These voice documents and components in them are addressable using HTML anchors embedding HTML universal resource locators (URLs) rendering them universally accessible over the Internet. This collection of connected documents forms a voice web. The voice web includes subscriber-specific documents including speech training files for speaker dependent speech recognition, voice print files for authenticating the identity of a user and personal preference and attribute files for customizing other aspects of the system in accordance with a specific subscriber.

This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 to all of the above identified applications.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to the construction and use of distributed interactive voice and speech processing systems, including interactive voice response (IVR) systems and voice messaging (VM) systems. More particularly, the invention relates to form based publishing of voice information and the use of universally accessible personal profiles for authentication of the user by voice signatures and generating context sensitive active vocabularies to improve speaker dependent speech recognition. The invention also relates to the use of the user attributes and preferences stored in universally accessible personal profiles to improve the efficiency of navigation and search as well as efficacy of search results pertaining to user queries.","2. Description of the Related Art","Conventional interactive voice response (IVR) systems allow a user to place a telephone call into a system, navigate (generally using touch tone input) through a hierarchy of options in response to voice prompts and retrieve information stored in a computer database. Airlines, banks, credit companies and many other service organizations are just a few examples of the types of businesses using IVR systems to allow a customer (or prospective customer) to retrieve desired information. These conventional systems are generally organization-specific in that they offer access to a single database or set of databases related to the goods, services or other aspects of the organization maintaining the IVR system. Thus, conventional IVR technology is used to offer access to information specific to a single organization (i.e. a specific airline, bank or credit company). For example airlines typically use IVR to allow callers to access flight arrival and departure information or to select reservation options, for the particular airline only.","It is desirable to provide an IVR system that enables access to an aggregation of databases and services rather than a single database and service. One barrier to the provision of aggregated services in an IVR system is that conventional IVR systems do not have a distributed information publishing means. Conventional IVR systems do not have a mechanism for service information providers to readily access the IVR system and add updated or entirely new information for publication on the IVR system.","Further, conventional IVR systems are generally configured for uniform access by any caller admitted to the IVR system. Each caller is handled by the system in the same manner and offered an identical set of options. One reason that IVR systems use uniform user interfaces for each caller rather than caller-specific configurations is that conventional IVR systems operate in \u201cclosed\u201d computer environments hosting the particular IVR system. Thus, when a caller accesses a conventional IVR system, the only caller-specific information which the system has at its disposal, is any information previously provided by the caller which the system has maintained or any information that is provided by the caller during the IVR session (i.e. when a user enters an account number using touch tone telephone input). Because, however, collecting and storing caller-specific information with conventional technology is cumbersome and time consuming, most IVR systems do not offer caller-specific (caller customized) features.","There are numerous applications in which it is desirable for an IVR system to use caller-specific information in handling a call. Caller-specific information in the form of user preferences can aid in minimizing the size of a command tree which the user must navigate to access desired information. Additionally, caller specific information could also be used to authenticate the identity of a user in cases where security is an issue (i.e. in bank and credit contexts). Further, caller-specific speech training profiles could be used to implement speaker dependent speech recognition to allow for a caller to use voice commands in place of touch-tone commands. Still further, an IVR system having access to caller-specific data could be used to apply IVR technology in new application areas such as personal productivity.","Thus, there is a need for an improved voice and speech processing system that provides universal access to caller-specific information to provide user-customized IVR systems. Further, there is a need to provide universal access to voice and speech files in order to allow widespread use of such files for caller authentication and for performing speaker dependent speech recognition in IVR systems.","The system and method of the present invention extends World Wide Web (referred to herein as \u201cwww\u201d or the \u201cweb\u201d) and Internet technology to provide universally accessible caller-specific profiles that are accessed by one or more IVR systems. The invention features a set of web pages containing information (components) formatted using MIME and hypertext markup language (HTML) standards with extensions for voice information access and navigation. These web pages are linked using HTML hyper-links that are accessible to users via voice commands and touch-tone inputs. These web pages and components in them are addressable using HTML anchors and links embedding HTML universal (uniform) resource locators (URLs) rendering them universally accessible over the Internet. This collection of connected web pages are referred to herein as the \u201cvoice web\u201d and the individual pages are referred to herein as \u201cvoice web pages\u201d. Each web page in the voice web contains a specially tagged set of key words and touch tone sequences that are associated with embedded anchors and links used for navigation within the web.","In addition, the invention features a set of linked HTML pages representing the user's \u201cpersonal profile\u201d. The personal profile contains user's attributes and preferences. Attributes include user's name, address, phone number, personal identification code, voice imprints for authentication, speech training profile and other information. Preferences include, configuration preferences such as personal greetings and gender and language selection, selection preferences such as bookmarks and favorite places and presentation preferences such as priority ordering, default overrides and preferred vocabulary.","The personal profile is designed for component access within web pages allowing easy extraction of context sensitive profile information. In particular, speech training profiles (included as a user attribute and which contain word patterns representing speaker dependent training information) partitioned into sets of related words likely to occur in combination within corresponding voice web pages. A set of command and control words such as \u201cplay, pause, continue, previous, next, home, reload, help, etc.\u201d are stored in a top level component set enabling user dependent but context independent navigation and control. Other component sets are designed to match the key word sets in corresponding voice web pages such as a calendar page or an address book page enabling user and context dependent navigation and control.","When a user calls into the distributed voice and speech processing system associated with the voice web, the system first identifies the user utilizing a unique account number (such as phone number or social security number). Next, it accesses the user's personal profile using the corresponding URL and retrieves the user attributes and preferences related to authentication and security. Using this personal profile information, the voice web system authenticates the identity of the user using a combination of personal identification code based password checking and voice imprint matching. The voice imprint is any sufficiently long utterance or phrase that the user has previously entered into his\/her profile. Each user's voice imprint is analyzed and stored in the profile for quick matching on demand with a real-time provided user sample. The combination of every individual's unique vocal characteristics stored in the voice imprint coupled with the random choice of the password phrase ensures a high degree of security and authentication.","Once authenticated, the user is allowed to navigate and access more information from the voice web using voice commands. In order to effectively accomplish this task, the voice web system retrieves the context independent command and control key word set from the user's speech profile.","The voice web system then presents a top level voice web personal home page for user's perusal. At the same time, it retrieves the set of word recognition patterns associated with the key words in the presented page from the user's speech profile. Thus, the system is able to match the active vocabulary and associated speaker dependent word patterns dynamically in a context sensitive manner. The process continues as the user navigates from page to page. The voice web system dynamically retrieves the suitable subset of training word patterns from the user's speech profile matching the voice navigation key words in the page being presented to the user.","The process described above greatly reduces the size of the training information that needs to be retrieved at any time while significantly enhancing accuracy of speech recognition using speaker dependent training profiles. Since the speech profile is constructed using HTML pages and components, it is universally accessible using its URL. This enables the user to call into any compatible Internet connected voice web system in user's proximity from anywhere in the world, identify himself\/herself to the system and then enable the system to dynamically retrieve suitable information that enhances his\/her navigation and access of the information stored in the voice web using voice commands and input.","In addition to the user attribute information discussed above, the personal profile contains user preferences relative to configuration, presentation and information selection. These preferences are components within the personal profile pages and are easily available to the voice web system for dynamic retrieval. For example, if the user requests his\/her stock portfolio from the voice web, it first retrieves the user's preferred portfolio of companies from his\/her profile and applies this list to limit the search on stock quotes from all companies. The user gets exactly the information relevant to his\/her interest in exactly the order of priority he\/she prefers.","The figures depict a preferred embodiment of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","102","105","101","102","105","101","107","100","105","111","109"]},"Internet  is a system of linked communications networks that facilitate communication among computers which are coupled to internet . Generally, internets such as Internet  facilitate communication by providing file transfer, electronic mail and news group services. Internet  is preferably the Internet which evolved from the ARPANET and which is publicly accessible world wide. It should be understood however, that the principles of the present invention apply to other internets and even closed (private) networks such as corporate intranets.","It should be noted that system  may include numerous voice web sites  and numerous voice web gateways . A single voice web site  and a single voice web gateway  are shown in , however, to keep the figure uncluttered. Thus, voice web system  is a collection of voice web gateways  and voice web sites  connected over internet  enabling subscribers  to access voice web pages  via their telephones as shown in FIG. .","A voice web page  is web page specified using a navigable markup language that includes voice extensions. A navigable markup language is an enhanced type of markup language that facilitates publication navigation and access of information stored in documents specified in the navigable markup language. An exemplary markup language is the Hypertext Markup Language 2.0, RFC1866, HTML working group of Internet Engineering Task Force, Sep. 22, 1995, edited by D. Connolly published on the www at the following uniform resource locator (URL) address: http:\/\/w3.org\/pub\/www\/Markup\/html-spec.","A markup language is a language that includes a set of conventions for marking portions of a document so that, when accessed by a parsing program such as a web browser, each marked portion is presented to a user with a distinctive format. In contrast to formatting codes used by word processing programs, markup language codes, called tags, do not specify exactly how the tagged portion should be presented. Instead the tags inform the web browser (parser) that the information is in a certain portion of a document such as title, heading, form or text and the like. The web browser (parser) determines how to present the tagged information.","A navigable markup language is an enhanced markup language that uses tags that are anchors and that are links. When these link and anchor tags are invoked, a user is then presented another navigable markup language document in accordance with the link and anchor tags. This link is sometimes called a hyperlink. A hyperlink is a reference to another markup language document which when invoked facilitates access of the referenced markup language document.","A navigable markup language thus uses attributes, tags and values that enable (i) a publisher to specify the presentation of information to a user, (ii) a user to interactively access the stored information; and (iii) a user to access other navigable markup language documents using hyperlinks.","The navigable markup language used to specify voice web pages  is HyperVoice Markup Language (HVML). HVML is a version of HTML that includes voice extensions as described in Appendix A, incorporated herein by reference. Voice web pages  include HVML tags and attributes that extend HTML to facilitate publication, navigation and access to voice information. For example, HVML specifies functions and protocols that facilitate voice and speech processing including voice authentication, speaker dependent speech recognition, voice information publishing (e.g. creating a voice form) and voice navigation.","Just as conventional web documents are displayed for the user, voice web documents  are \u201cplayed\u201d to a subscriber over a telephone. A voice web page  is played (by voice web browser ) by sequentially presenting the embedded voice components according to the HVML and MIME specifications.","While a conventional web site enables on-demand access over an internet to conventional web pages, voice web site  enables on demand access to voice web pages . Voice web site  is a computer that hosts voice web pages  and serves them up to other computers (i.e. voice web gateway ). More specifically, voice web server  is a computer configured with conventional web server software  and which has access to stored voice web pages . A voice web site  additionally optionally includes a subscriber directory  that stores a list of registered system subscribers. Voice web site  stores, serves and manages voice web pages  and can execute associated external scripts or programs in accordance with the present invention. These external scripts and programs interface with databases and other information sources both internal and external to web site .","Voice web gateway  is a computer connected to the Internet . Voice web gateway  also includes a conventional voice telecommunications interface  for coupling to the public switched telephone network (PSTN)  for telephonic communications with a subscriber . Telephone  is any voice enabling telecommunications device. Exemplary telephones include conventional desktop telephones, portable telephones, cellular telephones, analog telephones, digital telephones, smart phones and a computer configured to operate as a telephone and perform telephonic functions. Thus voice web pages  are universally accessible from any ordinary telephone . Alternatively, a subscriber  may access voice web pages  either by using a subscriber interface local to voice web gateway  (i.e. a direct user interface with voice web gateway ) or by dialing into voice web gateway  using another computer such as a personal digital assistant or a smart phone.","Voice telecommunications interface  serves as an interface between a voice web browser  and telephone  and preferably includes conventional telephony and voice processing hardware and software enabling voice web gateway  to receive and answer telephone calls, respond to touch tone and voice commands, route and conference calls, play voice prompts and record voice messages.","Voice web gateway  additionally hosts a voice web browser . Voice web browser  is a computer program capable of accessing and processing voice web pages  in response to a request placed by subscriber . More specifically, voice web browser  (i) processes voice and touch tone activated subscriber commands, (ii) retrieves requested voice web pages  from the appropriate voice web site , (iii) interprets the embedded markup language (HVML) in the retrieved voice web page  and (iv) delivers the contents of a voice web page  to a subscriber  over the telephone . In performing the above-mentioned processing, voice web browser  executes scripts, including \u201cvoice scripts\u201d embedded in a voice web page . Voice web browser  provides a subscriber  with fast, easy, convenient voice activated navigation and access to voice web pages .","Voice web browser  is a conventional web browser modified with appropriate voice information playback and recording extensions and enhancements. Appendix A includes a specification of HVML and voice web browser commands and is incorporated herein by reference.","Some voice web pages  contain references to scripts and programs that operate as service agents ) to respond to subscriber requests as well as external events and carry out prescribed actions. These scripts and programs are externally stored on voice web sites  (for example as Common Gateway Interface (CGI) Scripts or Internet Services Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) programs). These external scripts and programs execute in the voice web server  environment as a service agent . The external scripts and programs that comprise service agents  are referred to by URLs embedded in an associated voice web page . In the case of a voice web page  that is a voice form, the script or program associated with the service agent executes in response to voice form submission by a subscriber . Service agents  follow standard Internet protocols such as HTTP, and conform to conventional formats such as MIME and application programming interfaces (APIs) such as CGI and ISAPI.","Conventional web pages are designed primarily for presentation on a computer color monitor and navigation by a mouse and key board. As such, graphics, images and text are the primary media types supported widely. Although, audio, video and 3-dimensional graphics extensions are becoming available, these extensions are directed primarily at computer users and not telephone users.","Voice web pages  consist of HTML pages that have been extended with Hyper Voice Markup Language (HVML) for easy and effective navigation and access of voice information via a voice activated device such as an ordinary telephone. Voice web pages  retain all the properties and behavior of conventional HTML pages such as HTML markup tags, universal identifiers (URLs), and hyper-links and can be accessed by a conventional web browser using HTTP protocols from a conventional web server. The additional markup tags are interpreted by an HVML extended web browser to enable subscribers  to navigate and access voice web pages  over the phone or similar voice activated device. Appendix A includes a specification of HVML and voice web browser commands and is incorporated herein by reference.","HVML pages web pages voice web page  are specially designed for presentation using an ordinary telephone  and navigation using touch tones and voice commands. This is in contrast to conventional multimedia web pages that may embed audio data to be presented on a multimedia personal computer using its speakers and navigated using its mouse, key board and microphone. Although, HVML voice web pages  can be embedded in generic multimedia web pages, thus sharing some of the information, they are designed to be presented using an ordinary phone and navigated using commands generated by touch tone signals and speech recognition.","An HVML web page (voice web page ) is first and foremost an HTML page. Each web page  has a unique universal resource locator (URL) (also called uniform resource locator). A URL is a string of characters that uniquely identifies an internet resource including an identification of (i) the access protocol to be used; (ii) an indication of resource type; and an identification of its location in the computer network. For example, the following fictitious URL identifies a www document: http:\/\/www.voiscorp.com\/banner.gif uniquely identifies the location of a resource on the world wide web computer network. \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d indicates the access protocol. \u201cwww.voiscorp.com\u201d is the domain name of the computer on which the resource is located. \u201cbanner\u201d is the name of the resource located on the computer specified by the domain name. \u201cgif\u201d indicates that the banner resource is a gif (graphical interchange file) type resource. Similarly, the following fictitious URL uniquely identifies the location of a voice web page : http:\/\/www.voiscorp.com\/voicememo.hvml. In this example, \u201cvoicememo\u201d is the name of the resource located on the computer specified by the domain name. \u201chvml\u201d indicates that the voicememo resource is an hvml type resource. Thus, web pages  are each uniquely identified by their corresponding URL. Once located, a web page  can be created, edited and played using existing web publication tools, it can be stored on any conventional web server anywhere on the Internet, it can be accessed by any conventional web browser and presented on a computer monitor, it can be navigated using the computer's mouse, keyword, and (with some additional plug-ins) microphone, and it can contain embedded anchors and hyper links to other HTML pages, including other HVML pages.","Voice web pages  are designed for three primary purposes: (i) presenting structured voice information to a user; (ii) enabling the user to navigate across and within voice pages; and (iii) capturing user input for information queries or submission.","a. HVML Presentation. Presentation of voice information is accomplished primarily by the voice tag. The voice tag has a type attribute which specifies the type of voice information to be presented. If the type attribute has the file value, the voice information is obtained from a voice file specified by its URL. If the type attribute has the text value, the voice information is synthesized from the specified text. If the type attribute has number, ordinal, currency, date, or character value, then the voice information is generated by concatenating voice fragments from a pre-recorded indexed system voice file. If the type attribute has the stream value, then the voice information is obtained from the voice stream specified by its URL. Composition of several voice elements into a seamless voice string is accomplished by the voice-string tag.","Combining these tags, publishers can compose and present: (i) pre-recorded voice prompts and messages; (ii) voice prompts generated using text-to-speech technology; and (iii) Pre-formatted voice prompts with dynamic speech synthesis elements.","b. HVML Navigation. Navigation of voice web pages  is primarily accomplished by extending the HTML anchor tag with new attributes\u2014tone and label. These attributes are used in conjunction with the existing href attribute in an anchor element that makes the anchor into a hyper link. When the user selects the touch tone signals specified by the value of the tone attribute or utters the word specified by the label attribute, the browser invokes the corresponding hyper link. The tone and label attribute values must be unique within a page. Navigation is also accomplished by system commands such as next, previous, reload, home, bookmarks, help, fax, and history which are invoked by specific touch tone sequences or utterance of the words. Users can control the voice browser operations by issuing system commands such as stop, start, play, pause, exit, backup, and forward. Using these attributes, publishers can enable (i) touch tone command and control and link navigation; (ii) pre-defined, system and user specific, spoken command and control key word recognition; and (iii) page and user specific spoken command and control key word recognition.","c. HVML Forms. HVML uses the form tag to enable user input similar to HTML including the method attribute which specifies the way parameters are passed to the server and the action attribute which specifies the procedure to be invoked by the server to process the form. HVML extends the input tag within forms by introducing voice-input tag. Voice-input takes a type attribute similar to the input tag with three new values \u201cvoice\u201d, \u201ctone\u201d and \u201creview\u201d in addition to the existing \u201creset\u201d and \u201csubmit\u201d values. The HVML browser pauses at each voice-input statement in a HVML form until the specified input is supplied or input is terminated, before processing the remaining form. Using these tags and attributes, publishers can enable: (i) touch tone command and control and parameter input; (ii) pre-defined, user specific, spoken alphabet and digit input; (iii) page and user specific, spoken key word and proper names input; and (iv) free form voice information input.","Syntactic and structural intelligence, such as in-line pre-recorded voice prompts, pre-formatted voice prompts with dynamically generated voice elements, key word accessible anchor elements, voice responsive hyper links etc. are embedded in voice web pages  through voice access extensions to HTML. Behavioral intelligence including command interpretation, page access, file caching, HVML interpretation and user interaction is embedded voice web browser  (the HVML browser). Voice web browser  has the following states: (i) waiting for user commands; (ii) active accessing and playing HVML pages; and (iii) paused for user input.","Initially, voice web browser  is launched upon the system's receipt of a subscriber's telephone call. Once launched, voice web browser  goes through an initialization sequence that includes subscriber authentication and normally becomes \u201cactive\u201d accessing and playing the subscriber's home page. Once the home page is played, voice web browser  \u201cwaits\u201d for subscriber commands. As part of playing the page, the browser may \u201cpause\u201d for subscriber input and continue once the input is provided.","Independent of any specific voice web page  that a subscriber may be accessing, voice web browser  provides a set of navigational and operational commands. Within the telephone key pad, \u201c*\u201d and \u201c#\u201d are special keys that generate unique tones. Voice web browser  has special meaning for these keys. In general, the \u201c*\u201d key followed by a sequence of touch tones, excluding the \u201c#\u201d key, signals a browser command, an escape or a skip and the \u201c#\u201d key signals a link activation, termination of form input, termination of a key sequence or a selection.","Voice wet system  can be used to provide voice web services to a subscriber . A voice web service is a service that provides on-line telephone based access to information. The information is presented to the user through the publication of voice web pages . The information presented to (published for) the subscriber may be information retrieved from a single information source or a combination of information sources including publicly accessible on-line databases, information proprietary to voice web system , information previously stored by subscriber  or another information source. Exemplary services provided by voice web system  include (i) personal information services such as calendar, address book, electronic mail, voice mail, (ii) information services such as headline news, weather reports, sports score, stock portfolio quotes, business white pages, yellow pages, classified information and (iii) transaction services (commerce services) such as banking, bill payments, stock trading, airline hotel and restaurant reservations and catalog store orders.","Users gain access to voice web services by becoming voice web subscribers . Subscribers  preferably sign up (e.g. register) for services through a service provider. In one embodiment, each subscriber  is assigned a unique account number on a calling card and subscribers  access the voice web system  by dialing a single \u201c800\u201d (e.g. toll free) service phone number and by then supplying their account number via the telephone . In an alternative embodiment, the services are publicly available and any user placing a call into the system is processed as a subscriber  without requiring any registration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["200","107","200","105","202","101","200","102","201","203","202","200","204"]},"Voice web service agents  are a type of service agent  (shown in ) that execute on service site  to provide voice web services to a subscriber . Voice web service agents  are therefore scripts and programs represented by a web page  (show in FIG. ).","Service database  is a database of service information. The content of the service information varies with the type of service being provided. For example, if voice web system  is configured to deliver a business white page service, then service database  is a database of address and phone number listings for businesses. If voice web system  is additionally or alternatively configured to deliver news headlines, then voice web system  includes a service database  that includes current news headlines.","Service forms and pages  are voice web pages  that are HVML templates (voice forms and pages) that are \u201cfilled in\u201d in response to a specific subscriber request. Service pages and forms  are used to gather subscriber input, to retrieve information and to deliver (publish) information to a subscriber. Some service pages  are database entry and administration forms, some are database query forms and others are database response pages. Entry forms are used to add information to the database. Query forms are used to extract information from the database. Response pages are used to present retrieved information to the user. In the preferred embodiment, service agents dynamically generate service and pages forms  by retrieving requested data from service database  and using the retrieved data in place of corresponding variables stored in an HVML template. The HVML templates link to each other specifying request-response dependencies. Thus, subscribers  are able to enter and retrieve information in personal and external databases over internet  using web protocols without having to create a voice web page for each entry in service database .","Service agent  typically uses a service database  and a set of service pages and forms  to provide the corresponding voice web service. The service database  hosts the information that subscribers  wish to access. The service forms allow subscribers  to input and query information in service database .

The appointments service enables a subscriber to track personal and business appointments in a voice-based calendar. The subscriber thus adds and retrieves appointments over the phone using personal voice web . In addition to providing day and time information related to stored appointments, a subscriber may also store voice note annotations that is associated with a particular appointment.","Address book page  is used to provide an address service. The address service enables a subscriber to add and retrieve address, phone number, and other information related to individual names or company names. The information added and retrieved is stored in a address book service database private to the subscriber.","Stock portfolio page  is used to provide a stock quote service. The stock service enables a subscriber to retrieve current stock pricing and portfolio valuation information as well as statistical information related to changes in portfolio or stock positions. The stock service uses information retrieved from a stock portfolio service database private to the subscriber and additionally retrieves current stock pricing information from an on-line data-base or information source.","News headlines page  is used to provide a news service. The news service enables a subscriber to retrieve news headlines related to subscriber customized topics.","Mail box page  is used to provide a mailbox service. The mailbox service enables a subscriber to access electronic mail (e-mail) messages. The e-mail messages are played for the subscriber using text to speech conversion and a speech synthesizer.","Business white pages home page  is used to provide a white page service. The white page service enables a subscriber to enter partial company name, and optionally city name and state code to retrieve the company's full name, address and phone number.","Each service page - is part of a collection of voice forms and pages that are used by the corresponding service agent to retrieve a request from the subscriber, generate an appropriate database query responsive to the subscriber-request, retrieve subscriber-requested information, and generate a voice web page that incorporates the retrieved information and that is adapted for presentation (publication) to the subscriber using a voice web browser. Thus, for example the service agent associated with calendar and appointments page  generates a voice form for prompting a subscriber for month, day and year information. After receiving the prompted information, calendar and appointments service agent generates the appropriate query to extract the requested calendar information from a calendar service database. Once the calendar information is retrieved from the database, the calendar and appointments service agent generates a voice web page that includes the retrieved information. The new page is then presented (published) to the subscriber over the telephone by the voice web browser.","Each of the other personal service agents associated with personal service pages - operate in a similar way to provide a subscriber with information retrieved from associated service databases.","Personal helpdesk page  is linked to personal voice web helpdesk service pages  including, by way of example, a hotels page , an airlines page , a rental cars page , a travel agents page , a restaurants page , a financial services page , and a banks page . The personal helpdesk page has an associated personal helpdesk agent that is used to provide a set of helpdesk services. Helpdesk services enable a subscriber to access product, pricing, availability and other information of the corresponding services.","Hotels page  is used to provide a hotel reservation service. Airlines page  is used to provide an airline booking service. Rental cars page  is used to provide a rental car reservation service. Travel agents page  is used to provide a travel service. Restaurants page  is used to provide a menu and reservations service. Financial services page  is used to provide a financial service.

The personal commerce page provides commerce services that enables a subscriber to access catalogs associated with various retail establishments. As part of the commerce service, the personal voice web allows a subscriber to shop in various catalogs and then submit orders for selected items directly to the sponsor of the associated catalog. Orders are submitted to the catalog sponsor either as a voice web form or conventional web form sent to the sponsor, as an electronic message or using another means.","Personal profile page  links to a set of personalized voice web profile pages including an authentication page , a speech profile page , and an attributes and preferences page .","User authentication page  contains authenticating information including a subscriber account number, an encrypted password or personal identification number and links to a voice authentication signature MIME resource.","Speech profile page  is linked to a hierarchy of speech training pages that correspond to the hierarchy of personal voice web .  shows the hierarchy  of speech training pages -. Speech training pages - are sets of pre-captured training files to be used in performing speaker dependent speech recognition in providing the corresponding service to a subscriber. Each speech training page is thus accessed by the corresponding agent in performing the corresponding service.

Calendar attributes and preferences information for multiple subscribers is stored in the subscriber calendar attributes and preferences profile database (a service database). Calendar service specific speech training information for multiple subscribers is stored in the subscriber calendar speech training profile database (a service database).

In order to access a personal voice web, the subscriber calls the service calling number and uses account information and the PIN to initiate a subscriber authentication process.  is a flow diagram of a subscriber authentication method  in accordance with the present invention. The subscriber authentication method  includes authentication signature creation form processing and subscriber authentication processing.","A subscriber initiates access  of his or her personal voice web  by calling the service calling number using a conventional telephone or a similar voice activated device computer configured to access the public telephone network. After the subscriber initiates access , a login agent starts login processing .","During login processing , the login agent answers the call and presents a standard login form to the subscriber. A login form is a voice form for collecting and submitting login information including subscriber account number and the subscriber PIN. After a subscriber enters the login information (into the login form) and submits the login form, the login agent uses the login information to retrieve the URL of the subscriber's personal voice web home page . The login agent retrieves the URL by looking up the subscriber's account number in the voice web subscriber directory. The login agent additionally verifies the PIN which was submitted. Upon verification of the PIN, the login agent presents  the subscriber's voice authentication form to the subscriber over the telephone. As part of the presentation, the login agent requests the subscriber to supply a personalized voice authentication sample. The login agent then waits  for the subscriber to supply the sample and submit  the form. After the subscriber submits  the form, the login agent processes  the submitted form. During processing  of the submitted form, the login agent accesses the subscriber's personal authentication page from the subscriber's personal voice web profile (linked to the subscriber's home page) and attempts to retrieve the voice authentication signature. If this is the first time the subscriber is accessing the service, the signature will be missing from the subscriber's authentication page. In this case, the login agent presents  the authentication signature creation form to the subscriber.","Using the options presented in the signature creation form, the subscriber selects the option to create or modify the personal voice authentication signature. Following the instructions provided by the login agent, the subscriber fills in  the voice authentication signature creation form and records a personalized voice phrase as an authentication signature. After filling in  the signature creation form, the subscriber submits the form to the login agent. The login agent waits until the signature creation form is submitted . The login agent then processes  the recorded phrase converting it into a signature pattern and linking it to the user authentication page as a MIME resource for future verification.","If however, after processing , the login agent determines that there is an authentication signature stored in the subscriber's personal profile then the login agent perform a test  to determine whether there is a match between the stored authentication signature and the voice sample submitted by the subscriber. If test  determines that there is a match between the sample and the signature, then the subscriber is given access to the personal voice web and the voice web. Test  uses conventional voice authentication methods. A \u201cmatch\u201d is determined by test  when the conventional voice authentication method determines that the speaker's voice print or voice signature matches a master stored voice print or voice signature within a specified tolerance. If, however, the test determines that there is not a match between the sample and the signature, then the subscriber is denied access .","Automatic speech recognition falls into three categories: speaker dependent, speaker adaptive, and speaker independent. A speaker dependent system is developed to work for a single speaker and are usually easier to develop, cheaper to buy and more accurate but requires the use of user-specific speech training files.","The size of the vocabulary of a speech recognition system affects the complexity, processing requirements and the accuracy of the system. Referring now again to , personal voice web  uses small to medium sized vocabularies (ten to hundred of words).","An isolated-word or discrete speech system operates on single words at a time requiring a pause between each word utterance. This conventional type of speech recognition is a simple form of recognition to perform because the end points are easier to find and the pronunciation of a word tends not to affect others. As the occurrences of the words are more consistent and sharply delimited they are easier to recognize. Personal voice web  focuses on discrete speech and in particular on speech used for command and control.","Personal voice web  typically uses speech coded at 8 kHz using 8 bit samples resulting in 64 kbps bandwidth and storage. Conventional adaptive pulse code modulation (ADPCM) techniques can reduce the bandwidth to 16 kbps without loss of information.","Personal voice web  uses conventional speaker dependent recognition of discrete speech. This conventional speaker dependent recognition relies on digital sampling of the word utterances. After sampling, the next stage is acoustic signal processing. Most techniques include spectral analysis. This is followed by recognition of phonemes, groups of phonemes and words. This stage uses many conventional processes such as Dynamic Time Warping, Hidden Markov Modeling, Neural Networks, expert systems and combination of techniques. Hidden Markov Modeling based techniques are commonly used and generally the most successful approach. Additionally, personal voice web  uses some knowledge of the language to aid the recognition process.","Personal voice web  improves speaker dependent recognition of discrete speech in a command and control context using universally accessible personal speech training profiles -.

Specifically, the service agent obtains the speech training profile, embeds it in the service page as a MIME resource and forwards it to the voice web browser which uses the training profiles to improve recognition. Thus, responding to the subscriber's voice commands pertinent to the accessed voice web service page, the voice web browser recognizes the command and control word utterances (the subscriber's voice commands that are submitted ) and matches them against the personalized vocabulary in the corresponding voice web speech training page for accurate speaker dependent recognition of discrete speech.","If the subscriber requests access to a new service page linked to a currently accessible service page, the currently active service agent exits  the current service and then invokes  the requested service. During the invocation of the requested service, the requested voice web service page corresponding to the requested service is loaded as well as the corresponding speech training page containing the matching command and control vocabulary.

The hyperlink for the indexed fragment uses the regular URL for the page concatenated with the fragment's unique label with a \u201c#\u201d separator.","Coupled with voice responsive hyper links, fragment labels can be used to construct simple menus or database searches.","For example:","Suppose \u201cmyweb\/home\/prompts.vml\u201d contains the following HVML text.\n\n","Suppose another HVML page contains the following hyperlinks.\n\n","Then, if the user presses \u201c1, #\u201d, the browser will fetch the \u201cmyweb\/home\/prompts.vml\u201d HVML page, match \u201cprompt\u201d index with the first anchor's \u201cprompt\u201d label, and start presenting the prompts starting with text-to-speech translation of \u201cPress CAL# for Calendar\u201d.","Browser Control",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0156","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0018","list-style":"none"},"li":"<PAUSE TIMEOUT=\u201c% seconds %\u201d TERMINATE=\u201c% tone %\u201d>"}},"In order to let the voice page publisher to control the behavior of the voice browser, HVML defines a tag \u201cPause\u201d with \u201cTIMEOUT\u201d and \u201cTERMINATE\u201d attributes. When the browser encounters a PAUSE statement, it pauses until either the amount of time specified in the TIMEOUT attribute elapses or the user enters the tone specified in the \u201cTERMINATE\u201d attribute. If the values of the TIMEOUT attribute is 0, then the browser waits there indefinitely. The default value for TIMEOUT is 1 second. Default value for TERMINATE is \u201c#\u201d.","Voice Responsive Forms","HVML uses the FORM tag to enable user input similar to HTML including the METHOD attribute which specifies the way parameters are passed to the server and the ACTION attribute which specifies the procedure to be invoked by the server to process the form. HVML extends the INPUT tag within forms by introducing VOICEINPUT tag. VOICEINPUT takes a TYPE attribute similar to the INPUT tag with three new values \u201cvoice\u201d, \u201ctone\u201d and \u201creview\u201d in addition to the existing \u201creset\u201d and \u201csubmit\u201d values. The HVML browser pauses at each VOICEINPUT statement in a HVML form until the specified input is supplied or input is terminated before processing the remaining form.","The VOICEINPUT tag with TYPE value set to \u201cvoice\u201d indicates a form that accepts voice input. Usually, a voice prompt or text-to-speech segment precedes the VOICEINPUT tag alerting the user that input is required and how to terminate input. The user is expected to speak and this message is recorded in real-time and supplied to the Voice Web server for processing. The VOICEINPUT tag containing \u201cvoice\u201d value for the TYPE attribute also supports a MAXTIME attribute which specifies the maximum recording time for the message and a TERMINATE attribute which specifies the touch tone that terminates input. If the MAXTIME attribute is not specified, then the default value of \u201c15\u201d is assumed. If TERMINATE attribute is not specified, then the default value of \u201c#\u201d is assumed. For example, if the MAXTIME value is 20 and TERMINATE value is \u201c#\u201d, then recording terminates when the user presses \u201c#\u201d or 20 seconds of time elapses.","The VOICEINPUT tag with TYPE value set to \u201ctone\u201d indicates a form that accepts touch tone input. Again, a voice prompt or a text-to-speech segment precedes the VOICEINPUT tag alerting the user for input. The user is expected to press a sequence of touch tones which are recorded and supplied to the Voice Web server for processing. The VOICEINPUT tag containing \u201ctone\u201d value for the TYPE attribute also supports a MAXDIGITS attribute which specifies the maximum number of touch tone digits that can be supplied and a TERMINATE attribute which specifies the touch tone that terminates input. If the MAXDIGITS attribute is not specified, then the default value of \u201c20\u201d is assumed. If TERMINATE attribute is not specified, then the default value of \u201c#\u201d is assumed. For example, if the MAXDIGITS value is 10 and TERMINATE value is \u201c#\u201d, then input process terminates when the user presses \u201c#\u201d or 10 digits are supplied.","The VOICEINPUT tag with TYPE value set to \u201creview\u201d indicates that the current values of the form can be reviewed by selecting the \u201creview\u201d input. The VOICEINPUT tag with TYPE value set to \u201creset\u201d indicates that the current values of the form should be reset to their original defaults. The VOICEINPUT tag with TYPE value set to \u201csubmit\u201d indicates that the current form should be submitted to the server. Each of these three TYPE values support a SELECTTONES attribute and a SKIPTONES attribute. SELECTTONES attribute specifies the sequence of touch tones that activates the corresponding selection. SKIPTONES attribute specifies the sequence of touch tones that skips the selection. If the SELECTTONES attribute is not specified, then the default value of \u201c#\u201d is assumed and if the SKIPTONES attribute is not specified, then the default value of \u201c*\u201d is assumed.","For example, if the SELECTTONES attribute value is \u201cREVIEW\u201d and SKIPTONES attribute value is \u201cSKIP\u201d for a VOICEINPUT element with TYPE value set to \u201creview\u201d, the user can enter \u201cREVIEW\u201d to review the form values or enter \u201cSKIP\u201d to skip the selection. VOICEINPUT tag with TYPE value set to \u201csubmit\u201d similarly indicates the values of the form can be submitted to the server. If the SELECTTONES attribute value is \u201cDONE\u201d and the SKIPTONES attribute value is \u201c**\u201d, the user can either enter \u201cDONE\u201d to submit the form or press \u201c**\u201d to skip the selection. VOICEINPUT tag with TYPE value set to \u201creset\u201d similarly indicates that the values of the form be reset to their original values.","All browser commands must start with the \u201c*\u201d key. Each browser command is associated with one or more key words that uniquely identify it. For example, in order to activate \u201cHome\u201d command, the user would press \u201c*home\u201d on the telephone key pad. The key words are chosen in such a way to generate unique dial tone sequences. A set of default browser commands are listed below with the keyword and description of the command. Alternatively, the browser commands can also be issued by vocalizing the corresponding commands. For example, to activate the \u201cHome\u201d command, the user would say \u201chome\u201d on the telephone.","Previous",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0164","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0020","list-style":"none"},"li":["Jump to the previous page from which the current page was accessed via a hyper link.
