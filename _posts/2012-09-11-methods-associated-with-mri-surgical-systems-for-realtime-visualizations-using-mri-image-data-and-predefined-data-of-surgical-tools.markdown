No. 12\/236,854, filed Sep. 24, 2008, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/134,412, filed Jun. 6, 2008, which issued on May 8, 2012 as U.S. Pat. No. 8,175,677, and also claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/974,821, filed Sep. 24, 2007, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if recited in full herein.","The present invention relates to MRI-guided diagnostic or interventional systems that may be particularly suitable for placement\/localization of interventional medical devices and\/or therapies in the body. Embodiments of the present invention may be particularly suitable for placing neuromodulation leads, such as Deep Brain Stimulation (\u201cDBS\u201d) leads, placing implantable parasympathetic or sympathetic nerve chain leads and\/or CNS stimulation leads and\/or for delivering therapies to target internal locations in the body including atrial fibrillation (AFIB) therapies.","Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is becoming an acceptable therapeutic modality in neurosurgical treatment of patients suffering from chronic pain, Parkinson's disease or seizure, and other medical conditions. Other electro-stimulation therapies have also been carried out or proposed using internal stimulation of the sympathetic nerve chain and\/or spinal cord, etc.","One example of a prior art DBS system is the Activa\u00ae system from Medtronic, Inc. The Activa\u00ae system includes an implantable pulse generator stimulator that is positioned in the chest cavity of the patient and a lead with axially spaced apart electrodes that is implanted with the electrodes disposed in neural tissue. The lead is tunneled subsurface from the brain to the chest cavity connecting the electrodes with the pulse generator. These leads can have multiple exposed electrodes at the distal end that are connected to conductors which run along the length of the lead and connect to the pulse generator placed in the chest cavity.","It is believed that the clinical outcome of certain medical procedures, particularly those using DBS, may depend on the precise location of the electrodes that are in contact with the tissue of interest. For example, to treat Parkinson's tremor, DBS stimulation leads are conventionally implanted during a stereotactic surgery, based on pre-operative MRI and CT images. These procedures can be long in duration and may have reduced efficacy as it has been reported that, in about 30% of the patients implanted with these devices, the clinical efficacy of the device\/procedure is less than optimum.","Some embodiments of the present invention are directed to MRI-guided systems that can generate substantially real time patient-specific visualizations of the patient and one or more surgical tools in logical space and provide feedback to a clinician to improve the speed and\/or reliability of an intrabody procedure.","The visualizations can be based (in-part) on predefined data of the tool(s) which define a point of interface for the system (e.g., software) based on predefined characteristics of the tool(s), e.g., dimensions, shape or configuration and\/or known rotational, translational and\/or other functional and\/or dynamic behavior of one or more surgical tools. The visualizations can include patient function data (e.g., fMRI data, electrical activity, active regions of a brain during a defined stimulation, fiber tracks, and the like).","The system can be configured to interrogate and segment image data to locate fiducial markers and generate successive visualizations of the patient's anatomical structure and tool(s) using MRI image data and a priori data of the tool(s) to provide (substantially real-time) visualizations of the patient.","Some embodiments are directed to MRI-guided surgical systems. The systems include: (a) at least one MRI-compatible surgical tool; (b) a circuit adapted to communicate with an MRI scanner; and (c) at least one display in communication with the circuit. The circuit electronically recognizes predefined physical characteristics of the at least one tool to automatically segment MR image data provided by the MRI scanner whereby the at least one tool constitutes a point of interface with the system. The circuit is configured to provide a User Interface that defines workflow progression for an MRI-guided surgical procedure and allows a user to select steps in the workflow, and wherein the circuit is configured to generate multi-dimensional visualizations using the predefined data of the at least one tool and data from MRI images of the patient in substantially real time during the surgical procedure.","Other embodiments are directed to methods for performing an MRI-guided surgical procedure. The methods include: (a) defining dimensional and\/or functional data of at least one MRI compatible surgical tool; (b) obtaining MRI image data of the patient; (c) electronically segmenting the MRI image data to identify known fiducial markers on the at least one tool based on the defining step; (d) generating visualizations of the at least one tool registered to patient anatomical structure; (e) electronically generating directions on adjustments for a pitch, roll or X-Y actuator to adjust a trajectory of a trajectory guide; and (f) guiding the tool to a location in the patient using patient MRI image data, the directions for adjustment and the visualizations thereby facilitating an MRI-guided surgical procedure.","Still other embodiments are directed to computer program products for facilitating an MRI-guided surgical procedure. The computer program product includes a computer readable storage medium having computer readable program code embodied in the medium. The computer-readable program code includes: (a) computer readable program code that comprises predefined physical data of a plurality of different surgical tools; (b) computer readable program code that communicates with an MRI scanner to obtain MRI image data of a patient; and (c) computer readable program code that generates visualizations of the patient using data from the tools and the image data of the patient in substantially real-time.","Yet other embodiments are directed to MRI-guided interventional deep brain systems. The systems include: (a) an MRI Scanner; (b) a clinician workstation with a circuit and a display, the workstation in communication with the MRI Scanner; (c) at least one flexible patch with a grid thereon configured to releasably attach to a patient's skull; and (d) at least one trajectory guide attachable to a skull of a patient. The guide has a base with an aperture configured to reside over a burr hole formed in a patient's skull. The base aperture provides a mechanical center of rotation for a pivot axis associated with the trajectory guide, the base having a plurality of fiducial markers spaced apart about the base aperture. The circuit comprises physical data regarding the patch and is configured to interrogate patient imaging data provided by the MRI Scanner and segment the image data to define a burr hole location that intersects the patch with a desired intrabrain trajectory. The circuit comprises tool-specific data of the trajectory guide and is configured to interrogate patient imaging data provided by the MRI Scanner and interactively generate visualizations of the patient's brain and the trajectory guide to the display.","In some embodiments, the circuit is configured to provide a default trajectory for the trajectory guide on the display that extends through a center location of the grid patch.","Embodiments of the invention can provide output to a user such as one or more of: (a) electronic generated warnings to alert an improper planned trajectory for a trajectory guide; (b) warnings regarding a physical interference with a planned projected trajectory associated with the MRI bore size and (isocenter) position (and optionally, patient head size and angle(s) or configuration of a surgical tool); (c) electronic instructions on what grid entry location to use to obtain a desired trajectory or entry point into the patient brain; (d) calculate and provide suggested physical adjustments to actuators to obtain a desired trajectory orientation and generate instructions on what adjustments to make to X, Y, pitch and roll adjustment mechanisms (e.g., rotate X button or dial left or right, potentially with a number of rotations or increments and the like) associated with the trajectory guide to obtain the desired trajectory; and (e) generate electronic data of electrode offset values for stimulation leads in the brain to define where the electrodes are anatomically positioned whereby pulse generator programming may be accelerated over conventional techniques.","Some embodiments of the present invention can provide visualizations to allow more precise control, delivery, and\/or feedback of a therapy so that the therapy or a tool associated therewith can be more precisely placed, delivered, confirmed and visualized.","These and other embodiments will be described further below.","The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown.

Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. It will be appreciated that although discussed with respect to a certain embodiment, features or operation of one embodiment can apply to others.","In the drawings, the thickness of lines, layers, features, components and\/or regions may be exaggerated for clarity and broken lines (such as those shown in circuit of flow diagrams) illustrate optional features or operations, unless specified otherwise. In addition, the sequence of operations (or steps) is not limited to the order presented in the claims unless specifically indicated otherwise.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises\u201d and\/or \u201ccomprising,\u201d when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, steps, operations, elements, and\/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, steps, operations, elements, components, and\/or groups thereof. As used herein, the term \u201cand\/or\u201d includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.","Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the specification and relevant art and should not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein. Well-known functions or constructions may not be described in detail for brevity and\/or clarity.","It will be understood that when a feature, such as a layer, region or substrate, is referred to as being \u201con\u201d another feature or element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d another feature or element, there are no intervening elements present. It will also be understood that, when a feature or element is referred to as being \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201ccoupled\u201d to another feature or element, it can be directly connected to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when a feature or element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly connected\u201d or \u201cdirectly coupled\u201d to another element, there are no intervening elements present. Although described or shown with respect to one embodiment, the features so described or shown can apply to other embodiments.","The term \u201celectroanatomical visualization\u201d or refers to a visualization or map of the anatomical structure, e.g., brain or heart, typically a volumetric, 3-D map or 4-D map, that illustrates or shows electrical activity of tissue correlated to anatomical and\/or coordinate spatial position. The visualization can be in color and color-coded to provide an easy to understand map or image with different measures or gradients of activity in different colors and\/or intensities. The term \u201ccolor-coded\u201d means that certain features electrical activity or other output are shown with defined colors of different color and\/or intensity to visually accentuate different tissue, different and similar electrical activity or potential in tissue and\/or to show abnormalities or lesions in tissue versus normal or non-lesion tissue. In some embodiments, the systems can be configured to allow a clinician to increase or decrease the intensity or change a color of certain tissue types or electrical outputs, e.g., in high-contrast color and\/or intensity, darker opacity or the like.","The actual visualization can be shown on a screen or display so that the map and\/or anatomical or tool structure is in a flat 2-D view and\/or in 2-D what appears to be 3-D volumetric images with data representing features or electrical output with different visual characteristics such as with differing intensity, opacity, color, texture and the like. A 4-D map illustrates time-dependent activity, such as electrical activity or blood flow movement.","The systems are configured to operate based on known physical characteristics of one or more surgical tools such that the hardware is a point of interface for the circuit or software. The systems can communicate with databases that define dimensions, configurations or shapes and spacing of components on the tool(s). The defined physical data can be obtained from a CAD model of a tool. The physical characteristics can include dimensions or other physical features or attributes and may also include relative changes in position of certain components or features upon a change in position of a tool or portion thereof. The defined physical characteristics can be electronically (programmatically) accessible by the system or known a priori and electronically stored locally or remotely and used to automatically calculate certain information and\/or to segment image data. That is, the tool data from the model can be used to segment image data and\/or correlate a position and orientation, of a tool and\/or provide trajectory adjustment guidelines or error estimates, warnings of improper trajectories and the like. For example, a grid for marking a burr hole location and\/or a trajectory guide that adjusts an intrabrain path for placing a diagnostic or therapy device and such can be input, transposed, and\/or overlayed in a visualization of the tool and patient structure or otherwise used, such as, for example, to project the information onto a patient's anatomical structure or determine certain operational parameters including which image volume to obtain high resolution MRI image data that include select portions of the targeting canula. At least some of the resulting visualizations are not merely an MRI image of the patient during a procedure.","The visualizations are rendered visualizations that can combine multiple sources of data to provide visualizations of spatially encoded tool position and orientation with anatomical structure and can be used to provide position adjustment data output so that a clinician can move a controller a certain amount to obtain a desired trajectory path, thereby providing a smart-adjustment system without requiring undue \u201cguess\u201d work on what adjustments to make to obtain the desired trajectory.","The term \u201canimation\u201d refers to a sequence or series of images shown in succession, typically in relatively quick succession, such as in about 1-50 frames per second. The term \u201cframe\u201d refers to a single visualization or static image. The term \u201canimation frame\u201d refers to one image frame of the different images in the sequence of images. The term \u201cACPC coordinate space\u201d refers to a right-handed coordinate system defined by anterior and posterior commissures (AC, PC) and Mid-Sagittal plane points, with positive directions corresponding to a patient's anatomical Right, Anterior and Head directions with origin at the mid-comissure point.","The term \u201cgrid\u201d refers to a pattern of crossed lines or shapes used as a reference for locating points or small spaces, e.g., a series of rows and intersecting columns, such as horizontal rows and vertical columns (but orientations other than vertical and horizontal can also be used). The grid can include associated visual indicia such as alphabetical markings (e.g., A-Z and the like) for rows and numbers for columns (e.g., 1-10) or the reverse. Other marking indicia may also be used. The grid can be provided as a flexible patch that can be releasably attached to the skull of a patient. For additional description of suitable grid devices, see co-pending, co-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/236,621.","The term \u201cfiducial marker\u201d refers to a marker that can be electronically identified using image recognition and\/or electronic interrogation of MRI image data. The fiducial marker can be provided in any suitable manner, such as, but not limited to, a geometric shape of a portion of the tool, a component on or in the tool, a coating or fluid-filled component or feature (or combinations of different types of fiducial markers) that makes the fiducial marker(s) MRI-visible with sufficient signal intensity (brightness) for identifying location and\/or orientation information for the tool and\/or components thereof in space.","The term \u201cRF safe\u201d means that the lead or probe is configured to safely operate when exposed to RF signals, particularly RF signals associated with MRI systems, without inducing unplanned current that inadvertently unduly heats local tissue or interferes with the planned therapy. The term \u201cMRI visible\u201d means that the device is visible, directly or indirectly, in an MRI image. The visibility may be indicated by the increased SNR of the MRI signal proximate the device.","The system can include an intrabody MRI receive imaging probe antenna to collect signal from local tissue. The term \u201cMRI compatible\u201d means that the so-called component(s) is safe for use in an MRI environment and as such is typically made of a non-ferromagnetic MRI compatible material(s) suitable to reside and\/or operate in a high magnetic field environment. The term \u201chigh-magnetic field\u201d refers to field strengths above about 0.5 T, typically above 1.0 T, and more typically between about 1.5 T and 10 T. MRI Scanners are well known and include high-field closed bore and open bore systems.","Embodiments of the present invention can be configured to carry out diagnostic and interventional procedures such as to guide and\/or place interventional devices to any desired internal region of the body or object, but may be particularly suitable for neurosurgeries. The object can be any object, and may be particularly suitable for animal and\/or human subjects. Although primarily described with respect to placement of stimulation leads in the brain, the invention is not limited thereto. For example, the system can be used for gene and\/or stem-cell based therapy delivery or other neural therapy delivery and allow user-defined custom targets in the brain or to other locations. In addition, embodiments of the systems can be used to ablate tissue in the brain or other locations. In some embodiments, it is contemplated that the systems can be configured to treat AFIB in cardiac tissue, and\/or to deliver stem cells or other cardio-rebuilding cells or products into cardiac tissue, such as a heart wall, via a minimally invasive MRI guided procedure while the heart is beating (i.e., not requiring a non-beating heart with the patient on a heart-lung machine).","Examples of known treatments and\/or target body regions are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,708,064; 6,438,423; 6,356,786; 6,526,318; 6,405,079; 6,167,311; 6,539,263; 6,609,030 and 6,050,992, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if recited in full herein.","Embodiments of the present invention may take the form of an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects, all generally referred to herein as a \u201ccircuit\u201d or \u201cmodule.\u201d In some embodiments, the circuits include both software and hardware and the software is configured to work with specific hardware with known physical attributes and\/or configurations. Furthermore, the present invention may take the form of a computer program product on a computer-usable storage medium having computer-usable program code embodied in the medium. Any suitable computer readable medium may be utilized including hard disks, CD-ROMs, optical storage devices, a transmission media such as those supporting the Internet or an intranet, or other storage devices.","Computer program code for carrying out operations of the present invention may be written in an object oriented programming language such as Java\u00ae, Smalltalk or C++. However, the computer program code for carrying out operations of the present invention may also be written in conventional procedural programming languages, such as the \u201cC\u201d programming language. The program code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on another computer, local and\/or remote or entirely on the other local or remote computer. In the latter scenario, the other local or remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).","The present invention is described in part below with reference to flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable memory that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable memory produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the function\/act specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide steps for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","The flowcharts and block diagrams of certain of the figures herein illustrate exemplary architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of embodiments of the present invention. In this regard, each block in the flow charts or block diagrams represents a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s). It should also be noted that in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the blocks may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may in fact be executed substantially concurrently or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order or two or more blocks may be combined, depending upon the functionality involved.","Generally stated, embodiments of the systems are configured to provide a substantially automated or semi-automated and relatively easy-to-use MRI-guided systems with defined workflow steps and interactive visualizations. In particular embodiments, the systems define and present workflow with discrete steps for finding target and entry point(s), localizing the entry point(s) to a physical identified grid position, guiding the alignment of the targeting canula to a planned trajectory, monitoring the insertion of the probe, and adjusting the X-Y position in cases where the placement needs to be corrected. During steps where specific MR scans are used, the circuit or computer module can display data for scan plane center and angulation to be entered at the console. The workstation\/circuit can passively or actively communicate with the MR scanner. The system can also be configured to use functional patient data (e.g., fiber tracks, fMRI and the like) to help plan or refine a target surgical site.","Embodiments of the present invention will now be described in further detail below with reference to the figures.  illustrates an MRI guided interventional system  with an MRI scanner , a clinician workstation  with at least one circuit , at least one display  and at least one MRI compatible interventional and\/or surgical tool . An MRI scanner interface  may be used to allow communication between the workstation  and the scanner . The interface  and\/or circuit may be hardware, software or a combination of same. The interface  and\/or circuit may reside partially or totally in the scanner , partially or totally in the workstation , or partially or totally in a discrete device therebetween. The system  can be configured to render or generate real time visualizations of the target anatomical space using MRI image data and predefined data of at least one surgical tool to segment the image data and place the tool  in the rendered visualization in the correct orientation and position in 3D space, anatomically registered to a patient. The tool  can include or cooperate with tracking, monitoring and\/or interventional components. The system  can optionally include a reader that can electronically read (e.g., optically such as via a bar code or otherwise electronically read such a via an RFID tag) a label or tag or other indicia to confirm that the hardware is authentic or compatible to inhibit counterfeit hardware and potential misuse of the system as the system is configured so that certain hardware define a point of interface with the software or circuit . Alternatively, or additionally, the system  can allow a user to manually input the tool\/hardware indicia. Proper operation of the system requires that the proper hardware having the specific predefined characteristics used by the system is used for the surgical procedure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIGS. 2 and 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","10","100","110","115","10","110","110","50","120","32","30","30","200","115","123","32","210","118","210","120"],"i":"c "},"The system  can be configured to provide workflow for a unilateral or bilateral (or even trilateral or more) procedure. Selection of the procedure type can initiate the associated work flow presented.  illustrates an example of a workstation control panel on display screen . The panel can illustrate a current workflow step and allow a user to go to a step directly (such as via a drop down list or selection of a workflow step in a toolbar or the like) and can be presented adjacent different views of the intrabody trajectory and patient anatomy. Tabs or other user-selectable features with visual feedback on status of a step for each side can be used for steps with laterality (e.g., left or right for bilateral procedures) to allow a user to control selection of laterality, such as left and right , to complete trajectory planning for each side independently (or to allow a user to toggle back and forth while maintaining control over each side). The display  can include viewer tools such as zoom, pan, width\/level, magnifier, etc.","The MRI scanner  can include a console that has a \u201claunch\u201d application or portal for allowing communication to the circuit of the workstation . The scanner console can acquire volumetric T1-weighted (post-contrast scan) data or other image data (e.g., high resolution image data for a specific volume) of a patient's head or other anatomy. In some embodiments, the console can push DICOM images or other suitable image data to the workstation  and\/or circuit . The workstation  and\/or circuit can be configured to passively wait for data to be sent from the MR scanner  and the circuit \/workstation  does not query the Scanner or initiate a communication to the Scanner. In other embodiments, a dynamic or active communication protocol between the circuit \/workstation  and the Scanner  may be used to acquire image data and initiate or request particular scans and\/or scan volumes. Also, in some embodiments, pre-DICOM, but reconstructed image data, can be sent to the circuit \/workstation  for processing or display. In other embodiments, pre-reconstruction image data (e.g., substantially \u201craw\u201d image data) can be sent to the circuit \/workstation  for Fourier Transform and reconstruction.","Generally described, for some unilateral scenarios, the user will proceed through a set of discrete workflow steps to load MR image data, identify a target point, identify an entry point, verify the planned trajectory, and align the targeting canula. A target point or region can also be planned or refined based on real-time functional image data of a patient. The functional image data can include, but is not limited to, images of fiber tracks, images of activity in brain regions during vocalization (e.g., reading, singing, talking), or based on physical or olefactory or sense-based stimulation, such as exposure to electrical (discomfort\/shock input), heat and\/or cold, light or dark, visual images, pictures or movies, chemicals, scents, taste, and sounds or the like) and\/or using fMRI or other imaging techniques. The enhanced visualization gives neurosurgeons a much clearer picture of the spatial relationship of a patient's brain structures. The visualizations can serve as a trajectory guide for surgical procedures, such as brain-tumor removal and epilepsy surgery. In some embodiments, the visualizations can be generated using data collated from different types of brain-imaging methods, including conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) and even hyperpolarized noble gas MRI imaging. The MRI gives details on the anatomy, fMRI or other active stimulation-based imaging protocol can provide information on the activated areas of the brain, and DTI provides images of the network of nerve fibers connecting different brain areas. The fusion of one or all of these different images and the tool information can be used to produce a 3-D display with trajectory information that surgeons can manipulate.","Thus, a target location and trajectory can be planned, confirmed or refined based in-part on functional information of the patient. This functional information can be provided in real-time visualizations of the patient with the trajectory guide tools for trajectory path and target planning, e.g., visualize a patient's fiber track structures and\/or functional information of a patient's brain for a surgeon's ease of reference. This information can also be selected or suppressed from views via a UI selection, such as \u201cShow Fiber Tracks\u201d Fand\/or \u201cShow Functional Output\u201d F(e.g., toolbar option) as shown in . It is noted that the patient functional information can be shown automatically without requiring a user selection or in response to a stage of a procedure or when selecting certain steps. In addition, such information may be shown or selected in any appropriate display or step described herein although not specifically described with respect to that particular step or screen display. Knowing where susceptible or sensitive brain regions are or where critical fiber tracks are in the patient's brain, can allow a surgeon to plan a better, less-risky or less-intrusive trajectory and\/or allow a surgeon to more precisely reach a desired target site and\/or more precisely place a device and\/or deliver a planned therapy, e.g., implant a stimulation lead, ablate tissue and\/or treat a tumor site and\/or excise a tumor, deliver a gene and\/or stem cell therapy and the like.","To align the targeting canula, scan volumes can be defined by the system based on known dimensions of the canula, such as a canula length a position of a proximal or distal marker on the canula, and angulation and lateral (X-Y) pivot limit. In particular embodiments, the user can then gradually advance a probe and a peel away sheath (that is configured to guide an interventional device to a desired location along the defined trajectory) and acquire images to check for hemorrhage and to verify the trajectory and\/or avoid functionally sensitive structure. When the probe has been advanced to the target point, high-resolution confirmation images can be obtained to verify the tip location relative to the planned location. If actual placement is unacceptable, the probe can be withdrawn. At that point, either the X-Y placement can be adjusted appropriately (e.g., by moving a platform or stage an amount to cause the desired adjustment) or a trajectory angulation can be re-planned and a second attempt can be made.","For some bilateral scenarios, the above steps can be repeated for both left and right sides, with the additional goal that the patient should not be moved into or out of the scanner. To satisfy that goal, trajectory planning should be completed for both sides prior to removing the patient from the scanner. Also, burring and frame attachment (the member that holds the trajectory guide to the patient's head) should be completed for both sides prior to moving the patient back into the scanner to promote speed of the procedure.","The system  can be configured with a hardware interface that provides a network connection, e.g., a standard TCP\/IP over Ethernet network connection, to provide access to MR scanner , such as the DICOM server.

The AC, PC and MSP anatomical landmarks define an AC-PC coordinate system, e.g., a Talairach-Tournoux coordination system that can be useful for surgical planning. This library can be used to automatically identify the location of the landmarks. It can be provided as a dynamic linked library that a host application can interface through a set of Application Programming Interface (API) on Microsoft Windows\u00ae. This library can receive a stack of MR brain images and fully automatically locates the AC, PC and MSP. The success rate and accuracy can be optimized, and typically it takes a few seconds for the processing. The output is returned as 3D coordinates for AC and PC, and a third point that defines the MSP. This library is purely computation and is typically UI-less. This library can fit a known brain atlas to the MR brain dataset. The utility can be available in form of a dynamic linked library that a host application can interface through a set of Application Programming Interface (API) on Microsoft Windows\u00ae. The input to this library can contain the MR brain dataset and can communicate with applications or other servers that include a brain atlas or include a brain atlas (e.g., have an integrated brain atlas). The design can be independent of any particular atlas; but one suitable atlas is the Cerefy\u00ae atlas of brain anatomy (note: typically not included in the library). The library can be configured to perform segmentation of the brain and identify certain landmarks. The atlas can then be fitted in 3D to the dataset based on piecewise affine transformation. The output can be a list of vertices of the interested structures.","In some embodiments, the mid-sagittal plane (MSP) is approximated using several extracted axial slices from the lower part of the input volume, e.g., about 15 equally spaced slices. A brightness equalization can be applied to each slice and an edge mask from each slice can be created using a Canny algorithm. A symmetry axis can be found for each edge mask and identify the actual symmetry axis based on an iterative review and ranking or scoring of tentative symmetry axes. The ranking\/scoring cam be based on whether a point on the Canny mask, reflected through the symmetry axis lands on the Canny mask (if so, this axes is scored for that slice). An active appearance model (AAM) can be applied to a brain stem in a reformatted input stack with the defined MSP to identify the AC and PC points.","The MSP plane estimate can be refined as well as the AC and PC points. The MSP plane estimate can be refined using a cropped image with a small region that surrounds a portion of the brain ventricle and an edge mask using a Canny algorithm. The symmetry axis on this edge mask if found following the procedure described above. The AC and PC points are estimated as noted above using the refined MSP and brightness peaks in a small region (e.g., 6\u00d76 mm) around the estimate are searched. The largest peak is the AC point. The PC point can be refined using the PC estimate above and the refined MSP. A Canny edge map of the MSP image can be computed. Again, a small region (e.g., about 6 mm\u00d76 mm) can be searched for a point that lies on a Canny edge and for which the image gradient is most nearly parallel to the AC-PC direction. The point is moved about 1 mm along the AC-PC direction, towards PC. The largest intensity peak in the direction perpendicular to AC-PC is taken to be the PC point.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0119"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2C"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Plan Entry - Target Step"},{"entry":"Description"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"The application can provide the ability to save position"]},{"entry":[{},"coordinates as default values for the STN and Gpi"]},{"entry":[{},"targets.
