{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention relates generally to computer technology, and is more particularly directed toward systems and methods for reprogramming electronic devices through a pager network.","In recent years there has been a great increase in the amount of computer technology that is involved in daily life. In today's world, computer technology is involved in many aspects of a person's day. Many devices being used today by consumers have a small computer inside of the device. These small computers come in varying sizes and degrees of sophistication. These small computers include everything from one microcontroller to a fully-functional complete computer system. For example, these small computers may be a one-chip computer, such as a microcontroller, a one-board type of computer, such as a controller, a typical desktop computer, such as an IBM-PC compatible, etc.","The small computers, (which can be rather large computers depending on the particular need which is being met by the computer), almost always have one or more processors at the heart of the computer. The processor(s) usually are interconnected to different external inputs and outputs and function to manage the particular device. For example, a processor in a vending machine for soda pop may be connected to the buttons used to select the pop, to the switch that allows a pop to drop down to a user, and to lights to indicate that the machine does not have any more pop of a particular variety.","Computer technology is involved in many aspects of daily life. Many appliances, devices, etc., include one or more small computers. For example, refrigerators, telephones, typewriters, automobiles, vending machines, and many different types of industrial equipment usually have small computers, or processors, inside of them. Computer software runs the processors of these computers and tells the processors what to do to carry out certain tasks. For example, the computer software running on a processor in a vending machine may cause a soda pop to drop to a user when the correct change has been entered by a user.","These types of small computers that are a part of a device, appliance, tool, etc., are often referred to as embedded systems. The term \u201cembedded system\u201d usually refers to computer hardware and software that is part of a larger system. Embedded systems usually do not have typical input and output devices such as a keyboard, mouse, and\/or monitor. Usually, at the heart of each embedded system is one or more processor(s).","It is an object of the present invention to provide systems and methods for reprogramming an electronic device.","A portable electronic device is disclosed that is reprogrammable through a pager network. The device includes a communications port. The device also includes a data transceiver for transmitting send data and receiving receive data from a pager network. In addition, the device has a processor. The processor is in electronic communication with the communications port for communicating through the communications port. The processor is also in electronic communication with the data transceiver for communications with the pager network. The device also includes reprogrammable memory programmed with instructions to cause the device to receive new program code from the pager network and to reprogram the reprogrammable memory with the new program code.","Embodiments of the communications port may include a serial communications port for electronically connecting the device to another electronic device.","The device may be a handheld device that is enclosed in a plastic snap-fit enclosure.","In some embodiments, the device may include a single-board computer. The single board computer may include the processor and the memory. In addition, the single-board computer and the data transceiver may be in electronic communication through a serial connection.","In certain embodiments, the single board computer may include a microcontroller that includes the processor, RAM and flash memory. Instructions may be stored in the flash memory to cause the single-board computer to receive new program code from the pager network through the data transceiver board and to reprogram the flash memory with the new program code such that once reprogrammed the device has new functionality.","A serial communications port may also be included on the single-board computer for electronically connecting the device to another electronic device. Moreover, a serial transceiver may also be included on the single-board computer for use with the serial communications port. The microcontroller may be in electronic communication with the serial communications port through the serial transceiver for communicating with the other electronic device.","Embodiments may also include single-board computer having a serial connection for electronically connecting the single-board computer to the data transceiver board such that the microcontroller is in electronic communication with the data transceiver for communications with the pager network.","A method is disclosed for reprogramming an electronic device through use of a pager network. The method includes providing an electronic device and providing power to the electronic device. Communication is established with the pager network. In addition, the method includes receiving receive data from the pager network that includes new instructions and storing the new instructions in the flash memory of the device thereby reprogramming the device to add new capability to the electronic device.","The portable electronic device may include the functional elements of means for processing, means for storing data, means for communicating with the pager network and means for causing the device to receive new program code from the pager network through the means for communicating with the pager network and to reprogram the means for storing data with the new program code to give the device new functionality.","It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention, as generally described and illustrated in the Figures herein, could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the system and method of the present invention, as represented in the Figures, is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as claimed, but is merely representative of the presently preferred embodiments of the invention.","The presently preferred embodiments of the invention will be best understood by reference to the drawings, wherein like parts are designated by like numerals throughout.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["20","22","24","20","20","20","20","20","20","22","24","20","22","24"]},"The communications adapter  also includes a communications port  and a communications module . The communications port  enables communication with the electronic device. Those skilled in the art will appreciate the various types of communication ports that can be used with the embodiments herein.","The communications module  enables communication with a provider computer through a communications network. Depending upon the type of communications network being utilized, the particular embodiment of a communications module may vary. For example, if a pager network were being used as the communications network, a pager communications module may be used with the communications adapter . One such commercially available pager communications module is the CreataLink 2 XT transceiver module available from Motorola, Inc.","The communications network  is any communications network capable of facilitating communications between the communications adapter  and the provider computer. For example, the communications network  may be a pager network, a cellular network, a global communications network, the Internet, a computer network, a telephone network, etc. Those skilled in the art will appreciate the many different communications networks  that may be utilized with embodiments herein.","The provider computer , or the controller  for the communications adapter, is capable of communicating over the communications network . The controller computer  includes a processor , memory , a communications port  as well as other input\/output components . The controller computer  may be a conventional desktop computer. However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the controller computer  is a broadly defined digital computer. A computer, as used herein, is any device that includes a digital processor capable of receiving and processing data. A computer includes the broad range of digital computers including microcontrollers, hand-held computers, personal computers, servers, mainframes, supercomputers, and any variation or related device thereof. In current design, the controller computer  is typically an IBM-compatible personal computer running the Linux or Microsoft Windows 95\/98\/2000 or NT operating system.","The electronic device\/appliance  is any device, appliance, machine, tool, or the like that is capable of receiving and\/or sending electronic signals or messages. Examples of devices  within the scope of the term device includes a vending machine, a telephone, a door lock, a temperature sensor, a motor, a switch, a light, a printer, a fax machine, a refrigerator, a health monitor, an elevator\/escalator, a copier, a scanner, manufacturing equipment, industrial equipment, computer equipment and peripherals, security systems, monitoring equipment, and the like. The device  typically includes a processor  (often, but not always, a microcontroller), memory , and a communications port  as well as other input\/output components .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["42","42","52","48","54","42","42","54","56","42","42","42","42","42"]},"The communications adapter  includes an adapter communications module  that represents the computer program routines or instructions that handle the communications over the communications port . The network communications module  includes the computer program routines or instructions that handle the communications over the communications network . If a commercially available communications module  is utilized, some or all of the network communications module  may also be commercially available.","In the embodiment shown in , the device interface main  is the computer program routines or instructions that receive data from and\/or send data to the controller  via the communications network . The device interface main  also manages the communications and interactions with the device  at the communications adapter  by receiving messages from the communications network  and by taking appropriate action based on the messages.","The communications adapter  may have a translator module . In the embodiment shown in , the translator  is the computer program routines or instructions that can communicate with, or more fully communicate with, the device . Because there are so many different devices  being used today there are many different protocols used in communicating with these devices. It may not be feasible to always program the communications adapter with all the necessary code to understand all possible protocols. Accordingly, in the embodiment of  the translator  serves to function as an interface between the device  and the device interface main . The translator may be programmed to send commands to the device , to access data on the device , to receive commands from the device , to control the device , to translate messages protocols to\/from the device , etc. As a result, in certain situations, a new translator  being sent to and loaded on the adapter  may add new functionality and behavior to the adapter such that an adapter may be reprogrammed to understand new protocols, interfaces, data and\/or to interact with a new device .","It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that embodiments herein may be used to reprogram the adapter  without any instructions for communicating with the device . For example, an adapter  may simply be reprogrammed with instructions that do not involve any functionality for communicating with the device . If a translator  were needed and if an appropriate translator  were already on the adapter , one may use embodiments herein to update the device interface main . Thus, program code can be updated that does not directly or indirectly relate to communicating with another device . By way of another example, if the adapter  were not connected to a device  or did not need any additional functionality to communicate with a connected device , program code in the adapter  could be updated through the communications network . This new program code may not be a translator and may have no communications functionality, but may provide other new functionality. As described, embodiments herein may be used in a broad range of contexts where an adapter or any other electronic device may be reprogrammed via a communications network .","An embodiment of the controller computer  may include the software components as shown in . A controller communications module  includes the computer program routines or instructions that handle the communications over the communications network  to and from the adapter . A translator database  includes one or more translators  that can be sent to adapters . In the embodiment of , the database  includes a plurality of translators  such that once the type of electronic device  is known, an appropriate translator  may be accessed and sent to the adapter  through the communications network . The software transmission master  serves to receive an identification of an electronic device  type, to locate a suitable translator  and to send the suitable translator  to the adapter .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["62","42","72","42","72","42","74","76","74","42","62","42","48","72","74","42"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["62","42","78","42","72","42","80","82","80","42","62","42","48","80","80","42"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIGS. 3 and 4"],"b":["20","42","20","42","20","20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["42","42","20","84","20","42","20","20","86","48"]},"Identification for the communications adapter  and the type of electronic device  are provided  to the controller . The identification of the adapter  enables the controller  to send information or data to the adapter . If a pager or cellular network were being used with the embodiment, the identification might be a telephone number. If a computer network were being used, the identification might be an IP address, a machine name, or other address. Those skilled in the art will appreciate the type of identification that may be used with an adapter . The identification of the device  serves to enable the controller  to send appropriate computer program code to facilitate communication with the device . The computer program code that is sent to the adapter  from the controller  provides the functionality to communicate with, or more fully communicate with, the electronic device . Accordingly, to create such code one skilled in the art would need to know enough about the device  or type of device to develop useful program code.","Once the controller receives the electronic device  identification, it determines  the translator code, or new program code, that may be used on the adapter  to communicate with the device . The controller  then establishes  communications with the adapter  through the communications network . Alternatively, the controller  may already be in contact with the adapter  such that it does not need to establish communications.","The controller sends  the new data, code or instructions to the adapter  through the communications network . The adapter  receives  the new data and updates itself. The adapter  updates itself by programming its memory or by storing the new data to memory. Those skilled in the art will appreciate how memory may be written to, the various types of memories that can be used, etc.","After the adapter  has updated itself, communication is established  between the adapter and the electronic device .
