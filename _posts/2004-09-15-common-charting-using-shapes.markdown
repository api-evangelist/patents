title: Common charting using shapes
abstract: A method for rendering a chart associated with a document includes translating a chart object into a shape-based chart definition, wherein the chart object defines the chart with chart elements, and the shape-based shape definition defines the chart with shapes, and maintaining the chart object in the document to enable access to underlying chart data contained in the chart. A system includes a chart object defining a chart with chart elements, a graphics module operable to render shapes, a charting module generating a shape-based chart definition based on the chart object, wherein the shape-based chart definition defines the chart with shapes that can be rendered by the graphics module.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A chart is a graphical representation of numerical data. Charts are particularly useful for presenting complicated data in a concise and easily-understandable form. In today's desktop publishing environment, users can create impressive presentations using charts. Charts are based on underlying data that is entered into an application program such as \u201cEXCEL\u201d from MICROSOFT CORPORATION. The underlying data can then be used to create a chart of the data in a number of different formats, such as pie-chart, bar-chart, histogram, line chart, etc. In addition, each part of the chart can have associated colors, textures, and other effects to improve the appearance of the chart, which is very important for conveying information.","Application programs have traditionally used primitive function calls to render charts. The graphics display interface (GDI or GDI+) from \u201cMICROSOFT WINDOWS\u201d and GEL from \u201cMICROSOFT OFFICE\u201d, for example, are relatively low-level interfaces that are often used by application programs to render charts. Such low-level interfaces typically provide functions for rendering chart elements at a pixel level. For example, to draw a line, an application program must specify a beginning pixel and an ending pixel. Later, if the line were being stretched, the application program must again specify the new beginning and\/or ending pixel. The traditional interfaces do not include higher-level functions, such as a line-stretching function, for handling a group of pixels as a line.","Another problem is that different application programs have traditionally rendered charts differently. For example, in \u201cMICROSOFT WINDOWS\u201d, one application program may use the GDI, while another application may use a combination of calls to GEL and GDI. Because the charts are rendered differently, similar elements in charts rendered by different application programs may appear different to the user. Thus, a chart that should otherwise appear the same in MICROSOFT \u201cPOWERPOINT\u201d and \u201cEXCEL\u201d, for example, may appear slightly different in the two application programs.","Users often copy a chart from one application program and import it into another application program. For example, a chart can be copied from \u201cEXCEL\u201d and pasted into a MICROSOFT \u201cWORD\u201d document or a \u201cPOWERPOINT\u201d presentation. Traditionally, a user has been able to paste the chart as either a chart object or a picture. Unfortunately, when the user pastes the chart as a picture, the chart is severed from the underlying data that was used to create the picture. This means the user can no longer manipulate the underlying data of the chart through the pasted chart. For example, the user cannot edit the numerical data or labels in the chart once the chart is pasted as a picture.","In addition, when they are not pasted as pictures, charts in documents can have certain drawbacks. These drawbacks are primarily due to the fact that the chart that is not in picture format is not generated with presentation aspects in mind. For example, sometimes charts appear with an aliasing effect that is distracting to the eye. As another example, when the user resizes the chart, text can appear unusual because the font scaling is imprecise. As yet another example, the chart that is not pasted as a picture sometimes appears different on the computer screen as it does in a printout, because of a difference in coordinate mapping.","Thus, there is a need for the ability to render and manipulate charts consistently across applications. In addition, there is a need to provide a consistent, high-quality presentation of charts while enabling users to manipulate underlying elements of the chart.","Described herein are various implementations of systems and methods for rendering and manipulating charts. In accordance with various implementations described herein, a chart is translated from a chart object to a shape-based definition. The chart object defines portions of the chart in terms of chart elements and references the underlying chart data on which the chart is based. Although the chart is rendered as shapes, the chart object is maintained to allow for manipulation of the underlying chart data. A common charting component that is common to one or more application programs uses the chart object to enable a user to manipulate underlying elements of the chart.","The shape-based definition defines the chart in terms of shapes. The shape-based definition is used by a common graphics module to provide consistent shape rendering services and shape manipulation services for different applications. In addition, the common graphics module provides group manipulation functions, whereby a group of related shapes can be manipulated in the chart.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","104","108"]},"As used herein, a document  is a computer-readable file that includes user-readable information, such as text and graphics. The document  may be viewed and edited by a user through a user interface of the application program . Exemplary types of documents include, but are not limited to, a spreadsheet, a presentation, or a conventional text document. Thus, depending on the type of document, the application program  may be, for example, but not limited to, MICROSOFT \u201cWORD\u201d, \u201cPOWERPOINT\u201d, \u201cEXCEL\u201d, or other application program. By way of example, as shown on the screen , the document  is a \u2018Presentation,\u2019 which is often, but not always, associated with \u201cPOWERPOINT\u201d.","Particularly relevant to the present description is a chart  in the presentation. The chart  shown in the particular implementation of  is a column chart. In accordance with other implementations, the chart  is not limited to a column chart, but can be any other type of chart, such as, but not limited to, a pie chart, a line chart, or a scatter plot. The various data in the chart  is originally specified by the document . The document  specifies the chart  with a chart definition called a chart object .","The chart object  defines the chart  in terms of chart elements. Generally, a chart element is a data unit representing an aspect of a chart. Typically a chart element represents an aspect of the chart in relation to the information that the chart conveys or the type of chart. Exemplary chart elements include bars (e.g., for a bar chart), chart axis, chart legends, chart titles, chart labels, element colors, text fonts, element locations, data sources and so on. One implementation of the chart object  is a set of extensible markup language (XML) code. To illustrate, an example of XML code from a chart object  is shown

document  typically also has other document data , which includes, but is not limited to, text and formatting information. In accordance with one implementation, when the application program  is launched and the document  is opened, the chart object  is passed to a common graphics interface  of the common graphics module  for rendering.","The common graphics interface  determines what type of graphic is represented by the chart object . Types of graphics that may be handled by the common graphics interface  include, but are not limited to, diagrams, charts, or autoshapes. The chart object  includes an identifier that indicates that it defines a chart. Based on the chart identifier, the common graphics interface  determines that the chart object  defines a chart and sends it to a common charting module .","The common charting module  includes a translation engine  that translates the chart object  into a form that the graphics module  uses for rendering the chart  to the screen . Specifically, the translation engine  translates the chart object  into a shape-based chart definition . As its name suggests, the shape-based chart definition  defines the chart in terms of shapes, rather than chart elements. As will be described, use of shapes can improve the chart rendering process, chart appearance, and chart manipulation, by allowing for a common mechanism for interacting with graphics.","In the translation process, the translation engine  performs a number of operations. For example, the translation engine  retrieves data (e.g., numerical data) that makes up the chart  from data source(s) referenced in the chart object . The data source(s) may be the document  itself, or some other source, such as, but not limited to, another document, a database, a file, the Internet, or a queue. In addition to the data, the translation engine  may retrieve numerical formatting information that describes how the data is formatted. Numerical formatting information includes, but is not limited to a currency symbol, number of decimal points, percentage or fraction format, or date and time format.","The translation engine  also translates the chart elements into shapes, such as lines, rectangles, circles, triangles, and so on. A shape is a data unit that simply represents the visual appearance of a chart element and is not tied to, or reliant upon, the underlying numerical chart data. Thus, for example, a bar in the chart object  will be translated into a rectangle in the shape-based chart definition ; a chart axis will be translated into a line, and so on.","In addition, the translation engine  groups selected related shapes to facilitate manipulation of related shapes by the user. The common graphics interface  provides functions that allow a user to interact with groups of related shapes. The translation engine  takes advantage of those functions by grouping related chart elements such as, but not limited to, related data labels and related data series. After retrieving the data, translating chart elements into shapes, and grouping related shapes, the translation engine  generates the shape-based chart definition .","An implementation of the shape-based chart definition  is composed of XML code. To illustrate, XML code from an exemplary shape-based chart definition  is shown

graphics interface  receives the shape-based chart definition  and renders the chart  on the screen  as a set of shapes specified by the shape-based chart definition. The common graphics interface  typically performs the rendering by making calls to operating system or display controller functions. For example, in the WINDOWS operating system, the common graphics interface  may make calls to the graphics display interface (GDI+).","As shown, the common graphics module  includes a set of common graphics services . The common graphics services  include services accessible by the application program for manipulating the chart . The common graphics services  provide one or more application programming interface(s) (API) to access the services.","Because the common graphics module  renders, shapes, the graphics services  are able to offer high-level functions for manipulating the chart . The graphics services  can, for example, perform vector-graphics functions on shapes within the chart. To illustrate, a rectangle can be moved easily by calling a single function of the graphics services  that moves a shape, rather than calling numerous low-level functions to redraw the rectangle in a new location. In addition, the common graphics module  is common to multiple application programs, so that shape manipulation\/editing and appearance will be consistent among the application programs. Thus, the common graphics module  can present a common graphics user interface for editing shapes in the chart , regardless of the type of application program .","The common graphics module  also includes other services  for rendering and\/or manipulating contents of the document  on the screen . The other services  can include, but are not limited to, memory allocation and text-related manipulations.","After the chart  is rendered, the user may manipulate the shapes in the chart  or the underlying data of the chart . Most commands to edit the chart are passed to the common charting component . The common charting component  can then act on the command or pass the command back to the graphics services . Prior to passing a command to the graphics services , the common charting component  can modify the command, if needed. If the user edits the underlying chart data and thereby changes the chart object , the translation engine  automatically translates the chart object  again into an updated shape-based chart definition .","When the user manipulates the underlying data of the chart , a common charting component  provides functions for the manipulations. In the past, when the user manipulated a chart, the application program  performed the manipulations. This resulted in different chart presentation and behavior, and different user interaction between different application programs. In implementations described herein, the common charting component  provides a common set of functions for manipulating the underlying chart data that makes up the chart . As a result, when the user edits the underlying chart data, the behavior of the chart  is consistent across all application programs.","Beneficially, although the chart  is rendered using a shape-based chart definition , the underlying chart data is still maintained in (i.e., not removed from) the document  in the chart object . The common charting component  uses the chart object  when the user edits the underlying chart data (e.g., the numerical data). Thus, the user is enabled to edit shapes of the chart  via the common graphics interface , and edit underlying chart data via the common charting component . Even when the document  is closed, the chart object  is maintained in the document . As a result, the user can edit the chart  as a chart and\/or a picture.","In a particular implementation, the shape-based chart definition  can be saved for future use. In this implementation, the shape-based chart definition  could be saved with the document  or in a cache memory (not shown) before the document  is closed. Then, when the document  is opened later, the shape-based chart definition  is retrieved from memory and used for rendering the chart . In this implementation, the translation engine  would not need to translate the chart object  every time the document  is opened.","The term module is used in a general sense to describe a component that is operable to perform one or more designated functions. A module may be implemented in various ways and forms. For example, a module may be implemented in or as hardware, software, firmware, or in various combinations of hardware, software, and\/or firmware, depending on such factors as speed, cost, size, etc. For example, and without limitation, in one implementation each of the modules in the system  comprises software, such as a dynamic link library (DLL), that is stored on a computer-readable medium and executed on a computing system, such as the computing system described below with respect to .","Exemplary Operations",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","100","200","100","200"]},"Initially, a retrieving operation  retrieves a chart object that provides a definition of the chart. Typically, the chart object is retrieved from the document. The chart object defines parts of the chart with chart elements, such as bars, axis, labels, numerical data, and so on, which are inherently related to a chart. The chart object provides references to data sources of the underlying chart data, on which the chart is based.","A translating operation  translates the chart object into a shape-based chart definition, so that the chart can be rendered and edited using shapes. Shapes specify the visual appearance (e.g., size, location, and color) of chart elements. A data label or other text element can also be converted into a shape by creating a rectangle with the corresponding text or label in the rectangle. A text or label rectangle can be edited to be filled with a specified color, or to have a border, or other graphical effects appropriate for a rectangle. An exemplary translating operation  is shown in  and described below.","After the chart object is translated into a shape-based definition, a rendering operation  renders the chart using the shapes specified in the shape-based definition. Typically, the chart is rendered at a location specified by the document. Locations, colors, groupings, dimensions, and other attributes of shapes within the chart can be specified by the shape-based definition.","Although the chart is rendered with shapes, the chart object persists in association with the document. In other words the chart object is not disassociated from the document. Because the chart object is maintained, a user can continue to edit the underlying chart data. Whenever the user edits the chart object by editing the underlying chart data, the translating operation  will be performed.","Turning to , there is shown an exemplary translating operation . The translating operation  can be performed at any relevant time or in response to a relevant event. For example, and without limitation, the translating operation  can be performed automatically whenever the document is opened, or when the chart is copied from one document and imported into another document. The translating operation  is discussed with reference to , for ease of illustration. Thus, for purposes of illustration, it will be assumed here that the chart object and the corresponding shape-based definition define the chart  shown in .","Initially a determining operation  determines the type of chart . In the particular case shown, the chart object includes a chart type identifier indicating that the chart is a column chart. Thus, the determining operation  determines that the chart is a column chart. The type of chart is determined because the chart type is typically relevant to give meaning to data values, and dictate how chart elements will be translated to shapes.","A retrieving operation  then retrieves underlying data that serves as the basis for the chart. Typically, but without limitation, the underlying chart data includes data values, labels, and data formats, such as currency type or decimal place. The underlying data is retrieved from one or more data sources specified by the chart object. Thus, with reference to the chart , the underlying data that is retrieved includes data label (6.0), data label (8.9), and data label (3.2).","A translating operation  then translates chart elements into corresponding shapes. With reference to the chart , a first column in the chart object, for example, is translated into a rectangle , whose dimensions are based on the data value associated with the column. The translating operation  determines the dimensions of the rectangle by first identifying the column with the greatest value (in this case 8.9), and linearly scaling the rectangle  a based on the height of the chart. Similarly, the translating operation  translates the other two columns into associated rectangles and ","A grouping operation  then groups related shapes. It is best to group shapes that a user may want to edit or manipulate as a group. For example, the data labels , , and can be grouped. As another example, rectangles , , and can be grouped. The grouping operation  inserts a group indicator into the shape-based chart definition that indicates which shapes are in a group.","After related shapes are grouped, a common graphics module (e.g., common graphics module , ), can apply group effects based on user input. For example, if the user wants to change the color of all the rectangles in the chart , the user only needs to select one of the rectangles and change the color. Such groups can be useful because the user can then manipulate every shape in a group by clicking on a shape in the group once. If the user wants to manipulate a single shape in a group, the user clicks twice on the shape.","Exemplary Computing Device","With reference to , an exemplary system for implementing the operations described herein includes a general-purpose computing device in the form of a conventional personal computer , including a processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus .
