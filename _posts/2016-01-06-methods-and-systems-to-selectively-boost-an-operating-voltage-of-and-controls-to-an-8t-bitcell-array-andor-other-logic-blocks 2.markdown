title: Methods and systems to selectively boost an operating voltage of, and controls to an 8T bit-cell array and/or other logic blocks
abstract: Methods and systems to provide a multi-Vcc environment, such as to selectively boost an operating voltage of a logic block and/or provide a level-shifted control to the logic block. A multi-Vcc environment may be implemented to isolate a Vmin-limiting logic block from a single-Vcc environment, such as to reduce Vmin and/or improve energy efficiency in the single-Vcc environment. The logic block may include bit cells of a register file, a low-level processor cache, and/or other memory system. A cell Vcc may be boosted during a read mode and/or write wordlines (WWLs) and/or read wordlines (RWLs) may be asserted with boost. A wordline decoder may include a voltage level shifter with differential split-level logic, and a dynamic NAND, which may include NAND logic, a keeper circuit, and logic to delay a keeper control based on a delay of the level shifter to reduce contention during an initial NAND evaluation phase.
