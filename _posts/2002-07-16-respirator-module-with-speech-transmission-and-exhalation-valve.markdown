No. 60\/306,333, filed Jul. 18, 2001.","This invention was made with government support under DAAD13-00-C-0021 by the Department of Defense (US Special Operations Command). The government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to a respirator with a module that includes a speech transmission and exhalation valve functions. In one of its aspects, the invention relates to a respirator module incorporating an exhalation valve, a speech transmitter and a drinking tube. In another of its aspects, the invention relates to a respirator speech transmission module with integral electrical connections for communications devices. In another of its aspects, the invention relates to a respirator with a speech transmission and an exhalation valve module. In yet another of its aspects, the invention relates to a respirator and speech transmitter module therefore with low airflow resistance through the module.","2. Description of the Related Art","When a respirator such as a gas mask is used in a contaminated environment, it is critical that the wearer only inhale air from a purified source or air that has been passed through a filtration canister. In the typical gas mask having removable filtration canisters, the filtration canisters are attached to a filter mount including an inhalation valve that provides for one-way flow, opening during inhalation and closing during exhalation to prevent exhalation of hot, moisture-laden air through the filter.","It is important that the inhalation valve introduce no restrictions in the airflow path that will put additional strains on the wearer. In like fashion, it is important that an exhalation valve has minimal restrictions in the exhalation airflow but has secure sealing during inhalation. As the inhalation valve must have a low-opening pressure, the exhalation valve must also have a low-opening pressure to reduce the burden on the wearer and the likelihood of breaking the seal of the respirator.","Further, it is important that the wearer has the ability to communicate clearly with others in the vicinity or by radio while the respirator is in place and functioning in the contaminated environment. It is therefore advantageous for an exhalation module to have low-resistance opening during wearer exhalation, complete sealing during wearer inhalation and with high intelligibility of wearer speech.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,958,633, issued Sep. 25, 1990, to Angell, discloses a respirator with a speech and exhalation module incorporating an elastomeric exhalation valve. The exhalation valve is constructed of resilient material in a generally dished form anchored at a central portion and adapted to seal on a peripheral edge onto a valve seat on the module housing. The exhalation valve has an annular channel, formed by an annular arcuate section and that faces the outside of the mask. The module forms an air path in the form of an exponential horn between the inside and outside of the mask. The air path reverses axial direction between the inlet and the outlet, creating some turbulence. The speech module and exhalation valve have a fairly low resistance to exhalation, in the range of about 15 mm at 85 l\/min air flow. The respirator also has interchangeable mountings on the face piece for a secondary speech outlet, such as a microphone, and for an air-purifying canister. The speech transmitter module is disclosed more fully in the U.S. Pat. No. 4,539,983, issued Sep. 10, 1985, to Angell. These two Angell patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The invention relates to a respirator and a front module therefor as set forth in the preamble to claim  and wherein the inner side wall of the module body forms with the airflow guide an airflow channel in the form of a horn expansion contour during exhalation when the outlet valve is in an open position. The airflow channel from the interior to the exterior of the module extends radially and axially outwardly, then bends radially inwardly and axially outwardly through a smooth curve and then bends through a smooth curve axially outwardly. The airflow pattern does not reverse direction and thus has a very low resistance. In one embodiment, the outlet valve forms a part of the airflow channel with the inner side wall of the module body.","In one embodiment, the form of the horn expansion is conical, exponential, hyperbolic, tractrix or a combination thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the airflow guide has a generally conical surface facing the outer face of the module. In addition, the airflow guide conical surface is concave and the airflow guide has a relatively flat bottom surface facing the inner face of the module. An outer edge of the exhalation valve abuts the bottom surface of the airflow guide when the exhalation valve is in the open position. In one embodiment of the invention, the bottom surface of the airflow guide has relief channels to prevent sticking of the exhalation valve in the open position.","The invention also relates to a respirator and a front module therefor as set forth in the preamble to claim  and wherein the outlet valve has a dome shape with a central body and a generally conical skirt. In one embodiment, the outlet valve conical skirt is slightly convex outwardly toward the outer face of the module body. Further, the outlet valve further has convex shoulder hinge between the central body and the conical skirt to toggle the outlet valve between an open position and a closed position. Still further, the convex shoulder hinge forms a channel that opens toward the inner face of the module body.","The invention further relates to a respirator and a front module therefor as set forth in the preamble to claim  and wherein the module further includes an electrical communication block with internal and external fittings for connecting a microphone in the mask to a radio or amplifier carried by the mask user.","Referring to the drawings and to  in particular, a gas mask or respirator assembly  comprises a mask  having a facepiece  that fits onto a user's face and defines an interior chamber, a visor  comprising a transparent polyurethane panel , or panels, that may or may not have a central elastomeric hinge , a pair of circular or elliptical filter canisters  each mounted to the mask  at a canister mount .","Facepiece  is held to a user's face by a plurality of low-profile harness straps  defining a seal at facepiece periphery  that eliminates hot spots and fits comfortably with a helmet. Harness straps  can be folded over the exterior of facepiece  to aid user in rapidly donning mask . The interior chamber of mask  further comprises a nose cup (not shown) that is formed of a suitable material such as silicone or polyisoprene and is provided in multiple sizes for comfort and fit on different users.","The canister mounts  each include an inlet port and self-sealing mechanism assembly  and a connector  for affixing the circular or elliptical filter canisters  to mask .","The assembly  further comprises a front module  that includes speech transmission and exhalation valve functions affixed to mask . Module  combines and integrates the functions of speech, drinking system, outlet valve assembly and electrical communication.","Referring now to  in particular, front module  includes a module body  having an inner face , an outer face  and a central cavity  defined by a smooth and continuous side wall. A conical airflow guide  is supported within the cavity  by a number of airflow guide struts  that are connected to the airflow guide  and to the side wall of the central cavity  to hold the conical airflow guide substantially centered within the central cavity . The conical airflow guide has a concave upper surface  and a relatively flat lower surface. The module body  further includes a peripheral shoulder  having a facepiece engaging surface  for mounting the module  to the facepiece  of a respirator (). A skirt  extending from the peripheral shoulder  is mounted in a conforming opening in a facepiece adapted to receive the speech transmitter module . The skirt  includes a circumferential bead  for assisting in retaining the module  in the facepiece opening and further provides a retention means for a nosecup within the respirator facepiece.","The central cavity  provides a flow path, illustrated by the arrows in , between an inlet opening  at the inner face  of the mask to an outlet opening at the outer face  of the mask through slots . The outer face  of the module body  includes a plurality of slats  defining an outer face grille . The slats  are not shown in  so that the conical airflow guide  can be seen in the cavity . The air flows between the inside and outside of the module body  through slots  defined between the slats  of the grille .","At the inner face  of the module body , the cavity  includes the substantially circular opening  defined by an annular valve seat  for fluidly connecting the cavity  to the inner face  of the module body . The circular opening  is surrounded at the base of central cavity  of the module body  by the annular valve seat .","An outlet valve attachment stud  is mounted to the annular valve seat  in a central portion of the circular opening  through a plurality of spokes . The valve attachment stud  and spokes  define a number of airflow apertures  for fluidly connecting the cavity  to the outside of the module body  at the inner face .","The side wall of the cavity  and the upper surface  of the conical airflow guide  define the airflow channel  through the module body  from the airflow apertures  at the inner face  of the module body  to the slots  at the outer face  of the module body . The airflow channel  defines a horn expansion contour that enhances the sound transmitted by a user through the speech module. The form of the horn expansion can be conical, exponential, hyperbolic, tractrix or a combination of theses forms. As illustrated in , the airflow pattern between the airflow apertures  and the slots  follows a smooth, continuous route without any reversal of direction. The airflow pattern begins in a radial outward and axial direction and then bends smoothly in a radially inward and axial outward direction and then smoothly turns axially outwardly.","The outlet valve attachment stud  mounts a domed outlet valve . The domed outlet valve  includes a central cylindrical body  surrounded by an outwardly convex shoulder hinge  and an umbrella-like skirt  having a ribbed, weighted perimeter . The skirt  is convex outwardly slightly toward the outer face  of the module body . The shoulder hinge  forms an open channel of generally semi-circular cross-section and the channel opening faces the inside of the module and the respirator. The central cylindrical body  includes a stud-receiving cavity  adapted to closely receive the outlet valve attachment stud .","The outlet valve attachment stud  is positioned centrally within the circular opening  and directed into the cavity . The domed outlet valve  is configured such that with the outlet valve attachment stud  received in the cavity  of the central body  of the domed outlet valve , the ribbed perimeter  of the domed outlet valve  is sealingly received in the annular valve seat .","The domed outlet valve  is resilient and biased toward a closed position with the perimeter  of the outlet valve  pressed against the annular valve seat  within the central cavity  of the module body  to form an airtight seal. This configuration eliminates the possibility that the outlet valve  will be drawn inside out during an inhalation process. As the wearer exhales, the domed outlet valve  rolls up the hinge  and then inverts so that it abuts the base  of the conical airflow guide . The convex shoulder hinge  functions as a rolling toggle mechanism to flip the valve very wide open at the lowest possible positive (exhalation) pressure and closing quickly when the exhalation pressure drops near zero. The domed or umbrella shape of the valve is designed such that more energy is stored in the valve when inverted and this helps to revert the valve back rapidly to the closed position. This rolling hinge action represents a major change over cone-shaped valves that have a tendency to be lazy and not to revert as rapidly. The opening and closing of the outlet valve  takes place very quickly when the pressure changes from positive to negative. The harder the work rate, the more rapid and deep is the pressure change as the airflow volume increases per breath. The valve  accommodates a wide variety of changes very quickly.","The base  of the airflow guide  is formed with a central depression  and a series of radial relief channels . The relief channels or grooves  prevent the skirt  of the outlet valve  from sticking to the base  by surface tension from breath moisture and forming an airtight seal when the valve is forced up against the base during exhalation.","The inverted outlet valve  cooperates with the conical airflow guide  to create an unobstructed airflow channel  through the cavity  of the module body . Exhalation air (shown by arrows) flows from the interior of the respirator through the airflow apertures  at the inner face  of the module body . The exhalation air then passes by the inverted outlet valve  and around the conical airflow guide , through the airflow channel , and through the slots  in the outer face  of the module body . Exhalation air in the form of speech by the wearer passes through the airflow channel  in a like manner; the expansion contour of the horn form of the airflow channel enhances the intelligibility of the wearer's speech.","The surfaces of the side wall of the cavity  and the skirt  of the domed valve  at the inner portion of the module and the side wall of the cavity  and the upper surface  of the conical airflow guide  define an expanding airflow channel in a smooth continuous horn pattern between the airflow apertures  and the slots  to amplify the speech from the user and to minimize the flow resistance through the airflow channel. The airflow through the airflow channel has very little, if any, turbulence and yet has a very low dynamic leakage due to the sensitivity of the exhalation valve. The combination of the low resistance domed valve  and the smooth, axially non-reversing and continuously expanding horn airflow passage walls minimize the airflow resistance through the airflow passage to a very low value. For example, it has been found that the flow resistance to airflow through the airflow channel  is a little as 6 mm water gauge at 85 l\/min with the configuration illustrated in the drawings and described above.","As the wearer of the respirator completes his exhalation, the outlet airflow rate decreases until it can no longer overcome the bias in the outlet valve . The outlet valve  then returns to its naturally biased position and forms a seal against the annular valve seat . As the wearer of the respirator inhales, the outlet valve  is firmly seated in the annular valve seat  and prevents the infiltration of inhalation air through the outlet airflow apertures .","The central cavity  is protected from the impingement of solid matter by the outer face grille . The domed outlet valve  is further shielded from the outer face  of the module body  by the conical airflow guide . The domed outlet valve  is not visible from the outer face  of the module body  through the outer face slots .","The respirator speech transmitter and exhalation valve module  further includes a drinking tube storage channel  for storing a drinking tube  on the exterior of the module . The drinking tube  has a distal end  for connecting to a fluid source such as a water bottle and a proximal end  for fluidly connecting to a drinking tube hole  passing through the module body .","The drinking tube hole  is selectively sealed by a drinking tube valve  shown in . The drinking tube valve  includes a blind end hollow tube  having an activation tap lever  for placement on the outside of the module body . The inner end  of the drinking tube valve  is adapted for fitting a mouthpiece  enabling a wearer of a respirator to drink from the water bottle. The drinking tube valve  includes an opening  in a side of the hollow tube  for selectively fluidly connecting the mouthpiece  to the proximal end  of the drinking tube . The drinking tube  is secured on a fitting  fluidly connected to the drinking tube hole . With the drinking tube valve  in the closed position as shown in , the fitting  and drinking tube  are fluidly isolated from the mouthpiece . When the drinking tube valve  is moved to the open position as shown in , the hole  in the side of the tube  is aligned with the fitting  to fluidly connect the drinking tube  with the mouthpiece . As the drinking tube valve  is rotated from the closed to the open position, the mouthpiece  simultaneously moves from a stored position away from the wearer's mouth to a position accessible to the wearer.","The module body  further incorporates an integrally molded communication connector block  for providing an electrical and communication connection between the inner and outer faces ,  of the module body . The connector block  is preferably integrally molded with the module body  and can be used for attaching a microphone (not shown) to internal terminal connectors  on the inner face  of the module body . The microphone can be electrically powered with the use of all three terminal connectors  or unpowered with the use of only two of the terminal connectors . A communications device, such as a radio or an amplifier (not shown) carried by the respirator user, can be connected to the external terminal connectors  on the outer face of the module body . All three terminal connectors  can be used to connect electrical power to the interior microphone. Alternatively, only two of the terminal connectors  can be used to connect the radio or amplifier to an unpowered microphone. The connector block  is also provided with an integrally molded connector block cover  for protecting the external connectors  when not in use.","In use, the respirator speech transmitter and exhalation valve module  provides an exhalation valve and airflow management for a respirator and provides a conduit through which the wearer of the respirator can intelligibly speak. For face-to-face conversation the wearer's voice is carried through the outlet airflow charmer . For electronic communication, the wearer's voice can be carried through the outlet airflow channel  to an external microphone, or the wearer can use an internal microphone electrically connected to the internal connectors  with the electronic communication device electrically connected to the external connectors . The module  provides pass-through connectors for a microphone and electronic communication. The module  further provides an attachment location for the nose cup as part of the airflow management process. Still further, the module  incorporates a drink tube connection to the mask and provides a convenient parking place for the drink tube. The module  has a low dynamic leakage while a very low flow resistance due to the smooth flow of the airflow through the air passage in the module.","While the invention has been specifically described in connection with certain specific embodiments thereof, it is to be understood that this is by way of illustration and not of limitation. Reasonable variation and modification are possible within the scope of the forgoing description and drawings without departing from the spirit of the invention which is defined in the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the drawings:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2"],"b":["6","6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 1-6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIGS. 1-7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"],"b":["9","9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 8"],"b":["10","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
