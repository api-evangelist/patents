title: Systems and methods for transcoding and place shifting media content
abstract: A set-top box (STB), digital video recorder (DVR), video player or other host device receives and interacts with a transcode module to provide enhanced transcoding capabilities that may be useful in placeshifting or other applications. The transcode module includes a host interface that couples to and communicates with the host device. The transcode module also includes a processor that receives an encrypted media stream from the host device via the bus interface, decrypts the encrypted media stream, transcodes the encrypted media stream to a different format, re-encrypts the transcoded stream, and provides the re-encrypted media stream to the host device via the host interface. The transcoded media content may be placeshifted to a remote player, stored at the host, or used for any other purpose.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This document generally relates to transcoding and\/or place shifting of media content, and more particularly relates to systems and methods for enhancing the ability of a set-top box (STB), digital video recorder (DVR), media player and\/or other host device to transcode and\/or place shift media content.","Most television viewers now receive their television signals through a content aggregator such as a cable or satellite television provider. For subscribers to a direct broadcast satellite (DBS) service, for example, television programming is received via a broadcast that is sent via a satellite to an antenna that is generally located on the exterior of a home or other structure. Other customers receive television programming through a cable, wireless or other medium. Programming is typically received at a receiver such as a \u201cset top box\u201d (STB) that demodulates the received signals and that converts the demodulated content into a format that can be presented to the viewer on a television or other display. In addition to traditionally-received television content, viewers also commonly enjoy media content that is provided from a digital video recorder (DVR), a DVD\/Blu-Ray or other removable media player, a network source of streaming media, and\/or any number of other sources. The capability to render such media content may be incorporated within a STB or other receiver device, and\/or may be provided by any number of other standalone-type devices.","More recently, consumers have expressed significant interest in \u201cplace shifting\u201d devices that allow viewing of television or other media content at locations other than their primary television set. Place shifting devices typically packetize media content that can be transmitted over a local or wide area network to a portable computer, mobile phone, personal digital assistant or other remote device capable of playing back the packetized media stream for the viewer. Placeshifting therefore allows consumers to view their media content from remote locations such as hotel rooms, offices, or any other locations where media player devices can gain access to a wireless or other communications network.","Although many different types of STBs, DVRs, disk players and other media host devices are widely deployed around the world, the vast majority of these devices do not presently support placeshifting functionality. Moreover, many host devices lack the desired processing capability to effectively transcode media streams into formats suitable for placeshifting and other purposes. Still further, the inherently insecure nature of digital communications (particularly over public networks such as the Internet) can create challenges in ensuring that only authorized users and players are allowed access to valuable media content that may be transmitted during a placeshifting session.","It is therefore desirable to create systems, devices and methods for allowing STBs, DVRs and\/or other media host devices to effectively transcode media data and\/or to securely placeshift media content from the host device to a remote media player. These and other desirable features and characteristics will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and this background section.","According to various exemplary embodiments, a set-top box (STB), digital video recorder (DVR), video player or other host device is able to receive and interact with a transcode module to provide enhanced transcoding capabilities. Such transcoding may be used to support placeshifting of media content processed by the host device, and\/or any other purpose.","In various embodiments, a transcoded module includes a host interface, such as a universal serial bus (USB) or similar interface, that couples to and communicates with the host device. The transcode module also includes a processor that is configured to receive a first encrypted stream from the host device via the host interface, wherein the first encrypted stream comprises a media stream in a first format, and wherein the processor is further configured to decrypt the encrypted stream, to transcode the media stream from the first format to a second format different from the first format, to encrypt the transcoded media stream in the second format to generate a second encrypted stream, and to provide the second encrypted stream to the host device via the host interface. In some embodiments, the second encrypted stream may be provided over a network to a remote player device. In other embodiments, the transcoded media stream may be stored at the host device or used for any other purpose.","Other embodiments provide a method executable by a digital processor in a transcode module that interfaces with a host device via a host interface. The method suitably comprises receiving a first encrypted media stream from the host device via the host interface, wherein the first encrypted media stream comprises a media stream in a first format, decrypting the first encrypted media stream to extract the media stream in the first format, transcoding the extracted media stream from the first format to a second format different from the first format, encrypting the transcoded media stream in the second format to generate a second encrypted media stream, and providing the second encrypted media stream to the host device via the host interface.","Other embodiments provide a method executable by a host device for placeshifting a media stream in a first format to a remote player via a communication network. The method suitably comprises encrypting a media stream in a first format to create an encrypted media stream, providing the encrypted media stream to a transcode module that is physically coupled to the host device, receiving a transcoded media stream from the transcode module at the host device, wherein the transcoded media stream comprises the media stream in a second format different from the first format, and directing the transmission of the transcoded media stream from the host device to a remote player via a communication network.","Still other embodiments provide a set top box configured to receive a television programming stream for presentation on a display, the set top box comprising a receiver interface configured to receive the television programming stream, a display interface configured to provide television programming signals to the display, a network interface configured to be coupled to a digital communications network, a bus interface configured to couple with a transcode module, and a controller. The controller is configured to direct the reception of the television programming stream via the receiver interface, to receive a request for a placeshifting session from a remote player via the network interface, to establish an encryption key with the transcode module, to encrypt the received television programming stream using the session key, to provide the encrypted television programming stream to the transcode module, to receive a transcoded media stream from the transcode module via the bus interface, and to transmit the transcoded media stream to the remote player via the network interface.","Various other embodiments, aspects and other features are described in more detail below.","The following detailed description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any theory presented in the preceding background or the following detailed description.","In various embodiments, host devices that may not have previously been capable of advanced media processing functions are enhanced through the addition of a transcode module that can be physically connected to the host device to allow transcoding, placeshifting and\/or other capabilities. The transcode module is a separate hardware module that can be plugged in or otherwise directly coupled to the host device to provide enhanced functionality (e.g., using a universal serial bus (USB) or similar interface). Any number of different host devices such as set top boxes (STBs), television receivers, digital video recorders (DVRs), DVD\/Blu-Ray or other removable media players and\/or the like can therefore accept the transcoded module at a convenient interface, and can thereafter use the transcoded module to provide capabilities that were not previously available using the device itself. To that end, the transcode module appropriately provides the physical, logical and other capabilities that may not otherwise be present in the host device to support placeshifting, transcoding and\/or other desired additional features. Various embodiments further maintain the security of media place shifting and other features through the use of authentication, cryptography and\/or other features, as described more fully below.","Certain systems and techniques described herein may find particular benefit when host devices capable of receiving television signals (e.g., signal feeds from a satellite, cable, wireless or other source) are enhanced to provide place shifting features. As an example, a network-enabled set top box (STB) that did not previously support placeshifting features could accept an external transcode module via a universal serial bus (USB) or similar interface to enhance the capabilities of the STB. The invention is not so limited, however; to the contrary, the features described herein may be used in conjunction with any number of conventional systems and devices, including those that interact with other external devices such as television receivers, removable media players, digital or personal video recorders, and\/or other sources of programming content to support transcoding, placeshifting and\/or other media processing features.","Turning now to the drawing figures and with initial reference to , an exemplary placeshifting system  suitably includes a host device  that physically and logically interfaces with a transcode module  that provides transcoding or other capabilities to facilitate enhanced functionality of host device , as described more fully below. Generally speaking, host device  uses transcode module  to provide transcoding, placeshifting, and\/or other additional features as desired. , for example, shows host device  providing a media stream  to the transcoded module  that can be transcoded into an appropriate placeshifting format and transmitted over network  as stream  to a remotely-located player device .  shows stream  as being generated based upon received television programming , although equivalent embodiments could provide stream  based upon content stored in a DVR or other database , content received from a network server on network , and\/or content obtained from any other source. Streams  and  are both encrypted as appropriate to prevent unauthorized interception of valuable media content during transfer between host device  and transcode module , or during transmission over network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["112","109","115","108","115","109","108","110","108","109","108","109"]},"Network  is any digital or other communications network capable of transmitting messages between senders and receivers. In various embodiments, network  includes any number of public or private data connections, links or networks supporting any number of communications protocols. Network  may include the Internet, for example, or any other network based upon TCP\/IP or other conventional protocols. In various embodiments, network  may also incorporate a wireless and\/or wired telephone network, such as a cellular communications network for communicating with mobile phones, personal digital assistants, and\/or the like. Network  may also incorporate any sort of wireless or wired local area networks, such as one or more IEEE 802.3 and\/or IEEE 802.11 networks. Host device  is therefore able to communicate using network  in any manner. Such communication may take place over a wide area link that includes the Internet and\/or a telephone network, for example; in other embodiments, communications on network  (e.g., between devices  and ) may take place over a wired or wireless local area link incorporated within network . Various types of networks  may include any number of wired, wireless and\/or other links using any number of conventional networking and communications techniques.","Host device  is any component, hardware and\/or the like capable of receiving and processing media content. In various embodiments, host device  interfaces with an external transcode module  to provide placeshifting, transcoding and\/or other features. In the embodiment shown in , for example, host device  suitably provides a media stream  to the transcode module  to allow transcoding into an appropriate digital format that can be transmitted over network , or used for any other purpose. In such embodiments, transcode module  further establishes placeshifting sessions with remote devices  using the network communications capabilities of host device  for distribution of the transcoded stream . Content of media stream  may be received at host device  in any format, and from any source such as a broadcast, cable or satellite television programming source, a \u201cvideo-on-demand\u201d or similar source, a digital video disk (DVD) or other removable media, a video camera, and\/or the like.","To that end, many implementations of host device  include media receivers or players that may not be capable of independently providing placeshifting or transcoding features without transcode module , but that nevertheless include some form of content receiving and\/or playing capabilities. Host device  may be a STB or other receiver that also provides transcoding and\/or placeshifting features, for example, as described more fully below. Such a device may receive satellite, cable, broadcast and\/or other signals that encode television programming  from an antenna , modem, server and\/or other source. Such a receiver may further demodulate or otherwise decode the received signals  to extract programming that can be locally viewed and\/or place shifted to a remote viewer  as appropriate. In some embodiments, host device  decrypts content received from a broadcaster or other content provider using, for example, a cryptographic key or other credential obtained from the content provider or its agent. In other embodiments, host device  is any other hardware or other device capable of receiving and processing media content, such as any sort of digital video recorder (DVR), DVD\/Blu-Ray or other removable media player, and\/or the like. Other types of host devices  may receive and process content received from any external receiver, STB, removable media player, streaming source and\/or the like. In still other embodiments, host device  is any sort of general or special purpose computing system, including any sort of personal computer, workstation, media player, or other device capable of interfacing with network .","In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in , host device  is shown receiving digital broadcast satellite (DBS) signals  from a satellite  at an antenna . Equivalent embodiments, however, could receive programming  from any sort of cable connection, broadcast source, removable media, service provider accessible via network , any external device and\/or the like. Some embodiments may also include a content database  stored on a hard disk drive, memory, or other storage medium to support a personal or digital video recorder (DVR) feature as appropriate. In embodiments that include DVR functionality, programming may be stored in database  as desired (e.g., in response to user\/viewer programming instructions) for subsequent viewing on a television or other display located in relatively close proximity to the host device ; programming need not be stored in all instances or embodiments, however, and programming could be alternately provided in real time. As noted above, content that would conventionally be presented on a television or other display associated with device  may be instead placeshifted to a remote device  over network  using the features of transcode module , as described more fully below.","Transcode module  is any device, component or other hardware capable of physically interfacing with the host device  and of logically providing transcoding, placeshifting and\/or other media processing capabilities for host device . In various embodiments, transcode module  includes a digital signal processor, microprocessor, microcontroller or other appropriate processing circuitry that facilitates transcoding of video signals provided by host device  into a format that can be more readily transmitted on network  or used for other desired purposes. Transcode module  may be physically provided on a circuit card or other substrate that physically and logically interfaces with host device . Transcode module  may interface with host device  using, for example, a conventional uniform serial bus (USB), IEEE 1394 (\u201cFirewire\u201d) or similar bus-type interface that allows serial or parallel transfer of data between host device  and transcode module  at an appropriate data rate. In some embodiments, much (if not all) of the electrical power consumed by the transcode module  is provided from host device  using the direct bus connection between the two components. A conventional USB bus, for example, provides a 2.5 volts source that may be used to power some or all of the various components of transcode module .","Remote device  is any device, component, module, hardware, software and\/or the like capable of receiving and playing a media stream  that is place shifted from transcode module  via host device . In various embodiments, remote device  is personal computer (e.g., a \u201claptop\u201d or similarly portable computer, although desktop-type computers could also be used), a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant, a personal media player (such as the ARCHOS products available from the Archos company of Igny, France or the various iPod products available from Apple Computer Inc. of Cupertino, Calif.), a set top box or other receiver, a television monitor and\/or the like. In many embodiments, remote device  is a general purpose computing device that includes a media player application in software or firmware that is capable of securely connecting to transcode module  via network , as described more fully below, and of receiving and presenting media content to the user of the device as appropriate. In other embodiments, remote device  is a special-purpose media player that allows for presentation of the received media stream on a remotely-located television or other display. One example of such a device is the SLINGCATCHER product available from Sling Media of Foster City, Calif., although other devices could be equivalently used in other embodiments.","Many different placeshifting scenarios could be formulated based upon available computing and communications resources, as well as consumer demand. In various embodiments, consumers may wish to placeshift content within a home, office or other structure, such as from a host device  to a desktop computer, portable computer or television located in another room. In such embodiments, the content stream  will typically be provided over a wired or wireless local area network operating within the structure. In other embodiments, consumers may wish to placeshift content over a broadband or similar network connection from a primary location to a computer, television or other remote device  located in a second home, office, hotel or other remote location. In still other embodiments, consumers may wish to placeshift content to a mobile phone, personal digital assistant, media player, video game player, automotive or other vehicle media player, and\/or other device via a mobile link (e.g., a GSM\/EDGE, CDMA\/EVDO or other connection, an IEEE 802.11 \u201cWi-fi\u201d link, and\/or the like). Several examples of placeshifting applications available for various platforms are provided by Sling Media of Foster City, Calif., although the concepts described herein could be used in conjunction with products and services available from any source.","It is generally desirable to maintain security of the placeshifting process to ensure that unauthorized users and unauthorized players do not gain access to programming content. This is particularly true when host device  is a television receiver, STB or DVR that also provides placeshifting capabilities, since the amount of valuable content available within the device could be significant. To maintain the security of the connection, then, media content  provided from the host device  to the transcode module  is appropriately encrypted to prevent unauthorized interception of the content. Transcoded content  is similarly encrypted prior to transport to the host device  or to the remote player over network .","Content  received at any sort of host device  can therefore be converted by transcode module  to a packetized media stream  that can be transmitted on network  or used for any other purpose. To maintain the security of the media streams  and , transcode module  may establish digital credentials (e.g., digital signatures, symmetric or asymmetric keys, and\/or the like) with host device  and\/or remote player  that allow for secure access to placeshifting and transcoding features, as explained more fully below. Content  can therefore be received, demodulated and or otherwise processed at host device , where it is encrypted for transport to transcoded module . This encrypted stream  is provided over a bus or other direct connection to transcoded module , which is then able to decrypt, transcoded and re-encrypt the content to create a transcoded stream . The transcoded stream  may be transmitted from transcode module  to a remote device  using the network communications capabilities of host device .","Note that various equivalent embodiments may provide transcoding features other than placeshifting using transcode module . To that end, transcode module  could be used for any transcoding application, such as the conversion of high definition video to standard definition video, or conversion between any number of different media formats. Transcode module  may be used, for example, to transcode received data into a streaming or file format that can be readily transferred to a portable media player for subsequent playback. Such conversions could take place in real time (e.g., as a media stream  is received at host device ), or in any other manner. Transcode module  could be equivalently used to transcode received video signals  from an MPEG or other received format into a different format (e.g., H.264 or the like) for DVR or other storage in a more efficient or more highly compressed format. Other features and uses may be contemplated in any number of equivalent embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["115","108","108","105","108"]},"Host device  may be logically and physically implemented in any manner.  shows various logical and functional features that may be present in an exemplary host device ; each module shown in the figure may be implemented with any sort of hardware, software, firmware and\/or the like. Any of the various modules may be implemented with any sort of general or special purpose integrated circuitry, for example, such as any sort of microprocessor, microcontroller, digital signal processor, programmed array and\/or the like. Any number of the modules shown in , for example, may be implemented as a \u201csystem on a chip\u201d (SoC) using any suitable processing circuitry under control of any appropriate control logic . In various embodiments, control logic  executes within an integrated SoC or other processor that implements receiver , transport selector , decoder , display processor  and\/or disk controller , as appropriate. In such embodiments, the integrated SoC processor may interact with a transcode module  as well as any other input or output devices to produce desired outputs based upon inputs received from local or remote users. Broadcom Corporation of Irvine, Calif., for example, produces several models of processors (e.g., the model BCM 7400 processor) that are capable of supporting SoC implementations of satellite and\/or cable receiver systems, although products from any number of other suppliers could be equivalently used. In still other embodiments, various distinct chips, circuits or components may be inter-connected and inter-relate with each other to implement the receiving and decoding functions represented in . Host device  as shown in  therefore includes any number of appropriate modules for obtaining and processing media content as desired for the particular embodiment. Each of these modules may be implemented in any combination of hardware and\/or software using logic executed within any number of semiconductor chips or other processing logic.","Various embodiments of control logic  can include any circuitry, components, hardware, software and\/or firmware logic capable of controlling the various components device . Various routines, methods and processes executed within device  are typically carried out under control of control logic  in conjunction with transcode module , as described more fully below.","In various embodiments, control logic  executes a driver program  that communicates with transcode module  to manage transcoding, placeshifting and\/or other features accessing transcoded module  as desired. Application  suitably executes on host device  and communicates with processor  or other features of transcode module  using any appropriate application programming interface (API) or the like. The control application  may also interact with other applications, processes and\/or other features of host device  using any sort of functional API, as desired. In various embodiments, a driver application  executes within control logic  of host device  to allow software applications executing on host device  to use processor  as a co-processor or the like that is capable of efficiently and effectively performing real-time (or other) transcoding of media streams from one format to another. Driver program  may be any sort of conventional application, applet, driver or other software logic that is capable of facilitating communications between host device  and transcode module . In various embodiments, a common design for transcode module  may be used with multiple types of host devices  by generating a driver program  for each type of host device  that is supported by the transcode module .","As noted above, many embodiments of host device  include an audio and\/or video receiver , which is any hardware, software, firmware and\/or other logic capable of receiving media content via one or more content sources . In various embodiments, content sources  may include cable television, DBS, broadcast and\/or other programming sources as appropriate. Receiver  appropriately selects a desired input source and provides the received content to an appropriate destination for further processing. In various embodiments, received programming may be provided in real-time (or near real-time) to a transport stream select module  or other component for presentation to the user as the programming is received. Alternatively, receiver  may provide content received from any source to a disk or other storage medium in embodiments that provide DVR functionality. In such embodiments, device  may also include a disk controller module  that interacts with an internal or external hard disk, memory and\/or other device that stores content in a database , as described above. Receiver  may also provide demodulation, decryption, and\/or other processing to extract a compressed transport stream (e.g., an MPEG transport stream) that can be decoded for presentation on a display associated with the host device  and\/or provided to transcoded module , as desired.","In the embodiment shown in , device  also includes an appropriate network interface , which operates using any implementation of protocols or other features to support communication by device  on network . In various embodiments, network interface  supports conventional LAN, WAN or other protocols (e.g., the TCP\/IP or UDP\/IP suite of protocols widely used on the Internet) to allow device  to communicate on network  as desired. Network interface  typically interfaces with network  using any sort of LAN adapter hardware, such as any conventional network interface card (NIC) or interface to any external wired or wireless network adapter, as appropriate.","Transport stream select module  is any hardware and\/or software logic capable of selecting a desired media stream from the available sources. In the embodiment shown in , transport select module  is able to generate video signals for presentation on one or more output interfaces . The stream may be selected from any available source of content, such as network interface , receiver interface  and\/or a DVR or other storage feature associated with database . In various embodiments, transport select module  is able to provide an encoded video signal  to transcode module  in response to control logic . Transport select module  may also respond to viewer inputs (e.g., via control logic ) to simply switch encoded content received from a live source , from network interface  or from storage  to one or more decoder modules .","Device  may include any number of decoder modules  for decoding, decompressing and\/or otherwise processing received\/stored content as desired. Generally speaking, decoder module  decompresses or otherwise processes received content from stream select module  to extract encoded programming. The decoded content can then be processed by one or more display processor modules  to create a display for the viewer in any appropriate format.","Display processor module  includes any appropriate hardware, software and\/or other logic to create desired screen displays at interfaces , ,  as desired. In various embodiments, display processing module  is also able to produce on screen displays (OSDs) for electronic program guide (EPG), setup and control, input\/output facilitation and\/or other features that may vary from embodiment to embodiment. Such displays are not typically contained within the received or stored broadcast stream, but are nevertheless useful to users in interacting with device  or the like. The generated displays, including received\/stored content and any other displays may then be presented to one or more output interfaces  in any desired format. In various embodiments, display processor  produces an output signal encoded in any standard format (e.g., ITU656 format for standard definition television signals or any format for high definition television signals) that can be readily converted to standard and\/or high definition television signals at interface  for presentation to the viewer on any sort of television or other conventional display.","In placeshifting embodiments, application  or another feature of control logic  suitably receives the selected stream, encrypts the selected stream, and provides the encrypted stream  to transcode module  via interface . Transcoding module  then partially or fully decodes the video signal  before re-encoding and packetizing the decoded content for subsequent transmittal over network  as stream , as described herein. Stream  may be generated at control logic  from signal  provided by transport select module , then, although other embodiments provide the compressed media content from decoder  or the like. Decoder  may be used in some embodiments to extract, decrypt or otherwise provide a compressed stream from a multiplex or other delivery mechanism, for example, that may be provided to control logic  for encryption and delivery to transcode module  as stream . On screen displays (e.g., EPG information) and\/or other features generated by display processor  may also be provided to transcode module  as part of stream  in some embodiments.","Driver application  or other logic executing within host device , then, allows one or more output channels to be diverted to a transcoding module  for placeshifting over network . In such embodiments, compressed video is encrypted and directed toward transcode module  as desired. Output that would otherwise be sent to channel , for example, may be additionally or alternately provided to the transcoding module . An output signal encoded as an MPEG transport stream, for example, may be provided as an input to transcoding module  to support digital-to-digital conversion to a media format that can be readily transmitted on network . In other embodiments, stream  may be provided to transcoder  in any other format, such as any MPEG-2, MPEG-4 or other format used in transporting signals , storing content in DVR , and\/or the like. In such embodiments, compressed video may be provided to transcode module  from transport select module  or from any other source as desired.","To that end, transcoding module  suitably includes any appropriate hardware, software, firmware and\/or combination thereof for producing media streams or files in suitable formats for subsequent use. Transcode module  may be implemented using any sort of printed circuit board or other substrate, which may be enclosed in any sort of housing or other packaging to allow for convenient interfacing with host device . In the exemplary embodiment shown in , transcode module  suitably includes a host interface , a processor , power management circuitry , clock generation circuitry , digital memory  and a control ROM  as appropriate. Other embodiments may include additional or alternate components that may be inter-coupled in any manner","In various embodiments, transcode module is implemented with a host interface  that physically and logically interfaces with a corresponding bus interface  on host device  over a direct data connection . Interfaces  and  can be implemented using any type of serial, parallel or other conventional interface capable of directly connecting host device  and transcode module  in a manner that allows convenient and defined communications between the two components. In various embodiments, interfaces  and  are directly connected to each other using any sort of bus or other direct connection; to that end, interfaces  and  may be conventional bus interfaces such as universal serial bus (USB) or similar interfaces that correspond to published or other well-known standards. A USB implementation, for example, may allow host device  and transcode module  to physically couple using conventional mini-USB Type B connectors or the like. \u201cCoupling\u201d of transcode module  to host device  to may be performed using any sort of direct physical connection between the two devices, or any sort of indirect physical connection in which the two devices are connected with one or more intervening cables, hubs, cradles, docks and\/or other devices that facilitate physical and logical interaction between the two components.","Similarly, conventional microcontroller circuits could be used to control logical access and communications between host device  and transcode module . One example of a conventional USB microcontroller is the model CY7C68053 controller available from Cypress Semiconductor Corp. of San Jose, Calif., although any number of other conventional or other bus controllers could be equivalently used. The control circuitry associated with interface  may communicate with other components of transcode module (e.g., processor ) using any sort of general programming interface (GPIF), bus or other connection, as appropriate.","Generally speaking, it may be desirable in many implementations to provide electrical power for the entire transcode module  using the power supplied from the USB or other interface . In such implementations, electrical power can be obtained from host device  via interface , thereby reducing or even eliminating the need for a battery or separate power source for transcode module . To that end, transcode module  may include a power management circuit  that receives electrical power from the host interface  and distributes appropriate power signals to each of the other powered components within transcode module . The VBUS or other power supplied by a conventional USB interface, for example, may be appropriately provided to processor  and\/or any other components of transcode module  as desired. In an exemplary embodiment, the 2.5 volts conventionally supplied on to a USB interface  may be provided to a power management integrated circuit (PMIC) for conversion into other voltages (e.g., 0.96 volts, 1.8 volts, 3.3 volts and\/or any other voltages as desired) used by the various other components of transcode module . One example of a PMIC that may be used in some embodiments is a model TPS65023 PMIC available from Texas Instruments Inc. of Dallas, Tex., although other embodiments may use other products or circuits as desired.","Clock signals may also be extracted from interface  and\/or generated on-board in any manner. In various embodiments, transcode module  includes a clock generation circuit or other component  for generating appropriate clock signals used by the various other components. Clock generator  may be, for example, a crystal or other signal generator that is capable of producing appropriate clock signals (e.g., a 24 Mhz clock in some embodiments, although other embodiments may use any number of alternate or additional frequencies).","Various embodiments may also include a readable memory  that includes boot instructions, operating instructions and\/or other firmware code that can direct the operation of transcode module . Memory  may be, for example, a read only memory (ROM), a flash memory, an externally erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM), or other type of digital storage medium capable of maintaining instructions executable by processor  even when electrical power is not available to module . In various embodiments, however, the functionality of memory  may be combined into processor  or any other components as appropriate.","Processor  is any type of microprocessor, microcontroller, digital signal processor, programmable logic or other computing hardware capable of transcoding media streams as described herein. In various embodiments, processor  is a system-on-a-chip (SoC) video processor such as the model DXT-LP processor available from Magnum Semiconductor of Milpitas, Calif., although equivalent embodiments may be based upon processors available from Texas Instruments, Broadcom, ViXS Systems, or any number of other sources.","Processor  interacts with one or more digital memories  for storage of instructions and\/or data. Any number of memories  of any type may be provided; different types of memories  that may be used include any sort of static or dynamic random access memories (SRAM, DRAM, SDRAM or the like), including any sort of double, quad or other data rate (e.g., DDR, QDR or the like) RAM as desired. In an exemplary embodiment, processor  interacts with one or more DDR SDRAM modules available from any number of suppliers. In other embodiments, different numbers or types of RAM modules are used. In still other embodiments, memory  is integrated with processor , for example in any sort of conventional microcontroller or other SoC-type of circuitry.","Processor  suitably performs session establishment, decryption, transcoding and\/or encryption of received media streams in support of placeshifting or other desired functions. Access to processor  may be provided by, for example, driver application or similar control  executing on host device  that communicates with processor  using any appropriate application programming interface (API), as described above.","Generally speaking, transcoding module  receives a compressed encoded stream from selector  (or the like). The received stream is typically encrypted, as described more fully below, to create stream  that can be provided over interfaces - to transcode module . Transcode module  suitably decrypts the received stream  and performs a digital-to-digital conversion to create a media stream  in a desired format and having desired parameters. The transcoded stream may then be re-encrypted and provided to host device  for storage, transport on network  and\/or any other subsequent use.","In operation, then, host device  suitably receives one or more media streams  from a DBS, cable, stored media, network or other source. Received and\/or stored content  may be encrypted and provided to processor  of transcoding module  as stream  via connection  between interfaces  and . Processor  then appropriately decrypts, transcodes and\/or otherwise converts the received signals to a transcoded stream  that can be transmitted to the remote device  over network  using network interface  of host device , as described more fully below. Control of the placeshifting or other transcoding processes, including any communications related to security or authentication, may take place under the direction of processor , which may interface with application  or the like within device  to receive stream  and for access to network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","108","112","108","112","115","300","100","300","108","112","115","108","215","205","108","115","250","248","252"]},"Generally speaking, host device  receives and processes media content in any manner (function ). In embodiments wherein host device  is a conventional STB, for example, device  would typically receive, demodulate, decode and\/or decrypt television content received from a DBS, cable and\/or broadcast source. Received programming signals  (), for example, are typically encrypted using a cryptographic key, coded into a multiplex or other distribution format, and modulated on an analog carrier wave prior to transmission. A host STB device  therefore receives, demodulates, decodes, decrypts and\/or otherwise processes received programming or other signals  as appropriate to present the content to the viewer on the local display. In embodiments that support placeshifting, the received content may be demodulated, decrypted and\/or otherwise processed to place the received media stream  into a format that can be processed by transcode module . Received DBS or cable programming signals, for example, may be demodulated, decrypted and suitably decoded to extract an MPEG or other stream that can be used for subsequent processing. Decrypting of content  in some embodiments may be performed using cryptographic keys or other resources that may be provided by the television aggregator or system operator, as appropriate. Processing of the received programming stream(s)  may be performed by receiver module  (), decoder module , control logic  and\/or other logic within host device . Such processing may take place on any temporal basis; receiving and processing of programming signals  may take place concurrently with any placeshifting functions, for example, and\/or in the absence of placeshifting as desired by the viewer.","A placeshifting session within process  typically begins with the remote device  requesting a placeshifting session over network  (function ). This may be initiated by, for example, a user of remote device  opening a media player application, or otherwise initiating the process of viewing placeshifted media. In various embodiments, the remote device  is able to identify a source of placeshifted content (e.g., transcode module  using the network communication features of host ) on network  using a central server or the like. The central server may have previously received registration information that allows users to find and establish placeshifting sessions with a particular transcode module  on network . The central server may also authenticate the user (e.g., with a userid\/password or other credential) prior to authorizing the placeshifting session.","Upon successful authentication with the central server, the remote device  is able to request a connection by sending a message  to host device  via network . This request  may be sent using any suitable protocol or other format that can be received an interpreted by host device . In an exemplary embodiment, remote device  obtains an IP address or other identifier associated with the host device  from a central server operating on network  that allows the remote device  to contact the desired host device  directly via network .","The request  is received at host device  in any manner. In various embodiments, the receipt of a session request  invokes a process  to handle the placeshifting session. In other embodiments, a handler application  is already executing on host device  prior to receipt of request . In either case, the received session request  from remote device  is forwarded to notify transcode module  that a session is to be initiated (function ). This notification typically takes place through any sort of message transmitted across connection  between interfaces  and .","Transcode module  establishes the requested placeshifting session in any manner (function ). In various embodiments, processor  (or other logic in transcode module ) executes a server process or application that interacts with remote device  (and\/or any other services available on network ) using the connection to network  provided by host device . Session establishment may involve opening a first transport session with host device  to facilitate reception of encrypted stream  and a second transport session with remote device  to provide transcoded stream .","As noted above, it is generally desirable to encrypt media content transferred across network  and\/or connection . To that end, transcode module  appropriately generates, negotiates or otherwise establishes one or more cryptographic keys that can be used in the placeshifting session. These session keys may be established according to any conventional, proprietary, open and\/or other formats and techniques, and the encryption technology used for obfuscating the exchanged content data may use any proprietary or industry standard techniques such as the advanced encryption standard (AES), the data encryption standard (DES), and\/or any other techniques presently known or subsequently developed. To that end, processor  on transcode module  may execute a cryptography server application or routine that separately interacts with a client routine running on host device  (e.g., as part of application ) and another client routine running on remote player  (e.g., as part of a media player application or the like). To that end, the server routine executing on processor  suitably generates or otherwise establish session keys to be shared with the two separate clients. Keys established by the server routine may be used to encrypt and decrypt streams  and  as desired.","Session keys may be established for communications between the cryptography server and its various clients in any manner. In the exemplary embodiment shown in , transcode module  establishes keys or other cryptographic credentials used in a particular session through any sort of handshaking procedures , .  shows one handshake  between transcode module  to establish the parameters used for encrypting stream  and another handshake  between transcode module  and remote device  to establish parameters for stream . Handshake  may be performed between the cryptography server application executing on processor  and a client application executing on host device  (e.g., as part of application ). Similarly, handshake  may occur between the cryptography server application on processor  and a client application executing (e.g, as part of a media player application) on remote device . In some embodiments, a single session key may be used to encrypt both the stream  that is received from the host device  and the stream  that is transmitted to the remote player . In other embodiments, two separate session keys may be established so that the stream  from the host device  is encrypted with a first key and the transcoded stream  transmitted to the remote player  is encrypted with a second key. Other techniques for key generation, distribution and\/or negotiation may be used in any number of equivalent embodiments.","The particular content of stream  may be determined in any manner. As noted above, the user of the remote device  can provide instructions to select and adjust the particular content desired for the placeshifted stream (function ). Such content may be selected from stored content on a DVR or other database , content  received from a broadcast or source of television programming, or from any other source. Generally, user selections for desired content and any other command and control instructions  are provided from remote device  to transcode module , which appropriately processes the instructions and directs the host device to adjust the source stream  accordingly (function ). To that end, transcode module  may receive any sort of program selection, source selection or other instructions  from remote device; these instructions may be relayed in any manner to host device . Such instructions may be provided over connection  to application , for example, which appropriately interacts with software, firmware or other logic executing within host device  to change the source stream  as desired by the user. Command and control instructions  could be provided and processed at any time during the placeshifting process; corresponding instructions  may be processed accordingly to adjust the content of the stream. As the viewer wishes to change programs or otherwise adjust the received stream , the source stream  provided by host device  can be adjusted in response to instructions  and  so that the remote viewer receives the desired content in the desired format.","As noted above, at least one session key is used by host device  to encrypt the selected media stream  (function ). Such content is appropriately encrypted by application  or elsewhere within host device  using at least one of the session keys to prevent unauthorized interception. The encrypted stream  is then transmitted from host device  across connection  to transcode module .","Transcode module  suitably decrypts the encoded stream  using the appropriate session key (function ). As noted above, a single session key may be used by transcode module  to both decrypt the received encoded stream and to re-encrypt the transcoded stream. Alternatively, two separate keys could be used, with each stream being encrypted with its own session key. After decryption, the transcode module  suitably transcodes the received media stream (function ) to place the media stream in a desired format, and then re-encrypts the transcoded stream (function ) prior to transmission to remote player  (function ) via connection . The transcoded and encrypted stream  can be relayed (function ) to remote player  over network  as appropriate; in various embodiments, application  receives stream  from interface  and relays the received stream to network interface  for transmission over network  to remote device .","Transcoding of the received media stream can be performed in any manner. Generally speaking, transcoding involves performing a conversion of received content from one digital format to another using processor  or the like. Received media streams may be transcoded from MPEG or similar formats to H.264 format or the like, for example, to improve compression and thereby provide more efficient storage or data transmission. In various placeshifting embodiments, transcoding  involves converting the received media stream from a compressed or uncompressed video stream to a format that is more suitable for transmission across network , such as WINDOWS MEDIA, QUICKTIME, H.264 and\/or any other format. Transcoding, encryption and\/or transmission of content in media stream  may be adjusted in any manner during operation. In various embodiments, the media player application associated with remote player  provides command and control information to device  or to transcode module  that may be used to adjust or otherwise control transcoding, encryption or transmission as desired. Transcoding may also involve altering the encoding based upon a status of network , host device , remote player  and\/or the like. Transcoding may be adjusted to lower a frame rate, bit rate and\/or resolution in response to congestion on network , for example. Several examples of transcoding techniques suitable for use with placeshifting are described in U.S. Patent Publication 2006\/0095471, although other placeshifting and\/or transcoding features may be implemented in a wide array of alternate embodiments.","In equivalent embodiments that make use of transcoding features without necessarily providing placeshifting functionality, media content transferred between host device  and transcoding module  can be similarly encrypted to protect the content from unauthorized interception. In such embodiments, the host device would typically store and\/or further process the transcoded stream in either an encrypted or decrypted format, as desired.","As noted above, the transcoded stream  is provided remote device  using the network interface features of host device . The encrypted stream  is therefore provided to host  via connection  for re-transmission on network . In placeshifting embodiments, application  or another feature of host device  appropriately receives the encrypted and transcoded stream  and relays the stream on network  to the remote player  (function ). The remote player  is then able to receive the transcoded stream , to decrypt the stream (function ), and then to decode the decrypted stream for playing or otherwise rendering of the media content to the user (function ).","From the varying perspectives of devices , , and , then, various methods for establishing a secure placeshifting session are described in . With respect to host device , for example, a method for placeshifting a media stream to a remote player  suitably involves encrypting the media stream (function ) that is in a first format to create an encrypted media stream , providing the encrypted media stream  from the host device  to transcode module over the direct connection , receiving the transcoded media stream  from the transcode module  via connection , and relaying the media stream  in the second format to the remote player  via the communication network  (function ). The various functions of this method may be carried out by any processing circuitry or logic associated with device , including control logic  and\/or application  shown operating in .","With respect to the transcode module , an encrypted media stream  in a first format is received from the host device . This encrypted stream is decrypted  to extract the media stream in the first format, and the stream is transcoded  to a second format different from the first. The media stream in the second format is then appropriately encrypted  and provided to the host  for storage, re-transmission and\/or other use as desired. Transcode module may further establish the placeshifting session (function ) with remote player  and host device , and may manage any command and control instructions  received from the remote player  by providing suitable instructions  to host device . The various functions of this method may be executed within a software or firmware executing on processor  of transcode module .","Using the various systems, methods and other concepts described herein, any number of advantages may be achieved. By providing a transcode module as a separate hardware component that can be coupled to a host device, host devices that do not presently have the capability to transcode and\/or placeshift media content can be expanded to provide such functionality in some embodiments. A conventional set-top box, DVR or other media player, for example, can be enhanced to provide transcoding and\/or placeshifting features using external transcode modules as described herein. Further, by providing sufficient cryptographic and other security features, access to placeshifted content can be limited to authorized users, thereby preserving the security of the placeshifted\/transcoded media content.","As noted at the outset, the various features described herein may be selectively applied, and not all features will be found in all embodiments. For example, it is not necessary that all embodiments relate to STB host devices or placeshifting. To the contrary, various transcode modules could be used with any number of media players or other host devices to perform any number of features, including simple format conversions. Various embodiments, for example, could provide conversion from a streaming to a file-based format for playback on a conventional portable media player, or conversion of received media streams to more compressible formats (e.g., H.264 format) for more efficient file storage in a DVR or the like. Other embodiments could be used in conjunction with a personal computer or similar host device to assist in streaming media over a network (e.g., from a media projector application such as the SLING PROJECTOR application available from Sling Media Inc.), or for any other purpose.","As used herein, the word \u201cexemplary\u201d means \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any implementation described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations.","While the foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled in the art with a convenient road map for implementing various embodiments of the invention, it should be appreciated that the particular embodiments described above are only examples, and are not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the invention in any way. To the contrary, various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements described without departing from the scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES","p":["Exemplary embodiments will hereinafter be described in conjunction with the following drawing figures, wherein like numerals denote like elements, and",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
