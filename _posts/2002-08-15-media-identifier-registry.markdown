title: Media identifier registry
abstract: A media identifier registry for managing metadata records. The registry stores a unique logical identifier for each of the records as well as a base type corresponding to each of the logical identifiers. The base types are representative of the information contained in the respective metadata records for the corresponding logical identifiers. The registry further defines associations between the logical identifiers and base types. Improvements in identifying media content and related information according to the invention permit building a media data warehouse capable of aggregating data from many different sources, uniquely identify the same piece of content from different data providers, in different cultures, and in different physical forms to allow a consistent set of data to be stored and retrieved.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to the field of data management and publishing. In particular, this invention relates to an identification registry for use in storing, retrieving, aggregating, and associating identifiers to deliver data such as content-related media metadata.","Due to recent advances in technology, computer users are now able to enjoy many features that provide an improved user experience, such as playing various media and multimedia content on their personal or laptop computers. For example, most computers today are able to play compact discs (CDs) so users can listen to their favorite musical artists while working on their computers. Many computers are also equipped with digital versatile disc (DVD) drives enabling users to watch movies.","As users become more familiar with advanced features on their computers, such as those mentioned above, their expectations of the various additional innovative features will undoubtedly continue to grow. Users often desire to receive media metadata, which includes content-related data associated with digital media files such as those from CDs and DVDs. Independent data providers (IDPs), such as Loudeye Corporation and All Media Guide (AMG) of Alliance Entertainment Corp., capture a vast amount of information related to music CDs and other digital media. IDPs usually enter the collected data manually and store and manage the data using their own particular data entry application. Each IDP uses a different format for identifying content. Those skilled in the art are also familiar with media metadata services that collect information from users when metadata for a specific, requested media file is unavailable from an IDP. For example, consider a media player software application that enables a user to play a CD on his or her computer. Typically, the application allows the user to display track information associated with the CD by clicking on an appropriate user interface (UI). Such track information may include track number, song title, playing time, and the like.","The wide and varied tastes of computer users in music, movies, and the like create the need for an enormous corpus of metadata. As such, data publications of media metadata tend to be very large and experience a high volume of query traffic (e.g., several multi-gigabytes in size and under constant access). Also, the same logical content may have many different physical representations, which makes it difficult to identify and retrieve the correct media metadata for a specific media file. Moreover, the same piece of content from different data providers and\/or in different cultures may be identified differently. These problems complicate the storage, management, and retrieval of media metadata, particularly in the context of a large database with data collected from multiple sources.","International Standard ISO 15707, published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) on Nov. 15, 2001, provides one scheme for identifying a logical piece of work. In general, ISO 15707 defines the format, administration, and rules for allocating an international standard musical work code (ISWC) to a musical work. The ISWC uniquely distinguishes one musical work from another within computer databases and related documentation for those involved in the administration of rights to musical works. The standard's goal is to reduce errors when information about musical works is exchanged between rights societies, publishers, record companies, and other interested parties on an international level. As defined in ISO 15707, the ISWC includes a prefix element followed by a nine-digit numeric code and a check digit. Unfortunately, this standard focuses on rights management rather than data management and aggregation and is limited in scope to musical works. Moreover, the existing standard does not provide for associating and mappings related identifiers, which is important when providing useful media metadata.","Those skilled in the art are also familiar with various tagging schemes for identifying digital content. For example, an ID3 tag residing at the end of an audio file can include title, artist, album, year, genre, track, and a comment field. In other words, known tagging systems embed data about the content directly in the content. The problem is that this metadata can become stale and even incorrect. While the ID3 standard provides for an identifier, it is merely a placeholder and there is no specification on how it is to be used. Moreover, existing tagging schemes also fail to address associations and mappings between identifiers.","Accordingly, this invention arose out of concerns for providing systems and methods for processing data to improve the breadth and quality of stored media metadata and, thus, improve the processing of media content to provide an enhanced, rich, and robust user experience. Improvements in identifying media content and related information, as well as in the techniques used to store, retrieve, aggregate, and associate identifiers is desired. Such improvements should permit building a media data warehouse capable of aggregating data from many different sources. In this regard, an identification system, or ID registry, is desired to uniquely identify the same piece of content from different data providers, in different cultures, and in different physical forms to allow a consistent set of data to be stored and retrieved.","The invention meets the above needs and overcomes one or more deficiencies in the prior art by providing improved management of metadata to enhance user experience when playing various media, including CDs and DVDs. Advantageously, the present invention improves how media content and related information are identified, as well as the techniques used to store, retrieve, aggregate, and associate identifiers. Systems and methods of the invention permit building a media data warehouse capable of aggregating data from many different sources. In this regard, an identification system uniquely identifies the same piece of content from different data providers, in different cultures, and in different physical forms to allow a consistent set of data to be stored and retrieved. The invention handles data about media content and authors without being bound to the physical or cultural representation of the data or to any of a number of incomplete or proprietary identification systems. The invention also enables a single logical identifier to be embedded in digital media content for use in retrieving metadata about the content. The identifier, which is independent of the physical media, can also be used to map other identification systems that are based on the physical properties of the media. This permits returning consistent data for different physical renderings of the same logical piece of content based on a mapping to the unique logical identifier. Moreover, the features of the present invention described herein are less laborious and easier to implement than currently available techniques as well as being economically feasible and commercially practical.","Briefly described, a method of managing metadata embodying aspects of the invention includes maintaining a database of metadata records. The metadata records each correspond to one or more media files and contain information relating to content of the corresponding media files. The media files are adapted for rendering by a media player program executed on one or more client computers. The method also includes generating a unique logical identifier for each of the metadata records. In this instance, the logical identifiers are configured for use in querying the metadata database. The method continues with defining a base type corresponding to each of the logical identifiers. The base types are representative of the information contained in the respective metadata records for the corresponding logical identifiers. The method also includes storing the logical identifiers and the base types in an ID registry and defining associations between them.","Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a system for managing metadata, which includes a server coupled to a data communications network and a database of metadata records. The metadata records each correspond to one or more media files and contain information relating to content of the corresponding media files. The media files are adapted for rendering by a media player program executed on one or more client computers, which are also coupled to the data communications network. An ID registry stores a unique logical identifier for each of the metadata records. In this instance, the logical identifiers being configured for use by the server in querying the metadata database. The ID registry further stores a base type corresponding to each of the logical identifiers and associated therewith in the ID registry. The base types are representative of the information contained in the respective metadata records for the corresponding logical identifiers.","In another embodiment, a data structure according to the invention has a first field containing unique logical identifiers and a second field containing base types associated with the logical identifiers. The logical identifiers correspond to a metadata record, which correspond to media files. The metadata records contain information relating to content of the corresponding media files. The base types each corresponding to one of the logical identifiers. In this instance, the base types are representative of the information contained in the respective metadata records for the corresponding logical identifiers.","Computer-readable media having computer-executable instructions for performing methods of managing metadata embody further aspects of the invention.","Alternatively, the invention may comprise various other methods and apparatuses.","Other features will be in part apparent and in part pointed out hereinafter.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the drawings.","Referring now to the drawings,  illustrates an exemplary network environment in which the present invention can be used. A system  has one or more client computers  coupled to a data communication network . One or more server computers , sometimes referred to as \u201cweb servers\u201d or \u201cnetwork servers,\u201d are also coupled to the network . In turn, the client computer  can access the server  via network . As shown in , the system  also includes one or more databases  associated with server .","In this example, network  is the Internet (or the World Wide Web). However, the teachings of the present invention can be applied to any data communication network. Server  and client computer  communicate in the illustrated embodiment using the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), a protocol commonly used on the Internet to exchange information.","Referring further to , the user's computer  accesses a digital media file , such as one residing on a compact disc or other suitable computer storage media. Client computer  also executes a web browser  and a media player application program . In this embodiment, server  and its associated database  form a repository web site  with which computer  communicates via network  to access data stored in database . The media player program  can be any suitable rendering filter or media player that is configured to play digital media so that a user can experience the content that is embodied on the media. For example, suitable media player applications include a CD media player application and a DVD media player application.","One aspect of the present invention enables the user or, particularly, enables media player program  executed on a computing device or client, to access, retrieve, and display for the user, so-called metadata. Those skilled in the art are familiar with metadata, which is simply information about data. In the context of the present invention, metadata involves information related to specific content of digital media file  being played on the media player . Basic metadata includes title, composer, performer, genre, description of content, and the like. Extended metadata includes cover art, performer biographies, reviews, related performers, where to buy similar items, upcoming concerts, ticket sales, URLs to other related experiences including purchase opportunities, and the like.","In the embodiment of , server  matches the metadata stored in database  to the specific media content that is being experienced by the user. Server  then returns the metadata to the user's computer . It is to be understood that  presents a simplified illustration of the relationship between computer , server , and database . Aspects of the invention involving this relationship between the components will be described in greater detail below.","In the examples herein, the media content of digital media file  is described in the context of content embodied on a CD or a DVD. It is to be appreciated and understood that the media content can be embodied on any suitable media, including digital files downloaded to the client computer's memory, and that the specific examples described herein are given to further understanding of the inventive principles. For convenience, digital media file  refers to one or more files representing, for example, a single song track or a collection of tracks such as would be found on an audio CD. The media content can include, without limitation, specially encoded media content in the form of, for example, an encoded media file such as media content encoded in Microsoft\u00ae Windows Media\u2122 format using the Microsoft\u00ae Windows Media\u2122 Player program.","The resultant system  permits the user to play media file  on an enabled media-playing device (e.g., computer  running Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae operating system and Windows Media\u2122 Player) and expect not only to experience the media content but also have access to all manner of related metadata. In addition, the user community has the ability to contribute key information to the process to improve the experience for other users.","In the exemplary embodiment of , a web service (i.e., repository web site ) provides data about music CDs and the like to media player application . Each time a user plays a CD, for example, in the media player, the media player contacts the web service to see what CD information (e.g., title, artist, cover art, track names, etc.) is available. On the back-end, the web service aggregates CD data from a number of different sources, including the user community. The data feeds vary periodically (e.g., daily). The process of collecting metadata is explained below in connection to . In this example, the web service publishes new CD information from different sources every day.","The present invention provides improved management of metadata to enhance user experience when playing media file . In one embodiment, the invention permits building a media data warehouse capable of aggregating data from many different sources. In this regard, an identifier (ID) registry uniquely identifies the same piece of content from different data providers, in different cultures (including different languages), and in different physical forms to allow a consistent set of data to be stored and retrieved. This ID registry handles data about media content and authors without being bound to the physical or cultural representation of the data or to any of a number of incomplete or proprietary identification systems. The invention enables a single logical identifier to be embedded in digital media content for use in retrieving metadata about the content. According to the invention, the identifier is independent of the physical media and can be used to map other identification systems that are based on the physical properties of the media. This permits returning consistent data for different physical renderings of the same logical piece of content based on a mapping to the unique logical identifier.","Referring now to , one embodiment of repository web site  provides import, datastore, and publishing functions at . Typically, known independent data providers  of media metadata (e.g., Loudeye, AMG, and Oricon) supply the repository with trusted information, that is, source data. In this instance, each IDP  specializes in the gathering and management of media metadata and licenses the data to system . Due to the trusted nature of the source, this data is treated as \u201ccanonical.\u201d As an example, popular albums that have been released for many years tend to have well-established metadata.","In , the user gathers content-related media data directly from a CD, for example, at  and then submits the information at . System  publishes metadata in several formats. As shown at , published metadata takes the form of basic CD information. System  can also publish the data in extended CD format at  and\/or DVD format at . As indicated at , the present invention contemplates other types of data output.","The present invention beneficially scales well to multiple data providers . While basic metadata for each digital media type (e.g., CD, DVD) can be considered universal because they are tied to the data standards in the media, extended metadata varies widely among multiple data providers. Many data publishers require full updates of metadata on a regular basis. Thus, the use of conventional tagging schemes and the like is problematic.","When the user accesses (\u201crips\u201d) an audio track from a specific digital medium, the ripped track (i.e., digital media file ) is stored on local storage media associated with the user's computer, such as client computer  in  (see also computer  in ). If client computer  is connected to network , as described with reference to  and , media player program  executing on computer  sends an identifier for digital media file  to server  of repository web site  via network . As described below, the ID may take the form of a physical identifier. Repository web site  has access to database . In response to the received ID, for example, server  transmits metadata associated with the identified media file  to the user's computer .","In one embodiment, each media file  (in which the content that is to be experienced by the user resides) has a physical ID associated therewith. The invention assigns or otherwise associates the physical ID with a unique logical ID in an ID registry, which it then uses as the basis for any database queries. With respect to the physical IDs that are associated with the media, any suitable method or technique of generating a physical ID can be used. For example, when a user inserts a piece of media into a properly configured and enabled device, software code can execute and read data from the physical media. The software code can then compose a unique or nearly unique physical ID from that data.","In the case where the media comprises a CD, the identifier may take the form of a physical ID such as a table of contents (TOC) identifying the specific digital media file  based on the offsets of each track on the disc. Software code can read the offsets (in frames, which have a resolution of 1\/72of a second) of each track on the disc. A composite key or physical ID is then built from a string of the hex values of these offsets, prefaced by a number of tracks on the disc and finished with a representation of the total length of the disc. The TOC, defined by a well-known specification referred to as the Red Book, identifies an audio CD based on absolute times for the start of each track. In general, the TOC is implicitly computed based on the offsets of each track and is expected to be the same for all like-entitled CDs published from the same source (in certain instances, the TOC may also be found in the CD's lead-in area).","In the case where the media comprises a DVD, software code can read the first 64 kilobytes of two files that are found on every DVD. These files are VIDEO_TS.IFO and VTS010.IFO. The former contains main-menu information (VMGI), and the latter contains title set information (VTSI) for the first title on the DVD. After the appropriate data blocks are read, the code generates a 64-bit CRC (cyclic redundancy code) checksum of the data, resulting in an appropriately unique key or physical ID.","Of course, it is to be understood that the above two examples are simply two ways that a physical ID can be generated for two different types of media. Other methods of generating physical IDs, such as an International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) or an audio fingerprint or digital watermark for a pulse code modulation (PCM) stream, as well as other media types can be employed. In general, the physical IDs are computed media identifiers.","The client computer  executes software code in this example to calculate the physical IDs on the client side. In one embodiment, such code comprises part of a software-implemented media player (e.g., media player program ) that is configured to play the media of interest. Once client computer  generates the physical IDs, it sends them to server  of the repository web site  via network  using a suitable protocol. The server  then uses the physical ID in connection with an ID registry system that, as described in detail below, uniquely identifies the same piece of content from different data providers, in different cultures, and in different physical forms to allow a consistent set of data to be stored and retrieved. The ID registry handles data about media content and authors without being bound to the physical or cultural representation of the data or to any of a number of incomplete or proprietary identification systems used by various IDPs. The invention enables a single logical ID for use in retrieving metadata about the content of digital media file . This unique identifier, which is independent of the physical media, can also be used to map other identification systems that are based on the physical properties of the media. As such, system  can return consistent metadata for different physical renderings of the same logical piece of content based on a mapping to the unique logical identifier.","Various features of the described systems and methods include a set of databases, client side executable code, and a series of server side processes that provide for querying and maintaining the databases. One logical organization of exemplary system  includes a process to define a unique logical ID for digital media file  in an ID registry and to map the unique ID to various pieces of physical media, other identifiers for the same content, and the like. This organization also includes a query process to retrieve information from database  based on the unique ID.","In system , the user on the client side inserts the media into computer , or otherwise causes the content of media file  to be experienced. As described above, computer  uses a physical ID identifying specific media file  to access the logical ID that uniquely identifies the media. Server  then uses the logical ID in the ID registry as the basis for metadata queries of database . These queries are designed to retrieve a rich set of related metadata for the user. Server  then returns the metadata to client computer  via network  for display to the user.","With reference to , the present invention involves an identification system  for media content and content-related information, as well as methods of storing, retrieving, aggregating, and associating identifiers.  illustrates one embodiment of the invention by way of a process flow diagram. In this instance, an ID registry  uses a database schema (see ) and a set of functions and procedures for storing, retrieving, and maintaining relationships in the schema to implement the invention. The registry  acts as a fundamental building block of a media data warehouse  capable of aggregating data from many different sources, such as IDPs  or user feedback (not shown in ).","The goal of the identification system  and, particularly, ID registry , is to uniquely identify the same piece of content from different data providers, in different cultures, and in different physical forms. For example, different IDPs use different formats for their identifiers so the same content may be identified by a number of different identifiers. Also, performers often use different stage names at different points in their careers and the same song may be found in a number of different physical forms, such as a CD track, MP3 file, etc. System  beneficially stores a consistent set of media-related data in a data publication  that integrates data from many different sources and from many different cultures. The use of ID registry  according to the invention also allows system  to consistently retrieve the data when presented with information about the physical format and unique characteristics of media file .","Beginning at  and , a computer such as server  processes source data (e.g., content-related metadata for a plurality of digital media files ) from one or more data providers . At , system  imports the source data into the data warehouse  and, at , system  generates standardized, unique, logical IDs for source rows of data. For example, system  generates unique Ids for artist\/performer, albums, tracks, etc. Process flow in  continues to one or more processes  for performing ID storage functions and one or more processes  for performing data aggregation functions.","At , server  writes the unique logical IDs generated at , as well as associations and mappings with various other identifiers, to ID registry  (see database schema of ). As described above, identification system  provides one common ID space, i.e., registry . This allows system  to store and retrieve IDs (see ID retrieval at ) using a single data type regardless of the characteristics of the data referred to by a particular unique logical ID. Using a common data type in this manner further allows a number of relationships (i.e., associations and mappings) between IDs to be stored using a common schema (described in greater detail below). In one embodiment, the invention abstracts the unique logical identifier from any one of a number of possible identifiers used to represent the physical media itself. Thus, the unique ID stored in registry  is actually a logical identifier for digital media file . Various different physical media identifiers, such as a TOC and track number for a CD, an ISRC, or an audio fingerprint or digital watermark for a PCM stream can all be mapped to the same unique logical identifier.","The system  also maps non-homogenous identifiers of different data types and formats from various IDPs  into the common ID space of registry . ID registry  maintains status information about the various identifiers, such as whether the data provider  has discontinued a particular identifier or replaced it with another identifier. This, again, provides a layer of abstraction between different data representations of media file  across multiple data providers . According to the invention, the unique logical identifier can also be embedded in digital content to provide a link back to ID registry . This means that data about the digital content of media file  can be maintained, updated, corrected, and enhanced in a central place and can be requested again at any time.","Process flow continues from the data collection functions at  to the aggregation functions at . In this instance, server  utilizes the common ID space of registry  to publish the source data from data warehouse  as a homogenized (i.e., aggregated) data publication . In this regard, the present invention uniquely identifies the same piece of content from different data providers, in different cultures, and in different physical forms using a single, unique, logical ID. System  allows a consistent set of metadata to be stored in data publication  at  and then retrieved at  based on, for example, the unique logical ID associated with the physical ID of media file .","In addition, the illustrated embodiment of  performs various bookkeeping functions at  to maintain integrity and consistency of the ID system as a whole. The bookkeeping functions remove IDs from registry  when they no longer refer to anything and re-map the corresponding information to other unique logical IDs. These functions at  also protect against circular references and the like. At , this embodiment of the invention also tracks IDs based on their type and generates statistics based on data publication  and the type information stored in registry .","Referring further to the processes illustrated in , ID registry  is embodied by a database schema that tracks each logical ID in the schema, and its type, when it was created. The logical ID itself is a globally unique identifier (GUID), for example. In general, a GUID is a 128-bit value known by those skilled in the art to be unique. At , server  generates the unique logical ID using a presently available GUID function (e.g., the newid( ) function of the Microsoft\u00ae SQL Server\u2122 database server application). In turn, the newid( ) function uses an application programming interface such as CoCreateGUID( ) to create the GUID. For simplicity, the foregoing describes server  as creating the logical ID. However, it is to be understood that the use of a GUID as the data type for IDs in the present invention means that several autonomous systems can be used to generate logical IDs without risk of creating duplicates. In other words, the invention advantageously permits creation of logical IDs in a federated manner. This is a useful property for improving the scalability of ID generation. Also, the use of GUIDs relieves the overhead of checking to see if an ID has already been used or pulling from a central pool of known new IDs.","In one embodiment of the invention, the logical IDs of registry  do not contain any type information. Thus, the invention eliminates the risk of partitioning the ID space and running out of useable IDs. The core registry table, ID registry , associates each logical ID with its type. For example, the type is a bit field used to describe the logical ID. Each logical ID in this embodiment has a base type (e.g., a piece of content, a collection of content, or a content author or performer). The \u201ctype\u201d indicates to what type of information the logical ID refers. Each type can be further specified to the extent that each unique type can still be represented as a unique bit field. So, the specificity of the type system is only constrained by the size of the bit field.","Having a single underlying data type while storing semantic type information separately for all logical IDs written to ID registry  permits functions and interfaces to be written generally. For example, a generalized web service can look up a unique logical ID for a specific media file  and return a type specific extensible markup language (XML) document based on the ID's type passed as input. Another generalized web service can take a logical ID as input and return all of the media-related content associated with the particular logical ID, whether it is an identifier for a CD, DVD, or other collection of content.","The invention further contemplates the use of type information stored in registry  when a more strongly typed interface is required. In one instance, a web service can verify artist information by checking that the logical ID passed as input has a base type of \u201cartist.\u201d The ID retrieval process  quickly checks for a specific type by a \u201cbookmarked\u201d retrieval of the ID from registry  and a check for the specific bits required in the identifier's type bit field. In the alternative, if a table or view exists containing all IDs of a specific type, such as artists, system  permits retrieval of information about the artist from the table. This allows for both a check of the existence of the logical ID of the particular type and retrieval of domain data about the logical ID at the same time. In this alternative embodiment, a domain table contains domain data for all logical IDs of the specific type.","Referring further to , registry  also associates logical IDs with other IDs. At ID storage stage , server  writes such associations to ID registry . Associations are useful for indicating when one thing is like another but not the same. A generalized collection table, for example, represents a basic association. The collection has a simple schema containing a collection ID, an element ID, and an ordinal value. The schema in this embodiment permits ordered collections to be represented. Ordered collections occur commonly in connection with media metadata and can be used to represent things like tracks on a CD, menu and chapter information on a DVD, individual media in a box set, or a radio play list. The flexibility of a common base data type for all IDs allows this collection table to be used in a general way.","Another important type of collection held in a separate schema is a temporal collection, rather than just an ordered collection. This schema is important for describing a collection that only exists for a certain period of time. For example, a band and its members is a temporal collection. Inasmuch as a band is really an entity unto itself and yet comprised of individual members, each band receives a separate identifier as a separate logical entity to be associated with content.","Another important relationship is between people, or collections of people, and content. This type-based association includes things like authors, composers, directors, and performers and how they related to the content of one or more media files . System  associates a person logical ID with a content logical ID. Again, a bit field describes the role of the person with respect to the content. Thus, system  easily associates a single person once with a piece of content and then \u201cANDs\u201d the bit field with the correct bits for various other types. This allows the same person to have an association type that indicates producer, director, writer and actor for a given piece of content.","Any number of different associations can be contained in the common schema of system  due to the choice of a single data type for the unique media logical identifier. One immediate benefit of the generic hierarchical nature of the associations is that a status that is applied at the root level can easily be applied at all levels below.","At , server  also writes mappings to ID registry  in addition to associations. Mapping the unique logical identifier assigned to a particular media file  to other ID domains is a core function of registry  and most of the current processes built in and around registry  are used to maintain these mappings. The two main areas of mapping are a) mapping a unique logical identifier to one or more IDs in other data providers' ID systems; and b) mapping a unique logical identifier to one or more physical identifiers. Mappings are useful for indicating when disparate things are really the same. System  implements mappings using a unique schema each time a logical ID needs to be mapped to a different data type or a different number of columns. For example, system  maps GUIDs (i.e., the logical IDs) to other information, such as source IDs and domain IDs. In one embodiment, source IDs identify media file  using the identifier convention of a particular IDP  or the file's physical ID and domain IDs indicate whether the data is CD, DVD, or another type of digital media data.","In one embodiment, a single table maps IDs from other data providers  to the unique logical identifiers of registry . The schema (see ) has a column for the unique logical identifier, another column for the provider's ID and yet another column for the bit field corresponding to the type of the provider's ID. System  uses the type to construct more and more detailed types by adding bits. For instance, a simple check can be used to identify all IDs from a given provider , then all IDs about music from provider  and finally all IDs about CD tracks from the given provider . A single unique logical identifier can be mapped to many IDs from different IDPs . This is part of the power of the unique logical identifier system .","The provider-type ID currently uses a variable length string of up to 100 unicode characters. The length has proved flexible enough to accommodate several IDPs . For example, numeric identifiers, such as those used by certain IDPs , can easily be converted to character data. In cases where data provider  does not maintain a unique identifier for data, system  can usually construct one from a group of fields considered to be unique. Thus, one logical identifier in a common ID space (i.e., registry ) can be used to map into different provider ID systems. Each IDP  may provide data in very different schema covering different elements about the same piece of content. Similarly, the data can also be provided in many different languages and culturally specific ways. As long as the data relates to the same logical piece of content of media file , system  relates it using a single, unique, logical identifier, which can also be associated with various physical recordings or representations of the content.","In one embodiment, multiple schemas store different physical IDs mapped to the unique logical identifiers of registry . This is based mainly on the widely different physical identifiers used for different types of media. For instance, CDs can consume up to 600 characters to uniquely identify a disc, using the standard TOC method. DVDs use a proprietary Microsoft identifier that consumes only 16 characters. As such, system  stores the mappings for these in separate schema. As other fingerprinting, watermarking and ISRC-based technologies become available to identify digital content, system  can similarly map the identifiers into ID registry .","Referring now to the bookkeeping processes at , the present invention maintains integrity and consistency of the ID system  as a whole by these data back end operations. The bookkeeping processes handle statuses for IDs that no longer refer to anything. For instance, if data provider  deletes a particular ID from its ID system, ID registry  can keep track of when the unique logical IDs no longer refer to useful data. This is important because the identifier could be embedded in a piece of content. If so, it would need to be flagged and re-mapped to another unique logical ID in system  that has data available. In the alternative, the data needs to be acquired through an editorial process.","The system  further ensures that one unique data provider ID or physical ID is only mapped to one single unique identifier through data constraints to prevent circular references in the collection relationships. System  also maintains other type-based integrity for important ID relationships. For example, a piece of content should never refer to a collection that does not exist and track information should never refer to an album that does not exist. Conversely, all content should have at least one performer associated with it. In one embodiment, the invention implements these rules as database triggers to maintain consistency at the time the logical IDs are stored in registry .","Advantageously, system  enables a single logical ID to be embedded in digital media content and\/or collections of digital media content and used to retrieve metadata about the media. The logical identifier can also be used to map other ID systems that are based on, for example, physical properties of the media file . Inasmuch as the logical identifier is independent of the physical media, a digital music file or a CD track or an audio stream can all be used to retrieve the same logical identifier from ID registry , presuming they all share the same metadata. In other words, system  returns consistent data for different physical renderings of the same logical piece of content return consistent data based on the unique logical identifier to which the physical IDs are mapped.","Referring now to , the present invention further provides an improved data schema for implementing ID registry . In , PK refers to Primary Key, FK refers to Foreign Key, AK refers to Alternate Key, U refers to Unique, and I refers to Index. In addition, the cardinality of the relationships among tables in the user feedback data schema is indicated as follows: One to Many (1 . . . *); One to One (1 . . . 1); and Zero or More (*).","The exemplary schema of  includes an Album table for at least two data providers  for purposes of illustration. In this instance, the Provider A data makes reference to an AlbumID primary key and the Provider B data makes reference to a UPC (universal product code) primary key. Both Album primary keys are associated with the unique logical identifier MSID in the ID Registry table. As described above, each MSID has a base type to identify to what the identifier refers. In this example, the base type is \u201calbum.\u201d","The present invention enables an essential service, namely, linking a general metadata experience with a purchase opportunity, or \u201cbuy\u201d experience. In this instance, the information used to determine whether a particular item is available for purchase is not included in the source data for Provider A. However, there is a unique logical ID in registry  that is common between the general purpose data and an external data source that holds specific information as to whether an item is available for purchase (i.e., source data from provider B). Given these two disparate data sources, system  uses the ID registry  to make a positive match between the information and provide a seamless user experience.","In this specific example, among the attributes of an album is the UPC. While this is included in the general purpose database, it is not intended to indicate anything relative to the product's availability. A separate database that includes a more up-to-date UPC list is also included in the ID registry . Based on this data, system  can build a \u201cbuy\u201d experience that incorporates current sales availability information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","116","102","500","106"]},"In the illustrated embodiment, computer  has one or more processors or processing units  and a system memory .
