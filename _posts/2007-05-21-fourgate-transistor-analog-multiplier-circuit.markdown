title: Four-gate transistor analog multiplier circuit
abstract: A differential output analog multiplier circuit utilizing four G-FETs, each source connected to a current source. The four G-FETs may be grouped into two pairs of two G-FETs each, where one pair has its drains connected to a load, and the other par has its drains connected to another load. The differential output voltage is taken at the two loads. In one embodiment, for each G-FET, the first and second junction gates are each connected together, where a first input voltage is applied to the front gates of each pair, and a second input voltage is applied to the first junction gates of each pair. Other embodiments are described and claimed.

Typical analog multiplier circuits, such as the so-called Gilbert multiplier, use on average from six to ten transistors for a differential output.","In the description that follows, the scope of the term \u201csome embodiments\u201d is not to be so limited as to mean more than one embodiment, but rather, the scope may include one embodiment, more than one embodiment, or perhaps all embodiments.","Embodiments described herein use a four-gate FET (Field Effect Transistor) as a basic building block in analog multiplier circuits. Four such four-gate FETs are employed to form a differential output multiplier. (Two such four-gate FETs may be employed to form a single-ended output multiplier.) The four-gate FET, denoted as G-FET, has been described in various publications, such as for example in B. J. Blalcok, et al., \u201cThe Multiple-Gate MOS-JFET Transistor\u201d, Int. Journal of High Speed Electronics and Systems, 12 (2), pp. 511-520, 2002; and in K.

Alternatively, it may be viewed as a lateral double-gate JFET (Junction FET) featuring two vertical MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor) gates (polysilicon front gate G and substrate-emulated back-gate G). The junction gates are normally reverse biased with respect to the channel, and the drain-current Iis comprised of majority carriers. The structure and layout of an n-channel G-FET may be essentially the same as that of a p-channel inversion-mode SOI MOSFET with two body contacts on each side of the channel. The body contacts, source, and drain of the inversion-mode MOSFET are used in the G-FET as the source, drain, and junction gates, respectively. The four-gates of the G-FET may be independently biased. Depending on the biasing, source and (or) volume conduction modes are available.","The junction gates operate as in a JFET, altering the potential distribution within the body via the lateral depletion regions they induce. On a partially depleted body, if the reverse bias on the junction gates is sufficiently high, they can switch the G-FET from a normally ON mode to a normally OFF mode. Further increases in the magnitude of the junction gate voltages modulate the threshold voltage related to the front gate (G). In a normally OFF mode, the saturated drain current of the G-FET may be expressed as for an accumulation-mode MOSFET by including the threshold voltage modulation by the junction gates:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["I","D"]},"mo":"=","msup":{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["K","n"]},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"V","mrow":{"mi":["G","S"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mn":"1"}},"mo":"-","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["V","T"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"V","mrow":{"mi":["JG","S"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mn":"1"}},{"mi":"V","mrow":{"mi":["JG","S"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}],"mo":","}}}}}},"mn":"2"}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"n "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["K","n"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["W","eff"]},"mi":"L"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"msub":[{"mi":["C","OX"]},{"mi":["\u03bc","neff"]}]}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["OX ","neff ","eff ","JG1S ","T","JG1S","JG2S","JG1S ","JG2S "],"b":"1","sup":"4"},"For the case where V=V\u2261V, the functional dependence of Vupon Vin the fully depleted mode has been modeled in K.
