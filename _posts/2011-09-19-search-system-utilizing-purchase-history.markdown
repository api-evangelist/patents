{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to internet searching and more particularly to a search system that utilizes a user purchase history as context for a search.","2. Related Art","Conventional search systems for searching the Internet typically involve a user providing search terms to the search system and the search system using those search terms to search a web index for web pages to return to the user as search results. The search system may create the web index using \u201cspider\u201d software programs that fetch a first set of web pages, follow a first set of links on the first set of web pages to fetch a second set of web pages that the first set of links point to, follow a second set of links on the second set of web pages to fetch a third set of web pages that the second set of links point to, and so on, in order to index the web such that the web index may include billions of web pages stored on many different devices. In response to receiving search terms from a user, the search system then searches the web index to find the web pages that includes the search terms, and then narrows those web pages into search results using a number of qualifiers such as, for example, a number of times the search terms are included on the web page, whether the search terms are included in the title of the web page, whether the search terms are included in the universal resource locator (URL) for the web page, whether the web page includes synonyms for the search terms, whether the web page is part of what is deemed a \u2018quality\u2019 website, how many web sites link to that web page, and\/or a variety of other qualifiers known in the art.","Thus, conventional search systems are limited to using the search terms provided by the user in order to determine the web pages that will be returned as search results.","Thus, there is a need for an improved search system.","According to one embodiment, a method for providing a purchase history context search includes receiving a search term from a user, accessing a purchase history of the user, and using the search term and purchase history to determine a plurality of search results.","In an embodiment, the purchase history may be accessed from different databases. The method may weigh more recent purchases in the purchase history higher than less recent purchases when determining the search results, and the search results may be ranked using the purchase history. In one example, the search term may be used to determine a superset of search results, and a purchased item in the purchase history may be used to determine a subset of the superset of search results. A plurality of previous searches may be determined for an item that is included in the purchase history, and those previous searches may also be used to determined the search results. In an embodiment, a calendar may be retrieved and used with the search term and the purchase history to determine the search results.","As a result, a user may conduct searches that are tailored, at least in part, to the user's purchase history. This allows a user to provide general search terms and, without any additional action from the user, use those search terms along with purchases that the user has made to determine search results, which provides search results that are relevant to items the user has purchased.","These and other features and advantages of the present disclosure will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures.","Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures, wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.","The present disclosure provides a system and method for providing a purchase history context search. At least one search term is received from a user, and a purchase history for that user is retrieved. A web index is then accessed and the at least one search term and the purchase history are used to determine a plurality of search results that are then provided for display on a display device of the user. The system and method allow a user to search using general search terms and have search results returned that are determined using the purchase history of the user as context such that at least some of the search results are related to the at least one search term and one or more purchased items in the purchase history.","Referring now to , , and , a method  for providing a purchase history context search is illustrated. In the embodiment of the method  described below, an account provider may provide a user with a user account, and the user may use the user account to fund payments for purchases made from payees. In another embodiment, a payment service provider such as, for example, PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, Calif. assists in the making of payments from the user to the payee by transferring funds from the user account to a payee account of the payee. However, these embodiments are meant to be merely exemplary, and one of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of modifications may be made to the system discussed below without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","The method  begins at block  where at least one search term is received from a user.  illustrates an embodiment of a search system  that includes a search device  that is coupled to a network . At least one payment account server  is coupled to both of the network  and at least one purchase history database . At least one web search server  is coupled to both of the network  and at least one web index database . In an embodiment, the at least one payment account server  may be operated by the payment service provider discussed above, the account providers discussed above, and\/or a third party payment history provider, and the purchase history database  may include one or more databases including purchases of the user of the search device . In an embodiment, the at least one web search server  may be operated by one or more search providers, and the web index database  may include one or more databases including a web index that may include billions of indexed web pages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","202","210","300","204","202","300","302","304","300","202","202","202","302","304","202","302","204","210"]},"In an embodiment, the at least one search term received by the at least one web search server  is associated with a user identifier of the user that provided the at least one search term using the search device . For example, a cookie or other identifier on the search device  may be provided along with the at least one search term to the at least one web search server , and that cookie may include the user identifier that identifies or otherwise indicates that the user of the search device  provided the at least one search term. In another embodiment, the user of the search device  may have an account that is associated with the search page , and an account identifier that identifies the user of the search device  is sent along with the at least one search term to the at least one web search server . While a few examples of user identifiers that identify the user that sent the at least one search term to the at least one web search server  have been described, one of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of other user identifiers for identifying the user of the search device  may be used with the method  without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","Referring now to , , and , the method  then proceeds to block  where a purchase history of the user is retrieved. In an embodiment, the user of the search device  may have previously authorized the at least one web search server  to access one or more payment histories associated with one or more payment accounts of the user. For example, the user of the search device  may have provided user authentication information for one or more payment accounts of the user. In another example, the user of the search device  may have provided user authentication information for a payment history aggregator of the payment accounts of the user. In another example, the web search server  may be operated by a payment service provider, an account provider, and\/or another entity that has access to one or more payments accounts of the user. In another embodiment, the user may have provided authorization for the at least one web search server  to access one or more payment histories associated with one or more payments accounts of the user along with the provision of the at least one search term in block  of the method . While a few examples have been provided, one of skill in the art will recognize that the web search server  may be provided authorization to access one or more payments histories of a user in a variety of manners without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["400","208","400","402","402","402","402","402","402","402","402","402","402","402","402","402","402","402","402","402","400","402","204","402","104","100","104"],"i":["a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l, ","m","n","o "]},"At block , the web search server  accesses the at least one payment account server  through the network  and, in an embodiment, may provide user authentication(s) to the payment account server(s)  in order to access the payment history  of the user that provided the at least one search term in block  of the method . Thus, upon providing proper user authentication, the at least one web server  accesses the payment history  of the user in the purchase history database  over the network .","Referring now to , , , and , the method  then proceeds to block  and  where a web index is accessed and the at least one search term and the purchase history are used to determine a plurality of search results. Using the at least one search term received in block  of the method  and the purchase history accessed in block  of the method , the web search server  accesses a web index that is located in the at least one web index database  in order to determine a plurality of search results. In an embodiment, the web index in the at least one web index database  includes a plurality of web pages, an index of the plurality of web pages, information included in the plurality of web pages, links to the plurality of web pages, metadata included with the plurality of web pages, and\/or a plurality of other web index information known in the art.","In an embodiment, the web search server  may use the at least one search term to determine a superset of search results that include web pages that are related to the at least one search term. Each of the web pages in the superset of search results may be related to the at least one search term due to a number of times the at least one search term is included on a web page, whether the at least one search term is included in the title of a web page, whether the at least one search term is included in the universal resource locator (URL) of a web page, whether a web page includes synonyms for the at least one search term, whether a web page is part of what is deemed a \u2018quality\u2019 website, how many web sites link to that web page, and\/or a variety of other search term\/search results relationships known in the art. The superset of search results may then be \u201cfiltered\u201d using the purchased items in the purchase history to provide a subset of the superset of search results that include web pages that are related to one or more purchase items in the purchase history. In another embodiment, the at least one search result and the purchase items in the purchase history may be used together to determine the plurality of search results (i.e., rather than first determining a set of results using the at least one search term and then filtering those results using the purchase items in the purchase history).","In another embodiment, more recent purchased items in the purchases history may be provided more weight in determining the plurality of search results relative to less recent purchased items. For example, using the purchase history illustrated in , the web search server  may give more weight to the purchased items , , , and in determining the plurality of search results relative to the remaining purchased items because the purchased items , , , and were purchased more recently. In an embodiment, the web search server  may provide more weight to purchases made within a month, a week, a number of days, etc. The time period within which a purchase item is provided more weight may be configurable by the user using the search device . Furthermore, different weights may be provided such that, for example, purchases made within 3 days of a search are provided the highest weight, purchases made between 3 days and a week from the search are provided an intermediate weight, purchases made between 1 week and 2 weeks from the search are provided a lowest weight, and purchases older than 2 weeks from the search are provided little or no weight. While a specific weighting system has been described, one of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of weighting systems will fall within the scope of the present disclosure.","In another embodiment, the web search server  may be coupled to a search database (not illustrated) that includes a plurality of previous searches by users. In this embodiment, at block  of the method , the web search server  may access the search database and use a purchased item in the purchase history  to determine a plurality of previous searches that were associated with that purchased item (e.g., searches related to that purchased item that were conducted by users other than the user of the search device  that provided the at least one search term at block  of the method ). The web search server  may then determine whether the plurality of previous searches associated with the purchased item are relevant to the at least one search term provided in block  of the method  in order to determine the plurality of search results. For example, using the purchase history illustrated in , the web search server  may use the purchase item (a purchase for \u201cPrinter Model #AX12560\u201d) to determine that a plurality of previous searches related to the purchase item include searches for software drivers, ink, and particular problems associated with the printer. Then, using the example of the at least one search term of \u201cdrivers\u201d illustrated in , the web search server  may determine that the search results for the previous searches for software drivers are relevant to the at least one search term and should be included in the search results. In another example, using the purchase history illustrated in , the web search server  may use the purchase item (a purchase for \u201cRestaurant\u2014Mexican food\u201d) to determine that a plurality of previous searches related to the purchase item includes searches for recipes, heartburn medication, and directions to the restaurant. For example, if the purchase item was purchased within a few hours (e.g., less than 3 hours) of the provision of the at least one search term and the at least one search term provided in block  of the method  includes the term \u201csick\u201d, the web search server  may determine that the search results for the previous searches for heartburn medication are relevant to the at least one search term and should be included in the search results.","Referring now to , , , , and , the method  then proceeds to block  where a plurality of search results are provided for display. In an embodiment, the web search server  provides the plurality of search results determined in block  of the method  over the network  to the search device  for display device on a display of the search device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 4"],"b":["500","500","502","504","506","506","506","506","506","108","100","402","102","210","202","402","506","506","506","506","506","210","402"],"i":["a","b","c","d","e ","a","b","c","d","e"]},"For example, the web search server  may determine that the purchase item is relevant (due to the description \u201cPrinter Model #AX12560\u201d being related to software drivers), the purchase item is relevant (due to the description \u201cVideo Card Model #987DS\u201d being related to software drivers), the purchase item is relevant (due to the description \u201cGolf\u2014San Antonio, Tex.\u201d being related to driver golf clubs), the purchase item is relevant (due to the description \u201cTaxi\u2014Austin, Tex.\u201d being related to taxi drivers), and the purchase item is relevant (due to the description \u201cAuto shop\u2014car repair\u201d being related to hired drivers). The web search server  may then use the web index in the web index database  to determine the search results , , , , and that are each associated with a web page that was indexed by the web index and that each include a link to an associated web page. The web server  then provides those search results , , , , and on the search results page  for display on the search device , as illustrated in . As can be seen, the search result provides a link to a webpage for software drivers for the Printer Model #AX12560, the search result provides a link to a webpage for software drivers for the Video Card Model #987DS, the search result provides a link to a webpage for golf club drivers, the search result provides a link to a webpage for Austin taxi drivers, and the search result provides a link to a webpage for hired drivers. One of skill in the art will recognize from the description above that the search results , , , , and are particularly relevant to the purchase history  of the user that was accessed in block  of the method .","In another example, the at least one search term may include \u201creturn\u201d, and the web search server  may access the payment history  and determine that the purchase item is relevant (due to the description \u201cPrinter Model #AX12560\u201d), the purchase item is relevant (due to the description \u201cAirline tickets\u2014New York City\u201d), the purchase item is relevant (due to the description \u201cComputer game\u2014MMORPG\u201d), and the purchase item is relevant (due to the description \u201cBook store\u2014Thriller Novel\u201d). The web search server  may then determine search results that include links to web pages that include the return policies for the merchants from whom these purchase items were purchased. While a few examples of search results have been described, one of skill in the art will recognize that the purchase history of a user may be used in combination with search terms in a variety of other ways than those described to produce search results that are relevant to purchases of the user without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","In an embodiment, the search results that are provided for display (e.g., as illustrated in ) may be ranked using the purchase history. For example, the search results , , , , and may have been ranked according to the weights provided to more recent purchased items as described above. Thus, the search result may be provided \u2018first\u2019 (e.g., at the top of the search results page ) relative to the search result because the purchased item that the search result is based upon was purchased more recently than the purchased item that the search result is based upon. Furthermore, the search results , , and may be displayed with their relative positioning because of the purchase dates of their related purchase items, illustrated in .","In another embodiment, additional user-specific information may be used along with the at least one search term and the purchase history in order to determine the plurality of search results. For example, the user may provide the web search server  access to a user calendar that may be stored locally on the search device , remotely on a database that is accessible over the network , and\/or in a variety of other locations known in the art. In response to receiving the at least one search term at block  of the method , the web search server  may access the user calendar as well as the purchase history  of the user at block  of the method . The web search server  may then use calendar items in the user calendar along with purchase items in the purchase history and the at least one search term in order to determine the plurality of search results at block  of the method . For example, using the at least one search term \u201cdrivers\u201d (illustrated in ), the purchase item including the \u201cAirline tickets\u2014New York City\u201d, and a calendar item that indicates that the user is traveling to New York City the coming weekend, the web search server  may determine that a web page that includes information about hired drivers in New York City should be provided to the user for display as one of the plurality of search results.","In another embodiment, the use of user-specific information such as a calendar may include the web search server  accessing a user calendar that indicates that the user went on vacation during a particular time period in the past year (or multiple years). The web search server  may then access the purchase history of the user to determine how much the user spent during that vacation on a hotel, plane tickets, entertainment, and\/or a variety of other vacation related payments known in the art. Then, for example, in response to at least one search term that includes \u201cvacation\u201d, the web search server may then search the web index in the web index database  to determine a plurality of search results for vacations that include similar destinations to those that were included in the user calendar and\/or the purchase history, along with hotel deals, plane tickets, entertainment, and\/or other vacation purchases that are in the same or similar price ranges as those purchased by the user in prior vacations.","While a specific example of a vacation has been described, one of skill in the art will recognize how other elements of a user calendar and\/or other user-specific information may be used to provide context for a search without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example, if the user is using a mobile user device that includes a location determination component (e.g., a Global Positioning System (GPS), a cell tower triangulation system, and\/or a variety of other location determination systems known in the art), the current location of the user may be retrieved and used with the purchase history to further refine the search. For example, a search for \u201crestaurants\u201d may reference the current location of the user along with restaurant payment items in the purchase history and return restaurants that are in the current location of the user and that are the same or similar (e.g., \u201cMexican restaurants\u201d) to restaurant payment items in the purchase history.","Thus, a system and method for providing a purchase history context search has been described that includes a user providing a web search provider access to the purchase history of the user. In some embodiments, the user may provide the web search provider with access to other user-specific information (e.g., a calendar). The web search provider may then access the purchase history and\/or other user specific information in response to receiving at least one search term in order to provide context for the search. Such context allows the web search provider to provide for display a plurality of search results that are relevant to purchases or other user-specific events without the need for the user to do anything other than provide access to that information.","Referring now to , an embodiment of a search results page  is illustrated that may replace the search results page  described above with reference to . The search results page  includes a search term input , a search submit button , a standard search results section  that is determined using conventional methods know in the art, and a purchase history search results section  including a plurality of search results determined according to the method  as described above. Thus, the web search server  is operable to provide search results using standard methods as well as using the purchase history of the user (and\/or other user-specific information), and those search results may be displayed separately such that a user may direct their attention to the standard search results section  when the at least one search term provided in block  of the method  is not related to a purchase, while directing attention to the purchase history search results section  when the at least one search term is related to a purchase.","Referring now to , an embodiment of a search page  is illustrated that may replace the search page , illustrated above with reference to . The search page  includes a search term input  and a search submit button . Upon being presented with the search page  on the search device , the user of the search device  may use an input device (e.g., a mouse, a keyboard, and\/or a variety of other input devices known in the art) connected to the search device  to provide at least one search term (e.g., \u201cdrivers\u201d in the illustrated embodiment) that is modified by a search term specifier (e.g., \u201cpurchase:\u201d in the illustrated embodiment) in the search term input . The search term specifier may be used to indicate to the web search server  that the purchase history of the user should be used as context for the search conducted using the at least one search term \u201cdrivers\u201d. Upon selecting the search submit button , the search device  sends the at least one search term and the search term specifier provided in the search term input  over the network , and the at least one search term is received by the at least one web search server . The web search server  may then operate substantially as described above according to the method .","Referring now to , an embodiment of a search page  is illustrated that may replace the search page , illustrated above with reference to .
