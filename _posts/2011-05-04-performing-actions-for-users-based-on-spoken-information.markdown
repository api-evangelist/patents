title: Performing actions for users based on spoken information
abstract: Techniques are described for performing actions for users based at least in part on spoken information, such as spoken voice-based information received from the users during telephone calls. The described techniques include categorizing spoken information obtained from a user in one or more ways, and performing actions on behalf of the user related to the categorized information. For example, in some situations, spoken information obtained from a user is analyzed to identify one or more spoken information items (e.g., words, phrases, sentences, etc.) supplied by the user, and to generate corresponding textual representations (e.g., via automated speech-to-text techniques). One or more actions may then be taken regarding the identified information items, including to categorize the items by adding textual representations of the spoken information items to one or more of multiple predefined lists or other collections of information that are specific to or otherwise available to the user.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/940,229, filed on Nov. 14, 2007, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,254,535, entitled \u201cPerforming Actions For Users Based On Spoken Information,\u201d which in turn claims the benefit of provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60\/859,052, filed Nov. 14, 2006 and entitled \u201cCategorization And Corresponding Actions On Voice Messages, System And Method;\u201d and of provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60\/859,049, filed Nov. 14, 2006 and entitled \u201cVoice Driven Presence For IM Networks And Multimodal Communications Across Messaging Networks,\u201d each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The following disclosure relates generally to techniques for performing actions for users based on spoken information, such as to automatically categorize spoken information items provided by a user of a voice-based messaging system according to multiple available collections of information for the user, and to perform one or more types of actions for the categorized information items for the collections of information.","While people are increasingly using data retrieval capabilities of computing devices to access information of a variety of types, voice-based functionality of telephones continues to be commonly used for a variety of purposes, including to obtain information of various types. For example, telephones are frequently used to obtain address and telephone number information for designated individuals or businesses, such as via automated and\/or manual directory assistance services. In addition, enhanced directory assistance services exist to provide a variety of types of additional information to telephone users, such as movie listings, weather reports, sports scores, traffic reports, etc. Moreover, some businesses may provide automated telephone systems to provide various information to customers and\/or partners about their businesses, such as via Interactive Voice Response (\u201cIVR\u201d) systems. Other types of systems may similarly provide a variety of other types of functionality to voice-based telephone users, such as voice message recording and\/or forwarding services (e.g., to record a voice message to later be provided to one or more designated recipients), transcription services (e.g., to record voice-based information that will later be manually and\/or automatically converted into text), etc. While various services and systems thus exist for telephone users to obtain some types of voice-based information, it is nonetheless often difficult for telephone users to obtain a variety of other types of functionality.","In addition, it is often difficult for companies and other entities to effectively provide promotional and other types of information to others and\/or to provide information to others about products and\/or services that are available. For example, while a variety of types Of advertising models are known (e.g., via traditional print media; radio; television; billboards; Internet-based banner ads and sponsored links and pop-up ads; location-based services, such as via data services of mobile devices; etc.), all suffer from various known problems, including difficulties in providing information to users that is currently of interest and in a form and\/or manner that is desired.","Various embodiments of the invention will now be described. The following description provides specific details for a thorough understanding and an enabling description of these embodiments. One skilled in the art will understand, however, that the invention may be practiced without many of these details. Additionally, some well-known structures or functions may not be shown or described in detail, so as to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the relevant description of the various embodiments. The terminology used in the description presented below is intended to be interpreted in its broadest reasonable manner, even though it is being used in conjunction with a detailed description of certain specific embodiments of the invention.","Techniques are described for performing actions for users based at least in part on spoken information, such as spoken voice-based information received from the users during telephone calls. In at least some embodiments, the described techniques include categorizing spoken information obtained from a user in one or more ways, and performing actions on behalf of the user related to the categorized information. For example, in at least some embodiments, spoken information obtained from a user is analyzed to identify one or more spoken information items (e.g., words, phrases, sentences, etc.) supplied by the user, and in at least some situations to further generate textual representations of the identified information items (e.g., based on use of automated speech-to-text techniques). One or more actions may then be taken regarding the identified information items, such as to add textual representations of the identified information items to one or more of multiple predefined lists or other collections of information that are specific to or otherwise available to the user (e.g., based on an indication of that information collection supplied by the user as part of the spoken information that includes the identified information items), to use textual representations of the identified information items to generate other information (e.g., to perform a search based on the textual representations), to provide to the user various types of automatically determined information based on the information items, etc. Additional details are included below related to performing actions for users based at least in part on spoken information. In addition, in at least some embodiments, a Voice Message Activity (\u201cVMA\u201d) system automatically performs some or all of the described techniques, such as by providing a VMA service to remote users, as described in greater detail below.","In at least some embodiments, the VMA system allows numerous remote users to each maintain one or more lists, groups, or other collections of information at the VMA system, such that a user may place a telephone call to the VMA system to supply one or more spoken information items to be added to a particular list or other information collection. Such lists or other information collections may have various forms in various embodiments, as discussed in greater detail below, such as, for example, a shopping list, a reminder list related to a particular topic, a wish list of desired items, etc. Thus, as one specific example, a user may supply a voice message during a telephone call that includes a spoken indication of \u201cshopping list\u201d and of one or more information items (e.g., \u201cmilk\u201d, \u201ca dozen eggs\u201d, etc.) to be added to that user's shopping list, such that a stored copy of a shopping list for that user will be updated to include textual representations of \u201cmilk\u201d and \u201ca dozen eggs\u201d (e.g., in addition to information items added to the shopping list during one or more prior telephone calls). In at least some embodiments, the VMA system may provide one or more predefined types of lists or other information collections for selection by users, such that each user may create and maintain a separate copy of a particular type of information collection (e.g., a separate shopping list), although in other embodiments at least some types of information collections may be configured to be shared between multiple users. Furthermore, in at least some embodiments, the VMA system may allow at least some users to define one or more new information collections specific to that user (e.g., for user Bob to define an information collection of Bob's list of interesting facts to tell Betty). A user may gain access to information stored in one or more information collections by the VMA system (e.g., in a database) and\/or to functionality from the VMA system related to stored information for one or more such information collections in various ways in various embodiments, as discussed in greater detail below.","As previously noted, spoken information may be obtained from users in various ways in various embodiments. For example, a user may place a telephone call to an IVR system or other automated voice-based system, such as via one or more of the following: a cell phone; a landline phone; a satellite phone; a phone that uses one or more computer networks at least in part, such as for a Voice Over IP (\u201cVOIP\u201d) call; a phone whose connection uses a URL (\u201cUniform Resource Locator\u201d) or other URI (\u201cUniform Resource Identifier\u201d), such as based on an SIP (\u201cSession Initiation Protocol\u201d) URI \u201cphone number\u201d (e.g., sip:<username>\u00a9<host>:port, where <username> is replaced by an actual username and <host> is replaced by a domain name or IP address, such as john.smith\u00a9212.111.1.111 or support@abcdefgh.com), as described in greater detail in the RFC 3261 standard); etc., such as to provide spoken information that includes instructions and\/or other information related to one or more actions to be taken. Once spoken information is obtained from a user, it may then be analyzed in various ways in various embodiments, including in an automated manner and\/or based at least in part by one or more human operators of the VMA system. For example, when a user includes one or more spoken information items, the VMA system may analyze the spoken information in order to categorize that information, such as to determine a list or other information collection on which the information items are to be included (e.g., based on a spoken indication of the information collection, or instead in another manner), or instead to determine one or more other types of actions to take for those spoken information items. In some embodiments, the Spoken information from a user is analyzed in a real time or substantially real time manner during a telephone call with the user, such as to allow appropriate-responses to be provided to the user during the telephone call. In other embodiments, the analysis of spoken information may occur after a telephone call from a user is completed (e.g., by analyzing a voice message left by the user), such as if results or other corresponding information and\/or functionality are provided to the user at a later time.","Various types of actions may be performed for users based on spoken information received from the user, and may be determined in various ways in various embodiments. For example, one or more actions to take regarding one or more spoken information items supplied by a user may be determined in at least some embodiments based at least in part on one or more of the following: spoken instructions or other information that is supplied by a user along with the spoken information items (e.g., supplied as part of the spoken information provided by the user during a telephone call); previously supplied instructions or other information (whether spoken or supplied in another manner); later-supplied instructions or other information whether spoken or supplied in another manner); a manner of supplying the information items (e.g., based on a particular telephone number that is called to provide the spoken information); a type of the information items (e.g., to automatically determine to add items corresponding to food to a user's shopping list rather than a list of to-do items to later be performed); etc. As one specific example, if a user provides spoken information that indicates a particular list or other information collection and one or more information items, the actions to be taken may include adding textual representations (and\/or other representations, such as audio representations) of those information items to that information collection. A non-exclusive list of other types of actions may include, for example, one or more of the following: performing a search based on one or more information items (e.g., by using one or more of the information items as keywords for the search and\/or by using one or more of the information items to indicate a particular search engine to use or other manner of performing the search); sending indicated information to an indicated recipient; adding information to an information collection that is available to multiple users (e.g., a bulletin board); etc. Furthermore, in at least some embodiments, spoken information from a user may indicate various other types of actions to take related to maintenance of particular lists or other information collections, such as to create or delete particular information collections, to remove or otherwise modify information items that are already present in one or more information collections, etc.","In addition, in some embodiments, one or more actions to take regarding one or more information items supplied by a user may include providing information to the user about those items. For example, in at least some embodiments, an action for one or more supplied information items and\/or for the information items that are currently part of an indicated information collection may include providing information about those information items to the user and\/or another recipient. In particular, after one or more spoken information items are supplied by a user and added to a collection, textual representations of those information items may be made available to the user (e.g., in response to a request from the user, by automatically sending one or more electronic messages to the user whose contents include those textual representations, etc.). In other situations, information that is provided to a user may be otherwise based on one or more supplied information items, such as to provide search results that are generated based on using one or more supplied information items. Information may be provided to a user in various ways, such as via one or more electronic messages sent to the user (e.g., via one or more emails, instant messages, paging messages, SMS or other text messages, etc., such as based on previously specified electronic address information for a user who registered with the VMA system), via a response to an interactive query from the user (e.g., as part of one or more Web pages requested by the user when interacting with the VMA system, such as a request for the contents of one or more information collections of the user), and\/or via a spoken voice-based response (e.g., immediately, such as during a telephone call with the user and in response to a spoken request or other spoken information from the user). Furthermore, in at least some embodiments, a user may be able to access and modify stored information in one or more information collections from prior spoken information in one or more manners, including interactively by a remote user of a computing device or system that interacts with the VMA system, programmatically via an API of the VMA system, via a telephone-based interface (e.g., via spoken commands or other instructions), etc.","In addition, in some embodiments, one or more actions to take regarding one or more information items supplied by a user may include actions related to a communication system (e.g., an instant messaging network system provided by the VMA system or a third-party system). For example, based on spoken information provided by a user, the VMA system may perform actions such as signing the user into an instant messenger network, and setting presence of the user on the instant messenger network (e.g., indicating that the user is online and\/or in a particular location or performing a particular activity), as well as optionally performing other operations related to instant messaging based on spoken information provided by a user. As one specific example, a user may provide a voice message during a telephone call to the VMA system that includes an indication that the user wants to sign into an instant messenger system (e.g., by saying \u201cLog in to IM\u201d), and the VMA system will log the user into an instant messenger system. Other types of actions by the VMA system may include logging a user off (e.g., by saying \u201cLog off IM\u201d), setting status of a user (e.g., by saying \u201cSet status to . . . \u201d), providing contents of one or more IM communications to the user (e.g., by using text-to-speech to automatically convert contents of an IM communication to spoken form, and reciting the spoken contents to the user during a telephone call), sending one or more IM communications to one or more indicated recipients (e.g., by using speech-to-text to automatically convert spoken information items from the user during a telephone call to be textual contents of an IM communication and\/or to be, indications of particular recipients, and sending the textual contents to the recipients in one or more IM communications), etc. Additional details related to actions concerning receiving and\/or providing communications to others, and\/or to other interactions with one or more external messaging networks or other communication systems, are included in provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60\/859,049, filed Nov. 14, 2006 and entitled \u201cVoice Driven Presence For IM Networks And Multimodal Communications Across Messaging Networks,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Furthermore, in at least some embodiments, third-parties may obtain various types of information from the VMA system and\/or provide various information to users via the VMA system, such as advertisements or other promotional materials (e.g., coupons, discount or promotional codes, samples, etc.) from businesses and other entities (e.g., providers of products, such as manufacturers, distributors, retailers, etc.). For example, if a user has a shopping list or a wish list of desired items, retailers may in some embodiments be able to obtain information about at least some information items on at least some such lists, and to provide related information to the user (e.g., an offer to supply a particular item at a particular price, promotional information specific to the item, information-n about other related items, etc.). In particular, in some embodiments, the VMA system may provide an API (\u201capplication programming interface\u201d) to allow such third-party entities to obtain and\/or provide such information, such as via one or more Web services provided by the VMA system. Entities who wish to obtain information from and\/or provide information to users may further be charged various fees in various situations, such as a flat fee, or a fee for each time that information is obtained from and\/or provided to a user (e.g., by allowing an entity to bid on or otherwise specify a price for a target expression, which the entity then pays each time that the information is provided to a user who uses the target expression).","In some embodiments, the VMA system may operate in conjunction with one or more affiliated systems that provide one or more other types of voice-based functionality to users (e.g., with third-party systems in exchange for a fee), while in other embodiments the VMA system may itself provide one or more other, types of voice-based functionality to users. A non-exclusive list of other types of voice-based functionality that may be provided in at least some embodiments to users, such as via a telephone call initiated by a user, include the following: the ability to create voice memos or other messages intended for the user and\/or one or more other recipients; directory services; the ability to use a phone call to check for coupons and\/or in response to advertising in broadcast and\/or user-directed media (e.g., radio, television, newspapers, magazines, billboards, online information, etc., whether local or regional\/national), etc. In some embodiments, the voice-based functionality may be available only to users who have a predefined relationship with the VMA system and\/or an affiliated system, such as registered subscriber or member users who have created an account and provided one or more of various types of information about themselves (e.g., a user name; an actual name; a password; electronic message address information for the user, such as an email address, instant message address, fax number, paging number, and\/or telephone number for SMS or other text messages; other contact information; demographic information; information about one or more user phone numbers from which the user will contact the VMA system and\/or affiliated system; etc.), as well as in some embodiments paying a fee. In other embodiments, the voice-based functionality may be available to all users. In addition, the VMA system and\/or affiliated system may provide one or more telephone numbers that users may call to receive the voice-based functionality, such as toll-free numbers that provide information to the VMA system and\/or affiliated system about a calling user's telephone number and\/or other caller ID information.","Furthermore, in at least some embodiments, one or more types of information collections may be maintained by one or more third-party systems, but modified or otherwise accessed by the VMA system on behalf of users who provide spoken information to the VMA system. For example, a third-party system may provide a bulletin board system that has one or more bulletin boards that are each accessible to multiple users (e.g., to a specified group of users of the third-party system, to any user of the third-party system, etc.), and one or more of the bulletin boards may be an information collection for each of one or more of the users of the VMA system that are also users of the third-party system. In such situations, a user may provide spoken information to the VMA system during a telephone call or in another manner, and the VMA system may take one or more corresponding actions that include performing a post to a particular such third-party bulletin board on behalf of the user (e.g., to post a textual representation of one or more information items in the spoken information)\u2014in such situations, the VMA system may take various actions on behalf of the user, such as to identify the user to the third-party bulletin board system (e.g., providing a username of the user for the third-party bulletin board system and\/or access information such as a password, such as based on information provided by the user during the telephone call or previously in other interactions with the VMA system). Third-party information collections may have other forms in other embodiments, including any Web page or other electronically accessible location in which users are allowed to post comments or otherwise provide information.","The use of the described techniques provides various benefits to users on whose behalf actions are performed based on spoken information, and to entities that obtain information from users and\/or make information available to be provided to the users via the VMA system. Non-exclusive examples of some such benefits in at least some embodiments include the following: the ability of users to quickly add information to defined information collections via spoken information provided during telephone calls; the ability of users to access information specified for a defined information collection, such as in a different form than provided (e.g., to obtain a textual representation of information items provided via spoken information) and\/or at a different time (e.g., to later obtain indications of spoken information items via email messages or requested Web pages); and the ability of advertisers, marketers, businesses and other entities to target particular information to particular information recipients.","For illustrative purposes, some embodiments are described below in which particular types of information is obtained from users in particular ways (e.g., by obtaining spoken information from users via voice messages supplied by the users during telephone calls) to provide particular types of services and functionality to the users (e.g., to categorize the spoken information, such as to add to an indicated list or other information collection). These examples are provided for illustrative purposes and are simplified for the sake of brevity, and the inventive techniques can be used in a wide variety of other situations, some of which are discussed below. For example, in some embodiments, voice-based information may be obtained from users in other manners than via an automated voice system that the users contact, such as by human operators that received the voice-based information from users and\/or in situations in which users are contacted via telephone. In addition, in some embodiments, information that is obtained from a user may be in a form other than voice-based information, such as text-based information, computer-generated audio information, video information, etc., and may similarly be categorized or otherwise analyzed by the VMA system so as to determine one or more actions to perform.","In at least some of the example scenarios described below, voice-based spoken information is obtained from a user, such as from a voice message recorded by a caller user who contacts a VMA system from a mobile phone (e.g., over the mobile network and\/or over VoIP), a landline phone, or a desktop\/laptop on the Internet. In these example' scenarios, spoken information may be categorized using various techniques, including explicit and\/or implicit techniques in varying embodiments, so as to determine actions to take for the spoken information. For example, explicit techniques for categorizing spoken information may include providing specific keywords associated with different categories of services and\/or functionality that may be spoken by caller users (e.g., such as at the beginning or end of a voice message); providing different telephone numbers associated with different types of services and\/or functionality that caller users may call to obtain the associated services and\/or functionality; etc. Examples of implicit categorization techniques may include analyzing spoken information to determine an appropriate category based at least in part on the contents of the spoken information, such as by using natural language processing, machine learning techniques, human intelligence, etc.","In addition, various types of actions may be performed on behalf of a caller user based at least in part on the categorized spoken information. For example, actions performed on behalf of a caller user may include one or more of the following: transcribing spoken information and adding at least some of the transcribed information to one or more types of lists (e.g., a grocery list or other shopping list, a wish list, etc) associated with the caller user and\/or with one or more other users, so as to allow the contents of the list to be accessed at a later time (e.g., via a Web-based interface); performing a purchase of one or more indicated products and\/or services for a caller user; obtaining price information for one or more indicated products and\/or services, such as from an indicated retailer and\/or from one or more partner or affiliated users for the VMA system; performing an Internet search for indicated information and providing results to the caller user; transcribing spoken information and publishing at least some of the transcribed information on a Mblog (\u201cblog\u201d) or electronic bulletin board system (\u201cBBS\u201d); transcribing spoken information and making the transcribed information available to the caller user in one or more other formats (e.g., in textual form via email, SMS, instant message, etc.); providing access to a communication service (e.g., an instant messaging network), etc.","In addition, in some embodiments, other actions may be performed on behalf of users in conjunction with one or more affiliated partners of the VMA system provider (e.g., third-party vendors, etc.), such as to enhance commerce opportunities for the affiliated partners and\/or to provide additional benefits to users. For example, the VMA system may obtain, on behalf of users, price bids for products and\/or services offered by various partners, such as by providing information related to categorized information obtained from users to the various partners, and obtaining bids from the various partners for products and\/or services provided by those partners that may be related to the information. In some embodiments, user information may be shared with affiliated partners, such as, for example, to allow a user's wish list to be transferred to or otherwise manifested on one or more partner sites (e.g., if the user opts into such a manifestation). In addition, in some embodiments, actions may be performed in conjunction with affiliated partners in a manner that protects the identities of users, such as by withholding users' identities from the various partners (e.g., to maintain user anonymity). For example, anonymous information included in a user's wish list may be provided to non-affiliated partners to obtain bids on product and\/or services.","In the example scenario illustrated in , a caller user places a call to an example embodiment of the VMA system that provides a VMA service for use by remote users. In this example, the caller user is a registered VMA system user whose phone number and email address are previously specified to the VMA system, such that the user may be automatically identified by the VMA system (e.g., via use of caller ID or related information that is available about the caller user, via login or other related information explicitly provided by the user, etc.). The caller user dials a general access phone number provided by the VMA system and delivers a voice message by saying a keyword associated with a category of services and\/or functionality provided by the system, and then speaking one or more information items (e.g., instructions, content, etc.) associated with that keyword. The VMA system recognizes the keyword and associates the voice message with the appropriate category of services and\/or functionality, and performs one or more associated actions using the voice message. In some of the examples provided below, the keyword is associated with a particular list, such that the associated action includes adding information from the voice message to a list and optionally initiating other actions related to the performance of the action (e.g., purchasing goods on behalf of a caller user, etc.).","In particular, in the example scenario of , the registered caller user calls a general number provided by the VMA system. After hearing a welcome prompt, the caller user delivers a voice message that includes saying \u201cWish List\u201d followed by \u201cLawn Mower,\u201d and then hangs up after hearing a confirmation. The VMA system records the voice message, adds an indication of the \u201cLawn Mower\u201d information item (e.g., a textual representation of the item) to the caller user's wish list for later access by the user, and also in this example obtains bids from affiliated VMA Partner Service # (e.g., an online retailer) and affiliated VMA Partner Service # (e.g., an online auction site) for lawn mowers to provide to the user in various ways. The VMA system may then optionally send an SMS message to the caller user's mobile phone (e.g., to the number from which the caller user dialed, or a number known to the VMA system to be an SMS number for the caller user) with some or all of the information (e.g., the best price) obtained from the affiliated partners. The caller user may later access the wish list provided by the VMA system (e.g., via a Web site or other Web-based interface provided by the VMA system) and interact with the wish list in various ways (e.g., view, modify, etc.), including the added indication from the voice message and\/or any offers or other information obtained from affiliated partner sites.","Some examples of keywords used by, associated information items stored by, and actions that may be taken by an example embodiment of the VMA system are as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},"Associated",{}]},{"entry":["No.","Keyword","Information","Action(s) Taken"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","Groceries","\u201cMilk, Butter, Eggs\u201d","Add associated information to a"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"grocery list maintained by a local"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"grocery store.

When executed, the instructions cause the voicemail computer system to analyze a recorded voicemail or other type of message for one or more possible action items for follow up by the calling party, the called party(ies) or both.","In one embodiment, the voicemail computer system  uses voice transcription software to transcribe an audio voicemail message into a corresponding textual message. Artificial intelligence, pattern matching techniques or other heuristics can then be used to analyze the textual message for possible action items. In another embodiment, the voicemail computer system  can be programmed to analyze audio messages for possible action items without converting the audio messages to text.","In one embodiment, the voicemail computer system  can be programmed to recognize key words such as \u201creservation\u201d, \u201cmeeting\u201d or similar words to indicate that a person may want to put a reminder on their calendar or to send out a meeting request that includes the calling party and the called party as invitees. As another example, if the voicemail computer system  finds the word \u201cgift\u201d in a message, the computer system can search the remainder of the message for contextual information about what a gift might be and to place it on a shopping list. The detection of words like \u201cbirthday,\u201d \u201canniversary\u201d or the like causes the voicemail computer system  to suggest placing a reoccurring date on a calendar.","In some cases, the same word detected in a message may be associated with more than one possible action item. In one embodiment, heuristics or other rules are used to process actions items according to a priority scheme. For example, the word \u201cchampagne\u201d may be relatively unique in a voicemail message. Therefore, the action item for this word (e.g. adding champagne to a shopping list) may be processed before other possible action items.","Upon the detection of one or more possible action items, the voicemail computer system  suggests one or more action items to a computer system  that is associated with the calling party. In one embodiment, the computer system  can be a device that is separate from the telephone used to record the voicemail message. In another embodiment, the computer system  is part of a smart telephone (e.g. integrated with the telephone of the calling party ).","In one embodiment, the voicemail computer system  keeps a database of information associated with a number of calling parties. Calling parties can provide the information when they register for voicemail services or during a set up procedure or via some other mechanism. Alternatively, the information can be provided from a remote source. The information can include the user's name and, their telephone number as well as an identifier of a computer associated with the calling party. The identifier may be an email address, IP address, serial number, MAC address or other identifier that uniquely identifies the computer of the calling party. If the computer is integrated in the calling party's phone, the identifier may be the phone number or other identifier that is uniquely associated with the calling party's telephone. The database may also store such information for the called parties if known.","In one embodiment, the database stores preference information for the calling party. Such preference information can include an indication of whether the calling party wants to receive a notice of possible action items that are detected in voicemail or other messages left by the calling party.","If the calling party does want to receive notice of possible action items, the voicemail computer system  sends a message to one or more programs operating on the computer associated with the calling party. In one embodiment, the messages are directed to the API's of these programs and cause the programs to perform a variety of tasks such as creating possible dates to add to calendars, generating meeting requests, inviting others to a meeting, adding items to shopping lists, adding persons to contacts lists or updating contact information, storing bookmarks to web pages etc. The particular tasks will depend on the content of the voicemail or other message left by the calling party and the associated action items that can be determined from such content. In another embodiment, the voicemail computer system  provides calendar, shopping list, contact list and other functions for the calling party so that a task can be generated from a detected action item all within the same computer program.","The calling party interacts with the programs on their computer to accept or reject each of the proposed action items. Alternatively, depending on the settings of the user's computer, such action items may automatically be accepted.","In yet another embodiment, the voicemail computer system leaves an indication for the called party that they have a message waiting for them. The called party can interact with the voicemail computer system  to instruct it to analyze voicemail messages for possible action items. Alternatively, the called party may set preference information that is stored within the voicemail computer system to automatically analyze stored messages for possible action items. For example, the voicemail computer system  can cause a computer to generate a meeting request that includes the called party as an invitee.","Depending on user preferences, the voicemail computer system may interact with advertisers or merchants with a message regarding a detected action item. For example, the voicemail computer system may send a message to a wine merchant  indicating that the calling party may be interested in purchasing a good bottle of champagne. The merchant  may pay the operator of the voicemail service a referral fee and send a message or coupon to the calling or called party. In one embodiment, such messaging can be allowed or restricted by the calling or called party depending on their privacy concerns or based on the privacy policy of the provider of the voicemail services.","From the foregoing it will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not limited by the exemplary details. In addition, while certain aspects of the invention may be now or later presented in certain claim forms, the inventors contemplate the various aspects of the invention in any available claim form. For example, while only some aspects of the invention may be initially recited as being embodied in a computer-readable medium, other aspects may likewise be so embodied."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIGS. 1-4"},"FIGS.  and A-B are block diagrams illustrating examples of computing systems suitable for performing actions for users based on spoken information in at least some embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 9"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
