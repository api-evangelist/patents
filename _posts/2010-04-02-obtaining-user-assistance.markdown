Computing technology has moved beyond the personal computer and into everyday items and devices, providing embedded technology and connectivity. Almost any thing or item, from buildings to clothing, from telephones to tools, from appliances to cars, from homes to the human body, from personal information devices to a common a coffee mug, may have an embedded electronic device that includes a computing device. The embedded electronic device typically improves performance and capacity of a basic functionality of the item, and may connect the item with a network of other items or the Internet. These items with embedded electronic devices may be described using a variety of names, which may not have a bright line distinction between them. Commonly used names include a limited resource-computing device, limited capacity computing device, ubiquitous computing device, pervasive computing device, digital appliance, and Internet appliance. Additionally, rapid advances have been made in interconnectability and interoperability of computing devices and other devices at a consumer level, such as handheld devices and cell phones, and at system and a large system level. These advances are intended to provide a user with many benefits.","Realization of these benefits may require that a user read and re-read manuals for their items. However, a user may experience difficulty obtaining, maintaining, updating, and simply keeping track of all the manuals for the items present and\/or used in and around their premises, such as their home and\/or business premises. Additionally, manuals are sometimes lost, misplaced, or unavailable. A user may benefit from a method, system, and computer program product that automatically identifies and obtains manuals for items having a presence within a user's geographic locale, such as their home and or\/business.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","120","130","121","120","121"]},"The computing system environment  typically includes a variety of computer-readable media products. Computer-readable media may include any media that can be accessed by the computing device  and include both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not of limitation, computer-readable media may include computer storage media and communications media. Computer storage media includes both volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data. Computer storage media include, but are not limited to, random-access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), flash memory, or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD), or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage, or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by the computing device . Communications media typically embody computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and include any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communications media include wired media such as a wired network and a direct-wired connection and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, optical, and infrared media. Combinations of the any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of volatile and nonvolatile memory such as ROM  and RAM . A basic input\/output system (BIOS) , containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the computing device , such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM .

A user may enter commands and information into the computing device  through input devices such as a microphone , keyboard , and pointing device , commonly referred to as a mouse, trackball, or touch pad. Other input devices (not shown) may include a joystick, game pad, satellite dish, and scanner. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port, or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video interface . In addition to the monitor, computers may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers  and printer , which may be connected through an output peripheral interface .","The computing system environment  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device, or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the computing device , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) , but may also include other networks such as a personal area network (PAN) (not shown). Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets, and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the computing system environment  is connected to the LAN  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, the computing device  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the WAN , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, may be connected to the system bus  via the user input interface , or via another appropriate mechanism.

distinction left between hardware and software implementations of aspects of systems; the use of hardware or software is generally (but not always, in that in certain contexts the choice between hardware and software can become significant) a design choice representing cost vs. efficiency tradeoffs. Those having skill in the art will appreciate that there are various vehicles by which processes and\/or systems and\/or other technologies described herein can be effected (e.g., hardware, software, and\/or firmware), and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the processes and\/or systems and\/or other technologies are deployed. For example, if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly hardware and\/or firmware vehicle; alternatively, if flexibility is paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation; or, yet again alternatively, the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware, software, and\/or firmware. Hence, there are several possible vehicles by which the processes and\/or devices and\/or other technologies described herein may be effected, none of which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific concerns (e.g., speed, flexibility, or predictability) of the implementer, any of which may vary. Those skilled in the art will recognize that optical aspects of implementations will require optically-oriented hardware, software, and or firmware.","The foregoing detailed description has set forth various embodiments of the devices and\/or processes via the use of block diagrams, flow diagrams, operation diagrams, flowcharts, illustrations, and\/or examples. Insofar as such block diagrams, operation diagrams, flowcharts, illustrations, and\/or examples contain one or more functions and\/or operations, it will be understood by those within the art that each function and\/or operation within such block diagrams, operation diagrams, flowcharts, illustrations, or examples can be implemented, individually and\/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, or virtually any combination thereof. In one embodiment, several portions of the subject matter described herein may be implemented via Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), digital signal processors (DSPs), or other integrated formats. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that some aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein, in whole or in part, can be equivalently implemented in standard integrated circuits, as one or more computer programs running on one or more computers (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more computer systems), as one or more programs running on one or more processors (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more microprocessors), as firmware, or as virtually any combination thereof, and that designing the circuitry and\/or writing the code for the software and or firmware would be well within the skill of one of skill in the art in light of this disclosure. In addition, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanisms of the subject matter described herein are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, and that an illustrative embodiment of the subject matter described herein applies equally regardless of the particular type of signal bearing media used to actually carry out the distribution. Examples of a signal bearing media include, but are not limited to, the following: recordable type media such as floppy disks, hard disk drives, CD ROMs, digital tape, and computer memory; and transmission type media such as digital and analog communication links using TDM or IP based communication links (e.g., packet links).","While particular aspects of the present subject matter described herein have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, based upon the teachings herein, changes and modifications may be made without departing from this subject matter described herein and its broader aspects and, therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as are within the true spirit and scope of this subject matter described herein. Furthermore, it is to be understood that the invention is solely defined by the appended claims. It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as \u201copen\u201d terms (e.g., the term \u201cincluding\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d the term \u201chaving\u201d should be interpreted as \u201chaving at least,\u201d the term \u201cincludes\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincludes but is not limited to,\u201d etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases \u201cat least one\u201d and \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim ncludes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca\u201d and\/or \u201can\u201d should typically be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201ctwo recitations,\u201d without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, and C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, and C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, or C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, or C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.).","The herein described aspects depict different components contained within, or connected with, different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary, and that in fact many other architectures can be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively \u201cassociated\u201d such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as \u201cassociated with\u201d each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise, any two components so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably connected,\u201d or \u201coperably coupled,\u201d to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably couplable\u201d to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and\/or physically interacting components and\/or wirelessly interactable and\/or wirelessly interacting components."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIGS. 3 and 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIGS. 13A-13D","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIG. 22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 25","FIG. 22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 26","FIG. 22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 31","FIG. 30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 32","FIG. 30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 33","FIG. 30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 34"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 35"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 36"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 37"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 38","FIG. 37"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 39","FIG. 37"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 40"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 41"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 42"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 43"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 44","FIG. 43"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 45","FIG. 43"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 46","FIG. 43"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":["FIG. 47","FIG. 43"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 48"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 49"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 50"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 51"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
