{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","Problems to be Solved by the Invention","Disclosure of the Invention","EFFECT OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF REFERENCE NUMERALS","BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention relates to an image processing device, including an image input unit and an image processing unit which processes an input image data to generate an output image data (or image data being outputted to a printer or an external device), such as a printer, a facsimile, and a multi-function peripheral having multiple functions including copier, printer, scanner and facsimile functions, which are connectable to a network. More particularly, this invention relates to an image processing device which is provided to have a power saving mode in which the image processing device is set in a power-saving state.","A MFP (multi-function peripheral) which has multiple functions including copier, printer, scanner and facsimile functions is widely used as an image processing device which performs image processing to process an input image data into an output image data. The MFP is connected to a network, receives input image data of paper documents through the scanner of the MFP, and receives other image data (document) from an external device via the communication I\/F (interface) of the MFP. After the inputted images are processed through the image processing to generate output image data, the output images are printed out by the plotter of the MFP or the output image data are outputted to the external device connected with the MFP.","Conventionally, the image processing device of the above type is provided with a power saving mode in order to reduce the power consumption of the device. When an idle state of the image processing device is detected, the normal operating mode of the image processing device is changed to the power saving mode. And the image processing device returns from the power saving mode to the normal operating mode when a predetermined return condition is detected.","A control system of an image processing device which includes a sub-system which operates in the power saving mode in order to realize the power saving function is known from the patent document 1, for example. This sub-system manages the power supply of a main system which controls the whole image processing device during a normal operation, and carries out operation of the power saving mode. That is, in the power saving state, the sub-system turns off the CPU power supply of the main system, performs the network response and the monitoring of the relevant units, and, when returning from the power saving state, returns the main system to the normal operating mode again. This enables reduction of large power consumption for systems having a large CPU supply power.","In the control system of the patent document 1, an ASIC with a built-in programmable sequencer which constitutes the sub-system controls the sequences of the change to the power saving mode and the return from the power saving mode. For example, the return from the power saving mode is initiated when pressing of the operation panel switch or opening of the device cover is performed as a return trigger.\n\n","In the control system of the patent document 1, reception of a signal transmitted via the network interface (I\/F) from an external device is disclosed an example of the return conditions from the power saving mode. However, there is no disclosure in the patent document 1 of a USB (universal serial bus) interface which has recently been a general-purpose I\/F for connecting peripheral devices to the image processing device of this kind (MFP).","When a USB device (which is an external device connected by the USB interface) is attached to the image processing device of this kind (MFP) and the power supply to the attached USB device is turned on even in the power saving mode, operational mismatching may occur at the start of the power saving mode between the USB device and the USB device driver provided in the main system whose power supply is turned OFF in the power saving mode. The problem of the mismatching remains unsolved by the conventional technology.","The reason why the above-mentioned mismatching occurs is that, when a change of the USB device itself or a change of the device state is effected by attaching or detaching of the USB device in the power saving mode, the main system whose power supply is turned off in the power saving mode cannot recognize the change.","This invention is made in view of the above-mentioned problems, and an object of the invention is to provide an improved image processing device having a sub-system performing a power saving control to support the use of a USB device or provided to allow the supporting of the use of a USB device, in which mismatching which may occur at a start of the power saving mode between the USB device and the USB device driver provided in the main system of the image processing device can be effectively suppressed.","In an embodiment of the invention which solves or reduces one or more of the above-mentioned problems, there is provided an image processing device including a main control unit and a sub-control unit, the main control unit controlling each of an image input unit, an image processing unit, and an image output unit, the sub-control unit controlling power supply to the main control unit to change a mode of the image processing device to a the power saving mode and to cause the mode of the image processing device to return from the power saving mode, and the sub-control unit controlling response and transmission of a network interface and a USB device provided in the image processing device for inputting or outputting of image data, the image processing device comprising: a state holding unit holding a state of a USB device driver provided in the main control unit;

In the following, the operation is divided into each operation of (1) initialization, (2) changing to the power saving mode, and (3) returning from the power saving mode, and a description of each operation will be given.","(1) Initialization","If the power supply is switched on, each function is initialized by CPU (), initialization of the controller () is performed, and engine () is set in a waiting state until it receives a processing request command. The flow of this initialization is carried out when changing the device to the normal operating state.","The initialization of the controller () is based on the following steps. Pressing the power supply switch causes a reset signal to be inputted to ASIC (). The ASIC () which receives this input signal sends a reset signal to the power supply unit (not shown) so that electric power supply to a set of divided power supply groups is turned on in a given sequence.","As a result, the reset signals sent from the power supply groups are distributed to the necessary devices. In the CPU (), the reset signal is asserted and negated, and the CPU will fetch the command of a reset vector and sends the fetch signal the ASIC (). The ASIC () decodes the address when the fetch signal is received, and asserts the CS signal of ROM () in which the initializing program is stored, so that the contents (the instruction codes\/data) at the address of the ROM () requested by the CPU () are read out and supplied to the CPU ().","The CPU () repeatedly requests the ASIC () to read out the instructions, and the ASIC () passes the instruction codes\/data from the ROM () to the CPU () according to the relevant address. Thus, the CPU () can execute the initializing program.","The ASIC () has the built-in mechanism which enables reading out of instruction codes\/data directly from an SD card in the SD () instead of the ROM (). In the SD card, a program is stored in the format that is the same as the program stored in the ROM (). Generally, an SD card is managed by a sector number, but it can be accessed by converting the fetch request address from the CPU () into a sector number and an offset address in the sector, in a manner similar to that of the ROM.","By the read initializing program, initialization of the CPU (), initialization of the memory () which is connected to the ASIC (), and the ASIC (), initialization of two PCI buses from the ASIC (), initialization of the engine (), initialization of the operation panel (), initialization of the HDD (), and initialization of the network I\/F are carried out. And if needed, the SLOT groups (, , , , ) are initialized, and then the application programs are started.","The access time of the ROM () of the ASIC () is dependent on the data bus width, and in order to reduce the number of external terminals of ASIC () as small as possible, and, in many cases, the number of external terminals is set to be smaller than the width of the data bus of the CPU (), such as 16 bits, 8 bits, etc. If a 4-bit or 1-bit serial device, SEEPROM, SD card () or a memory stick is used in some case, the access time will become late.","In order to reduce terminals for exclusive use, it is possible to connect the ROM (), the ROM () and the NVRAM () through the exterior LOGIC () to the signals of the PCI, sharing the terminals of the PCI bus. In this case, it is possible to access the ROM (), the ROM () or the NVRAM () exclusively with the access to the PCI bus.","In the composition of this embodiment, the ASIC () performs, with the host I\/F the return, the control of the power supply and the operation of returning from the power saving mode, while the ASIC () performs the control of the CPU (), the MEM (), the HDD () and the SD () with the two PCI buses.","The optional composition of the two PCI buses of the ASIC () can be assigned for setting of REQ\/GNT, and this increases the flexibility of the system configuration. One of the two PCI buses is for exclusive use for connection with the engine (), and the other is for exclusive use for connection with the ASIC (). The PCI bus to which the ASIC () is connected can be operated at 66 MHz, and it is specializing in order to connect the host I\/F. The option slots ,  and  (, , ) are provided so that they may be connected with only the PCI bus connected with the engine at the time of 66 MHz operation.","Similarly, interrupt signals can also be assigned one for the engine (), one for the ASIC (), and the remaining three signals for either of the PCI buses.","\u2014Initialization of CPU","The CPU (MIPS system) () reads out the boot configuration data in each ASIC. Fetch of the command is started after reset release. It is determined whether the initiation is cold reset or other. And initialization of the access timing of the local bus in each ASIC, initialization of the cache in the CPU, initialization of TLB, and setup of exception vector, and initialization of the coprocessor are performed.","\u2014Initialization of Memory","It is checked whether the option memory exists, before determining the parameters concerning the timing of the normally implemented memory (also called standard memory). If the option memory exists, the SEEPROM in which the information on the option memory is stored is accessed, and the capacity of the memory, the speed, and the composition are read out. The standard memory timing is compared with the option memory timing, and the slower timing is selected and it is set to the ASIC (), and initialization of the MEM () is performed. Then, setting of the interrupt vector table and setting of the initial value to the data area are performed.","\u2014Initialization of PCI Bus","The configuration register in the internal registers of each ASIC is used, and all the devices existing on the PCI bus are searched. The type of each device is determined, and if there is a bus bridge, the devices on the following bus at the point will be searched. If listing of all the devices is completed, mapping of the address space of the PCI is performed. The mapping is performed by setting the start address of the memory under ASIC management to as 0x0000.0000 (making it 0x0000.0000 is not necessarily needed). The mapping of other devices is performed in the PCI memory space access window provided in the register space of the ASIC, or the PCI I\/O space access window. If the mapping is completed, the value 1 is set to the memory enabling bit, the I\/O enabling bit and the bus master enabling bit of the command register of each device, so that each device is set in the operable state. Since two PCI buses exist in the ASIC (), both the PCI buses are initialized similarly.","\u2014Initialization of Engine ()","Communication between the engine () and the controller () is performed via the transmission buffer and the receive buffer provided in the engine side PCI device.","\u2014Initialization of Operation Panel ()","The operation panel () and the ASIC () are connected together via the operation panel I\/F, and transmission and reception are performed in full duplex. A packet telecommunication is performed with a predetermined packet size, and it is displayed on the operation panel to indicate that the system is initializing.","\u2014Initialization of HDD ()","It is checked whether the HDD () is connected, and when the HDD () is connected, the information on the HDD () is read out and management information is stored in the memory in order to use it later.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0132"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG.

The ACPI driver () is a driver provided for supporting the power-saving mechanism of the hardware, such as the CPU (). The power saving state of the hardware is controlled by operation of this driver. It is feasible by implementing the functions equivalent to the ACPI realized by the IBM-AT compatible architecture. Operation related to the USB driver () will be explained later.","The USB driver () manages the hardware of USB and offers the function to the process layer via the process I\/F (). The network driver () drives the network hardware and offers the network communication function independent of the hardware to the network protocol stack ().","The main control system has the composition shown in  in the OS layer which manages the hardware resources, which enables the support of the power saving operation in which the power supply to the CPU () in the main control system is turned OFF. That is, in the power saving mode, the CPU () is in OFF state and the data on the RAM remain in the stored state, and at the time of returning from the power saving mode, the CPU () works as if the control is returned the ACPI driver ().","However, the sub-system (formed by the ASIC () or the ASIC () in ) is always maintained in the active state (conduction state), and there is the possibility that the state of the hardware under control of the sub-system is changed by the attaching or detaching of the USB device during the power saving mode.","In addition, it may be necessary for a certain device that, when changing to the power saving node, the operation of changing to the power saving state is performed after the pre-processing is performed. In the case of a USB driver, when the state of USB is in a configured state, transmission and reception of data to the end points, such as bulk in\/out is made possible. However, since receiving data in the power saving state is not desirable, the DMA in the normal operation state is stopped. When receiving data is present at the bulk out port in the power saving mode, NAK response is returned by the hardware. And after the operation of returning from the power saving state is performed, the data receiving is performed.","When the above structure is provided, the main control system (USB driver) conventionally cannot recognize change of the state of the USB device.","Since the USB driver cannot recognize change of the state of the USB device which may arise in the power saving mode, there is a possibility that mismatching may arise between the state held by the main control system (USB driver) immediately before changing to the power saving mode, and the state of the USB device which is changed during the power saving mode, which may cause an error in operation after returning from the power saving mode.","To obviate the problem, the USB device driver of this embodiment holds the state of the USB device at the time of changing to the power-saving mode. After returning from the power saving mode, the USB device driver compares the held state of the USB device at the time of changing to the power-saving mode with the state of the hardware of the USB device actually loaded. If there is mismatching, correction processing which makes a state transition of the USB device driver coincide with the actual state transition of the USB device is performed.","Even when power supply OFF\/ON of the device (for example, host PC) connected by the USB or hot swapping of a USB cable is performed during the power-saving mode, the state transition of the USB device driver is thus corrected after returning from the power-saving mode, and performing the normal operation can be continued without error.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0158","num":"0342"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 22"]},"The blocks in the state transition diagram of  include the following elements.\n\n","Suppose that a USB device which operates according to the state transition diagram of  is in the state of Configured () immediately before changing to the power saving mode, and the state of the USB device is changed to the state of Powered () after returning from the power saving mode. In this case, there is no direct state transition, and it is determined that detaching or attaching occurred during the power saving mode and the state of the USB device was returned to the state of Attached () or Not Attached () and then it was changed to the state of Powered (). In this case, there is also the possibility that detaching and attaching occurred repeatedly. Such operation may arise when the detection of hot swapping of the USB device is not the return factor from the power saving mode.","Although it is dependent on the structure of the USB device driver, it can be estimated that the state of the USB device drive is returned according to the shortest state transition regardless of the actual state changes. Making the state of the USB device drive be returned according to the shortest state transition based on this assumption can suppress the mismatching between the state of the USB device driver and the state of the actual USB device, if an estimated state transition sequence is created for the state of the USB device driver such that no conflict does not arise.","In this embodiment, the following serial number is assigned for each state of a USB device as information indicating the specific state of the USB device:","Not Attached=0","Attached=1","Powered=2","Default=3","Address=4","Configured=5","In this regard, since the state of Suspended () is detected by the hardware only, this state is disregarded by the software as not being relevant to the state change or return.","Bearing in mind the assignment of the above serial number for the USB device state, suppose that x denotes the serial number indicating the state of a USB device before state change and y denotes serial number indicating the state of the USB device after returning from the state change. When x<y, it can be considered that the estimated state transition sequence starts from x and ends at y. When y<x and y=0 or 1, it can be considered that the estimated state transition sequence directly ends at 0 or 1. When y is equal to 2 or more, it can be considered that the estimated state transition sequence changes to 1 and goes up to y.","The reason why the estimated state transition sequence mentioned above can be considered is as follows. If the after-return state y is equal to 0, it can be considered that connection of the USB device is in the cut-off state (Not Attached=0) as a result of the state change, whatever the before-change state x is. As indicated in the state transition diagram of , the state of the USB device after it is changed to the state of Disconnect can be changed to the state of Not Attached from any state. The USB device driver is provided so that the state of the USB device can be changed to the state of Not Attached=0 from any state.","Similarly, if y indicates the state immediately before the state of Connect (Attached=1) regardless of the number of x (whatever state it was), it can be considered that it is in the state with which hub resetting has occurred. As indicated in the state transition diagram of , the state transition is either the direct change to the state of Attached=1 after the hub resetting state (Hub Reset or Hub Deconfigure) occurred, or the changes from the state of Not Attached=0 to the state of Attached=1. In the latter case, even if the direct change to the state of Attached=1 is estimated, the mismatching between the state of the USB device and the state of the USB device driver can be suppressed. The mismatching can be suppressed by disregarding the difference between the two cases and presuming that it is changed to the state of Attached directly.","When y is equal to two or more and x>y, no state changes from a large number to a small state do not exist except for the state of Deconfigure, as indicated in the state transition diagram of . Although special consideration may be given to the state of Deconfigure and direct state transition may be considered only for the state change from Configured=5 to Address=4, the changes to the state of Deconfigure are not common in the normal operation of the actual USB device. Thus, at the time of y>=2 and x>y, it is assumed that the state of the USB device is changed to the state of Attached=1 and then changed to the state of y. By this estimated state transition, it is possible to suppress the mismatching between the state of the USB device driver and the state of the USB device.","In order to suppress the mismatching which may occur between the state of the USB device driver and the state of the actual USB device, an estimated state-transition sequence is generated based on the above-mentioned conditions.","The USB device is set in a communication-permitted state when it is in the state of Configured=5, and the outputting or inputting of data between the USB device and the MFP of this embodiment or the data transfer therebetween is permitted at this time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0176","num":"0377"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIG. 23"],"b":"201"},"When the condition x=y is met, it is a case where the state transition has not arisen, and a vacant estimated state-transition sequence { } is generated as the result (step S). And the processing is ended.","On the other hand, when the condition x=y is not met, it is a case where the state transition has arisen. In this case, the processing is branched depending on whether the state changes returning from the state of Configured=5 to the state of Attached=1 or Not Attached=0 have arisen.","It is determined whether the condition x<y is met (step S). When the condition x<y is met (or when the result of the determination at step S is affirmative), an estimated state-transition sequence {x+1, . . . , y} in which the serial number is simply incremented from x to y for each state is generated as the result (step S). And the processing is ended. This is because the device state is once changed to the state of Attached=1 or Not Attached=0 but the state after the return is progressing ahead of the state prior to the change to the power saving mode, and what is necessary is just to change from the current state to the state after the return.","On the other hand, when the condition x>y is met (or when the result of the determination at step S is negative), it is a case where the changes returning from the state of Configured=5 to the state of Attached=1 or Not Attached=0 have arisen. In this case, the processing is branched depending on whether the after-return state y is the state of Attached=1 or the state of Not Attached=0.","It is determined whether the condition y=0 or y=1 is met (step S). When the condition y=0 or y=1 is met (or when the result of the determination at step S is affirmative), an estimated state-transition sequence {y} in which the serial number changes to y immediately is generated as the result (step S).
