{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to online shopping, and more particularly, to online shopping checkout and payments.","Related Art","Consumers traditionally shop at brick-and-mortar stores, where consumers travel to the physical stores, shop for items, purchase the items, and take possession of the items, all at the point of sale (POS). However, online shopping is become more and more popular for numerous reasons, including the convenience of shopping from the consumer's home or office and the ability to shop multiple merchants around the world from their computing device, without ever having to leave their house or office.","Payments made through online shopping purchases are typically processed online, either through the consumer submitting information about a funding source, such as a credit card, debit card, or bank account, or using a payment provider, such as PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, Calif. After a consumer is finished shopping, e.g., placing selected items into an online cart or basket, the consumer goes through a payment or checkout flow. As part of the flow, the consumer enters the funding information or payment provider login information, confirms the purchase details and total, and receives a confirmation that the payment was processed.","However, there are times when a consumer may want to add one or more items to the purchase after checkout is completed. In that situation, the consumer typically has to start the shopping and payment process over, e.g., by selecting the item(s) to purchase, adding them to the cart, selecting a shipping address, entering in payment information, and confirming the payment. This can be tedious and inconvenient and possibly leading to the consumer deciding not to make the additional purchase at that time.","Therefore, a need exits for a payment solution that overcomes the disadvantages described above.","According to one embodiment, a user's checkout information is stored for a certain amount of time, e.g., 10 minutes, after checkout, and the user is given the option of selecting a button to add one or more items for purchase and completing the purchase by adding the additional item(s) and approving the payment, without having to go through a complete checkout flow again. In one embodiment, when the rapid checkout option is no longer available, the button disappears. In another embodiment, after initial checkout, the user sees a timer that counts down the amount of time remaining for the user to select the rapid checkout option or button.","Once selected, the user may be directed to a shopping page, where the user can shop and\/or search for additional items for purchase. The user can then select one or more items for purchase. An order page may be displayed to the user showing the previous items along with the new items. The user can then review and confirm the purchase. As a result, the user does not need to go through the full checkout flow again (e.g., login, entering shipping address, billing address, and\/or payment information). The additional items may be purchased from the same merchant or from a different merchant\/site.","These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures, wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102"]},"If the user is paying with a payment provider, such as PayPal Inc. of San Jose, the user selects an appropriate button or link on the merchant page. The user is then presented with a login screen, either as a new page or a pop-up screen on the same page, requesting login information, such as a user identifier (e.g., user name, email address) and a password or PIN.","Once the requested information has been entered or provided, the user may confirm the order at step . Before confirmation, the user may be presented with details of the purchase, such as item description, item prices, total price, shipping costs, tax, etc. If the details are acceptable and correct, the user may select a \u201cConfirm,\u201d \u201cPay,\u201d or other button or link to confirm the order.","The payment and\/or account information is then processed, such as by a credit card company, a bank, the merchant, a service provider, or a payment provider. If the payment can be approved, a notification is sent to the user and\/or the merchant that the payment is approved or completed. A transaction number or identifier may accompany the notification.","At this point, the user may conclude the current purchases with the merchant and await delivery of the purchased items. Alternatively, the user may want to add one or more items to the purchase. This can happen when the user wants to add an item the user forgot to add or did not think about adding during the shopping. Thus, at step , the user makes a determination whether to add one or more items to the purchase just completed. If the answer is no, the process ends and the user's funding source is debited, and the purchase is processed, such as the merchant shipping or otherwise delivering the purchased items.","However, if the user wishes to add an item, a determination is made, at step , whether the user is within a time limit to add an item and use a rapid checkout option offered by the merchant and\/or the payment provider. The user may be given a certain amount of time to use the rapid checkout option. The amount of time may be determined by the merchant, the payment provider, or the user in various embodiments. For example, the payment provider may set the time at 5 minutes. Longer times increase the likelihood that another person may make an authorized purchase from the user device or through the user session with the merchant. Shorter times may not give the user sufficient time to decide that another item should be added. The user may also set a timer period, based on how much risk the user may be willing to take. For example, the user may set a longer time to give the user more time in the event the user wishes to add an item to a just concluded purchase. The user alternatively select a shorter time to minimize exposure, especially if the user expects to make a decision to add an item in a very short time after a purchase is confirmed.","In one embodiment, the user may set different time periods for different merchants or dollar amounts. For example, the user may set a longer period for larger merchants and merchants the user typically makes larger purchases from. Larger merchants have larger inventories, so it may be more likely that the user will want to add an item with a larger merchant than with a smaller specialized merchant or seller. Shorter periods may be set for merchants that the user typically makes single or small purchases from. The payment provider may also set different time periods for different users, such as based on the user's purchase history. For example, if the payment provider sees that the user, in the past, has had to make several transactions with a particular merchant or generally within ten minutes after one transaction has concluded, the payment provider may set the time period for the user at ten minutes generally or for one or more specific merchants. However, for another user, the payment provider may set a time limit of five minutes because the user has many transactions within five minutes of another transaction with the same merchant, but no repeat transactions outside of seven minutes. The merchant may also set time periods if desired or allowed by the payment provider. Note that this option may not be available to all users, depending on the user, the payment provider, and\/or the merchant preferences.","If the rapid checkout option is available, the user may be shown a button or link after receiving notification at step  that indicates to the user that the rapid checkout option is available. In one embodiment, a timer or clock shows the user time remaining to select the rapid checkout option. Once the timer reaches zero or the option is no longer available, the rapid checkout button may disappear. During the time the rapid checkout option is available, the payment provider and\/or the merchant saves the information from the just concluded purchase, such as shipping address, billing address, funding source information, and\/or cart or item information. When the rapid checkout option is no longer available, the information is no longer saved.","If the user wishes to add an item after the first purchase and the rapid checkout option is not available, the user may go continue shopping with the merchant and add the item(s) at step . This may involve the user selecting a \u201cContinue Shopping\u201d button on the merchant site, which may then present the user a home or shopping page. The user then selects the desired item and performs a conventional checkout at step . Thus, the user is required to go through the same or similar checkout process as before because the earlier used information is no longer saved or available for reuse. For example, the user may be asked to login to a payment provider again, enter shipping address, billing address, etc.","However, if the user decides to add an item while the rapid checkout option is available, the user may select the option at step , such as by tapping, clicking, or otherwise selecting a button or link on the merchant page, which may be on the same page as the notification received at step . Once selected, a communication may be sent to the merchant and\/or the payment provider to notify of the user's intent to add one or more items and to use saved information from the earlier transaction to rapidly checkout. In one embodiment, this stops the clock or timer indefinitely. In other words, the user is not limited to when the user needs to complete the transaction to add the additional item(s). In another embodiment, the communication triggers another timer that gives the user a certain amount of time to complete the add-on purchase. Again, the time remaining to complete may be shown to the user, such as in the form of a timer counting down.","The user may then add the additional item(s) at step . For example, the user may be redirected back to a shopping page of the merchant, where the user can select the desired item(s) to be placed in the user's shopping cart. Once added to the cart, the user may then confirm the order at step . Note that the user no longer needs to perform a checkout again at step , e.g., no need to enter shipping information, billing information, login information, and payment information. The user simply needs to confirm the payment and the new item(s) are quickly and easily added to the previously submitted order.","In another embodiment, the newly added item(s) are processed as its own order, i.e., the newly added item(s) are not added to the previous order. However, there are still advantages in that the user does not need to go through a new checkout process to add the new item. The user payment and shipping information are saved so that the user simply has to confirm the new order.","As shown in , after the additional item(s) are added, the user goes through the previously described steps, including step , where the user can add more item(s) again. Thus, the user may continue to add items as long as the rapid checkout option is available. For example, the timer may reset each time the user receives a notification at step . In other embodiments, the user may be allowed only one or a finite number of uses of the rapid checkout option based on a first full checkout flow. Note that the one or more of the various steps described above may be performed in different order and\/or combined as suitable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 2A"]},"However, if the merchant provides the rapid checkout option, such as a button on the confirmation page, the user gets to the review page directly. In the example flow in , once the user selects the rapid checkout option, the user is directed to the review page, showing information such as shipping information, billing information, etc. If that is confirmed, the user may be redirected to the merchant site to continue shopping, where the user may then add the desired additional item(s) to the cart. In another embodiment, these two steps may be swapped, where the review page will then show the user the previously purchased items and the new item(s). The user does not have to login in again with the payment provider.","For payment, the user may be redirected to the merchant website. As soon as the user selects the \u201cPay\u201d button, a new payment provider call \u201cDoUpdateExpressCheckoutPayment\u201d is used to update the existing order. To be able to provide the ability to not require user login again to the payment provider website and to match the new and the existing website, the payment provider token that is transferred within the API\u2014merchant communication is used. The token may also be used to define the exact time stamp for the rapid checkout option timer. The time stamp provided by payment provider gives exact information how long the rapid checkout option will be available to the user.","By saving user information for a certain period of time, the user may obtain the benefit of using the rapid checkout option across different merchant sites with the same transaction. For example, the user can visit different websites, add products to the cart and go through the checkout flow without the need to login to the user's account again or enter shipping, billing, or funding information each time. All orders may be added to the same initial transaction if the rapid checkout option (such as calling DoUpdateExpressCheckoutPayment) is used every time the user completes the payment process, assuming the rapid checkout option is still available at each merchant page. For example, the timer or time stamp may reset each time the user finishes adding item(s) to one merchant site.","In one example, after the user finishes payment at merchant A, the user selects the rapid checkout option and may then go to a site of merchant B. The user information is saved by the payment provider. The user places items in the cart at merchant B's site, reviews the cart, and approves payment without having to login with the payment provider. Once a notification is received, the user may again see the rapid checkout option. The user may select the option and then go to a site for merchant C. Again, the user information is saved. The user places desired item(s) in a cart through the merchant C site and proceeds with checkout and payment without having to login with the payment provider. This can continue as long as the user wants to add additional items (either within a current merchant site or a different merchant site) and the rapid checkout option is still available.","In the above example, the user may enter a URL address or select a link from a search to enter a new merchant's site. The user may also select a link on the site of a merchant where the user just completed a transaction. The link may be to one or more products offered by a different merchant.","In one embodiment, the user sees a separate receipt or review page for each separate merchant, although the payment is processed as one transaction by the payment provider. In another embodiment, the user sees a single cumulative receipt or review page, listing items from each separate merchant on the same receipt. The payment provider processes the payment through one user transaction and credits accounts separately to the appropriate merchants.","It is possible to use this functionality to show products of other stores on any website to promote cross-selling between merchants or websites. In one embodiment, when the user has completed the checkout, the user may be shown additional items that may be of interest to the user, such as suggested by the payment provider through the user's current and\/or previous purchases. The user can then add those items to the user's just-completed transaction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","340","370","360","370","305","310","370"]},"User device , merchant server , and payment provider server  may each include one or more processors, memories, and other appropriate components for executing instructions such as program code and\/or data stored on one or more computer readable mediums to implement the various applications, data, and steps described herein. For example, such instructions may be stored in one or more computer readable media such as memories or data storage devices internal and\/or external to various components of system , and\/or accessible over network .","Network  may be implemented as a single network or a combination of multiple networks. For example, in various embodiments, network  may include the Internet or one or more intranets, landline networks, wireless networks, and\/or other appropriate types of networks.","User device  may be implemented using any appropriate hardware and software configured for wired and\/or wireless communication over network . For example, in one embodiment, the user device may be implemented as a smart phone, personal computer (PC), personal digital assistant (PDA), laptop computer, and\/or other types of computing devices capable of transmitting and\/or receiving data, such as an iPad\u2122 from Apple\u2122. The user may use different user devices to perform different transactions described above.","User device  may include one or more browser applications  which may be used, for example, to provide a convenient interface to permit user  to browse information available over network . For example, in one embodiment, browser application  may be implemented as a web browser configured to view information available over the Internet. User device  may also include one or more toolbar applications  which may be used, for example, to provide client-side processing for performing desired tasks in response to operations selected by user .

In one embodiment, user identifier  may be used by a payment service provider to associate user  with a particular account maintained by the payment provider. A communications application , with associated interfaces, enables user device  to communicate within system .","Merchant server  may be maintained, for example, by a merchant or seller offering various products and\/or services in exchange for payment to be received over network . Merchant server  may be used for POS or online purchases and transactions. Generally, merchant server  may be maintained by anyone or any entity that receives money, which includes charities as well as retailers and restaurants. Merchant server  includes a database  identifying available products and\/or services (e.g., collectively referred to as items) which may be made available for viewing and purchase by user . Accordingly, merchant server  also includes a marketplace application  which may be configured to serve information over network  to browser  of user device . In one embodiment, user  may interact with marketplace application  through browser applications over network  in order to view various products, food items, or services identified in database .","Merchant server  also includes a checkout application  which may be configured to facilitate the purchase by user  of goods or services identified by marketplace application . Checkout application  may be configured to accept payment information from or on behalf of user  through payment service provider server  over network , such as at a physical POS or online. For example, checkout application  may receive and process a payment confirmation from payment service provider server , as well as transmit transaction information to the payment provider and receive information from the payment provider (e.g., a transaction ID). Multiple merchant servers  may be networked with the payment provider server  so that user  may use the rapid checkout option across multiple merchants and sites with a single transaction started and completed with one merchant or site.","Payment provider server  may be maintained, for example, by an online payment service provider which may provide payment between user  and the operator of merchant server . In this regard, payment provider server  includes one or more payment applications  which may be configured to interact with user device  and\/or merchant server  over network  to facilitate the purchase of goods or services, communicate\/display information, and send payments by user  of user device  and as discussed above.","Payment provider server  also maintains a plurality of user accounts , each of which may include account information  associated with individual users. For example, account information  may include private financial information of users of devices such as account numbers, passwords, device identifiers, user names, phone numbers, credit card information, bank information, or other financial information which may be used to facilitate online transactions by user . Advantageously, payment application  may be configured to interact with merchant server  on behalf of user  during a transaction with checkout application  to track and manage payment requests and purchases made by users using the rapid checkout option.","A transaction processing application , which may be part of payment application  or separate, may be configured to receive information from a user device and\/or merchant server  for processing and storage in a payment database . Transaction processing application  may include one or more applications to process information from user  for processing a payment request and payment by the user selecting the fast checkout option as described herein. As such, transaction processing application  may store details of a payment request from a user or merchant. Payment application  may be further configured to determine the existence of and to manage accounts for user , as well as create new accounts if necessary, such as the set up, management, and use of an account for the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400"]},"Computer system  includes a bus  or other communication mechanism for communicating information data, signals, and information between various components of computer system .
