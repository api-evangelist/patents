title: Method for embedded integrated end-to-end testing
abstract: A method and system for automated testing of a system such as a billing module in a telecommunication system is disclosed. In a first embodiment, test APIs, scenarios and configuration information are embedded into the module itself in a way such that, when testing is desired, tests may be conducted without any need for a dedicated test environment. Tests can be run from within the module itself, thereby eliminating the risk, expense and time required to use external testing systems and data to test the module. In another embodiment, operational data such as live operational orders are wrapped in test headers and are used as input data for testing purposes within the billing module. In this embodiment, test APIs may be embedded into all modules of an operational support system so that complete system end-to-end testing is possible without the use of dedicated external test equipment and processes.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of prior application Ser. No. 11\/233,540 filed Sep. 23, 2005, and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,484,145 on Jan. 27, 2009, which is incorporated herein by reference.","As complex converged telecommunication networks designed to provide a wide range of services to customers become more prevalent, the need for thorough testing becomes important prior to operationally releasing any replacement module or improvement to any part of the system. For example, operational support systems (OSSs) in telecommunication systems have many different elements that require frequent updates and improvements when new services are introduced to customers. Such OSS systems typically include order management, design and engineering, carrier interconnection, service provisioning, inventory, service activation, billing, customer care and service assurance modules. These modules are able to interact with each other and various modules and networks and also must be able to accept input from and provide information to external elements, such as sales, engineering and technician personnel. Accordingly, such systems are complex and require careful configuration control. When a new element of a system, such as a billing module, is inserted into the system, an integration system test is typically conducted to verify the configuration, compatibility and proper operation of the module. In the case of today's large converged telecommunication networks, such tests can be correspondingly very large and complex in scope.","Typically, such tests involve creating a comprehensive set of test data and running that data through the new module\/system element under a variety of test scenarios involving various system configurations and loads. These test scenarios are typically created independently of the system under test and involve integrating special test equipment with the system prior to testing. As the data is processed by the system, intermediate results are monitored at various points throughout the system in order to ensure proper functioning of the system. Any faults are detected through the detection of anomalous data at these monitoring points. As a result of the complexity involved in integrating test equipment and validating test data\/scenarios, such large integration systems tests (ISTs) are typically long in duration, expensive and risky.","The present invention essentially solves the aforementioned problems. The present inventors have invented a method and system for automated testing of a system such as a billing module in a telecommunication system. In a first embodiment, test APIs, scenarios and configuration information are embedded into the module itself in a way such that, when testing is desired, tests may be conducted without any need for a dedicated test environment. Tests can be run from within the module itself, thus eliminating the risk, expense and time required to use external testing systems and data to test the module. In another embodiment, operational data such as live operational orders are wrapped in test headers and are used as input data for testing purposes within the billing module. In yet another embodiment, test APIs are embedded into all modules of an operational support system in a way such that complete system end-to-end testing is possible without the use of dedicated external test equipment and processes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 1","figure 112"],"b":["100","101","102","103","104","105","106","107","108","109","101","110","110","105","103","111","111","110"]},"One skilled in the art will recognize that the different modules of the OSS of  are typically legacy systems that may have been in operation for a significant period of time. Each module in the system may have been added or updated independently from other elements of the system and may have been developed by different suppliers.  shows one functional module of the system of , specifically billing module , showing the various aspects of functionality of the billing module. Referring to , in operations of the billing module, customer orders  are received and sales contracts  are generated. These customer orders  and sales contracts , together with tariff policies , are used as input to establish service rates and business rules  for operation. Any mediations , or changes to the established rates and business rules, are used to modify those rates and rules. The resulting rate is input into the billing system A, along with sales contract  information and tariff policy  information. When services  are rendered, the billing system  is referred to for rate information and, along with the customer profile\/history , is used to generate bills . Information from such bills is used to update the customer profile\/history  and is used to bill the customer for the rendered services . The billing system of  may be, for example, implemented in a computer adapted to perform the functional steps discussed above.","When a new billing system, such as the billing system of , is added as a new module in the OSS system of , then, as discussed above, an entire dedicated test of the system is typically conducted. As also discussed above, such tests involve creating a comprehensive set of test data and running that data through the new module\/system element under a variety of test scenarios involving various system configurations and loads.  shows a block diagram of a prior test configuration. In that figure, system  is the system that is to be tested. Test configuration database  contains environmental data dictating the configuration of the system. Test scenario module  inputs test rules and conditions for the test. Test data , generated by scripts, users, simulated data and from other sources, is input into the test system via the test configuration database where it is formatted appropriately. Faults in the data may intentionally be inserted by ad hoc change module  to test the ability of the system to handle such faults. End-to-End (ETE) flow monitoring module  monitors the data flow in the systems during the test and compares the data flow with the original test data to determine proper handling of the data flow. The data flow output by the systems  is collected and monitored by a test results\/analysis\/certification module . Thus, as shown by the prior configuration of , testing of a system such as integration system testing was typically conducted by applying externally-generated configuration settings, scenarios and test data to a system and then extracting test data results from that system for analysis. One skilled in the art will recognize that, while the above elements of the test system of  are discussed in terms of modules, they may be either stand alone systems operated on different computer systems, or alternatively, may be implemented on a single computer system. One skilled in the art will recognize that these elements may also be input manually as opposed to being operated by a computer system.","The present inventors have recognized that testing of an illustrative billing system, such as accomplished by the test arrangement of , is cumbersome, expensive and risky. Therefore, in accordance with the principles of the present invention, test application programming interfaces (APIs) are embedded into the modules of operational systems. Test scenarios can thus be embedded into the billing system module itself to allow for automated end-to-end testing at any desired time.  shows an illustrative test configuration of a billing system, such as the billing system of , in accordance with one embodiment of the principles of the present invention. Specifically, instead of applying externally-generated configuration, scenario and data collection functions to a system, these functions are integrated within the modules of the system itself. Referring to , therefore, orders and contracts  are created and or stored internally to the billing system and may be, for example, actual operational orders collected and stored for testing purposes. Simulated data , which consists of, for example, simulated contracts and orders, may also be used to test specific features of the system. In contrast to prior systems, as discussed above, instead of applying test scenarios and configurations from an external source to the system to be tested, test APIs, scenarios and configurations  are already integrated within the actual system modules to facilitate testing internal to the system. Internal test data points are accumulated by, for example, embedded test software agents adapted to collect such data. For example, these agents have well-known APIs that collect statistics as to types of data flowing through the system while in operation. The data points are optimized for complete regressing testing when a new software release is loaded.","Therefore, for example, when a new billing module is inserted within the system, the infrastructure for a test as an integrated system test is already in place. This internal test infrastructure can be automated so that, when a test transaction of a particular format is inserted into the system, that transaction will trigger one or more predefined test scenarios and configurations. Thus, due to the integrated nature of the test configurations, different environments may be run simultaneously through the same system, such as an IST test environment , where integrated system tests run, the user acceptance test (UAT) environment , where acceptance tests and\/or operational readiness tests may be run and the AdHoc test environment  where specialized or ad hoc tests are run. As discussed above, these tests may be run prior to the operational use of the system to verify the operational integration and readiness of the system. The results of this data may be output as benchmark results and analysis . Accordingly, by using a test configuration according to the above-described principles, the time and expense associated with connecting and configuring external test elements\/equipment with a system to be tested is essentially eliminated. Additionally, such a test configuration leads to a less-risky test since the uncertainty of interoperability of the different test elements with the system is eliminated.","The billing system of  may be, for example, implemented in a computer adapted to perform the functional steps discussed above. Referring to , graphical computer  may be implemented on any suitable computer adapted to receive store and transmit data such as the aforementioned billing information. Referring to , illustrative computer  may have, for example, a processor  (or multiple processors) which controls the overall operation of the graphical computer . Such operation is defined by computer program instructions stored in a memory  and executed by processor . The memory  may be any type of computer readable medium, including without limitation electronic, magnetic, or optical media. Further, while one memory unit  is shown in , it is to be understood that memory unit  could comprise multiple memory units, with such memory units comprising any type of memory. Graphical computer  also comprises illustrative modem  and network interface . Modem  is used to connect, for example, to network  in  and network interface  is used to connect to network . Graphical computer  also illustratively comprises a storage medium, such as a computer hard disk drive  for storing, for example, data and computer programs adapted for use in accordance with the principles of the present invention as described hereinabove. Finally, graphical computer  also illustratively comprises one or more input\/output devices, represented in  as terminal , for allowing interaction with, for example, a service provider technician or database administrator. One skilled in the art will recognize that graphical computer  is merely illustrative in nature and that various hardware and software components may be adapted for equally advantageous use in a computer in accordance with the principles of the present invention.","One skilled in the art will recognize in light of the foregoing that, in addition to conducting tests prior to operation or production implementation, a benefit of incorporating the test infrastructure directly into the system modules is that such tests may be conducted at any time. Therefore, to ensure the proper operation of a system after installation, for example, tests may be run in parallel to operations of the production system or traces may be run through the production environment  in  itself. This testing may be accomplished entirely transparently to operational transaction data. Therefore, one skilled in the art will recognize in light of the foregoing that ETE testing may be accomplished in a very flexible manner. For example, audit tracing or testing may be \u201cturned on\u201d automatically when an unexpected or anomalous data point is detected in operational use (step  of ). In such a case, a trigger will initiate a known flow of data using a predetermined system configuration and scenario to test the system and produce benchmarks or other data for analysis. One skilled in the art will also recognize that such tests may be conducted periodically in response to the expiration of a time period. Thus, benchmarks such as transaction timeliness, end to end user response times and resource (e.g., central processing unit\/memory) utilization may be tested and analyzed periodically.","While the foregoing discussion is centered on testing of a billing system by integrating test functionality within the billing module, one skilled in the art will recognize that it may be desirable to also integrate test functionality into other modules. Thus, for example, an ordering module might contain a test API by which it can collect operational data and use it for test purposes by forwarding it via the test API to the billing module. Such operational data, for example operational orders generated in response to customer purchases, may be wrapped in a test header that will trigger the test procedures in the billing module when received by that module. Each different module in the system, such as system  of , may contain similar test APIs in order to facilitate true system end to end testing in an automatic fashion.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"b":["507","601","602","602","603","604","605","606"]},"The foregoing Detailed Description is to be understood as being in every respect illustrative and exemplary, but not restrictive, and the scope of the invention disclosed herein is not to be determined from the Detailed Description, but rather from the claims as interpreted according to the full breadth permitted by the patent laws.
