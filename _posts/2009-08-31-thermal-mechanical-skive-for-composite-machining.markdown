title: Thermal mechanical skive for composite machining
abstract: An apparatus for thermal mechanical machining of composite materials includes a head, a drive, and a shaft. The head has an abrasive face. The drive is coupled to the apparatus to move the head to produce abrasion of the composite material by the abrasive face. The shaft includes a passageway that communicates a heated gas to an interface between the abrasive face and the composite material. The gas removes particles that result from the abrasion of the composite material by the abrasive face. The gas can be heated sufficiently to carbonize or vaporize organic constituents of the composite material.

A skive is the apparatus used to remove portions of the part. Laser skives or mechanical skives are currently used on products in industries including semiconductor, aerospace, and photographic and optical equipment.","Laser skives have been used to remove composite layer(s) when the composite utilizes an organic fiber (i.e., a fiber containing carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and\/or oxygen compounds) such as graphite or an organic polymer matrix such as epoxy. Laser skiving relies on the thermal decomposition of the organic constituents of the composite in the presence of oxygen (oxidation) or the exclusion of oxygen (pyrolysis). However, laser skiving becomes ineffective for material removal when the composite being machined utilizes an inorganic fiber or filler such as fiberglass, metal or silica, or has organic constituents which thermally convert to inorganic constituents (e.g., silicone). Additionally, laser skives are not easily controllable to remove composite layers having non-uniform thickness or surface irregularities.","Mechanical skiving also has drawbacks which include the fact that it may be difficult to dimensionally control the machined cavity produced. For example, when the surface of the composite layer being exposed by machining is thin and\/or is located in a position difficult to reference by traditional machining techniques, the ability to machine to the surface of the layer can result in damage to the layer or failure to adequately expose the layer. Inaccurate machining can impair desired properties of the composite such as the ability of the constituents of the composite to transfer and\/or convert electrical energy into heat energy.","An apparatus for thermal mechanical machining of composite materials includes a head, a drive, and a shaft. The head has an abrasive face. The drive is coupled to the apparatus to move the head to produce abrasion of the composite material by the abrasive face. The shaft includes a passageway that communicates a heated gas to an interface between the abrasive face and the composite material.","In another aspect, a method of machining a composite material includes positioning a thermal mechanical skive with a gas conduit and a head having an abrasive face adjacent a composite material, moving the abrasive face against the composite material, and heating a gas to a temperature sufficient to either vaporize or carbonize organic constituent(s) of the composite material, and delivering the gas through a passageway in the thermal mechanical skive to an interface between the abrasive face and the composite material.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["12","14","16","18","12","20","16","24","18","22","26","22","28","30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The inlet strut  extends radially inward from the annular outer case  to the annular inner case . The exit port  extends through the outer case  is complementary to and receives the electrical conduit  when the shroud fairing  is assembled on the inlet strut .","The shroud fairing  includes the U-shaped folded heater mat , which surrounds and wraps the leading edge portion of the inlet strut . When assembled, the electrical conduit  interconnects with electrical pads or contacts imbedded in the heater mat  through the shell  and is electrically connected to supply an electrical charge to heating elements . The shell  interfaces with and is integral with the heater mat . In one embodiment, the shell  is a polymer matrix composite.","A manufacturing process bonds and integrates the shell  and the heater mat . In one embodiment, this process is accomplished by resin transfer molding. Alternatively, the shell  can be joined to the heater mat  as an insert by another type of molding such as compression molding. The electrical conduit  can be joined to the heater mat  by, for example, welding, soldering, mechanical contact or electrically conducting adhesives.","The heater mat  may be constructed from any electrically isolating suitable composite material or composite polymer matrix. The metallic heating elements  are disposed on a surface of mat  extend along the radial length of the heating mat  and may be sputtered, or flame sprayed when the mat is a woven product; insert molded, or adhesively bonded to the heating mat  when the mat is a solid product. The heater mat  may have additional electrically isolating layers. In , the heating elements  illustrated are imbedded within the heating mat  and are therefore illustrated with dashed lines.","When the shroud fairing  is assembled to inlet strut , a leading portion of the shell  abuts the inlet strut . The sides of the heater mat  and shell  extend rearward around a portion of each inlet strut  and may be secured thereto by fasteners or adhesive. The exit port  in the outer case  receives the electrical conduit  to supply power to the heating elements . The heating elements  are electrically resistive to convert electrical energy into heat energy and provide the heat along the entire length of the outer shell  thereby anti-icing (preventing the formation of ice on the exterior surface of the outer shell  and in any space between the heater mat  and the inlet strut ) or de-icing (allowing the formation of ice followed by controlled release of the ice on the exterior surface of the shell  and in any space between the heater mat  and the inlet strut ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["22","28","22","32","34"]},"In , the heating elements  are an electrically resistive metallic which is disposed on a single fabric layer  within the heating mat  and are therefore shown with dashed lines. The heating elements  are covered by an additional fabric layer(s)  and extend from the lower radial portions of the heater mat  to the generally rectangular shaped electrical contacts . Alternatively, only the single fabric layer  with the heating elements  disposed thereon can comprise the heater mat . In such an instance the heating elements  would be illustrated with solid lines. The electrical contacts  connect with the heating elements  and are disposed on a single fabric layer . The electrical contacts  are electrically contacted by traditional terminations on the electrical conduit  () when the shell  is assembled with the heater mat .","Like the heating elements , the electrical contacts  are comprised of a electrically conductive metallic material such as titanium, stainless steel, nickel alloys, copper alloys or copper. If the electrical contacts  are embedded within the shell  or are covered by additional fabric layer(s)  of the heater mat , the electrical contacts  must be exposed by, for example, removing the fabric layer(s)  or layer(s) of the shell  thereabove to allow for an effective electrical connection to be made between the electrical contacts  and the electrical conduit  ().","The fabric layer  on which the heating elements  are disposed acts as a backing material to support the heating elements  extending along it. In one embodiment, the fabric layer  contains a densely woven organic electrically insulating (i.e., a material containing carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and\/or oxygen compounds) and\/or inorganic material such as fiberglass or a polymer film. Examples of suitable densely woven materials that may be used include a fiberglass fabric, such as Style 106, which is made commercially available by Clark Schwebel Tech-Fab Company of Anderson, S.C., and a polymer film, such as Kapton, which is made commercially available by DuPont High Performance Materials of Circleville, Ohio. In other embodiments, the fabric layer  contains a densely woven organic and\/or inorganic material that is itself electrically insulating and is geometrically configured to electrically insulate an electrically conductive component, such as one formed of a carbon composite or a metal alloy, from the metallic heating elements , while at the same time, thermally conduct heat generated by heating elements . In situations where the fabric layer  also electrically insulates the heating elements , it is desirable for the fabric material forming the fabric layer  to be woven tightly enough to be electrically insulating. Electrically insulating materials that may be used to form the fabric layer  include fiberglass, Nextel or another suitable ceramic fiber fabric. The densely woven material of the fabric layer  can also be impregnated with a high-temperature resin (not shown). Examples of suitable high-temperature resins include, but are not limited to, bismaleimide, phthalonitrile, cyanate ester, polyimide adhesive, and polyimide resin. Specific examples of various embodiments of resins, the heating element  and the fabric layer , including their constituents, arrangements, volumetric ratios, and properties are disclosed in United States Patent Application Publication Number 2007\/0187381 A1, which is incorporated herein by reference. In yet other embodiments, the composite can contain an organic and\/or inorganic filler or fiber orientated in a random or organized pattern.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["18","26","22","35","34","18","26","22","28","32","34","26","22","35","26","22"]},"As previously indicated, in one embodiment of the heater mat  the heating elements  and electrical contacts  are disposed on a single fabric layer . In other cases, if only a single fabric layer  was utilized in heater mat  the heating elements  and electrical contacts  were used in the shroud fairing , subsequent steps in the manufacturing process (including the embedding within shell  or bonding of the heater mat  to other components of the turbine engine) may cover portions of the heating elements  and electrical contacts  with material(s) such as the high-temperature resin discussed previously. These materials imbed the heating elements  and electrical contacts  and do not allow for a good electrical connection to occur upon assembly. In either case, the inventive apparatus and method described herein can be used to remove the material covering the electrical contacts  to allow for an effective electrical connection to be made.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["38","38","39","40","42","40","52","54"]},"The conduit extends through and is bonded to the generally circular head . The conduit  directs the flow of the gas G or gas mixture to the exterior surface of the head  which interfaces a composite surface during the machining operation of the skive . In this embodiment, the gas G is heated to the desired temperature prior to entering the conduit . The conduit  includes the rigid inelastic shaft  which has the gas flow passageway  extending through therethrough from a side port (not shown). This configuration allows the shaft  to be clamped or otherwise affixed to the drive  such as a mechanical drill press or piezoelectric actuator. The shaft  transfers drive movement generated by the drive  to the head .","More specifically, the conduit  extends through the axis of symmetry of the head . The head  has an abrasive face adapted to interface with a composite material work piece. In one embodiment, the abrasive face is comprised of a hard material, for example: silica, silicon carbide or diamond. The type of material selected for the abrasive face of the head  is determined by a combination of criteria including the strength of the composite being machined, the desired tool life, and the desired composite surface tolerance or finish. The head  can be a backer for the abrasive face or can be constructed from the same material as the abrasive face. Alternatively, the conduit  can extend around the edge of the head  rather than through it along the axis of symmetry. In addition to bonding, the conduit  can be joined to the head  by, for example, welding, brazing, soldering, mechanical crimping\/stapling or adhesives. The shaft  portion of the conduit  can be comprised of a metallic such as steel, or another suitable composite, polymeric, or ceramic material. The rigid shaft  configuration allows the conduit  to be clamped or otherwise affixed to the drive . The shaft  transfers drive movements generated by the drive  to the head . Alternatively, a flexible conduit may be utilized rather than a rigid shaft if the drive  is clamped or otherwise affixed directly to the head  rather than the shaft.","The conduit  directs the flow of a gas G to the abrasive surface of the head . Thus, the gas G flow is delivered to the interface between the abrasive surface of the head  and the composite material being machined. The quantity of gas G flow should be sufficient to remove machined particles that result from the drive movement of the head  against the composite. The gas G may include any gas or mixture of gases. In one embodiment, the gas G contains a suitable quantity of oxygen to support oxidation adjacent the exterior surface of the head . In another embodiment, the gas G or mixture of gases, contains a sufficient quantity of an inert gas to support pyrolysis adjacent the exterior surface of the head .","The gas G can be heated to a desired temperature prior to entering the conduit . The desired temperature will vary depending upon the composition of the composite being machined by the skive apparatus . For applications in which the composite being machined contains both organic and inorganic constituents it may be desirable to convert the organic constituents to behave like a brittle inorganic. The brittle converted constituents can then be broken up and removed by the mechanical action of the skive apparatus . For example, a gas G temperature upwards of about 316\u00b0 C. (about 600\u00b0 F.) in the presence of oxygen can be used if it is desirable to carbonize the organic constituent(s) of the composite being thermally and mechanically machined by the skive apparatus . In other applications, it may be desirable to thermally convert the organic constituents of the composite to gas(es) rather than mechanically removing them. For example, a gas G temperature of around 650\u00b0 C. (around 1200\u00b0 F.) can be used in the presence of oxygen to vaporize (chemically convert to carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen monoxide and water) any organic constituent(s) of the composite. A gas G temperature of around 540\u00b0 C. (around 1000\u00b0 F.) can be used in the absence of oxygen (for example by using an inert gas such as argon to blanket the composite surface being machined) to pyrolize any organic constituent(s) of the composite. The dual thermal and mechanical features of the skive apparatus  allow it to effectively remove both the organic and inorganic constituents of composites whether through thermal degradation, mechanical action or both.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["42","38","38","42","40","42","58","60","40","52","54"]},"The conduit  extends through the head .

Other modes of drive movement can be generated by the drive  and include a downward motion that selectively contacts the head  with the shroud fairing  and an upward motion that selectively disengages the head  from contact with the shroud fairing . Another mode of drive movement can include a rotational motion in which the skive  is spun continuously around a rotational axis.","The drive movement of the head  against the shroud fairing  (along with some downward force pressing the head  against the shroud fairing ) breaks up the shell  and the additional fabric layer(s)  of the heater mat  into particles P after thermal removal or conversion of the organic constituents. In , in addition to the back-and-forth oscillatory motion, the skive  also moves downward to selectively contact the head  with the heater mat  and upward to selectively disengage the head  from contact with the shroud fairing . During engagement of the head  with the fabric layer , the back-and-forth motion breaks the fabric layer  into the particles P. During the upward movement when the head  is not in contact with the shroud fairing , the gas G flow from the flow passageway  transports the machined particles P generally outward to the edge  of the head  and away from the machined area. The particles P and gas are blown out together from the edge  of the head  away from the area of the shroud fairing  being machined.
