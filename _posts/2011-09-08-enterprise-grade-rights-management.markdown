No. 61\/381,366, filed Sep. 9, 2010, in the United States, entitled \u201cEnterprise Grade Rights Management.\u201d This provisional application is hereby incorporated for all purposes.","This disclosure relates in general to cloud-based computer processing and, but not by way of limitation, to managing access rights to media items for streaming.","Access to a media item, such as a video, via an online on-demand system may typically be controlled in a static manner. For example, the media item may be accessible to only end-users that satisfy specific criteria. If multiple, different sets of criteria are to be used to evaluate whether access to the media item should be granted, multiple instances of the media item may need to be stored (e.g., one for each set of criteria). Such an arrangement may not be efficient for managing access rights to a significant number of media items.","Various arrangements for controlling access to a set of media items accessible via multiple channels are presented. In some embodiments, a computer system for controlling access to a set of media items accessible via multiple channels is presented. The computer system may comprise a processor and a computer-readable storage medium. The computer-readable storage medium may store instructions configured to cause the computer system to store an indication for each media item of a set of media items. The instructions may be further configured to cause the computer system to receive a first set of rules that is used to determine accessibility of a first subset of the set of media items. The instructions may be further configured to cause the computer system to receive a second set of rules that is used to determine accessibility of a second subset of the set of media items. The first subset of the set of media items and the second subset of the set of media items may comprise at least one media item in common. The instructions may be further configured to cause the computer system to receive a first request for access to a media item of the set of media items from an instance of a first application. The media item may be common to the first subset of the set of media items and the second subset of the set of media items. The first application may be executed remotely from the computer system. The instructions may be further configured to cause the computer system to determine the first request is associated with a first channel. The first channel may be associated with the first application and the first set of rules. The instructions may be further configured to cause the computer system to provide access to the media item in accordance with the first set of rules. The instructions may be further configured to receive a second request for access to the media item from an instance of a second application. The second application may be executed remotely from the computer system and the first application. The instructions may be further configured to determine the second request is associated with a second channel. The second channel may be associated with the second application and the second subset of the set of media items. The instructions may be further configured to provide access to the media item in accordance with the second set of rules.","Various embodiments may include one or more of the following: The instructions configured to cause the computer system to provide access to the media item in accordance with the first set of rules may comprise instructions configured to cause the computer system to transmit, to the first application, a first universal resource locator that indicates a location at a content data network from where the first application is to retrieve the media item. The instructions configured to cause the computer system to provide access to the media item in accordance with the second set of rules may comprise instructions configured to cause the computer system to transmit, to the first application, a second universal resource locator that indicates the location at the content data network from where the second application is to retrieve the media item. The media item may be a chunk of a media asset. Continuous playback of the chunk is configured to occur for, at most, a minute, and continuous playback of the media asset, is configured to occur for, at minimum, three minutes. The first set of rules may define a geographical region in which playback of the media item is permitted. The geographical region may be defined as a set of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. The first set of rules may specify a time period in which playback of the media item is permitted. The instructions may be further configured to cause the computer system to generate a manifest that indicates multiple media items of the first subset of the set of media items accessible by the first application, wherein each of the multiple media items indicated are in accordance with the first set of rules. The instructions may be further configured to cause the computer system to transfer, to the first application, the manifest. At least one media item of the first subset of the set of media items may not be in accordance with the first set of rules. The at least one media item may not indicated in the manifest.","In some embodiments, a method for controlling access to a set of media items accessible via multiple channels is presented. The method may include storing an indication for each media item of a set of media items. The method may include receiving a first set of rules that is used to determine accessibility of a first subset of the set of media items. The method may include receiving a second set of rules that is used to determine accessibility of a second subset of the set of media items. The first subset of the set of media items and the second subset of the set of media items may contain at least one media item in common. The method may include receiving a first request for access to a media item of the set of media items from an instance of a first application. The media item may be common to the first subset of the set of media items and the second subset of the set of media items. The first application may be executed remotely. The method may include determining the first request is associated with a first channel. The first channel may be associated with the first application and the first set of rules. The method may include providing access to the media item in accordance with the first set of rules. The method may include receiving a second request for access to the media item from an instance of a second application. The second application may be executed remotely from the first application. The method may include determining the second request is associated with a second channel. The second channel may be associated with the second application and the second subset of the set of media items. The method may include providing access to the media item in accordance with the second set of rules.","In some embodiments, computer program product for controlling access to a set of media items accessible via multiple channels is presented. The computer program product may comprise instructions, which, when executed, cause a computer system to receive a first set of rules that is used to determine accessibility of a first subset of the set of media items. The computer program product may also comprise instructions, which, when executed, cause a computer system to receive a second set of rules that is used to determine accessibility of a second subset of the set of media items. The computer program product may also comprise instructions, which, when executed, cause a computer system to receive a first request for access to a media item of the set of media items from an instance of a first application. The media item may be common to the first subset of the set of media items and the second subset of the set of media items. The computer program product may also comprise instructions, which, when executed, cause a computer system to determine the first request is associated with a first channel. The first channel may be associated with the first application and the first set of rules. The computer program product may also comprise instructions, which, when executed, cause a computer system to provide access to the media item in accordance with the first set of rules. The computer program product may also comprise instructions, which, when executed, cause a computer system to receive a second request for access to the media item from an instance of a second application. The computer program product may also comprise instructions, which, when executed, cause a computer system to determine the second request is associated with a second channel. The second channel may be associated with the second application and the second subset of the set of media items. The computer program product may also comprise instructions, which, when executed, cause a computer system to provide access to the media item in accordance with the second set of rules.","Flexibility in managing data items, such as media items, may be useful when multiple end-users and\/or applications have different access rights depending on factors such as the channel that the media item is accessed through. Further, media items may need to be accessible via multiple channels and have different rules governing access to the media item via each channel. As opposed to fixing various rules directly with media items and potentially having multiple instantiations of the same media item with different rules linked to each instantiation, rules may be established that define access parameters via one or more channels to stored media items. Such an implementation of rules may allow for flexible management of media items, such as media items that are hosted by a content data network. While the content data network may be used to serve media items to an application operating on an end-user's computer system, access to the media item may be governed by rules enforced remotely from the content data network and\/or the application.","By way of example only, consider two websites that each provides episodes of sitcoms. The first website may provide access to sitcoms A, B, and C. Further, this first website may allow sitcoms A, B, and C to be viewed using applications 1, 2, and 3. The second website may provide access to sitcoms C, D, and E via applications 4, 5, and 6. The sitcoms, which may be stored in the form of video and\/or audio files (e.g., as media assets), may be stored in a common location by a third party. The first and second website may each be accessed as a channel. Therefore, when an end-user accesses the first channel using a first application, the end-user may only be able to view sitcoms A, B, and C. The media items that the end-user is able to view via the first channel may be controlled by a first set of rules associated with the channel and media items. Similarly, if the end-user visits the second channel, the end-user may access media items C, D, and E in accordance with a second set of rules. Sitcom C, the sitcom in common to both channels, may be a single media item (which may be accessible from a content data network), but may have different rules associated with sitcom C based on the channel it is accessed through. For example, while sitcom C may be available via both channels, the application through which the end-user may view and\/or listen to the media item may vary and may be controlled by the set of rules linked to each channel.","Such an arrangement may allow for determining which media items are available through each channel and which applications may be used with each media item to be reconfigured quickly. For example, if a cross-promotional agreement was reached between the first and second websites, by only adjusting the rules linked to each channel, it may be possible to make sitcoms previously associated with only the first website be associated with the second website. Further, such a change may not involve any media items needing to be modified and\/or copied because the rules are implemented such that the media items themselves do not need to be modified regardless of the channel the media item is being accessed through. Moreover, such flexible sets of rules may allow for highly configurable control of media items.","While the above embodiments may be implemented in a variety of different systems, some particular embodiments may be implemented as part of a media service system.  is a block diagram illustrating a media servicing system , according to some embodiments of the present invention. The system may deliver media content to the end-user  (alternatively referred to as an end-user or a client) through a network such as the Internet . A media asset provided by a content provider  can be processed and indexed by cloud-hosted integrated multi-node pipelining system (CHIMPS) , and further stored on content delivery network (CDN) . Additionally or alternatively, the CHIMPS  may also be adapted to store the media asset.","The media servicing system further enables a content provider  or other entity to gather information regarding end-user behavior during media playback. For example, a content provider  can be provided with data indicating that end-users tend to stop watching a video at a certain point in playback, or that end-users tend to follow links associated with certain advertisements displayed during playback. With this data, a content provider  can adjust factors such as media content, advertisement placement and content, etc., to increase revenue associated with the media content and provide the end-user  with a more desirable playback experience.","End-user  can request a media asset to hear and\/or see with a client program running on a personal computer or other electronic device connected to Internet . The client program can be, for example, a media player, browser, or other application adapted to request and\/or play media assets. In response to a request for a media asset, the CHIMPS  can utilize any number of application centers  and\/or kernel application center(s)  to provide the client program with a data object concerning the requested media asset. The data object can include information about the media asset, including where the media asset can be located, such as within the CDN  or within the CHIMPS  itself. Location information may be provided by Universal Resource Indicator (URI), a Universal Resource Locator (URL) or other indicator. During playback of the media asset, the CHIMPS  can collect data regarding the playback through beaconing provided by a client program executed on a device operated by the end-user  and\/or indexing service from within the CHIMPS and\/or CDN. The CHIMPS  can subsequently provide the data and\/or any analytics information derived from the data to the content provider .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["111","1","110","1","111","1","112","120","140","112","111","1","112","110","1","270","112","111","1"]},"Components within the kernel application center - can communicate through network  such as a local area network (LAN) and can include one or more data object origin servers  and a storage array  with which data objects and\/or media assets may be stored and distributed. The storage array  may also be utilized by services running on processing server(s)  and\/or transcoding server(s)  that may require temporary or long-term storage. Kernel server  can utilize processing server(s)  or transcoding server(s)  to provide various functional capabilities to the CHIMPS .","For example, as described in more detail below, the CHIMPS - can provide transcoding service for media assets provided by a content provider  for syndication. Such a service can allow a content provider  to upload a media asset to an application center , after which the application center  would notify the kernel server  that the media asset has been uploaded. The kernel server  can then notify services running on the processing server(s)  of the upload. These services can utilize transcoding server(s)  to transcode the media asset, which can then be moved to a CDN and\/or stored locally by storage array  and data object origin server(s) . Services running on the processing server(s)  can also update the associated data object stored by the storage array  and data object origin server(s) .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["111","2","112","111","2","112","111","2","111","2","260","112","110","112","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["112","112","330","310","360","330","310","360","112","320","130","370","310","111","112","340","112","350","110","350","310","111"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","1","110"]},"Media can be ingested into the CHIMPS  when a content provider  uploads a media asset to ingestion server(s)  in an application center  by utilizing a client . The client  can be a stand-alone application or browser-based, for example, and can communicate with ingest server(s)  through an application programming interface (API) configured for the ingestion of media assets.","Ingest server(s)  can communicate with devices in the kernel application center  executing programs such as kernel server  and file replication service . The kernel server  can be configured to organize the workflow among services such as transcoding master , file system manager , and other services  (e.g., analytics, dynamic API, etc.) Upon a particular event, for example, the kernel server can be configured to notify the relevant services of the event, causing the services to process tasks associated with the event.","The file replication service , under direction of the kernel server , can coordinate the movement of the media assets between services; for example, retrieving the uploaded media asset from the ingest server(s)  and storing it on the file archive , or retrieving transcoded media assets from transcoding server(s)  and storing them in the media asset origin.","The data object updater  keeps the data object origin server  up to date in response to any changes in the system. When, for example, a file is uploaded, transcoded, and stored in media asset origin , the location and other metadata concerning the transcoded media assets need to be created or updated in the data object origin server  to ensure an end-user who accesses the object in the data object origin server  has the correct information regarding the related media asset. Because the data object updater  receives updates from the kernel server  (which is notified when a transcoded media asset is stored in the media asset origin ), the system ensures the data objects in the data object origin server  are constantly up to date.","The upload of a media asset to the ingest server(s) , as described above, can provide an example of how the kernel server  may coordinate workflow. For instance, in response to the upload, the ingest server(s)  can notify the kernel server  that a media asset has been uploaded. The kernel server  informs the file replication service  of the uploaded media asset, and the file replication service  moves the uploaded media asset into the file archive  and notifies the kernel server  of the move. In response, the kernel server  notifies the file replication service , the file system manager , and the transcoding master  of the move. The file replication service  then will know it can delete the uploaded media asset from the ingest server(s) , the file system manager  will update the file system accordingly, and the transcoding master  will notify transcoding service(s)  of different transcoding tasks to be performed. The transcoding service(s)  can then retrieve the uploaded media asset from the file archive  to create transcoded media assets. The transcoding service(s)  notify the kernel server  once transcoding is complete, and the kernel server  relays this information to the file replication service . The file replication service  then takes the transcoded media assets from the transcoding services  and moves them to the media asset origin . Once the file replication service  notifies the kernel server  of the move, the kernel server , in turn, notifies the file replication service  and the data object updater . The data object updater  updates the data object origin server  accordingly, and the file replication service  deletes the transcoded media assets from the transcoding services .","The modular nature of the system enables all tasks associated with an event to be completed quickly. As illustrated in the example above, workflow relating to a particular event, such as a media asset upload, can be spread among the various services simultaneously. Moreover, because the system's modularity enables it to be scaled to accommodate differing hardware capacities, and because the system can be configured to dynamically allocate hardware to different services according to the needs of the system, the speed of completing tasks relating to a particular event can further be increased.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":["400","2","110","400","2","400","1","455","400","2","455","150"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 4C","b":["400","3","110","400","3","400","1","455","400","3","455","150"]},"Referring to , a simplified embodiment of a system  configured for controlling access to media items (or, more generally, data items) accessed by an end-user via a channel is present. System  may include part of CHIMPS. More specifically, system  may include part of an Application Center. Media items may be video, animation, and\/or audio items, which an end-user may wish to play back or otherwise access. A media item may refer to a media asset or a chunk of a media asset. A media asset may be an entire media file configured for streaming (for example, an entire episode of a television program). A chunk may be a portion of the media asset. For example, when streamed, a media asset may be broken into a series of chunks configured to be played sequentially. When a media asset is broken into chunks (\u201cchunked\u201d), additional chunks associated with other content may be periodically inserted among the chunks, such as advertisements. Each chunk may be played back to an end-user sequentially. If a media item is being played back, this may mean that a media asset is being played back or a chunk of a media asset is being played back.","An end-user, via a public network, such as the Internet, or a private network, such as a corporate local area network, may access domain . The end-user accessing access domain  may allow an end-user access to one or more channels. An end-user, using a particular application, may access a website to access various media items. When accessing the website of a content provider (which may be a channel), the end-user may be directed to domain . Domain  may be operated by an entity separate from the entity that operates the webpage.","In , only one channel, channel , is illustrated for simplicity. A channel may represent a grouping of various media items that are available through a particular content provider. The content provider may be the entity that operates the webpage initially accessed by the end-user. For example, a channel, such as channel , may be linked with a specific content provider that provides media items to end-users, such as a television network (e.g., NBC, FOX, CBS). Besides media items, a channel may be used by a software provider to allow access to binary data files. Such an arrangement involving channels may be used to access binary and\/or media items. Collectively, these items are referred to as data items. It should be understood that while the various embodiments discussed herein focus on the use of media items, similar systems and methods may be applied to data items.","Channel  may be linked with applications . Applications  represent various applications that are permitted to be used by an end-user to access the media items accessible through channel . Applications  may represent various media players that are available to play back media items accessible via channel . Associated with each application of applications , one or more instances  may be executed. For example, an application may be a media player for a mobile device associated with a particular content provider (e.g., HBO, NETFLIX, HULU). Other applications associated with the same content provider may be associated with the same or a different channel; for example, a media player configured for playback on a television.","Manifest  may represent a listing of media items associated with channel . Manifest  may contain universal resource indicators (e.g., universal resource locators (URLs)) that identify locations of media items. Manifest  may also contain various metadata, such as length of playback data, order of playback data, etc. A manifest may be generated based on rules  as applied to the instance of the application being used to access the media items. For example, a manifest may be a playlist of various media items available to the end-user via a particular instance of an application. Manifest  may be a playlist that defines an order of playback of media items accessible via channel . Manifest  may be generated when an end-user accesses access domain  using an instance of an application.","Linked to access domain  may be one or more catalogs . Catalogs  may be used to store and organize media items . A catalog of catalogs  may store one or more media items. As an example, a catalog may be devoted to storing videos, while another catalog may be devoted to storing audio recordings. Catalogs  may store indications of media items (e.g., the location of each media item), rather than the media items themselves. In some embodiments, media items stored as part of catalogs  may be used to distribute the media item to various end-users for playback, or another location of the media items may be used. For example, rather than using media items  of catalogs  to serve end-users, a location of the media items may be stored, such as a location of a media item on a content data network. This location may be provided to the application of the end-user rather than the media item itself.","One or more of media items  may be accessible through one or more channels, such as channel . A same media item of media items  may be accessible via more than one channel. As such, even if each channel is operated\/controlled on behalf of a different content provider, the same media item may be used to serve requests through that channel. It also may be possible that some media items of media items  are not accessible via any channels. Media items  may represent media items owned by a variety of entities (e.g., content providers) that are being stored in a common location or on a common network. For example, if an entity wishes for a media item to be available to end-users only within a particular geographical region (e.g., a state, a country, the world, etc.), the entity may provide the media item to a second entity that has servers dispersed throughout the geographical area. Restriction may be performed based on the IP addresses of the end-users. The media item may then be accessible via the second entity's servers. This second entity may provide similar services for multiple different content providers of media items. Further, each of these content providers of media items may want to define various rules governing when and how its media items may be accessed.","Rules  may define how the media items of media items  linked to channel  may be accessed. Rules  may serve at least a dual purpose: 1) to enforce security procedures; and 2) to enforce business rules. The security procedures may be directed to ensuring that a particular instance of an application and\/or an end-user attempting to access a media item is the only instance of that application\/user accessing the media item (e.g., a URL is not being redistributed to other end-users and\/or applications). The business rules may refer to rules created by the content provider that governs which applications, which end-users, and when playback of particular media items are permissible. Some of rules  may only apply to some of media items .","For example, a content provider associated with channel  may wish to define a certain time period in which one or more media items of media items  that are associated with channel  may be accessed. Outside of this time period, when an end-user accesses channel , the media item may not be accessible due to rules , despite the fact that the media item is still among media items . Within this time period, the media item may be accessible through channel . Another rule that may be defined for channel  may include a geographic restriction (e.g., geofencing). This may involve restricting access to one or more media items of media items  to a particular geographical region (e.g., a city, county, state, country, continent, IP domain, etc.). Within this geographical region, rules  may dictate that a particular media item of media items  be available to the end-user; however, outside this geographical region, the media item may appear unavailable (e.g., may not appear during a search or may be demarked unavailable). Therefore, an end-user may access one or more media items through channel , which is in turn accessed through domain . Through channel , the end-user may have access to a subset of media items  defined accessible to the end-user by rules . The subset of media items  accessible in accordance with rules  may be accessible to the end-user via applications .","Rules  may be flexible in what security rules and\/or business rules can be enforced. Rules  may apply to all media items accessible via a channel, such as channel , or may apply only to specific media items available via a channel. Rules  can include one or more rules. As previously discussed, rules may include a geographic restriction, which may be enforced based on the IP address at which a request for a media item originates. Similarly to a geographic restriction, rules may be used to define particular IP addresses that are permitted or prevented from viewing media items. Rules  may include an IP address white list (that is, IP addresses permitted to view the media items associated with rules ) or an IP blacklist (IP addresses prohibited from viewing the media items associated with rules ). Rules  may be used to permit or deny access to a range of IP addresses. For example, if a content provider desires to provide access to media items for all end-users of an Internet service provider, the range of IP addresses associated with that Internet service provider may be set via rules  to permit access to the associated media items.","Rules may include permitting access on a time period basis. For example, a particular media item may only be made accessible starting at a certain time, until a certain time, or for a particular time period. As an example, a content provider may desire an episode of a television program to become available immediately after the television program has been broadcast. As such, the television program may be stored as a media item and associated with the role that identifies the time at which the television program is to become available for streaming.","Rules  may restrict what devices and\/or applications are permitted to view particular media items. Based upon request, it may be possible to identify what devices and\/or applications are being used to attempt to access the media item. Which media items are permitted to be accessed may vary depending on the device and\/or application. For example, a same end-user may have access to different media items when a first application is used as compared to a second application.","Rules  may also be used to enforce parental controls. For example, based on a request, if an end-user is determined to be a certain age, such as 12, media items associated with a motion picture rating more restrictive than PG may not be accessible. Previously defined preferences for video and audio may also be enforced via rules . For example, if an end-user and\/or application that the end-user is executing is associated with particular video and\/or audio formats only, rules  may be used to present only media items in the supported formats. Rules  may also be used to determine whether a paid and\/or free version of a particular media item is available to the end-user via channel .","Rules  may be used to ensure a quality of service (QoS) for playback. If the media item being provided to the instance of the application is in the form of chunks and a certain QoS as defined by rules  is not being realized, the location of the chunks of the media item used to serve the end-user may be modified. For example, chunks may be provided from a different content data network in an attempt to realize the QoS as defined by rules .","In response to a request for a media item received from an instance of an application through channel , at least two options may be possible. If the request complies with rules  that are associated with the media item requested, a URL to the media item (e.g., the media asset or a chunk of the media asset) may be returned to the instance of the application of the end-user. If the request is not in compliance with rules , no URL may be returned. Additionally, a denial message may be transmitted to the instance of the application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["600","605","610","600","605","630","632","634","610","605","630","605","640","620","631","630","530","631","535","631","640","605","630","631","630","630","631","630","631","630"]},"Applications  may represent applications  of  or may represent some other group of applications.

However, it should be understood that each of these channels may be accessible via various applications (which may be the same or different) from applications  linked to channel , various playlists (which may be the same or different) from playlists , and instances of applications (which may be the same or different from instances , , and  linked to channel ).","Channel  may be linked to rules . Rules  may define access for end-user  (and\/or other end-users) to media items . For example, some of the same media items of media items  may be accessible via both channels  and . Further, a media item that is only accessible via channel  may be made accessible through channel  by only modifying the rules associated with the channels. For example, it may only be necessary to change rules , with no change necessary to the media item itself. This may allow for expeditious changes to which media items are available via each channel because the media items  (nor may additional copies of such media items be required) are not altered by the channels they are available through.","Further rules  may define which of the media items are available to end-user  via channel . Again, the media items made available to the end-user via channel  may include some (or all) of the same media items available via channels  and . Further, because a media item is available through multiple channels (and possibly through different applications based on the channel), only one instance of the media item may be present in media items .","Rules , , and  may represent rules similar to previously discussed rules . Each of these sets of rules may contain one or more of the restrictions discussed in relation to rules . Each of these sets of rules may be defined by the content provider associated with the channel. The content provider may be permitted to access and modify the rules associated with the content provider's channel. In some embodiments, the rules may be provided to CHIMPS. In some embodiments, an interface provided by CHIMPS may be used by the content provider associated with the channel to define the rules.","By way of example, if channel  has made available a video from among media items , rules  may specify that the video is available to end-users in the United States. Therefore, if an end-user from the United States accesses channel , the end-user may be able to access the video. However, if the same end-user (or some other end-user) accesses channel  from some other country, the video may not appear as accessible via channel . The entity operating channel  may change this by only having rules  modified, with no change to the video stored among media items  being necessary.","Further, if the entity operating channel  acquired rights to the video, it may make the video available to end-users via channel  by only modifying rules . In other words, no modification to media items  may be necessary because the video is already stored among media items . Further, even if channel  uses one or more different applications to present the video to the end-user different from applications  of channel , no modification may be necessary to the video of media items . Rather, channel  may have different applications linked to it for playback of media items.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","700","405","150","600","405","605","700","500","600"]},"End-user  may communicate directly with client  for authentication purposes. For example, an end-user may be authenticated by a client  to have permission to access a channel associated with client . In the illustrated embodiment of , channel  is associated with client . Assuming end-user  is authorized to access channel , client  may provide end-user  with an authentication token to be provided to domain  of CHIMPS. In some embodiments, authentication information may be provided from end-user  to domain . In turn, this authentication information may be sent by CHIMPS to client  for authentication. In some embodiments, domain  may handle authentication for client .","Client  may be able to edit rules  that correspond to channel  and\/or media items associated with channel . Client  may be permitted to access an API that allows rules  to be modified. Client , which may be a content provider, may be a separate entity from CHIMPS. While only one client (client ) is illustrated as in communication with CHIMPS, it should be understood that many different clients may be in communication with CHIMPS in order to manage rules associated with various channels.","As previously discussed, manifests  may contain URLs and\/or various metadata that is transmitted to end-user . Such a manifest may be generated dynamically based on the rules applicable to the channel being accessed by the end-user via an instance of an application. For example, if end-user  is accessing channel  via domain , rules  may be used to generate a manifest that identifies various media items that are permissible to be accessed by the end-user. Such a manifest may be used as a playlist by the end-user to access the various permissible media items.","While rules  may be used to generate the manifest, between the time when the manifest was generated and when end-user  attempts to play back media items via the URLs listed in the manifest, end-user  may no longer be permitted access to one or more media items listed in the manifest in accordance with rules . For example, if rules  specify a time in which a media item is available, the media item may have been available when the manifest was generated. However, by the time the media item is attempted to be played by the end-user , the time period may have expired. As such, despite the media item being identified in the manifest, the media item may not be permitted to be streamed to end-user .","As previously discussed, a media item may be a chunk. As such, a manifest provided to an end-user may specify chunks of a media asset. Each of these chunks may represent a portion of the media asset. A chunk may be a short segment of a larger media asset. For example, a chunk may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, or 20 seconds in length. The media asset may, for example, be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, or 60 minutes in length. As such, a single chunk may represent a small portion of the media asset. As the end-user  attempts to retrieve consecutive chunks from the manifest, rules  may be reevaluated. If end-user  begins to stream a media asset, and during the streaming the end-user  no longer complies with rules , streaming may cease. As such, rules  may be evaluated on a chunk-by-chunk basis.","While media items may be stored within catalogs of CHIMPS, media items  may also represent indications of media items. Rather than CHIMPS providing media items to end-users, such as end-user , a URL that indicates the location of the media item may be provided to end-user . The URL may point to an instance of the media items stored by a content data network, such as CDN . As such, end-user , via the instance of the application being used by the end-user to access the media asset, may retrieve the media item from CDN . In such embodiments, CHIMPS may be used for rule enforcement, while a CDN, such as CDN , is used to stream the media item to end-user . CDN  may be operated by an entity separate from client  and CHIMPS.","In some embodiments, authentication is handled between end-user  and client . Rule enforcement is handled by CHIMPS, and streaming of the media item is handled by CDN . CHIMPS may dynamically create the manifest that is transferred to end-user . This manifest may be in accordance with the rules associated with the channel the end-user is accessing. These rules may also be accessed when the individual media items specified within the manifest are requested by end-user . While systems  and  illustrate a computerized device of a single end-user (represented as end-user ) accessing domain , it should be understood that greater numbers of end-users may be accessing domain .","The systems of  may be used to perform various methods.  illustrates an embodiment of a method  for controlling access to media items. Method  may be performed using the systems of  or some other system that is configured for controlling access to media items. Each step of method  may be performed by a computer system. Each step of method  may be performed by CHIMPS. More specifically, each step of method  may be performed by a computer system of an application center of CHIMPS.","At step , a plurality of media items may be stored. The stored media items may be stored in one or more catalogs. In some embodiments, rather than storing the media items themselves, links, such as URLs, to other locations storing the media items may be stored. For example, these other locations may include one or more content data networks.","At step , rules may be received. These rules may be received from one or more different content providers, which may be referred to as clients. These rules may define which media items are available through which channels. The rules may also identify which media items are available to end-users based on characteristics of the end-user and\/or the application being used by the end-user to access a channel. The rules received at step  may be associated with a particular channel. The rules may also be associated with particular media items.","At step , a request may be received for access from an end-user. The request may be for access to a channel in general or for one or more specific media items via a channel. As such, this request may come in the form of the end-user attempting to access a particular channel or as a request for a specific media item.","At step , a channel may be identified that is associated with the request received from the end-user. Based upon the application identified by the end-user's request, a particular channel may be identified. As an example of this, if the end-user attempts to access domain  using a media streaming application associated with HBO, it may be determined that the HBO channel is associated with the end-user's request.","At step , it may be determined whether the request received from the end-user complies with rules that correspond to the channel and\/or the media items associated with the channel. In response to determining whether the request received from the end-user complies with the rules associated with the media items of the channel, access to one or more media items may be provided to the end-user at step . Such access may include providing the end-user with a dynamically-generated manifest that contains various URLs associated with one or more media assets accessible by the end-user. The various URLs presented in the manifest may correspond to chunks of a media asset and\/or various media assets. In some embodiments, such access may include streaming a particular media item to the end-user without the use of the manifest. If a manifest is provided, access may also be evaluated when a URL from the manifest is accessed. Alternatively, a manifest may be provided that indicates chunks of the particular media item. If the end-user is attempting to access all media assets available to the end-user's particular channel, the manifest may contain URLs corresponding to a plurality of media assets available to the end-user via the channel. If the request from the end-user is for a particular media item, the particular media item may be streamed to the end-user. Streaming of a media item to the end-user may occur from the system that evaluates the rules (e.g., CHIMPS) or from some other computerized system, such as a content data network.","If, at step , the request received from the end-user does not comply with the rules associated with the channel and\/or media items requested by the end-user, access may be denied to the media item at step .

These rules may be received from multiple different content providers, which may be referred to as clients. These rules may define which media items are available through which channels. The rules may identify which media items are available to specific end-users based on the identity of the end-user and\/or the application being used by the end-user to access the media items.

In some embodiments, the chunks are transferred directly from the system performing method . Access may include providing the end-user with a dynamically-generated manifest that contains various URLs associated with one or more media assets accessible by the end-user in accordance with the rules. The various URLs presented in the manifest may correspond to chunks of one or more media assets. In some embodiments, a URL may be provided to the end-user without the use of a manifest. If the request from the end-user is for a particular media item, a URL for a chunk of the particular media item may be streamed to the end-user. In some embodiments, a manifest may be provided that indicates chunks of the particular media item. If the end-user is attempting to access all media assets available through a particular channel, the manifest may contain URLs corresponding to chunks of a plurality of media assets available to the end-user via the channel.
