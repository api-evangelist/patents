title: Folding seat with movable backrest
abstract: A movable seat and backrest are coupled by a pivoted link system, allowing the seat to pivot from a raised stowed position to a lowered use position. A connecting link is coupled to one of the pivoted seat links, such that, as the seat is lowered, the connecting link raises the backrest. When the seat is raised to a stowed position, the connecting link lowers the backrest to a lowered position. When mounted in a vessel, the backrest forms part of the bolster system when the seat is stowed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/086,561 entitled FSWMB, filed on Aug. 6, 2008, by Bruce F. Thompson, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to a fold-out seat which includes a movable backrest which moves between a lowered stowed position, when the seat is stowed, and a raised use position, when the seat is folded out to a use position.","Many pleasure boats, such as those available in the Pursuit\u00ae and Tiara\u00ae lines of yachts, include seats across the transom for increasing the seating in the cockpit areas. Such seats are usually stowed in a vertical position parallel to the transom to allow full use of the cockpit. When additional seating is desired, they fold down from the vertical stowed position to a lowered position in which they form a bench seat. The bolster, which extends across the transom and along the port and starboard sides, typically forms the backrest for the seat. The bolster height in some vessels, however, is inconveniently low to form a comfortable backrest. Also, in some fold-out seat designs for vessels, the bolster is pivotally mounted to hold the seat in a stowed position and must be manipulated by pivoting the bolster upwardly to allow the folding seat to be extended. Subsequently, the bolster is again returned to its normal position. This complicates the operation of the seat for the user and the bolster may be uncomfortable for use as a backrest.","The present invention addresses the issue of providing a fold-out seat which can be easily moved between a stowed and use position. A bolster is coupled to the fold-out seat mechanism to move from a lowered position aligned with adjoining bolster sections of a vessel to a raised position forming a comfortable backrest when the seat is extended to a use position. Such construction eliminates the need for the operator to manipulate a bolster first to pull down a seat and then subsequently return the bolster to its original position and provides a one-motion operation to lower the seat and raise the bolster to a backrest position. Upon returning the seat to the stowed position, the bolster again returns to the aligned position with the remaining bolster sections.","Seats provided by the present invention provide such control of the seat and backrest by providing a parallel link connection for the seat allowing the seat to pivot from a raised stowed position to a lowered use position. A sliding backrest is coupled by a connecting link to one of the pivoted seat links, such that, as the seat is lowered, the connecting link raises the backrest to a more comfortable position. When the seat is again stowed, the connecting link lowers to move the backrest to a lowered position. When installed in a vessel, the backrest forms part of the bolster system in the cockpit of the vessel.","In one embodiment of the invention, magnetic catches are employed to secure the seat to the frame mechanism for the seat assembly in a stowed position. Although the seat and bolster\/backrest assembly of the present invention typically are mounted to the transom of a vessel, such mechanisms can be employed in other areas and in other environments to provide compactly stowed seat and comfortable backrest when the seat is moved to a use position.","These and other features, objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reading the following description thereof together with reference to the accompanying drawings.","Referring initially to , there is shown a vessel , such as a 2008 Pursuit\u00ae 375 Offshore, which includes a cockpit area  at the stern of the vessel and having a transom  which includes one or more seat assemblies  of the present invention. The seat assembly includes a finished outer forward facing panel  which is generally U-shaped with sides  and , as best seen in . Panel  covers the seat frame and link assembly  () for controlling the motion of the seat and its backrest. The seat assembly  includes a padded horizontally extending cushioned seat  () mounted to the frame assembly , as described below. A handle  is employed for moving the seat from a stowed position () downwardly in a direction indicated by arrow A in  to the use position shown in . Seat assembly  also includes a vertically sliding seat back\/bolster  which integrally forms part of the bolster system aligned with adjacent bolster sections  and  of the vessel when the seat is stowed, as shown in . When seat  is lowered for use, the backrest raises to a comfortable back supporting position, as seen in .","As best seen in , the frame assembly  for the seat comprises a generally rectangular seat frame  having a front leg , side legs  and , and a rear leg . The rearwardly extending legs ,  are pivotally mounted at  () to one end of link  having its opposite end pivotally mounted at  to vertically extending mounting brackets  (starboard) and  (port). Brackets ,  are secured in spaced relationship to the stern transom bulkhead  by suitable fasteners . The pivot mounting of frame  to brackets  and  is through an upper link  (best seen in ) and a lower link . The linkage connection is symmetrical so that only the one link mechanism on one side of the seat (port side of the vessel) is described in detail. Link  is pivotally coupled to leg  by pivot connection  and to right angle bracket  by pivot connection . Lower link  is pivotally coupled to the end of leg  at pivot connection  and to bracket  at pivot connection .","The seat back\/bolster  is coupled to a generally inverted U-shaped frame  () having a top horizontally extending leg  and a pair of downwardly extending L-shaped legs  and  at opposite ends. Legs ,  are slideably mounted in a slot in a lubricious polymeric bracket . Legs ,  each have a flange  which fits within a slot  () in brackets  (between surface  and the rear surface of brackets ) to captively hold the movable frame  and also allow the seat back\/bolster  to move upwardly and downwardly. To coordinate the motion of seat back frame  with the motion of seat frame , a connecting link  is pivotally coupled to link  at pivot connection  () between the ends of link  and at its upper end to leg  of frame  at pivot connection . Leg  of the seat frame  includes a magnetic catch  which aligns with a magnetic catch  on bracket  when the seat is in a closed position, as seen in , to hold the seat in a vertical stowed position.","The operation of the seat is best understood by reference to  in which, when the seat frame  is rotated downwardly in the direction indicated by arrow A in , link  rotates from a generally vertical lower position parallel to bulkhead  upwardly, as indicated by arrow B in , which also raises connecting link  in a direction indicated by arrow C. Thus, as seat frame  is further pivoted to the position shown in , link  moves to a position parallel to bracket  as does link , thereby raising the seat back\/bolster  attached to frame  from the lowered position, shown in , to a raised position, shown in . The movement of the bolster is through guide bracket  with leg  being L-shaped with a flange  () which slides in slot  and is controlled by the guide bracket  on one side and a spaced-apart lubricious polymeric guide  on the opposite side of leg  to control the position of the seat back\/bolster  in its movement between the lowered position, shown in , to the raised position, shown in . When the seat  is again stowed, the connecting links move in the opposite directions.","Thus, the seat assembly of the present invention provides a unique, movable backrest which serves as a bolster in the cockpit of a vessel and allows the compact storage of the seat with ease of control by rotating the seat downwardly utilizing only handle  from the stowed position, shown in , to the use position, shown in , where the seat back\/bolster  becomes a comfortable backrest for the user. Although the seat assembly  of the present invention is shown mounted in the stern area of the cockpit of a vessel, it could be mounted in the port or starboard side of the cockpit area or used in other environments where compact storage of a fold-down seat with a movable backrest is desired.","It will become apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications to the preferred embodiment of the invention as described herein can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 4-6"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
