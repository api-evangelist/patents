{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention generally relates to processing of data signals representing audio, in particular to prevent the recording and presentation of sensitive information during telephonic transactions.","Call centres are extensively used by service providers in delivering services to, and communicating with, customers. Call centres typically comprise a large group of staff members taking or making telephone calls with customers. Call centres commonly implement two key pieces of technology to aid in staff training, customer complaint management, or record-keeping. These are call recording technologies, where an audio recording of the customer conversation is kept, and screen recording technologies, where a video or static snapshot of the staff member's computer terminal is kept.","Each year, millions of people telephone call centres to make service enquiries or financial transactions, or issue instructions to companies they deal with. In many cases, the customer is either required to confirm his identity by providing the answer to security-based questions, or to provide his credit card details to pay for a transaction. As will be appreciated, the nature of much of this information is highly sensitive. In particular, the information can include passwords, personally-identifiable information such as a date of birth, a PIN, a memorable phrase, bank account numbers, credit card security codes and the like.","Data and identity theft, as well as fraudulent financial transactions, are widespread, and so it is of particular interest to the caller to keep secret as much of the information as possible. Disclosing personally-sensitive financial or other security information to a call centre staff member has the potential to increase personal data loss in a number of ways. Firstly, the call centre staff member can write down the customer's information for later use. Secondly, anybody with access to an audio recording of the customer conversation can listen to the customer information and note it down. Thirdly, anybody with access to a screen recording taken at the time the customer's information appeared on a call centre staff member's computer screen could note it down. Fourthly, technology exists to automatically \u2018mine\u2019 audio and screen recordings for customer information, and data loss through this mode has the potential to be widespread.","As a result of these increasing security concerns, some governments have enshrined data storage security standards in law, and some industry bodies have enacted their own guidelines surrounding the storage of personal data. One example is the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council, which issues guidelines for the processing and storage of credit card data, globally. Their Data Security Standards (DSS), periodically updated, dictates the methods and ways in which companies processing credit card data (including telephone-based credit card transactions) can store card and personal data. Regulations and guidelines such as these have a direct impact on call centres which take customers' sensitive data in telephone conversations. For example, the DSS stipulates that the 3 or 4 digit Card Verification Value (CV2\u2014sometimes also known as CVN, CW2, CVC2 or CID) not be stored in any format, including as encrypted audio recordings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","104","112","102","108","105","120","106","110","112"]},"A known approach to improve the security of a customer's interaction with a call centre is to introduce a pause recording capability that can be invoked while the sensitive information is being spoken to the agent. The pause can be manually or automatically triggered, for example when the agent clicks on the CV2 field on his monitor to enter the caller's credit card security number. Alternatively, the agent can be bypassed by routing the call to an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) application (not shown in ) when the sensitive information is required, which ensures that this part of the call is not recorded. However, in this mode, the agent and caller are disconnected from each other and are not able to talk freely throughout the card transaction. Another alternate method, turning off the recording, is not always practical, as most organisations carrying out credit card transactions need to record calls for staff training, investigating customer complaints, and in some circumstances to comply with industry or legal regulation such as those laid down by the Financial Services Authority (FSA).","Another known approach is to have callers use Dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signalling. DTMF tones are typically produced by pressing the keys on a standard telephone, and are used for \u2018touch dialing\u2019. In addition to its use for dialing, DTMF tones can communicate several alphanumeric characters clearly through a telephone's audio channel during a phone call. DTMF has the security advantage that it is impractical for a human to determine the alphanumeric equivalent of the DTMF tone simply by hearing the DTMF tone. Furthermore, it allows the call to continue as normal whilst the caller enters their credit card information using their phone keypad. However, the DTMF tones are representative of the sensitive information and so cannot be recorded if the DSS is to be complied with. To address this issue, it is known to introduce a call processor  at the call centre  that blocks DTMF tones.","For example, International Patent Application WO 2009\/136163 (Semafone Limited) describes a telephone call processor with the capability to be switched between two modes: \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201csafe\u201d. In normal mode both voice and DTMF components are allowed to pass to the PBX. This is important for the operation of call centres, as DTMF tones are used frequently, to allow customers to operate and navigate through IVR menu selections, for example. In the safe mode the voice component of the call is allowed to pass to the agent whilst the DTMF component is blocked or masked. This means both the agent and the call recording do not \u2018hear\u2019 the DTMF data.","The process of switching between a \u2018normal\u2019 and \u2018safe\u2019 mode, however, can require a complex interaction between a call centre's phone system, its credit card payment processes and its agents' desktop computers. A need therefore exists for improved methods and apparatus that do not rely on invoking different operating states at different times during a call.","In one aspect of the invention there is provided a method of processing signals of a telephonic communication, the signals conveying sensitive and non-sensitive information, the method comprising processing the signals to provide a first version of the signals that is to be recorded and a second version of the signals that is to be output as audio; monitoring at least the first version of the signals to detect, in the at least the first version of the signals, one or more instances of one or more predetermined characteristics that represent the sensitive information conveyed by the signals; and modifying the at least the first version of the signals by removing the identified predetermined characteristics from the at least the first version of the signals.","The provision of first and second versions of the signals means that the need to invoke different operating states at different times during the communication can be avoided. In particular, the first and second versions of the signals can be handled separately from each other, so that monitoring and modifying of signals can be performed for substantially the entire telephonic communication and without any additional actions from the participants of the telephonic communication.","Examples of predetermined characteristics include, but are not limited to, waveform patterns such as Dual Tone Multiple Frequency tone patterns and voice patterns, and bit patterns such as data packet identifiers of, for example, VoIP packets.","In one embodiment, the method further comprises recording the first version of the signals at a call processor implementing the monitoring and the modifying. This allows the method to be performed at the point of recording.","In one embodiment, the method further comprises buffering the at least the first version of the signals, and wherein modifying the at least the first version of the signals comprises removing at least a portion of the buffered the at least the first version of the signals preceding a point of detection for each identified instance of the predetermined characteristics. This allows the modification of the monitored signals to compensate for the time interval associated with the detection of the predetermined characteristics. The portion can correspond to about up to about 50 milliseconds of audio information, for example between about 10 to 20 milliseconds of audio information.","In one embodiment the method further comprises determining an alphanumeric representation corresponding to each identified instance of the predetermined characteristics, and outputting data indicative of said alphanumeric representation for use by a software application. In this way, data representing the sensitive information can be automatically extracted without the involvement of the agent and output to a computer software application. The data can be formatted into a format suitable for the software application. Examples of alphanumeric representation include, but are not limited to phrases, words, letters, and numbers (individual or grouped).","In one embodiment, the method further comprises generating an emulated input device signal for the alphanumeric representation, and wherein the outputting of data comprises outputting the emulated input device signal. This allows data to be input directly into a software application.","In one embodiment, the method further comprises determining a target computer device from among a plurality of computer devices, the outputting comprising transmitting the data to the target computer device. In one embodiment, the target computer device is determined based on an IP address contained in the signals. Thus, the call processor can route incoming signals to a respective computer device, such as a computer terminal of a call centre agent.","In one embodiment, the software application resides on a computer device at a location remote from the call processor, the method further comprising encrypting the data.","In one embodiment, the method further comprises preventing a display of the alphanumeric representation by the software application. Such prevention can include instructing the software application to output a masked alphanumeric representation or generating a blank over a data entry field, for example.","In one embodiment, at least the monitoring and the modifying are applied to the second version of the signals (that are to be output as audio), the method further comprising outputting the modified second version of the signals. In this way, audio to an agent, for example, can be masked.","In another aspect of the invention there is provided a call processor for processing signals of a telephonic communication, the signals conveying sensitive and non-sensitive information, the call processor comprising means configured to receive a first version of the signals that is to be recorded, wherein said first version of the signals is one of at least two versions of the signals that include a second version of the signals that is to be output as audio; means configured to monitor at least the first version of the signals to detect, in the at least the first version of the signals, one or more instances of one or more predetermined characteristics that represent the sensitive information conveyed by the signals; and means configured to modify the at least the first version of the signals by removing the identified predetermined characteristics from the at least the first version of the signals.","In one embodiment the call processor further comprises means configured to record said first version of the signals.","In one embodiment, the call processor further comprises means configured to buffer the at least the first version of the signals, and wherein the means configured to modify the at least the first version of the signals is configured to remove at least a portion of the buffered the at least the first version of the signals preceding a point of detection for each identified instance of the predetermined characteristics.","In one embodiment, the call processor further comprises means configured to determine an alphanumeric representation corresponding to each identified instance of the predetermined characteristics, and means configured to output data indicative of said alphanumeric representation for use by a software application.","In one embodiment, the call processor further comprises means configured to generate an emulated input device signal for the alphanumeric representation, and wherein the means configured to output data is configured to output the emulated input device signal. The output can be a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface or any other interface suitable for connecting to a personal computer.","In one embodiment, the call processor further comprises means configured to prevent a display of the alphanumeric representation by the software application.","In one embodiment, the call processor further comprises means configured to determine a target computer device from among a plurality of computer devices, said outputting comprising transmitting the data to said target computer device. In one embodiment, the target computer device is determined based on an IP address contained in the signals.","In one embodiment, the software application resides on a computer device at a location remote from the call processor, the call processor further comprising means configured to encrypt the data.","In one embodiment, the call processor further comprises means configured to output the modified second version of the signals.","In another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of processing signals of a telephonic communication, the signals conveying sensitive and non-sensitive information, the method comprising buffering the signals; monitoring the signals to detect, in the signals, one or more instances of one or more predetermined characteristics that represent the sensitive information conveyed by the signals; and modifying the buffered signals by removing the identified predetermined characteristics.","As described previously, buffering the signals allows the modification to compensate for the small time period associated with the detection of the predetermined characteristics. In this way the method can be implemented as a standalone method, for example at already existing recording devices such as a call recording server. Thus in one embodiment, modifying the buffered signals comprises removing at least a portion of the buffered signals preceding a point of detection for each identified instance of the predetermined characteristics.","In one embodiment, the method further comprises recording the modified signals.","In another aspect of the invention there is provided a call processor for processing signals of a telephonic communication, the signals conveying sensitive and non-sensitive information, the call processor comprising means configured to buffer the signals; means configured to monitor the signals to detect, in the signals, one or more instances of one or more predetermined characteristics that represent the sensitive information conveyed by the signals; and means configured to modify the buffered signals by removing the identified predetermined characteristics.","In one embodiment, the means configured to modify the buffered signals is configured to modify the buffered signals by removing at least a portion of the buffered signals preceding a point of detection for each identified instance of the predetermined characteristics.","In one embodiment, the call processor further comprises means configured to record the modified signals.","In another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of processing signals of a telephonic communication, the signals conveying sensitive and non-sensitive information, the method comprising processing the signals to provide a first version of the signals that is to be recorded and a second version of the signals from which information is to be extracted; at a first location: monitoring said first version of the signals to detect, in the first version of the signals, one or more instances of one or more predetermined characteristics that represent the sensitive information conveyed by the signals;

and at one or more second locations: monitoring said second version of the signals to detect, in the second version of the signals, one or more instances of one or more predetermined characteristics that represent the sensitive information conveyed by the signals; determining an alphanumeric representation corresponding to each identified instance of the predetermined characteristics; and outputting data indicative of said alphanumeric representation for use by a software application.","Thus this method facilitates recording at a first location and data extraction at a second location, for example at a central server and an agent station of a call centre, respectively.","In one embodiment, the method further comprises, at the first location, buffering the first version of the signals, and wherein modifying the first version of the signals comprises removing at least a portion of the buffered first version of the signals preceding a point of detection for each identified instance of the predetermined characteristics.","In one embodiment, the method further comprises recording the first version of the signals at the first location.","In one embodiment, the method further comprises, at the one or more second locations, preventing a display of said alphanumeric representation by the software application.","In one embodiment, the method further comprises, at the one or more second locations, modifying the second version of the signals by removing the identified predetermined characteristics from the second version of the signals, and outputting the second version of the signals for hearing.","In one embodiment, the method further comprises, at the one or more second locations, generating an emulated input device signal for said alphanumeric representation, and wherein the outputting of data comprises outputting the emulated input device signal.","In another aspect of the invention there is provided a call processor for processing signals of a telephonic communication, the signals conveying sensitive and non-sensitive information, the call processor comprising a first means at a first location comprising: receiving means configured to receive a first version of the signals;

In particular, the timing control signal can indicate a start time and a finish time for each tone, or start and finish times for a set of tones. In this way, detected DTMF tone signals that would otherwise be recorded by recording module  are masked by signal modification module .","It will be appreciated that the detection of predetermined patterns will usually take a finite amount of time. For example, the recognition of DTMF tones in digital audio can take about 10-20 ms. The buffer  is configured to temporarily store the audio signals, in order to allow the signal modification module  to modify a portion of the signal that precedes the detected start time of each tone, for example by masking the digital audio. Signal modification module  may also modify a portion of the signal following the detected finish time for each tone.","With reference to , which schematically shows the detection and masking of two DTMF tones , , the signal monitoring module  detects at time Tthat DTMF tone has started, and detects at time Tthat the tone has ended. As is evident a portion of the DTMF tone exists before the detected start time T. The signal modification module  may therefore apply a mask to include the portion of DTMF tone that precedes the detected start time based on the time signal T(i.e. from time T\u2212\u03b4t). To ensure that the entire DTMF tone is masked, the signal modification module  may also apply the mask to a period of time subsequent to the detected finish time Tof tone (i.e. T+\u03b4t). DTMF tones and may be of different duration. Likewise, the values for \u03b4tand \u03b4tmay also be of different duration. In an embodiment, signal modification (e.g. masking) is performed for the audio in its entirety, for example until all 16 digits of a credit card have been entered. Although in  two DTMF tones are shown, the general principle of signal modification such as masking characteristic information can be readily ascertained.","Thus the modification to the signal applied by the signal modification module renders the detected pattern unattainable from the recording. In an embodiment, the signal modification module  masks the digital audio signal by replacing it with an audible tone, e.g. at 1-2 kHz. In this way, according to one aspect of the invention, no part of the predetermined patterns detected by the signal monitoring module will appear in the masked digital audio sent for storage. This ensures that, for example, DTMF tones entered by a caller, or a security check process performed by the caller, are not passed to a recording module .","Referring again to , information established by the signal monitoring module  is also output to the signal interface module . The signal interface module  may determine an alphanumeric representation of the detected DTMF pattern. In this way, DTMF tones detected in the digital audio can be automatically communicated to a third-party application  and processed without the call centre staff member  needing to input any data into their computer terminal , thus removing the ability for the call centre staff member to note down the information for possible theft. Hence the secrecy of a caller's security details, credit card numbers, or other similar data, are preserved and not available for subsequent review in a recorded call made from the digital audio.","Furthermore, because the signal interface module  can be configured to determine and communicate the number of times a pattern or patterns have been detected, it is possible to confirm that, for example, all 16 digits of a credit card number have been received correctly as the customer types in his card details. If not all security information has been received, the third-party application  may prompt the call centre staff member to ask the caller to re-enter the security data. Thus, the signals communicated by the signal interface module  may provide confirmation that the security data has been correctly entered.","In this way, a customer's credit card transaction could be processed with minimal or no assistance from the call centre staff member and without the call centre staff member partaking in data entry.","The signals communicated by the signal interface module  to the third-party application  can be communicated via electronic communication, such as ActiveX communication, Internet Protocol communication, Application Programming Interface (API) communication, signals which mimic computer keystrokes, or any other electronic methods.","A data entry interface module  is configured to adapt the information, the method of its display within the third-party application  or the operation of the third-party application, such that the information is displayed within the third-party application in a suitable format, or that the third-party application operates in a desired manner. Where the third-party application is already configured to display the information in a suitable format, or operate in the desired manner, the data output by the data entry interface module  may be the same as the signals received from the signal interface module . In this way, the data entry processor need not change the signals or their method of display within the third-party application, or the operation of the third-party application, and can simply pass them directly to the third-party application .","In an embodiment, the data entry interface module  is configured to apply visual masking commands or methods. In this way, a customer's secure credit card information communicated through DTMF tones (for example), can not only be eliminated from digital audio and the alphanumeric representation of the DTMF tones passed to a third-party application, but the visual display of the third-party application can be controlled to make the alphanumeric representation of the DTMF information effectively obscured or invisible. In this way, not only does the customer's secure information become eliminated from the digital audio sent to storage, if any screen recording applications or processes are operational on the call centre staff member's computer, the screen recordings will not contain a recording of the customer's secure information either. In addition, the call centre staff member never sees the card details, and hence cannot steal them.","The management module  is configured to determine information about each call, such as the length of the call and the times at which signal modification was applied and for how long. It also allows this information to be associated with the customer and the third-party application.","In the embodiment shown in , call recording is performed locally at the computer terminal  of the agent  by call recording module . It is noted that there is no \u201coverwriting\u201d of recorded DTMF tones. Rather, DTMF tones are simply not recorded because of the buffering. The recordings can be passed to a server periodically or at the end of the call. Thus, calls can be constantly monitored and, where applicable, modified without the need to pause or switch between \u2018normal\u2019 and \u2018safe\u2019 modes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0131","num":"0130"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["402","404","406","408","408","406","410","412","414"]},"It is to be understood that the specific order of steps in the methods disclosed are examples of exemplary approaches, and that steps may be rearranged or omitted. For example, some embodiments do not implement buffering (step S) as shown in . Similarly, some embodiments do not perform recording (step S) or data extraction (step S).

Such means will be evident to a person skilled in the art. For example, incoming calls may be mapped to an agent's computer terminal by means of line identification. As another example, for a company with a VoIP compatible PBX and VoIP compatible call recording device, the packet headers of the VoIP packets containing audio information which is to be recorded may also include the IP address of the agent computer terminal  or phone  where the call is received by an agent. Thus, when the signal monitoring module  detects DTMF tones within the audio stream, the signal interface module  can additionally identify the relevant computer terminal's IP address, and this can then be used when routing signals representing DTMF tones.","It will be understood that references to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201can embodiment\u201d, \u201can example embodiment\u201d, etc., indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Similarly, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with one embodiment, it will be within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to effect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described. For example, it is possible to combine a first call processor for extracting data from DTMF tones, in accordance with the call processor shown in , with a second call processor configured to block DTMF tones for existing call recording devices, in accordance with the call processor shown in . The two call processors may operate in the same environment such as a call centre. Indeed, there may be more than one call processor of each \u201ctype\u201d, i.e. more than one call processor for extracting the DTMF tones and more than one call processor for blocking the DTMF tones. For convenience, these two types of call processor can be referred to as \u201cdecoder\u201d and \u201cfilter\u201d call processors. Although there is no communication between the decoder and filter call processors, they act jointly to block DTMF tones to an existing call recording device, and also extract data from the DTMF tones and send the extracted data directly to the agent's computer terminal, with the extracted data possibly prevented from being displayed to the agent. This enables a call centre to isolate its existing call recording system, existing screen recording system and also its agents from a customer's sensitive data, without having to make any changes to its existing computer systems in use at the agent's computer terminal, or its call or screen recording systems. As another example, the call processor  shown in  may include a signal modification module  as shown in .","Although in foregoing embodiments DTMF tones in digital audio signals are detected and masked, the signal data may comprise VoIP data packets. In the case of VoIP, DTMF \u201ctones\u201d are transmitted in specific packets (RFC 2833 RTP Event packets). In that case, the data corresponding to the voice packets can be recorded while the DTMF packets are discarded, i.e. packet filtering can be applied. However, at the transmitter there is a small delay for the DTMF tone to be recognised, prior to the transmitter sending an RFC 2833 RTP Event packet. Hence, in this case, buffering can be used to mask all DTMF information preceding the receipt of the RFC 2833 RTP Event packet.","Although in foregoing embodiments the predetermined patterns are described as comprising audio tones such as DTMF tones, other kinds of predetermined patterns can also be detected, for example voice signals that contain voice biometric information, information representing a spoken word or phrase, or spoken security information (such as a password, pass phrase, or other security information). Thus any of the aforementioned signal monitoring modules can be configured to establish the information with reference to external sources, e.g. a database of customer passwords, and using digital signal processing techniques such as speech recognition techniques. For voice recognition where only part of the password is to be provided by the caller (e.g. two random letters of a ten letter word), the detected voice patterns corresponding to the letters need only be masked for the recording module as the agent cannot construct the full password. Of course, for voice recognition where a full password is required, the output to the agent can be masked. Further still, at the point at which the password is to be spoken, the audio to the agent can be switched off.","As such, the signal monitoring module may make reference to an additional source in order to determine the nature of the signals communicated to an external source. In this manner, other functionality is possible (for example referring to a database containing customer passwords to ascertain whether a customer has passed a security check, or communicating with a credit card payment system to authorise a customer transaction).","Although the foregoing embodiments indicate that the signal interface module is configured to determine and communicate the number of times patterns have been detected, other variations are envisaged. For example, the signals communicated by the signal interface module can be configured to indicate the duration of the detected pattern and the proportion or length of the detected pattern which has been detected within a defined timeframe. In this way, it is possible for the third-party application to determine how much of the customer's security information has been received.","In an embodiment, the signal interface module provides confirmation that a security check has been passed. In this way, it is possible to confirm, via the third-party application, to the call centre staff member, that the caller has passed a security check, without the call centre staff member having to perform or assist the security check operation.","In foregoing embodiments the signal interface module is described as communicating signals representing one or more of an alphanumeric representation of the detected pattern, the number of times a pattern or patterns have been detected, the duration of the detected pattern, the proportion or length of the detected pattern which has been detected within a defined timeframe, confirmation that a security check has been passed, and confirmation that a transaction has been authorised. Alternatively, or in addition, other types of signals can also be communicated. These include signals representing the type of pattern which has been detected, meta-data relating to the detected pattern and the digital audio, the value of a hash function operating on the detected pattern, a uniquely-generated identifier representing the detected data, a true\/false value based on whether or not a predetermined pattern has been detected, a statistical probability that the predetermined pattern has been detected, a reference to a record within a database which is matched or probably matched by the detected or probably detected pattern, \u2018begin data\u2019 or \u2018end data\u2019 signals based on the detected pattern, a value or sequence of separate values based on the detected pattern, and no signal being communicated.","For example, based on the type of pattern which has been detected, it is possible for the third-party application to be made aware of whether (for example) the customer has generated a DTMF tone using his telephone keypad.","Meta-data relating to the detected pattern and the digital audio enables the third-party application to be made aware of (for example) the time the pattern was detected, the number of occurrences within the digital audio, and the duration of the pattern. This use also allows such data to be stored with or alongside the masked digital audio, for later searching or reporting. In this way, it is possible to easily find all recorded calls where DTMF tones have been masked, simply by searching through the associated meta-data for these calls.","The value of a hash function operating on the detected pattern, and the uniquely-generated identifier representing the detected data, enable the third-party applications to store representations of credit card numbers, without storing the actual credit card numbers themselves, and without the credit card number being stored in the call recording. This \u2018tokenisation\u2019 or \u2018hashing\u2019 is familiar to those skilled in the area of credit card security or cryptography, and acts to improve security. The \u2018token\u2019 or \u2018hash\u2019 values are unable to be used to make credit card transactions, but they are useful for reporting on customer data, determining where the same credit card has been used to make purchases at another time, and for other marketing or statistical analysis.","True\/false values based on whether or not a predetermined pattern has been detected, as well as signals representing a statistical probability that the predetermined pattern has been detected, allow third-party applications to determine the statistical \u2018confidence\u2019 that a customer has (for example) passed a security check.","Signals representing a reference to a record within a database which is matched or probably matched by the detected or probably detected pattern, allows a third-party application to be provided with (for example) the name of the customer who matches, or most likely matches, a security check just undertaken by a caller, but without the actual security information (such as a password) appearing in the associated call recording.","Signals representing \u2018begin data\u2019 or \u2018end data\u2019 based on the detected pattern allow a third-party application to (for example) be prepared to receive incoming card data, and to then stop receipt of data, based on the detection of particular DTMF alphanumeric characters. For example, if a customer entered his card details prefixed with a hash \u2018#\u2019 tone, the signal interface module would effectively alert the third-party application that card details were following. A star \u2018*\u2019 tone, for example, would end the receipt of card details by the third party application. Also in this manner, customers who make a mistake entering their card details can press hash \u2018#\u2019 to start again.","A value or sequence of separate values based on the detected pattern allows a third-party application to determine that it is receiving a signal from the call processor and not from another source. For example, in one embodiment, the call processor outputs signals to a computer terminal by means of a USB interface mimicking computer keystrokes. By communicating a sequence of separate values (for example a predetermined semi-random string which has a very low probability of ever being typed by a human), the third party application can determine accurately that it is receiving a signal directly from the call processor and not from a human typing into a keyboard.","Communicating no signal based on the detected pattern allows the call processor to (for example) automatically correct some errors which may be introduced by a customer typing in card details. For example, card details do not contain the hash \u2018#\u2019 character, so by not transmitting any signal when a customer types hash \u2018#\u2019 the third-party application is isolated from the error. This same process is useful in eliminating the transmission of special \u2018control\u2019 tone sequences (such as \u2018begin data\u2019 and \u2018end data\u2019 described above), which may be used primarily to communicate with the call processor but which are not intended for onward communication to a third-party application.","Furthermore, signals communicated by the signal interface module may be communicated as the pattern is detected. Thus as DTMF tones are detected, the alphanumeric representations of them can be passed directly to the third-party application with no delay. Further still, the signals communicated by the signal interface module may be buffered and then communicated at a later time. As such, the entire DTMF sequence can be detected, and then their alphanumeric representations communicated in one go to the third-party application. Yet further, the signals communicated by the signal interface module may be communicated on demand from another appropriately-authorised source. In this way, an appropriately-authorised third-party application could request from the signal interface module the number of DTMF tones which have been detected during the current call.","During communication with a third-party application, it is advantageous if the identity of the third-party application is established as being appropriately authorised to receive such communications. The authorisation credentials can be in the form of a security certificate or other similar certification device familiar to those skilled in the art of communications security.","The signals communicated by the signal interface module may be with the operating system of a data processing apparatus (a computer). The signals communicated by the signal interface may be with the operating system of a telephone or other portable communication device. The signals communicated by the signal interface may be communicated via an intermediate method (such as via text files, XML files, or Really Simple Syndication (RSS)). In these ways, many different third-party applications can be communicated with via the signal interface, according to communications format standards familiar to those skilled in the art.","The signals communicated by the signal interface may represent \u201cplain text\u201d unencrypted communications. They may also represent encrypted communications, using data encryption techniques familiar to those skilled in the art. In these ways, both \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018closed\u2019 (or secure) communications are possible with third-party applications.","Although in foregoing embodiments a mask applied by the signal modification module replaces the detected pattern with an audio tone of a single pitch, the modification could alternatively comprise random audio tones, or a white noise signal. Additionally, the modification applied by the signal modification module may act to remove or obscure part of the detected pattern, whereby the initial data signals which represent audio are unable to be determined in their entirety from the masked digital audio. In these ways, the detected signal is variously obscured in the digital audio, but the digital audio will still contain audible \u2018placeholders\u2019 to signify that a pattern was detected.","The modification applied by the signal modification module may act to encrypt the detected pattern. In this way, according to one aspect of the invention, a customer's personal security data can be encrypted (preferably with an encryption algorithm familiar to those skilled in the art) for later decryption by an appropriately-authorised application or person. In this manner, people or applications without the appropriate authorisation to decrypt the pattern will be unable to determine its nature.","The modification applied by the signal modification module may act on one of the stereo channels of the digital audio signals, if the digital audio signals are in stereo. In this way, according to one aspect of the invention, a customer's credit card details sent through DTMF can be eliminated from the digital audio, but any conversation or other audio signals in the digital audio being spoken by, for example, a call centre staff member, are unaffected. Additionally, the modification applied by the signal modification module may act on both of the stereo channels of the digital audio signals, if the digital audio signals are in stereo.","The signal-related data output by the data entry processor may represent a placeholder (such as the alphanumeric character \u2018*\u2019). In this way, a customer's data may be represented on the call centre staff member's computer as a series of asterisks, \u2018X\u2019 marks, or similar, to obscure the sensitive information, while still fulfilling the requirement of the call centre staff member's computer applications that relevant data should be entered into the application.","Further, the placeholder may be a random alphanumeric character. It may further be in the same format of information expected to be received by the third-party application. In this way, the call centre staff member's computer application may be satisfied as to the format, composition, length or other attributes of any data entry requirements.","Additionally, the placeholder may be deliberately not in the same format of information expected to be received by the third-party application. In this way, a third-party application may be provided with information which it interprets as deliberately wrong, in order to trigger a subsequent request of further data.","The signals received from the signal interface may be modified to conform to the format expected to be received by the third-party application, prior to the output of signal-related data to the third-party application. In this way, for example, card details may be encrypted to ensure further security.","Although in foregoing embodiments the call processor is configured to prevent the alphanumeric representations from being displayed by the software application and\/or entered by the emulated input device signal as data into a data entry field, other interactions or commands are also contemplated.","The interactions or commands may act to determine that signals about to be communicated with a third-party application are to be displayed in the expected data entry location of the expected third-party application. For example, the command or method may be configured to determine the current \u2018window title\u2019 and the current data entry field title of a third-party application, and deny signal communication to unexpected locations. In this way, agents can be prevented, for example, from seeing sensitive card details in a separate location from where they can be stolen.","The interactions or commands may act so that the display of alphanumeric representation within the third-party application is made automatically to only an expected data entry location. For example, the command or method can include locating a data entry field with a particular property or characteristic (for example one which has a text label \u2018CV2\u2019 on its left) and then passing the CV2 element of the card data only to this field. In this way, card data is forced into its intended location, and cannot therefore be stolen by agents from other locations.","The interactions with the third-party application or commands output to the third-party application may act to restrict, inhibit or deny manual data entry in the third-party application. For example, the call centre staff member would be denied the ability to enter, correct, overwrite or (critically) copy the customer's sensitive data from their computer screen.","The interactions with the third-party application or commands output to the third-party application may act to alter the visual display of the third-party application. They may also act to change the third-party application's display to show placeholder information (such as the alphanumeric character \u201c*\u201d). In this way, even though a call centre staff member's computer application may be preconfigured to display sensitive information on the computer screen, the display can be altered through the use of visual masking commands or methods to obscure the data with asterisks, or \u2018X\u2019 marks or similar.","The interactions with the third-party application or commands output to the third-party application may act to remove existing restrictions on the format of manual data entry within the third-party application. Thus data passed directly to the third-party application may be of a different format than that allowed for by manual data entry.","The interactions with the third-party application or commands output to the third-party application may act to hide or otherwise obscure portions of the third-party application. Accordingly, the customer's secure data can be hidden from the call centre staff member's computer screen, to eliminate the ability of the staff member to note the information.","The interactions with the third-party application or commands output to the third-party application may act to modify the operation of the third-party application. It may further act to insert a \u2018callback\u2019 process (which acts to allow the third-party application to provide signals back to the data entry processor, or to request transmission of signal-related data from the data entry processor). For example, a third-party application can request the customer's sensitive credit card data to be communicated at the point the call centre staff member attempts to authorise the credit card data, thus avoiding display or communication of the credit card information to the call centre staff member's computer screen in advance.","The interactions with the third-party application or commands output to the third-party application may act to modify the document object model of a web page displayed in a web browser. For example, a web page can be altered to change a specified credit card entry field into a \u2018display as asterisks\u2019 field, thus obscuring the card details with asterisk \u2018*\u2019 characters or similar, and further restricting the agent's ability to copy card data from that field.","The interactions with the third-party application or commands output to the third-party application may act to detect changes in third-party applications, prior to communicating signals to the third-party application. For example, a command or method may be configured to detect the activation of a \u2018submit\u2019 function on the call centre staff member's computer screen, and communicate the card details at the point the submit function is activated. In this way, for example, an agent never sees card data on screen.","The interactions with the third-party application or commands output to the third-party application may act to decrypt information already encrypted elsewhere. In this way, for example, data can be placed in plain sight but in an encrypted form on a call centre agent's computer screen, and then be decrypted immediately prior to processing.","The interactions with the third-party application or commands output to the third-party application may act to issue commands recognised by the third-party application. Further, these commands or methods may mimic manual commands which may be performed by an operator of the third-party application. If, for example, a customer is confirming credit card details for a transaction using DTMF tones, the third-party application may be commanded to process the transaction (for example by mimicking the activation of a \u2018submit\u2019 function on the call centre staff member's computer screen) once the correct number of credit card digits has been received.","The interactions with the third-party application or commands may further act to gather information from a third-party application and combine it with data from the signal interface module prior to issuing commands recognised by the third-party application. For example, if a call centre agent is taking transaction details from a customer and entering them into a payments website, the customer's name, address and transaction price details can be gathered from where they have already been entered into the website by the call centre agent, combined with the customer's card details transmitted through DTMF tones, and then an HTTP \u2018post\u2019 command executed using visual masking commands or methods, to transmit all details for payment authorisation. In this way, the call centre agent never sees the card details on screen.","The interactions with the third-party application or commands output to the third-party application may act to reverse or undo the effect of any interactions with the third-party application or commands previously issued to the third-party application. Accordingly any changes which have been made to the third-party application's performance or appearance can be reversed, after (for example) a transaction has been processed.","The interactions or commands may include Application Programming Interface (API) communication with a third-party application, altering a web page's HTML content or document object model, macros or scripts, or any similar or related communication required to interact with the third-party application.","The signal-related data may be sent to the third-party application alphanumeric character-by-character, as the pattern is detected by the audio processor. In this way a customer's credit card details represented in DTMF tones may be sent one character at a time to the third-party application. Alternatively, the signal-related data may be sent to the third-party application in one or more blocks. For example, a customer's credit card details may be accumulated as they are received, and then communicated in one block to the third-party application.","The signal-related data may be sent to the third-party application at different times based on the mode or status of the third-party application. Thus placeholder characters may be communicated to the third-party application until a point later in the transaction, when the real customer sensitive data is communicated. This would ensure that customer sensitive data did not appear on a call centre staff member's computer screen until the moment at which a transaction was to be authorised, for example.","The signal-related data may be sent to the third-party application on receipt of an appropriate request by the third-party application. In this way an appropriately-authorised third-party application could request from the data entry processor (for example), that the customer's credit card details be communicated at the point the credit card was to be authorised, thus ensuring that the customer's credit card details did not appear on the call centre staff member's computer screen at all prior to that event.","The interactions with the third-party application or commands output to the third-party application may be sent to the third-party application at the same time as the signal-related data. They may also be sent to the third-party application at any time before the signal-related data. They may also be sent to the third-party application at any time after the signal-related data.","The third-party application may comprise a computer operating system. It may also comprise a telecommunications device. Further the telecommunications device may be a mobile phone. Thus common telecommunications devices and computers used in a call centre environment or in an environment where transactions are performed with customer sensitive data, can have customer sensitive data eliminated from their visual displays.","The third-party application may be a web page being displayed within a computer operating system. It may also be an application running within a computer operating system. The third-party application may be a web page being displayed on a telecommunications device, including a mobile phone. It may also be an application running within a telecommunications device, including a mobile phone. It may also be a database or other data storage medium. Thus commonly-used data entry interfaces (such as computer applications or websites) can have customer sensitive data eliminated from their visual displays, and customer-sensitive data can also be communicated directly into a database, without appearing on a call centre staff member's computer screen.","While the described methods and apparatus can provide particular advantages to call centre operations, they are also applicable to other communication technologies that implement call recording of one form or another. In this regard, although in foregoing embodiments the processing of signals is described as being performed for \u2018incoming\u2019 signals, the processing of signals can also be performed for \u2018outgoing\u2019 signals, e.g. at the call originator side.","Although the present invention has been described hereinabove with reference to specific embodiments, it will be apparent to a skilled person in the art that modifications lie within the spirit and scope of the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS","p":["Further aspects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent to the reader of the following description of specific embodiments of the invention, provided by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0098"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0099"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0102"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0103"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0104"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0106","num":"0105"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0106"},"figref":"FIG. 14"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
