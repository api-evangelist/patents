Using content syndication formats such as Really Simple Syndication (RSS), content providers can include content and\/or links to such content in a content feed. Users may subscribe to these content feeds using an application known as a feed reader, content feed reader, feed aggregator or content feed aggregator. When the content feed is updated with new content items, the new content items are reflected in the user's reader.","A method quantifies unread content items for a stream subscribed to by a user. The stream includes a time-ordered list of content items from two or more content feeds. Each content feed includes a set of content items published by a respective publication source. The method includes determining a count of content items having an unread status in accordance with read state information stored for the user with respect to the stream, and transmitting the count to a client system for display.","A system quantifies unread content items in a stream subscribed to by a user. The stream includes a time-ordered list of content items from two or more content feeds. Each content feed includes a set of content items published by a respective publication source. The system includes memory, one or more processors, and one or more programs stored in the memory and configured for execution by the one or more processors. The one or more programs include: instructions for determining a count of content items having an unread status in accordance with read state information stored for the user with respect to the stream; and instructions for transmitting the count to a client system for display.","A computer program product is used to quantify unread content items in a stream subscribed to by a user. The stream includes a time-ordered list of content items from two or more content feeds. Each content feed includes a set of content items published by a respective publication source. The computer program product includes a computer readable storage medium and a computer program mechanism embedded therein. The computer program mechanism includes: instructions for determining a count of content items having an unread status in accordance with read state information stored for the user with respect to the stream; and instructions for transmitting the count to a client system for display.","A system quantifies unread content items in a stream subscribed to by a user. The stream includes a time-ordered list of content items from two or more content feeds. Each content feed includes a set of content items published by a respective publication source. The system includes: means for determining a count of content items having an unread status in accordance with read state information stored for the user with respect to the stream; and means for transmitting the count to a client system for display.","Like reference numerals refer to corresponding parts throughout the drawings.","In a content feed aggregation system, a user may subscribe to one or more content feeds and be presented with the content items included in those content feeds. The content items may be presented to the user in an ordered list, such that the format of each item in the list is uniform. However, the user may desire to view additional information about content items beyond that provided by a uniform list. The disclosed embodiments provide the user with ways to view additional information about various items. For example, in one mode of operation, when a user selects a first content item, the selected item is displayed in an expanded format, and other items are displayed in a compact format. When the user subsequently selects a second content item, the second item is displayed in the expanded format and the first item is displayed in the compact format. In another example, unread items are displayed in a visually distinctive format from items that have been read or marked as read, thus providing the user with information about the read status of various items. In some embodiments, a count of unread items in a content feed is displayed.","Content feeds are also herein called feed streams. The feed items from a content feed source can be considered to be a stream of items. Furthermore, some embodiments of the content feed aggregation and distribution system described herein allow users to define virtual streams that incorporate content items from content feeds and\/or other virtual streams. Thus, in these embodiments, the term \u201cfeed streams,\u201d or simply \u201cstreams,\u201d also encompasses virtual streams defined by the users of the content feed aggregation and distribution system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","104","104","102","120","106","106"]},"The server system  accesses content feeds from the feed sources . The server system  includes a server  and a database . Server  serves as a front-end for the server system . Server , sometimes called a front end server, retrieves the content feeds from the feed sources , and also provides an interface between the server system  and the client systems . In some embodiments, the functions of server  may be divided or allocated among two or more servers.","The server system  stores content items in the content feeds in the database . In some embodiments, the database  stores both metadata (e.g., title, description, URL, date\/time, and possibly other metadata) and the content of each content item. However, in some other embodiments, the database  stores the metadata but not the content for each content item. The database  also stores user feed information  for a plurality of users. The user feed information for a particular user identifies content feed subscriptions, as well as sources, filters, and read states for that particular user. That is, user feed information associated with a user identifies the content feeds to which the user has subscribed, any filters the user has defined for the feeds, any labels the user has associated with individual feed items, and whether feed items have been marked as \u201cread\u201d by the user. User feed information associated with a user also may identify whether the user has marked an entire feed as \u201cread,\u201d such that all items in the feed with timestamps dated prior to a specified time are marked as \u201cread.\u201d","It should be appreciated that the server system , including the server  and the database , may be implemented as a distributed system of multiple computers. However, for convenience of explanation, the server system  is described below as being implemented on a single computer, which can be considered a single logical system.","A content feed (or channel) is a resource or service that provides a list of content items that are present, recently added, or recently updated at a feed source . A content item in a content feed may include the content associated with the item itself (the actual content that the content item specifies), a title (sometimes called a headline), and\/or a description of the content, a network location or locator (e.g., URL) of the content, or any combination thereof. For example, if the content item identifies a text article, the content item may include the article itself inline, along with the title (or headline), and locator. Alternatively, a content item may include the title, description and locator, but not the article content. Thus, some content items may include the content associated with those items, while others contain links to the associated content but not the full content of the items. A content item may also include additional metadata that provides additional information about the content. The full version of the content may be any machine-readable data, including but not limited to web pages, images, digital audio, digital video, Portable Document Format (PDF) documents, and so forth.","In some embodiments, a content feed is specified using a content syndication format, such as RSS. RSS is an acronym that stands for \u201crich site summary,\u201d \u201cRDF site summary,\u201d or \u201cReally Simple Syndication.\u201d \u201cRSS\u201d may refer to any of a family of formats based on the Extensible Markup Language (XML) for specifying a content feed and content items included in the feed. In some other embodiments, other content syndication formats, such as the Atom syndication format or the VCALENDAR calendar format, may be used to specify content feeds.","Further information regarding the RSS syndication format known as \u201cReally Simple Syndication\u201d is disclosed in the 2.0 by D. Winer, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. M. Nottingham et al. disclose further information regarding the Atom syndication format in , which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","A user interfaces with the server system  and views content items at a client system or device  (hereinafter called the client system for ease of reference). The client system  includes a computer  or computer controlled device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), cellular telephone or the like. The computer  typically includes one or more processors (not shown); memory, which may include volatile memory (not shown) and non-volatile memory such as a hard disk drive ; and a display . The computer  may also have input devices such as a keyboard and a mouse (not shown).","In some embodiments, a user may interact with the server system  via a feed reader user interface  that may be presented on the display . The user may create a list of feed subscriptions via the feed reader user interface . In some embodiments, using the feed reader user interface , the user may also create filters or labels to be applied to content feeds and\/or content items, and modify the read states of content feeds and\/or content items. The feed reader user interface transmits a list of content feed subscriptions, or modifications to a list of content feed subscriptions, to the server system  for storage at the database . The feed reader user interface  presents content items stored at the database  to the user based on the user's list of content feed subscriptions. That is, feed reader user interface  presents to the user content items specified in the content feeds to which the user has subscribed. A user may view the full version of the content of a content item in the feed reader user interface  by selecting it (e.g., by clicking on it with a mouse pointer). In some embodiments, a copy of the user's list of content feed subscriptions and copies of the presented content items may be cached locally at the client system .","In some embodiments, the feed reader user interface  may be a web-based user interface. That is, the feed reader user interface  includes one or more web pages. It is noted that a single web page can contain multiple frames, each of which may appear (when displayed by a browser application) to be a distinct web page. The web page(s) may be written in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), or any other suitable language for preparing web pages, and may include one or more scripts for interfacing with the server system . For example, the web page(s) may include a Javascript application that interfaces with the server system  via an application programming interface (API). The Javascript application receives content items from the server system , manages the rendering of those content items at the client, and also performs the client-side aspects of other tasks, such as marking items or feed streams as read, adding and removing content feed subscriptions, labeling content feed subscriptions and\/or individually selected content items, selecting or revising user preferences, and the like. The user may subscribe to content feeds, view content items, and otherwise interact with the server system  by interacting with the web page(s) of the feed reader user interface . In other words, the server system , including the feed reader user interface , provides a web-based content aggregation service. The server system  aggregates and stores content items in accordance with the user's content feed subscriptions. In some embodiments, the server system  can also apply filters or labels, change the read states of content items or feed streams in accordance with user actions or instructions, and calculate the number of content items in a feed stream with read states indicating that the items have not been read. When the user accesses the feed reader user interface , the content items are presented to the user via the feed reader user interface .","In some other embodiments, the feed reader user interface  may be a part of a standalone application that is run on the client system . The standalone application may interface with the server system  via an application programming interface (API).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 3B"],"b":["200","200","104","116","116","202","204"]},"A user may select a next item (second item), for example by scrolling down the list, or may select another item (second item), for example by clicking on it.

For example, determining the count of content items with an unread status may include fetching all content items in each content feed that constitutes the stream, up to the first predefined depth limit or the first predefined age limit, whichever is reached first. In some embodiments, the first predefined depth limit and the first predefined age limit are applied to each content feed individually. In some other embodiments, the first predefined depth limit and the first predefined age limit are applied to the entire stream, instead of being applied to each constituent content feed individually.","In an example, as illustrated in , a stream  includes first  and second  constituent content feeds. The first predefined age limit  is 30 days and the first predefined depth limit  is  content items. For the first constituent content feed , the first predefined depth limit  is reached prior to the first predefined age limit : item  has a timestamp less than 30 days old. Therefore, items one through  are fetched from the first constituent content feed . For the second constituent content feed , the first predefined age limit  is reached prior to the first predefined depth limit : item  has a timestamp that is 30 days old, and item  has a timestamp greater than 30 days old. Therefore, items one through  are fetched from the second constituent content feed . A total of 4963 items are fetched from the two constituent content feeds  and . It remains to be determined how many of the 4963 fetched items are unread.","In some embodiments, the count excludes items in the time-ordered list in accordance with a subscription timestamp that corresponds to a time of subscription by the user to the stream (). For example, when fetching content items in a respective content feed in the stream, no content items are fetched with timestamps earlier than a subscription timestamp associated with the user, regardless of the first predetermined age and depth limits. The unread count thus will not include items that predate the user's subscription to the stream. In another example, a small, predefined number of content items are fetched that have timestamps earlier than a subscription timestamp associated with the user. For example, the 10 items with timestamps dated immediately prior to the subscription timestamp are fetched.","In an example, as illustrated in , a user subscribed to a stream  that includes first  and second  constituent content feeds, at a time corresponding to a recorded subscription timestamp . In this example, item  in the first constituent content feed  and item  in the second constituent content feed  are the last items in their respective content feeds to have timestamps later than or equal to the subscription timestamp , and thus are the last items fetched from their respective content feeds. A total of 2306 items are fetched from the two constituent content feeds  and . It remains to be determined how many of the 2306 fetched items are unread.","In other examples, a respective content feed in the stream may have a distinct subscription timestamp corresponding to when the respective content feed was added to the stream. In quantifying unread content items from the respective content feed, no content items with timestamps earlier than the subscription timestamp are fetched.","In some embodiments, the count excludes items in the time-ordered list in accordance with a timestamp indicating user execution of a mark-all-read command associated with the stream (). For example, when fetching content items in each constituent content feed, no content items are fetched with timestamps earlier than a recorded time of execution of a mark-all-read command. In some embodiments, a mark-all-read command is executed by selecting an icon  (). The unread count thus will not include items that predate execution of the mark-all-read command.","In an example, as illustrated in , a mark-all-read command was executed for a stream  that includes first  and second  constituent content feeds, at a time corresponding to a recorded mark-all-read timestamp . In this example, item  in the first constituent content feed  and item  in the second constituent content feed  are the last items in their respective content feeds to have timestamps later than or equal to the mark-all-read timestamp , and thus are the last items fetched from their respective content feeds. A total of 877 items are fetched from the two constituent content feeds  and . It remains to be determined how many of the 877 fetched items are unread.","In some embodiments, the count excludes items in the time-ordered list in accordance with a timestamp indicating user execution of a mark-all-read command associated with a constituent stream of the stream (). Thus, if a user subscribed directly to a particular stream, and also subscribed to second stream (e.g., a virtual stream) that included the particular content stream, then execution of a mark-all-read command associated directly with the particular stream would cause items from the particular stream to appear in both subscriptions to have been read.","In some embodiments, the count excludes items in the time-ordered list in accordance with a second predefined age limit and a second predefined depth limit as applied to a time-ordered read list identifying items in the stream for which a stored read status indicates that the items have been read (). Items on the time-ordered read list are filtered from the items that were fetched from the stream's constituent content feeds, to determine the unread count. The time-ordered read list is sometimes referred to as a user's read stream or exclude stream.","The exclude stream may be created by fetching content items in the stream with a status indicating that they have been read, up to the second predefined age limit or the second predefined depth limit, whichever is reached first. To determine the count of unread items, these items are filtered out from the content items that were fetched from the stream's constituent content feeds in accordance with the first predefined depth limit, the first predefined age limit, the subscription timestamp, and\/or the mark-all-read timestamp.","In an example, the second predefined age limit is 30 days and the second predefined depth limit is 10,000 content items.  illustrate respective streams  and  that include respective time-ordered lists of content items from two or more content feeds. The content items from the constituent content feeds of each stream  and  have been combined into a single time-ordered list, as shown respectively in . Each item has a read status  indicating whether the item is read or unread. In the example of , read items in the stream  are fetched up to the second age limit , which is reached prior to the second depth limit . Item , which is the 3487th read item in the stream , has a timestamp that is 30 days old, and thus is the last item  fetched into the exclude stream of the stream . Items fetched into the exclude stream are shown in bold. In the example of , read items in the stream  are fetched up to the second depth limit , which is reached prior to the second age limit . Item ,, which is the 10,000th read item in the stream , is the last item  fetched into the exclude stream of the stream . Again, items fetched into the exclude stream are shown in bold.","In some embodiments, the count excludes items in the time-ordered list that have timestamps earlier than a timestamp of a last item, determined in accordance with the second predefined age limit and the second predefined depth limit, having a read status indicating that the item has been read (). For example, the last item is the item in the user's read stream (i.e., exclude stream) having either a depth equal to the second predefined depth limit (e.g., last item , ) or a timestamp corresponding to the second predefined age limit (e.g., last item , ), whichever is reached first. Content items having timestamps earlier than the timestamp of the last item are filtered out, for example in a manner similar to filtering out items in the exclude stream.","The count is transmitted to a client system (e.g., client system ) for display ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":["FIG. 7B","FIG. 4A"],"b":["750","750","700","305"]},"As in method , a stream subscribed to by a user is specified () and a count of content items that have an unread status is determined () in accordance with read state information stored for the user with respect to the stream.","In some embodiments, the count excludes items in the time-ordered list in accordance with a second age limit that is applicable if a time-ordered read list, identifying content items in the stream for which a stored read status indicates that the items have been read (i.e., the stream's exclude stream), has a depth greater than or equal to a second predefined depth limit (). In some embodiments, the second age limit corresponds to a timestamp of a content item in the stream corresponding to an item having a depth in the time-ordered read list equal to the second predefined depth limit (). For example, if the second predefined depth limit is equal to 10,000 for the stream  shown in , then the second age limit would correspond to a timestamp associated with item ,.

If the set of user labeled items is made available for subscription by others, the user-labeled items become a virtual stream that is assigned a stream identifier, such as \u201cuser:best\u201d. This virtual stream is assigned a column in the user subscription table  and subscription and user labeling information for the virtual stream is stored in this column.","Check marks in column  associated with stream  indicate which other users have subscribed to stream .
