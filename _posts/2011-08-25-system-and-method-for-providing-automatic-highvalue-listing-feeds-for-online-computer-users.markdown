{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","TECHINICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This non-provisional patent application is related to the U.S. Non-Provisional patent application Ser. No. 13\/237,726, filed on Sep. 20, 2011, entitled, \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR LINKING KEYWORDS WITH USER PROFILING AND ITEM CATEGORIES\u201d, and assigned to the same assignee as the present patent application.","This application relates to a method and system for use with an electronic commerce system, according to one embodiment, and more specifically, for providing automatic high-value listing feeds for online computer users.","On-line commerce sites on a wide-area public network (e.g., the Internet) often share information regarding products or services for sale and purchasers who seek to purchase the offered products or services. For example, search engines (e.g. Google) will pull content from on-line commerce sites, advertising sites, and\/or content sites that may have product\/service information, listings, or advertising related to search terms entered by a user of the search engine. As a result, the search engines can receive content feeds from a variety of content sources. Depending on the number of users and the search terms entered by users of the search engine, these content feeds can produce an extremely large amount of data. It is often necessary for the amount of data transferred by these content feeds to be limited by the search engine, the content source, or the nodes in the network infrastructure. However, the content feeds are typically limited in an arbitrary manner. As a result, the best product\/service information, listings, or advertising related to search terms entered by a user may be lost.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments. It will be evident, however, to one of ordinary skill in the art that the various embodiments may be practiced without these specific details.","In one embodiment, a system and method for providing automatic high-value listing feeds for online computer users is disclosed. In various example embodiments, a feed distribution network aims to simplify, facilitate, and improve the efficiency of the transfer of product\/service information, listings, or advertising from a host site, such as a feed distribution network site, an on-line commerce site, an auction site, a publisher site, a merchant site, or other product\/service or broker site. A particular embodiment can use an application programming interface (API) that can make use of host site search and other API's to provide search results to e-commerce users in a more valuable listing and format. Search results and can be customized according to keyword data, historical user conversion data, user profile information associated with one or more consumers, and information related to particular products, listings, and\/or advertisements.","In a particular example embodiment, the host can generate content feeds (also denoted traffic) and send traffic to publishers or affiliates, such as Google. The quantity of traffic can be high-volume, so it is beneficial to only send the most high-value feeds as possible. High-value feeds are those that have a high probability of conversion. Conversion is an act of a consumer that indicates interest in a particular item. The high-value feeds can be identified by mapping keywords to listings included in the feeds. High value keywords found in listings included in the feeds is indicative of a high-value feed. High-value keywords are those that have a high probability of conversion based on historical data. A keyword matching process can be used to match the keywords to listings and produce a high-value feed: 1) map each keyword to a listing set, 2) order each listing set by a quality score, 3) restrict or truncate the ordered listing set at a boundary n, where n is determined based on a weighted value of keywords, 4) de-dupe feeds having the same listing in multiple feeds so a listing is only in one feed, and 5) send the high-value feeds, wherein each feed includes listings and a quality score for each listing.","In a particular example embodiment, a central data repository or database  can use well-known screen-scraping techniques and application programming interfaces (API's) to collect product or item data from source sites, such as publisher sites and merchant sites. The feed distribution network can analyze this collected data to create a high-value set of item listings for delivery to the publisher sites. The high-value set of item listings enables merchants to bid for item placement on the publisher site. The appropriate combinations of content of the item listings can be exposed to a particular consumer based on the site being used to view the item listing and the bids placed by corresponding merchants.","Applications for the described system and method include cataloging systems, merchandising systems, and search systems, among other applications. Conventional systems and methods don't pro-actively and automatically gather and produce high-value feeds to enable merchants to obtain a desired ad placement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100"]},"Returning to , a data exchange platform, in an example form of a network-based provider (or host system\/site) , provides server-side functionality, via a network  (e.g., the Internet) to one or more clients. The one or more clients may include users that may utilize the network system  and more specifically, the network-based provider , to exchange data over the network . These transactions may include transmitting, receiving (communicating) and processing data to and from the multitude of users. The data may include, but is not limited to, user preference information, user profile information, ad search queries, search keywords, shopping or listing context information and\/or identifiers, context data, notations (e.g., personal and public shopping notes), context filter data, shared electronic shopping carts, product and service reviews, product, service, manufacture, and vendor recommendations and identifiers, product and service listings associated with buyers and sellers, auction bids, feedback, etc. In one embodiment, the user profile information can be associated with one or more contexts generated by a user or other users and maintained on the network-based provider . Data associated with a user profile, such as any of the data described above, may be publicly shared as determined by the originator of the data.","Turning specifically to the network-based marketplace , an application program interface (API) server  and a web server  are coupled to, and provide programmatic and web interfaces respectively to, one or more application servers . The application servers  host one or more networking application(s)  and marketplace application(s) . The application servers  are, in turn, shown to be coupled to one or more databases servers  that facilitate access to one or more databases .","In one embodiment, the web server  may send and receive data pertaining to a user profile or item listing via a toolbar installed on a browser application. The toolbar may allow for a user or a third party to, inter alia, create a new user profile (a profile creator), selectively add a uniform resource locator (URL) associated with the created user profile, and create notations regarding research and general matters associated with the user profile. In other embodiments, the web server may serve a page or the API server  in conjunction with the client application  may provide the same or similar functionality as that described with reference to the toolbar. It may be noted that using a toolbar within an application such as a browser or stand alone application is well known in the art.","The marketplace application(s)  may provide a number of marketplace functions and services (e.g., item listings, searching, advertisement, payment, etc.) to users that access the network-based marketplace . The networking application(s)  likewise may provide a number of consumer services, merchant services, or social networking services and functions to users. The networking application(s)  may allow a user to generate one or more contexts related to shopping or advertisement (ad) generation, which may include listings (e.g., for products and services) couched as a broad category associated with a consumer, a class of consumers, and\/or an item a product or service or a listing for a product or service) or class of items. Additionally, listings can be couched as associated with a specific consumer or a specific item. For example, listings in the form of a category could be, \u201cdigital cameras\u201d or \u201cplumbers.\u201d Similarly, a context can include a user profile associated with a category of users or a specific user. For example, a user profile in the form of a category could be, \u201cwomen over 40 years old\u201d or \u201cpurchasers of digital cameras,\u201d An example of a user profile in a more specific form may be, \u201ca user profile for John A. Smith of Akron, Ohio\u201d or \u201cpurchasers of Canon digital cameras,\u201d The level of specificity may vary and is selectable by the user profile creator or administrator of the feed distribution engine of a particular embodiment. For example, the user profile can be as specific as a particular person or the associated listing associated with a make, model, additional specific attributes or features of a specific item or service offered for sale or lease.","In one embodiment, the networking application(s)  and marketplace application(s)  may provide a client (e.g., web client ) with an interface that includes input fields for personality or item\/listing attributes most commonly selected by other users as the most important or most determinative attributes related to the products\/services which a user\/consumer is seeking or selling. For example, a multitude of users may have indicated they thought the most important personality attributes for the user profile include information related to: 1) consumer\/user need, 2) general consumer\/user personality, 3) consumer\/user shopping attitude, and 4) consumer\/user budget. A multitude of other users may have indicated they thought the most important item attributes for a digital camera purchaser user profile include: 1) digital camera brand, 2) pixel count, 3) zoom, and 4) size. These user profile attributes may be independently developed or discovered by the network-based marketplace  by processing the attribute data received from the multitude of users or may be based on the user profile creator ranking the attributes or a combination thereof.","The networking application(s)  may allow the user profile creator or feed distribution engine user to distribute the one or more user profiles to one or more groups defined by the user profile creator or feed distribution engine user (e.g., \u201cmy family,\u201d \u201cmy friends,\u201d etc.) or to groups at various levels in a predefined category (e.g., \u201cphotography group,\u201d \u201cdigital camera group,\u201d or \u201cCanon digital camera group,\u201d etc.).","While the networking application(s)  and the marketplace application(s)  are shown in  to form part of the network-based marketplace , it will be appreciated that, in alternative embodiments, the networking application(s)  may form part of a social networking service that is separate and distinct from the network-based marketplace .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["138","140","112","124","138","112","112"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["130","132","112","112","112","130","132"]},"To this end, the network and marketplace application(s)  and , respectively, are shown to include one or more application(s) which support the network-based marketplace , and more specifically the generation and maintenance of one or more user profiles provided by users of the network-based marketplace  or feed distribution engine users. These applications can include support for activities associated with the user profiles and listing information, including storing and retrieving user notes, web sites (URLs), links associated with related tags, research and notes from other users and community members, related community groups, vendors, providing localized geographic data for user profiles (e.g., regional or country-specific consumer purchasing patterns), etc. Additionally, the various applications may support social networking functions, including building and maintaining the community groups created by a user, which may be helpful in providing various types of data (e.g., reviews, notes, local services, consumer information, etc.) pertaining to the user profiles and listing information.","Store application(s)  may allow sellers to group their listings (e.g., goods and\/or services) within a \u201cvirtual\u201d store, which may be branded and otherwise personalized by and for the sellers. Such a virtual store may also offer promotions, incentives and features that are specific and personalized to a relevant seller and consumer. In one embodiment, based on the user profiles provided by the user profile creator, the virtual store may be provided to the user profile creator or feed distribution engine user where the virtual store may carry or sell an item or service related to a user's need based on the user profile.","Reputation application(s)  may allow parties that transact utilizing the network-based marketplace  to establish, build, and maintain reputations, which may be made available and published to potential trading partners. Consider that where, for example, the network-based marketplace  supports person-to-person trading, users may have no history or other reference information whereby the trustworthiness and\/or credibility of potential trading partners may be assessed. The reputation application(s)  may allow a user, for example through feedback provided by other transaction partners, to establish a reputation within the network-based marketplace  over time. Other potential trading partners may then reference such a reputation for the purposes of assessing credibility, trustworthiness, or the like. A user creating a user profile and seeking reviews, research (e.g., notes, etc.), and recommendations associated with the profile may filter the result data from the search or context submission based on reputation data. For example, the user profile creator may only want profile data such as reviews and research notes pertaining to the user profile from other users with a greater than 3 out of 5 star reputation rating.","In one embodiment, the network-based marketplace  includes review and recommendation application(s) . The social networking application(s)  may work in conjunction with the review and recommendation application(s)  to provide a user interface to facilitate the entry of reviews of the user profile data received from other users. A review may be a text entry of the community group member's opinion, a standard review form including check boxes indicating a level satisfaction, or a combination of both, etc. Recommendations may include a specific type of demographic, item, a specific brand or service for a type of item, a specific retailer for the item, etc.","Navigation of the network-based marketplace  may be facilitated by one or more navigation and context application(s) . For example, a context application may, inter alia, enable key word searches of item listings associated with a context defined by a user profile of a particular consumer. The context can include an association between the user profile data in the user profile and item feature sets related to items in the item listings. The item listings can include listings from a group including products or services or both. The item feature set data and data defining the association between the user profile data in the user profile and item feature sets may be retrieved from the network-based marketplace  (e.g., databases ) or from various other remote sources, such as other network sites, other users (e.g., experts or peers), etc. In one embodiment, a toolbar installed on a browser application may be used for functions including interactive and navigation functions to create a new user profile, selectively add a uniform resource locator (URL) associated with the created user profile, and create notations regarding research and general matters associated with the user profile. These functions may be user accessible by many methods known in the art, including a web form interface (HTML or embedded Java) or a stand-alone application interface. For example, a navigation application may include a browser that allows users via an associated user interface to browse a user's user profile, various item listings, item feature sets, contexts, catalogues, inventories, social networks, and review data structures within the network-based marketplace . In one embodiment, the user interface includes selectable elements in the form of tabs to separate out various categories of user profile data that when selected generate a list associated with the category. For example, a tab for \u201cMy Notes,\u201d a tab for \u201cEveryone's Notes,\u201d a tab for \u201cBuy,\u201d and a tab for \u201cSell\u201d. Various other navigation applications (e.g., an external search engine) may be provided to supplement the search and browsing applications.","In one embodiment, using filtering application(s) , the user or feed distribution engine user may customize result data associated with a user profile or listing search results. The filtering application(s)  may generate the result data according to one or more rules provided by the network-based marketplace  and the user receiving the filtered result data. For example, as discussed above with reference to the reputation application(s) , the user may only want the user profile to match on item listings pertaining to item reviews from other users with a greater than 3 out of 5 star reputation rating. In another example, the user may only want user profile data to match on item listings pertaining to item listings with a particular feature set or attribute set. For example, the user may only want result data for digital cameras with equal or greater than 5 megapixels. Additionally, the filtering rules may be combinable or modifiable to broaden or narrow the scope of the result data. The filtering application(s)  may also be used to implement rules for granting or allowing access to the user profile data.","Messaging application(s)  may be used for the generation and delivery of messages to users of the network-based marketplace . For example, the user may like a particular review or research from another user and may wish to contact the user for additional information. In one embodiment, the messaging application(s)  may be used in conjunction with the social networking application(s)  to provide promotional and\/or marketing (e.g., targeted advertisements associated with the user profile) to the user or a related user from vendors and community members that may have offerings related to the user profile.","Item list application(s)  may be used in the network-based marketplace  by the user to create an item list based on selecting one or more items and services to purchase (or sell, auction, lease, or donate), which may be at least partially based on result data associated with the user's shopping experience. The item list application(s)  may be accessed via a user interface that allows the user to create and use the item list. Additionally, the user may selectively share this list within a community or to all users to gain or solicit additional data such as vendor recommendations for each purchase or vendor reviews for vendors that may be present in the list.","In one embodiment, electronic shopping cart application(s)  are used to create a shared electronic shopping cart used by a user to add and store items from a shopping list generated by the user (e.g., by making selections from a \u201cBuy\u201d tab). The electronic shopping cart application(s)  may facilitate the transactions for each item on the list by automatically finding the items in the electronic shopping cart across at least one or all of a set of vendors, a comparison shopping site, an auction site, other user's ads, etc. In one embodiment, a multitude of transactions may appear as one transaction based on the selection of \u201cBulk Purchase.\u201d In various embodiments, the selection criteria for which vendor or vendors to purchase from may include, but is not limited to, criteria such as lowest cost, fastest shipping time, preferred or highest rated vendors or sellers, or any combination thereof.","It will be appreciated that one or more of the various sample networking and marketplace application(s) ,  may be combined into a single application including one or more modules. Further, in some embodiments, one or more applications may be omitted and additional applications may also be included.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","136","130","132","302","112","112"]},"The context data table  maintains a record of the one or more user profiles and\/or listings created by or related to a user. As discussed above, this may include user profile identifiers and\/or listing identifiers that may include words and\/or phrases from the general to the specific for a consumer class, specific consumer, product\/service class, or a specific product\/service. Context data in context data table  can also include associations between the user profile data in the personalized consumer profiles and item feature sets related to items in the item listings. The item listings can be listings for products or services or both. The personalized consumer profiles, item feature set data, and data defining the association between the user profile data in the personalized consumer profiles and item feature set data may be stored into or retrieved from the context data table  of database(s) . In one embodiment, each word in a phrase may be a tag linked to another user profile and its associated data. For example \u201cCanon\u201d may be a selectable element within the user interface as a tag that results in the selector receiving more general data regarding Canon products. Similarly, \u201ccamera\u201d may be selected to receive more general data regarding cameras, in this case both digital and film cameras.","The tables  may also include an item list table  which maintains listing or item records for goods and\/or services that were created using the item list application(s) . In various embodiments, the item list may be created and shared with a community group or to all users in part to solicit feedback regarding listed or potential vendors.","Each listing or item record within the item list table  may furthermore be linked to one or more electronic shopping cart records within a electronic shopping cart table  and to one or more user records within the user table  and\/or a vendor table , so as to associate a seller or vendor and one or more actual or potential buyers from the community group with each item record.","A transaction table  may contain a record for each transaction pertaining to items or listings for which records exist within the item list table . For example, the transaction table  may contain a purchase or sales transaction of an item of the item list by a consumer.","In one example embodiment, a feedback table  may be utilized by one or more of the reputation application (s)  to construct and maintain reputation information associated with users (e.g., members of the community group, sellers, etc.).","Group(s) of users found in a community group table  may be selected by a user to be members of a community group having access to user profile data and an item listing associated with the electronic shopping cart.","A filter table  may be used to sort and filter data associated with a user profile. The sorted or filtered data are then stored in the result data table  and linked to the user profile creator via a user profile identifier. Various types of filters and associated rules were discussed above with reference to the filtering application(s)  in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","401","401","726","402","403","401","402","403","402","401","402","401","402","402","401","401","405","405","405"]},"Similarly, the feed distribution network  can collect feed-related data from the merchant sites . For example, merchant sites  can be used by merchants, advertisers, or other users to bid on keywords or search terms that correspond to a particular merchant's products\/items. These merchant bids or this merchant value information can be conveyed to the feed distribution network  via network . Using this merchant bid information, the feed distribution network  can generate a Merchant data set . The Merchant data set  can be used to store information related to the connections or relationships between products or items appearing in a particular publisher's content, the identifiers of the corresponding publisher sites, the merchant bids corresponding to the particular products\/items, and the merchant or seller associated with each bid. An example of the content of the Merchant data set  is shown in . As described in more detail below, the merchant bids can be used by the feed distribution network  to facilitate the placement of product\/item listings at publisher sites  in a manner that corresponds to the value of each merchant bid.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","100","112"]},"In the particular embodiment, the feed distribution network  may include a feed distribution engine . The feed distribution engine  of a particular embodiment, as shown in , can include a number of features, applications, services, tools, or modules, such as:\n\n","These feed distribution engine  modules of a particular embodiment are described in more detail below.","In a particular embodiment, the database  can include the following elements:\n\n","All APIs supported by the API module  can be based on a Service Oriented Architecture. When responding to a \u201cpost\u201d request by the client, the API can write data into a database table and reply back to the client with success or failure codes. As described above, a publisher site  can use APIs provided by API module  to register particular products or items with the teed distribution network . Similarly, a merchant site  can use APIs provided by API module  to submit a bid related to particular products or items to the feed distribution network . The APIs provided by API module  can also be used by the feed distribution network  to transfer high-value feeds to the publisher sites .","Feed Data Collector Module ","When a publisher site  uses APIs provided by API module  to register particular products or items with the feed distribution network , the feed data collector module  receives this data from the publisher site  and updates the corresponding portions of the publisher data set  in database . The feed data collector module  can also augment the data stored in publisher data set  with data retrieved from other sources. For example, additional product information, related keyword or search term information, or other information related to a product\/item registered by a publisher site  can also be added to the publisher data set  by the feed collector module . Similarly, the feed collector module  can receive merchant data from a merchant site . The feed collector module  updates the corresponding portions of the merchant data set  in database . The feed data collector module  can also augment the data stored in merchant data set  with data retrieved from other sources. For example, additional product information, related keyword or search term information, related bid or purchase information, publisher information, item value or hid value information, or other information related to a bid submitted by a merchant site  can also be added to the merchant data set  by the feed collector module .","Feed Analytics Module ","Once the publisher data set  and merchant data set  are populated with publisher data and merchant data as described above, the feed analytics module  can use this data to generate high-value feeds for transfer to publisher sites . The feed analytics module  can be a web application. In the particular embodiment, the feed analytics module , as shown in , can include a number of features, applications, services, tools, or modules, such as:\n\n","These feed analytics module  components of a particular embodiment are described in more detail below.","Feed Transfer Module ","Once the feed analytics module  generates a set of high-value feeds, this feed data can be transferred to the publisher sites  using the feed transfer module . The feed transfer module  can use one or more of the APIs provided by the API module  to effect the transfer of the high-value feeds to the corresponding publisher sites .","Keyword Cleansing Module ","The keyword cleansing module  processing of a particular embodiment is described in more detail herein. Some conventional keyword processing systems store even the slightest differences in text strings as distinct listings\/queries\/records. For example, two phrases may have the same keywords, but one may have an additional space in the keyword string. Conventional systems create distinct records for these keyword variations even though these variations would be considered the same keyword in some conventional search engines, thus triggering the display of the same listings. Thus, it is beneficial to pre-process or clean the product identifiers, keywords, or search queries received from a particular publisher site to the extent possible. The following pre-processing actions can be implemented to increase the likelihood that the keyword processing will appropriately match the product identifiers, keywords, or search queries with corresponding bids submitted by merchant sites. Various examples of this pre-processing are provided below:\n\n","The following actions can be used in various embodiments to process user queries and related keywords for various conventional search engines.\n\n","The keyword cleansing module  processing of a particular embodiment can also employ pattern rules. Pattern rules can infer information from the usage of keywords based on a context in which the keywords are used. In a particular context, particular keywords or phrases can be extracted and\/or normalized to improve the accuracy of the keyword mapping\/matching process.","Keyword Mapping Module ","The keyword mapping module  processing of a particular embodiment is described in more detail herein. Once a set of product identifiers or keywords have been pre-processed as described above, the keywords can be matched against the content in a set of listings that can be served to the publisher sites . Because it is not feasible to serve all available listings to the publisher sites , it is important to pick only the highest value listings for transfer to the publisher sites . The keyword mapping module  identifies the particular listings at a host site that include keywords that match to the set of product identifiers, items, or keywords registered by the publisher sites. These matched listings can be provided as input to the quality score generator module , which can determine how relevant a particular listing is to a particular keyword being processed. The set of product identifiers, items, or keywords can also be matched to the titles of the set of listings. A unique identifier can be assigned to each member of the set of product identifiers, items, or keywords.","Quality Score Generator Module ","The quality score generator module  processing of a particular embodiment is described in more detail herein. The quality score generator module  processes the set of matched listings produced by the keyword mapping module  to determine a quality or relevancy score for each keyword or item as related to the matching listings. The quality score can be based on a number of factors including:\n\n","Once the quality score for a particular keyword or item is generated by the quality score generator module , the set of keywords can be ranked in an ordering of the associated quality scores. A set of matching listing items can also be ranked in an ordering of the associated quality scores. In this manner, the highest quality keyword\/item and the corresponding highest quality listing is ranked at the top of the list and the lowest quality keyword\/item and the corresponding lowest quality listing is ranked at the bottom of the list.","In an alternative embodiment, various quality scoring models can be used. For example, one quality scoring model can focus on the leaf-category performance of the listing items. In this model, the average conversion rates per leaf category and per price segment can be used to determine a quality score for each listing item. In a second alternative quality scoring model, the attributes of sellers corresponding to the listing items can be used to score the listing items. In a third alternative quality scoring model, the attributes of the listing items themselves can be used to score the listing items. In a fourth alternative quality scoring model, various combinations of several quality scoring models can be used. Ultimately, a quality score corresponding to each individual listing item can be generated using any of the methods described above.","Feed Restrictor Module ","The feed restrictor module  processing of a particular embodiment is described in more detail herein. Once the set of keywords and listing items have been ranked in an ordering of the associated quality scores, the feed restrictor module  can discard a pre-determined portion of the sorted list. Typically, the items at the end of the sorted list are discarded to retain the highest-value items in the list. In this manner, the highest-value items, and the listings associated with these high-value items can be served to the corresponding publisher sites . The portion of the sorted list that is discarded can be defined by an item number \u2018n\u2019. The item number \u2018n\u2019 designates an index of an item in the sorted list that represents the lowest value item that will be included in the list delivered to the publisher sites . The value of \u2018n\u2019 can be chosen to deliver a fixed number of listings to the publisher sites . The value of \u2018n\u2019 can also be chosen to deliver listings to the publisher sites  that are of a minimal level of quality based on the item quality score. In this manner, the feed restrictor module  can be used to regulate the quantity and quality of listings delivered to the publisher sites. When the feed restrictor module  has completed processing the sorted list and the high value listings have been identified as described above, the high value listings can be delivered to the corresponding publisher sites  using the feed transfer module .","In an alternative embodiment, the feed restrictor module  can partition the sorted list to various portions. The various portions can correspond to related product identifiers, keywords, or search strings. Each portion of the sorted list can be truncated at a pre-determined quality score value.
