Insomnia is a growing health problem in the United States. It is believed that more than 10-15 million people suffer from chronic insomnia and up to an additional 70 million people suffer from some form of insomnia each year. Insomnia is a condition characterized by difficulty falling asleep (sleep onset), waking frequently during the night (fragmented sleep), waking too early (premature final awakening), and\/or waking up feeling un-refreshed. In the National Sleep Foundation's (NSF) Sleep in America Poll 2005, 42% of survey respondents reported that they awoke frequently during the night, 22% of adults reported waking too early and not being able to return to sleep and 38% reported waking and feeling un-refreshed.","Sleep maintenance difficulty is the most commonly reported symptom in primary care patients with chronic insomnia, and is the most common complaint in depressed patients, medically ill populations, especially those with pain symptoms, and in the elderly.","Medications commonly used to treat sleep disorders, such as insomnia, include sedative antidepressants, antihistamines, benzodiazepines, and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.","Although there have been several advances in pharmaceutical treatments for insomnia, it is often hard to find an ideal drug for treating particular forms of insomnia. One common problem is early termination of sleep or premature final awakening. For example, many individuals may wake prematurely and not fall back asleep, thereby failing to achieve a full night of sleep. Many drugs that are effective in inducing or expediting sleep initiation do not provide much effect in maintaining sleep, particularly through the eighth and final hour of sleep period. Drugs that are sufficiently powerful to induce a full eight hours sleep often cause serious hangover effects, i.e., the patient has difficulty awakening and\/or feels sedated, sleepy, or disoriented and may demonstrate impairment of psychomotor function.","In addition to patients having difficulty with early termination of sleep during the last 60, 90, or 120 minutes of an 8 hour sleep period, other patients have problems with fragmented or disrupted sleep. In other words, those patients awaken one or more times during that time period, then fall asleep again. Such fragmented sleep patterns detract from a feeling of restfulness, and make it less likely that the patient will enjoy restful sleep.","Both groups of patients would benefit greatly from a drug that addresses their particular sleep deficiency.","Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant that is known to have beneficial effects in treating insomnia. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,502,047 and 6,211,229. However, prior to the present invention, doxepin was not known to have particular efficacy in treating premature termination of sleep at the end of an 8 hour sleep period, nor was it known to be efficacious in treating those patients with disturbed sleep patterns during the final 60, 90, or 120 minutes of an 8-hour sleep period. The mean half-life of doxepin is 17 hours, and the half-life of its major active metabolite, desmethyldoxepin, is 51 hours. Thus, when taken at the start of a sleep cycle, a majority of the drug or active metabolite should still be present in the body at the end of the sleep cycle. As a result, it would be expected that dosages of doxepin that are sufficient to address premature final awakenings or last-hour sleep efficiency in the elderly would also cause post-sleep sedation or other undesirable side effects.","The present invention describes the surprising ability of doxepin to treat last-hour sleep efficiency and premature final awakenings in patients, without untoward side effects.","Some embodiments provide methods for reducing or preventing early awakenings in a patient in need thereof. In some embodiments the methods can include identifying a patient having a sleep disorder in which, for a given 8 hour period of desired sleep, the patient experiences a sleep period that terminates during the final 60 minutes of said period; and administering to the patient, prior to the sleep period, doxepin, a pharmaceutically accept salt thereof, or a prodrug thereof in a dosage between 1 milligram (mg) and 6 mg that can be effective to lengthen the sleep period. In some aspects of the embodiment, the patient can be identified as experiencing a sleep period that terminates during the final 45 minutes of said period. In some aspects of the embodiment, the patient can be identified as experiencing a sleep period that terminates during the final 30 minutes of said period. In some embodiments, the sleep period can be lengthened to terminate during or after hour 7 of said period. In some embodiments, the sleep period can be lengthened to terminate during or after hour 7.5 of said period. In some aspects, the patient can be additionally identified as in need of reducing wake time after sleep. In another embodiment, the patient suffers from chronic or non-chronic insomnia. In yet another embodiment, the patient suffers from transient insomnia.","Some embodiments provide methods for decreasing fragmented sleep in the 8th hour of a sleep period for a patient. In some embodiments the methods include identifying a patient suffering from fragmented sleep during the 8th hour of a sleep period; and administering to the patient doxepin, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof in a dosage between about 1 mg and 6 mg. In some embodiments, the dosage of doxepin can be, for example, about 1 mg, 3 mg or 6 mg. Thus, in one aspect the dosage of doxepin can be about 1 mg. In one aspect, the dosage of doxepin can be about 3 mg. In one aspect, the dosage of doxepin is about 6 mg. In another embodiment, the patient suffers from chronic or non-chronic insomnia. In yet another embodiment, the patient suffers from transient insomnia.","Some embodiments provide methods for treating a sleep disorder, comprising identifying a patient suffering from a transient insomnia comprising a sleep deficiency associated with one or more of LPS, WASO, TST, TWT, SE, latency to Stage 2 sleep, WTDS, or WTAS; and administering to the patient doxepin, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof in a dosage between about 0.5 mg and 6 mg. In one embodiment, the dosage of doxepin is about 1 mg, 3 mg or 6 mg. In other embodiments, the dosage of doxepin is about 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 3 mg or 6 mg.","Many individuals currently suffer from sleep disorders, such as insomnia. Some of these individuals with insomnia are subject to shorter total sleep periods due to premature final awakenings. Also, some of these individuals suffer from transient awakenings, particularly during the last 1-2 hours of their sleep period. The premature final awakenings and the transient awakening during the final hours of sleep causes the individuals to be tired and un-refreshed, and can decrease their overall well-being and productivity. Thus, there is a need for methods of treating such individuals to improve sleep efficiency and the total sleep time.","The present invention relates to methods of using doxepin, for example, low doses of doxepin to improve the sleep of such individuals. Some embodiments relate to methods of using doxepin to prevent or reduce the early final awakening of an individual. Also, some embodiments relate to decreasing the transient awakenings during the last hours of sleep, preferably in the last hour of a sleep period for an individual.","As mentioned above, various medications are currently approved for the treatment of sleep disorders, such as insomnia. Many of the approved medications have unfavorable side effects. Additionally, the previously approved medications do not effectively manage the sleep experience for an individual taking the medication. For example, the approved medications do not improve fragmented sleep for a patient in the final hours of sleep, especially the last hour of a sleep period. Furthermore, as an example, many of the already approved medications do not reduce or prevent the early final awakening of an individual that is taking the medication. In short, the currently approved medications do not completely improve the sleep experience for patients in the final hours of sleep.","Doxepin HCl is a tricyclic compound currently approved for treatment of depression. The recommended daily dose for the treatment of depression ranges from 75 mg to 300 mg. Doxepin, unlike most FDA approved products for the treatment of insomnia, is not a Schedule IV controlled substance. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,502,047 and 6,211,229, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, describe the use of doxepin for the treatment chronic and non-chronic (e.g., transient\/short term) insomnias at dosages far below those used to treat depression.","Some embodiments of this invention relate to the ability of low-dose doxepin, pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof to prevent premature or early final awakenings, and\/or to improve fragmented sleep, which can be measured by decrements in sleep efficiency (SE) during the seventh and eighth hours of an eight hour period of sleep, by identifying an individual in need of such treatment, and providing a low dose of doxepin, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a prodrug thereof to the individual.","As used herein, the term \u201cpolysomnography\u201d (PSG) refers a diagnostic test during which a number of physiologic variables are measured and recorded during sleep. Physiologic sensor leads are placed on the patient in order to record brain electrical activity, eye and jaw muscle movement, leg muscle movement, airflow, respiratory effort (chest and abdominal excursion), EKG and oxygen saturation Information is gathered from all leads and fed into a computer and outputted as a series of waveform tracings which enable the technician to visualize the various waveforms, assign a score for the test, and assist in the diagnostic process. The primary efficacy variable, wake time during sleep (WTDS) and various secondary efficacy variables are all based on the PSG and are defined as follows.","\u201cWake Time During Sleep\u201d (WTDS), typically expressed in minutes, is the number of wake events (epochs) after the onset of persistent sleep and prior to final awakening, divided by two. Each epoch is defined as a 30-second duration on the PSG recording.","\u201cWake Time After Sleep\u201d (WTAS), typically expressed in minutes, is the number of epochs after the final awakening until the end of PSG recording (i.e., a wake epoch immediately prior to the end of the recording), divided by two. If the patient does not have a wake epoch immediately prior to the end of the recording, then WTAS is zero.","\u201cWake After Sleep Onset\u201d (WASO) is the sum of WTDS and WTAS.","\u201cLatency to Persistent Sleep\u201d (LPS), typically expressed in minutes, is the number of epochs from the beginning of the PSG recording (lights-out) to the start of the first 20 consecutive non-wake epochs, divided by two.","\u201cTotal Sleep Time\u201d (TST), typically expressed in minutes, is the number of non-wake epochs from the beginning of the PSG recording to the end of the recording, divided by two.","\u201cSleep Efficiency\u201d (SE) is the TST divided by the time in bed (8 hours), multiplied by 100 and expressed as a percentage. This also can be divided into SE for each third-of-the-night of sleep, reflecting the SE for each 160 minute time interval across the night. Finally, SE can be measured for individual hours during the night or sleep period, for example the final hour of the sleep period.","The term \u201cfragmented sleep\u201d can refer to interrupted sleep over a measurement period or sleep period, for example the time a patient is awake during period of measurement. Fragmentation can occur as a result of multiple awakenings or one or more awakenings of a long duration.","The term \u201cprodrug\u201d refers to an agent that is converted into the active drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the active drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the active drug is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the active drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound of the present invention which is administered as an ester (the \u201cprodrug\u201d) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety.","The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d refers to an ionic form of a compound that does not cause significant irritation to an organism to which it is administered and does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the compound. Pharmaceutical salts can be obtained by reacting a compound of the invention with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like. Pharmaceutical salts can also be obtained by reacting a compound of the invention with a base to form a salt such as an ammonium salt, an alkali metal salt, such as a sodium or a potassium salt, an alkaline earth metal salt, such as a calcium or a magnesium salt, a salt of organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine, N-methyl-D-glutamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and the like.","The term \u201clow dose\u201d can refer to a daily dose range of between about 0.5 and 6 mg. In some embodiments, daily dosages of low dose doxepin can be about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 mg. These dosages have reduced side effects, are surprisingly effective, and have a relatively rapid onset. In one embodiment, an initial daily dosage of about 1 mg can be given. If the desired improvement in sleep is not achieved, then the dosage may be incrementally increased until the desired dosage is achieved or until a maximum desired dosage is reached which can be, for example, 2 mg, 3 mg, 4 mg, 5 mg or 6 mg. It should be noted that other dosages of doxepin can be used in the embodiments described herein. For example, the dosage can be about 0.5 to about 10 mg.","Compounds","Doxepin:","Doxepin HCl is a tricyclic compound currently approved and available for treatment of depression and anxiety.

The pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs can be made by any suitable method.","The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d refers to an ionic form of a compound that does not cause significant irritation to an organism to which it is administered and does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the compound. Pharmaceutical salts can be obtained by reacting a compound of the invention with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like. Pharmaceutical salts can also be obtained by reacting a compound of the invention with a base to form a salt such as an ammonium salt, an alkali metal salt, such as a sodium or a potassium salt, an alkaline earth metal salt, such as a calcium or a magnesium salt, a salt of organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine, N-methyl-D-glutamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are more fully described in the following paragraph.","The acids that can be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include, for example, those that form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmacologically acceptable anions, such as the acetate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bicarbonate, bisulfate, bitartrate, borate, bromide, calcium edetate, camsylate, carbonate, chloride, clavulanate, citrate, dihydrochloride, edetate, dislyate, estolate, esylate, ethylsuccinate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glutamate, glycollylarsanilate, hexylresorcinate, hydrabamine, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, iodide, isothionate, lactate, lactobionate, laurate, malate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, methylsulfate, mucate, napsylate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, pamoate (embonate), palmitate, pantothenate, phospate\/diphosphate, polygalacturonate, salicylate, stearate, subacetate, succinate, tannate, tartrate, teoclate, tosylate, triethiodode, and valerate salts.","The bases that can be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include, for example, those that form non-toxic base addition salts, i.e., base salts formed with metals or amines, such as alkali and alkaline earth metals or organic amines. Non-limiting examples of metals used as cations include sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and the like. Also included are heavy metal salts such as for example silver, zinc, cobalt, and cerium. Non-limiting examples of suitable amines include N,N\u2032-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamene, N-methylglucamine, and procaine.","Prodrugs:","The term \u201cprodrug\u201d refers to an agent that is converted into the active drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they can be easier to administer than the active drug. They can, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the active drug is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the active drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound of the present invention which is administered as an ester (the \u201cprodrug\u201d) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. Examples of prodrug groups can be found in, for example, T. Higuchi and V. Stella, in \u201cPro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,\u201d Vol. 14, A.C.S. Symposium Series, American Chemical Society (1975); H. Bundgaard, \u201cDesign of Prodrugs,\u201d Elsevier Science, 1985; and \u201cBioreversible Carriers in Drug Design: Theory and Application,\u201d edited by E. B. Roche, Pergamon Press: New York, 14-21 (1987), each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Methods of Using Low Dose Doxepin","Some embodiments relate to methods for reducing or preventing premature awakening in a patient in need thereof. The methods can include the step of identifying a patient having a sleep disorder in which, for a given sleep period of desired sleep, for example an 8 hour period, the patient experiences a sleep period that terminates prior to or during the final 60 minutes of the period; and administering to the patient a dosage of doxepin that is effective to lengthen the sleep period, preferably between about 1 and 6 mg. In some aspects the patient can experience a sleep period that terminates within the final 60 minutes, 45 minutes, 30 minutes or 15 minutes. In other aspects the sleep period can terminate even earlier, for example, during the final 90 minutes, the final 120 minutes, or longer. In some aspects, the sleep period may be lengthened by administering low dose doxepin to extend the sleep period to terminate during or after hour 7 (e.g., hour 7.5) of an 8 hour period of sleep. Also, the patients can be identified as being in need of reduced wake time during (or after) sleep.","Further, some embodiments relate to methods for improving fragmented sleep in the final hours of a sleep period for a patient, preferably during the final hour or the 8hour of sleep. The methods can include, for example, the steps of identifying a patient suffering from or experiencing fragmented sleep during last hour or hours of a sleep period, and administering to the patient doxepin in a dosage between about 1 mg and 6 mg. Preferably, the methods can be used to reduce or improve fragmented sleep during the 8th hour of a sleep period. In some aspects the dosage of doxepin can be about 1 mg, 3 mg or 6 mg.","Some embodiments relate to methods of using low dose doxepin to decrease WTAS in an individual who is prone to early awakenings. An individual with such a need can be identified, and low doses of doxepin can be administered to the individual, for example, prior to the sleep period.","The methods described herein can be used to treat individuals suffering from a sleep disorder, such as insomnia. The individual can suffer from a chronic insomnia or a non-chronic insomnia. For chronic (e.g., greater than 3-4 weeks) or non-chronic insomnias, a patient may suffer from difficulties in sleep onset, sleep maintenance (interruption of sleep during the night by periods of wakefulness), sleep duration, sleep efficiency, premature early-morning awakening, or a combination thereof. Also, the insomnia may be attributable to the concurrent use of other medication, for example. The non-chronic insomnia can be, for example, a short term insomnia or a transient insomnia. The chronic or non-chronic insomnia can be a primary insomnia or an insomnia that is secondary or attributable to another condition, for example a disease such as depression or chronic fatigue syndrome. In some aspects, the patient can be one that is not suffering from an insomnia that is a component of a disease, or a patient can be treated that is otherwise healthy. As previously mentioned, the chronic or non-chronic insomnia can be a primary insomnia, that is, one that is not attributable to another mental disorder, a general medical condition, or a substance. In many cases, such conditions may be associated with a chronic insomnia and can include, but are not limited to, insomnia attributable to a diagnosable DSM-IV disorder, a disorder such as anxiety or depression, or a disturbance of the physiological sleep-wake system. In some aspects the insomnia can be non-chronic, or of short duration (e.g., less than 3-4 weeks). Examples of causes of such insomnia may be extrinsic or intrinsic and include, but are not limited to environmental sleep disorders as defined by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) such as inadequate sleep hygiene, altitude insomnia or adjustment sleep disorder (e.g., bereavement). Also, short-term insomnia may also be caused by disturbances such as shift-work sleep disorder.","Administration of Doxepin","In performing the methods, doxepin, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of doxepin, or prodrug of doxepin can be administered using any suitable route or method of delivery. Also, doxepin, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a prodrug thereof can be included and administered in a composition.","Suitable routes of administration include oral, buccal, sublingual, transdermal, rectal, topical, transmucosal, or intestinal administration; parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections.","For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated readily by combining the active compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated. Administration though oral pathways can be accomplished, for example, using a capsule, a tablet, a granule, a spray, a syrup, a liquid, powder, granules, pastes (e.g., for application to the tongue). Oral administration can be accomplished using fast-melt formulations, for example. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by mixing one or more solid excipient with pharmaceutical combination of the invention, optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and\/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate.","Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally, including sublingually, include for example, liquid solutions, powders, and suspensions in bulk or unit dosage forms. Also, the oral formulations can include, for example, pills, tablets, granules, sprays, syrups, pastes, powders, boluses, pre-measured ampules or syringes, push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and\/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration.","For buccal administration, the compositions may take any suitable form, for example, tablets or lozenges.","For topical administration, the compounds may be formulated for administration to the epidermis as ointments, gels, creams, pastes, salves, gels, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch. Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and\/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also containing one or more emulsifying agents, stabilizing agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or coloring agents.","For injection, the agents of the invention may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art.","For administration by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, e.g., gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.","The compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and\/or dispersing agents.","Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.","In addition, any of the compounds and compositions described herein can also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt. Furthermore, any of the compounds and compositions described herein also can be formulated as a fast-melt preparation. The compounds and compositions can also be formulated and administered as a drip, a suppository, a salve, an ointment, an absorbable material such a transdermal patch, or the like.","One can also administer the compounds of the invention in sustained release forms or from sustained release drug delivery systems. A description of representative sustained release materials can be found in the incorporated materials in (20ed, Lippincott Williams & Wilkens Publishers (2003)), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","A variety of techniques for formulation and administration can be found in (20ed, Lippincott Williams & Wilkens Publishers (2003)), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Compositions","As mentioned above, doxepin, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and\/or prodrugs of the same can be used alone or in combination with other substances, such as for example, other insomnia or sleep medications, or with other medications that treat a primary illness. The doxepin alone or in combination can be included as part of a composition. The compounds and compositions can include any suitable form of the compound for pharmaceutical delivery, as discussed in further detail herein.","The compositions and formulations disclosed herein also can include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier materials or excipients. Such compositions can be prepared for storage and for subsequent administration. Acceptable carriers or diluents for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in the incorporated material of (20ed, Lippincott Williams & Wilkens Publishers (2003)), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The term \u201ccarrier\u201d material or \u201cexcipient\u201d herein can mean any substance, not itself a therapeutic agent, used as a carrier and\/or diluent and\/or adjuvant, or vehicle for delivery of a therapeutic agent to a subject or added to a pharmaceutical composition to improve its handling or storage properties or to permit or facilitate formation of a dose unit of the composition into a discrete article such as a capsule or tablet suitable for oral administration. Excipients can include, by way of illustration and not limitation, diluents, disintegrants, binding agents, adhesives, wetting agents, polymers, lubricants, glidants, substances added to mask or counteract a disagreeable taste or odor, flavors, dyes, fragrances, and substances added to improve appearance of the composition.

Suitable excipients for the preparation of solutions and syrups include, without limitation, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and glucose. Suitable excipients for injectable solutions include, without limitation, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, and vegetable oils. The pharmaceutical compositions can additionally include preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorings, buffers, coating agents, or antioxidants. Sterile compositions for injection can be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice as described in the incorporated material in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (20ed, Lippincott Williams & Wilkens Publishers (2003)). For example, dissolution or suspension of the active compound in a vehicle such as water or naturally occurring vegetable oil like sesame, peanut, or cottonseed oil or a synthetic fatty vehicle like ethyl oleate or the like may be desired. Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants and the like can be incorporated according to accepted pharmaceutical practice. The compound can also be made in microencapsulated form. In addition, if desired, the injectable pharmaceutical compositions may contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances, such as wetting agents, pH buffering agents, and the like. If desired, absorption enhancing preparations (for example, liposomes), can be utilized.","The compositions and formulations can include any other agents that provide improved transfer, delivery, tolerance, and the like. These compositions and formulations can include, for example, powders, pastes, ointments, jellies, waxes, oils, lipids, lipid (cationic or anionic) containing vesicles (such as Lipofectin\u2122), DNA conjugates, anhydrous absorption pastes, oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, emulsions carbowax (polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights), semi-solid gels, and semi-solid mixtures containing carbowax. Any of the foregoing mixtures may be appropriate in treatments and therapies in accordance with the present invention, provided that the active ingredient in the formulation is not inactivated by the formulation and the formulation is physiologically compatible and tolerable with the route of administration.

A description of representative sustained release materials can be found in the incorporated materials in (20ed, Lippincott Williams & Wilkens Publishers (2003)).","Dosage","As mentioned above, in some embodiments the preferable dosage can be between about 1 mg and 6 mg. Preferably, the dosage can be about 0.5 mg, 1 mg, about 2 mg, about 3 mg, about 4 mg, about 5 mg or about 6 mg. It should be noted that in some embodiments the dosage can be between about 0.01 mg and 20 mg or between about 0.5 mg and 10 mg. Further, the dosage can be about 7 mg, about 8 mg, about 9 mg, or about 10 mg.","The selected dosage level can depend upon, for example, the route of administration, the severity of the condition being treated, and the condition and prior medical history of the patient being treated. However, it is within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient can depend upon a variety of factors including the genetic makeup, body weight, general health, diet, time and route of administration, combination with other drugs and the particular condition being treated, and its severity. For the treatment of insomnia, preferably one dose is administered prior to bedtime.","The selected dosage can also be determined by targeting a mean plasma concentration profile that has been associated with improvement in one or more PSG sleep variables including LPS, WASO, TST, SE, WTDS, or WTAS (). Examples of such plasma concentration profiles are shown in . The target plasma concentration profile may be achieved by any suitable route of administration including oral, buccal, sublingual, transdermal, rectal, topical, transmucosal, or intestinal administration; parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections using any suitable formulation.","Doxepin is prepared by the following method.","(a) A Grignard compound is prepared in the conventional manner from 4.8 g (0.2 gram-atom) magnesium in 100 mL ether and 30 g (34 ml) (3-chloropropyl)-tertbutyl ether and 16.40 grams (0.078 mol) 6,11-dihydrodibenzo-[b,e]-oxepine-11-one dissolved in 100 mL ether is added in dropwise fashion so that the contents of the flask boil lightly. The mixture is heated for 1 hour with agitation in a reflux condenser to complete the reaction and then it is decomposed with ammonium chloride solution. The product which is obtained by separating, drying and eliminating the solvent produced, when the ether residue (24.0 g) is extracted with ligroin, amounts to 20.3 g (80.0% of theory) of 11-tertbutoxypropyl)-11-hydroxy-6,11-dihydrodibenzo-[b,e]-oxepine, having a melting point of 124-126\u00b0 C. The (3-chloropropyl)-tertbutyl ether is thereafter obtained in the following manner: 19 g (0.2 mol) 1-chloropropanol-3), 50 mL liquid isobutylene and 0.5 mL concentrated sulfuric acid are permitted to stand for 24 hours in an autoclave, then are poured into excess sodium bicarbonate solution and extracted with ether. The ether solution is dried with calcium chloride and distilled. 23.6 grams of (3-chloropropyl)-tertbutyl ether having a boiling point of 150-156\u00b0 C. (78% of theory) are recovered.","30.8 grams of the 11-(3-tertbutoxypropyl)-11-hydroxy-6,11-dihydrodibenzo-[b,e]-oxepine obtained according to (a) above and 150 ml absolute alcoholic hydrochloric acid are heated for 1 hour at ebullition. After removing the solvent by evaporation, the residue is crystallized with ligroin, 21.0 grams (88.5% of theory) of 11-(3-hydroxypropylidene)-6,11-dihydrodibenzo-[b,e]-oxepine having a melting point of 108-111\u00b0 C. were obtained. After recrystallization from acetic acid ester, the compound melts at 112-114\u00b0 C.","(c) 5.0 ml thionyl chloride dissolved in 5 mL benzene is added dropwise at room temperature to 12.6 g (0.05 mol) of the 11-(3-hydroxypropylidene)-6,11-dihydrodibenzo-[b,e]-oxepine obtained in part (b) above. After 1 hour of standing, the contents of the flask are heated at ebullition for 2 hours. The volatile components are thereafter removed and the remainder distilled using high vacuum. The yield amounts to 10.6 g (78.5% of theory) of 11-(3-chloropropylidene)-6,11-dihydrodibenzo-[b,e]-oxepine having a B.P.0.1 169-172\u00b0 C., a melting point of 106-111\u00b0 C. After recrystallization from 20 ml of acetic acid ester, 9.1 g (67.5% of theory) of pure product having a melting point of 113-115\u00b0 C. is obtained. The crude product can however be used quite easily for further processing.","(d) 5.4 g (0.02 mol) of the 11-(3-chloropropylidene)-6,11-dihydrodibenzo-[b,e]-oxepine, prepared according to (c) above, in 20 mL tetrahydrofuran and 5.5 g (0.12 mol) dimethylamine in 20 mL ethanol is heated together for 3 hours using a glass autoclave and a temperature of 95-100\u00b0 C. (boiling water bath). Water and 6 N hydrochloric acid are added to the contents of the autoclave and the mixture is extracted with ether. The separated, aqueous-acid components are then made alkaline with dilute caustic soda solution, and the oil thereby separated is taken up in ether. The ether residue, after distillation in a high vacuum, produces 4.1 g (73.5% of theory) of 11-(3-dimethylamino-propylidene)-6,11-dihydrodibenzo-[b,e]-oxepine, having a B.P.147-150\u00b0 C. The melting point of the hydrochloride is 182-184\u00b0 C. (recrystallized from isopropanol).","Desmethyldoxepin is prepared according to the following method. Anhydrous 3-methylaminopropyltriphenylphosphonium bromide hydrobromide (1530 g) prepared as in U.S. Pat. No. 3,509,175, is suspended in 4.5 L dry tetrahydrofuran and 6.0 moles of butyl lithium in heptane is added during 1 hour. After an additional 30 minutes, 483 g of 6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-11-one, is added to the deep red solution and the reaction is maintained at reflux for 10 hours. Water, 500 mL, is added at room temperature and the solvent is removed in vacuo. The crude residue is treated with 10% hydrochloric acid until acidic (pH 2) and then 1.5 L benzene is added. After stirring, the mixture separates into three phases (an insoluble hydrochloride salt product phase, an aqueous phase and an organic phase). The benzene layer is removed by decantation and the remaining mixture is rendered basic with 10% sodium hydroxide solution and is extracted with 3\u00d71500 mL portions of benzene. The benzene extracts are washed, then dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated in a vacuum leaving a solid residue of desmethyldoxepin.","(E)-Desmethyldoxepin is prepared from doxepin hydrochloride as follows. Doxepin hydrochloride (E\/Z=85\/15) (55.0 g, 0.174 mol) is dissolved in 600 mL H2O, made basic with 6M NaOH, and extracted with CHC13 (3\u00d7600 mL). The CHC3 extracts are combined, dried over Na2SO4, and solvent removed in vacuo. The resulting oil is dissolved in 250 mL EtOH, then 21.15 g (0.182 mol) of maleic acid dissolved in 100 mL EtOH is added slowly, with stirring, followed by an additional 350 mL EtOH. The resulting cloudy solution is refluxed until it becomes clear, then allowed to stand overnight at room temperature; the resulting crystals are isolated by vacuum filtration. Additional recrystallization from EtOH yields a white crystalline product (E)-Doxepin maleate) with an E\/Z ratio of 98\/2. (E)-Doxepin maleate (2.50 g, 6.32 mmol) is then partially dissolved in 60 mL H20, made basic with 6M NaOH, and extracted with CHC13 (3\u00d760 mL). The CHC13 extracts are combined, washed with 60 mL brine, dried over Na2SO4, and solvent removed in vacuo. The resulting oil is re-dissolved in 10 mL CHC13, 1.8 mL (13 mmol) of triethylamine added, 1.8 mL (13 mmol) of 2,2,2-trichloroethylchloro-formate added, and reaction stirred under N2 for 3.5 hours. The completed reaction is then diluted with 140 mL Et2O, washed successively with 0.5M HCl (2\u00d7140 mL), H20 (140 mL), and brine (140 mL), then dried over MgO4 and solvent removed in vacuo. Resulting material is further purified by silica gel column chromatography, eluting with EtOAc\/Hex (20\/80), to afford 1.48 g (3.36 mmol) of the desired product as a clear oil. The N-protected (E)-desmethyldoxepin intermediate (1.44 g, 3.27 mmol) is then dissolved in 12 mL THF, 2.88 g of zinc powder added, 2.3 mL of 1M sodium phosphate (pH=5.5) added, and reaction stirred for 17 hours. The reaction mixture is then vacuum filtered, filtrate solvent removed in vacuo, and resulting residue purified by silica gel column chromatography, eluting with THF\/MeOH\/NH4OH (85\/15\/0.4), then THF\/MeOH\/NH4OH (75\/25\/0.4), to afford 744 mg (2.80 mmol) of the desired product as a pale yellow solid.","(Z)-Desmethyldoxepin is prepared from doxepin hydrochloride as follows. Doxepin hydrochloride (E\/Z=85\/15) (100 g, 0.317 mol) is dissolved in 800 mL H2O, made basic with 6M NaOH, and extracted with CHC13 (3\u00d7800 mL). The CHC13 extracts are combined, dried over Na2SO4, and solvent removed in vacuo. The resulting oil is dissolved in 700 mL EtOH, then 36.7 g (0.317 mol) of maleic acid dissolved in 600 mL EtOH is added slowly, with stirring. The resulting cloudy solution is refluxed until clear, then allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. Crystals are isolated by vacuum filtration and the mother liquor saved. Crystals are recrystallized two additional times as above, and the three mother liquors saved and combined and solvent removed in vacuo. Recrystallization of mother liquor material from refluxing EtOH eventually affords 24 g of a mother liquor product which is 65% Z isomer in composition. Recrystallization of this material from 450 mL EtOH gives crystals (9.1 g) which are 80% Z isomer. This material is recrystallized from 170 mL CHCl3\/CCl4 (50\/50) at 4\u00b0 C., yielding 7.65 g of crystalline material which is 87% Z isomer in composition. Three additional recrystallizations from CHC13\/CHC14 eventually affords 5.12 g (12.9 mmol) of the desired product ((Z)-Doxepin maleate) with an E\/Z ratio of 4\/96; melting point: 162-163\u00b0 C. (Z)-Doxepin maleate (1.00 g, 2.53 mmol) is then partially dissolved in 35 mL H2O, made basic with 6M NaOH, and extracted with CHC13 (3\u00d735 mL). The CHC13 extracts are combined, washed with 35 mL brine, dried over Na2SO4, and solvent removed in vacuo. The resulting oil is re-dissolved in 4 mL CHC13, 0.65 mL (4.7 mmol) of triethylamine added, 0.65 mL (4.7 mmol) of 2,2,2-trichloroethyl-chloroformate added, and reaction stirred under N2 for 3.5 hours.

Patients with a 3-month history of primary insomnia, according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)-defined primary insomnia were enrolled.","This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of two dose levels of doxepin, 3 mg and 6 mg, in subjects with primary insomnia and sleep maintenance difficulties.

These variables were assessed using a questionnaire completed in the morning following each PSG recording night. Drowsiness, ability to function, and total nap time during the day were assessed using an evening questionnaire completed on Night 2, Night 16, and Night 30. Other secondary subjective efficacy variables included the 2-item Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale for severity and therapeutic effect completed by a clinician; the 5-item CGI scale pertaining to therapeutic effect completed by the subject; the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) completed by the subject; and a subjective assessment of average nightly total sleep time following administration of the study drug at home.","A total of 229 subjects were randomized into the study (76 to placebo, 77 to 3 mg, and 76 to 6 mg).
