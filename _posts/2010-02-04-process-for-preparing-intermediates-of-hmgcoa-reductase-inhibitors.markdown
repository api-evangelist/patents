For example, it requires the use of an expensive microorganism such as CLS-BC-14011 during the partial hydrolysis of 3-hydroxy diethyl glutarate. Additionally, the process uses a hazardous reaction, such as isobutylene gas during esterification of ethyl-(3S)-3-hydroxyglutaric acid in the presence of sulphuric acid, and the purification of TSPH by column chromatography is commercially difficult.","US publication No. 2005\/0070605A1 discloses the enantioselective opening of 3-hydroxyprotected glutaric anhydride by phenyl ethylamine to faun an amide bond, and further converting it to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.
