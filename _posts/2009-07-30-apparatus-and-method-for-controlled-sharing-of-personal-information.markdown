{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to the field of electronic communications and particularly to an apparatus and method for controlling the dissemination of personal information.","Portable electronic devices have become a near ubiquitous aspect of everyday modern living. Many people carry a portable electronic device (such as a cellular telephone, personal digital assistant, smartphone, netbook or laptop) with them everywhere they go. These portable electronic devices are often capable of communicating information to other electronic devices using common network communications technologies, such as wireless communications networks and wired communications networks.","Some portable electronic devices share information about the user of the portable electronic device to easily inform other people about the user's current activities. This information may be referred to generally as presence information, or personal information. Some users are increasingly happy to share intimate details of their daily lives with anyone who is interested. These users expect that their portable electronic device will share personal information, often without their ongoing permission or specific instruction.","There may be times when the user of a portable electronic device desires privacy while still being able to use the portable electronic device for other purposes. Current portable electronic devices do not offer a useful, reliable and simple mechanism to achieve a desired level of privacy.","Portable electronic devices are being used for increasingly sophisticated and varied purposes. Portable electronic devices are typically capable of executing a number of applications which provide a variety of functionality to a user of the portable electronic device. Some applications are configured to share (or publish) contextual information about the device and what is happening at, or to, the device to interested parties. Information about what is happening at the device or to the device can be correlated into information about a user of the device. This information can generally be referred to as personal information because of its association with the user of the portable electronic device and is often referred to as presence information. To share personal information, the portable electronic device communicates the personal information to another electronic device, typically using network communication technologies.","There are many different types of applications which share many different types of personal information. One example application is a location application which shares personal information indicating the geographic location of the portable electronic device. Another example application is a social networking application which shares the current status of the user of the device, such as \u2018in a meeting\u2019, \u2018on the phone\u2019 or \u2018having a tough day\u2019. Yet another example application is a messaging application which shares information about what the user of the device is doing with the portable electronic device, such as \u2018listening to Landslide by Fleetwood Mac\u2019 or \u2018typing a message\u2019. The variety of personal information shared by a portable electronic device is ever increasing. Creative software application developers continue to create ever more useful and varied types of personal information which can be shared from a portable electronic device.","Some presence information is generated directly by a user, such as a user changing their \u2018status\u2019 from Busy to Available, while other presence information is generated without direct interaction by a user. Presence information which is generated without direct user interaction includes periodic updates generated automatically at the portable electronic device which describe particular states. Particular states include where a portable electronic device is, if a calendar application of a portable electronic device indicates that a user of the portable electronic device is entering or exiting a meeting, or whether or not the user is presently typing a message using the portable electronic device.","Current portable electronic devices rely on individual applications to share or not share personal information according to their own instructions, largely independent of other applications on the portable electronic device. For example, each application allows a user to turn off personal information sharing for the specific application. To reliably achieve a high level of privacy, a user of the portable electronic device has to access each of the individual applications to ensure that personal information sharing functionality is turned off. Such a system requires a user to exert unnecessary effort to access multiple individual applications to ensure that personal information sharing is turned off in each of the applications. In addition, such a system does not provide the user with a clear and reliable indication that no personal information is being shared after the user has accessed each of the applications to turn off the personal information sharing of each application. It is possible that the user did not access one application which is still sharing personal information, possibly due to inadvertence or a lack of understanding on the part of the user. It is further possible that the user is unaware that a particular application is sharing personal information.","Controlled sharing of personal information is achieved by an apparatus and method whereby a portable electronic device is capable of having a plurality of applications each independently sharing personal information, detecting a request to alter the level at which personal information is shared and altering the level at which the plurality of applications are able to continue sharing personal information. An easily seen indicator is maintained in accordance with the level at which personal information is shared to provide a user of the portable electronic device a quick assessment of whether or not personal information is being shared.","Personal information derived from, generated by or associated with a plurality of applications of a portable electronic device is shared by the portable electronic device with other electronic devices. Each of the plurality of applications of the personal electronic device is capable of sharing personal information according to the functionality of the specific application. For example, a location or mapping application shares personal information relevant to location, a social networking application shares personal information relevant to social networking and a messaging application shares personal information relevant to messaging. Each application executes independent of other applications of the portable electronic device and shares personal information according to pre-configured instructions.","Some of these applications share personal information generated by the application itself and other applications derive the information they share from other applications or data stores. For example, a social networking application shares personal information about a user's interactions with the social networking application itself (such as an indication of \u2018I do not want to be disturbed\u2019) and the social networking application also shares personal information derived from a separate calendar application's data store (such as \u2018In a meeting\u2019).","A portable electronic device is capable of operating in a number of different personal information sharing modes (\u201csharing modes\u201d), ranging from full sharing mode to full privacy mode. In full sharing mode all applications of the portable electronic device share personal information without restriction. In full privacy mode, the applications of the portable electronic device are completely restricted from sharing personal information. Between full sharing mode and full privacy mode there exist sharing modes where certain types, quantities or classes of personal information are or are not shared by certain applications of the portable electronic device. Sharing modes can be described as ranging from a high level of sharing, to a low, or a zero level of sharing. Each sharing mode corresponds to a given level of personal information being shared by the applications of the portable electronic device","To simplify the task of alternating between the various sharing modes, a sharing toggle is provided. The sharing toggle provides a single point of access from which a user of the portable device can alter the sharing mode across all applications of the device. The sharing toggle operates to detect a request to restrict or allow the sharing of personal information. Detection typically occurs by a user of the portable electronic device actuating a user interface of the portable electronic device according to a pre-defined set of instructions.","Further embodiments reduce uncertainty which a user of a portable electronic device may have regarding whether or not applications of the portable electronic device are sharing personal information by including a sharing indicator which provides an easily referenced indication to a user of the portable electronic device of whether personal information is presently being shared by the applications of the portable electronic device. The sharing indicator operates in conjunction with the sharing toggle to inform the user of the current sharing mode of the device and provides an indication to the user of the current level of personal information being shared by the portable electronic device with other electronic devices.","A sharing toggle and sharing indicator permit a user of a portable electronic device to control a desired level of personal information sharing, and, by association, a desired level of privacy. The sharing toggle allows a user to alter the ability of multiple applications to share personal information from a single access point, reducing the burden and uncertainty imposed on a user in previous systems. The sharing indicator, in cooperation with the sharing toggle, provides the user with an easy to see indication of the present level of privacy afforded by the device and provides a simple and reliable indicator to the user upon which the user may make a decision about if they are satisfied with the level of privacy or if a change needs to be made via the sharing toggle.","Embodiments of an apparatus for controlled sharing of personal information are provided, the apparatus comprising a plurality of applications adapted to share personal information, a detecting module adapted to detect a request to alter the personal information sharing of the plurality of applications and a controlling module adapted to alter the plurality of applications' sharing of personal information in

Detecting module  and controlling module , which may be embodied in a single module or separately, assist in the controlled sharing of personal information being done by applications . Detecting module  and controlling module  are, for example, software or firmware, or both, and are executed at portable electronic device  to provide controlled sharing of personal information.","In some embodiments, storage mechanism  stores detecting module , controlling module  and applications . In other embodiments, one or more of detecting module , controlling module  and applications  are stored remote from portable electronic device . In such other embodiments, detecting module , controlling module  and applications  are resident on, for example, a server (such as server  of ) and are sent to portable electronic device  for on demand execution.","Applications  share personal information with other electronic devices, typically for further dissemination or use by related applications on the other electronic devices. Each one of the applications  is typically responsible for monitoring, gathering, generating and sending personal information relevant to the respective one of the applications . Applications  determine that new personal information is to be shared, and the personal information is passed on to communication mechanism  formatted as appropriate messages for transmission to the other electronic devices.","Applications  may alternatively share personal information using a sharing module . In embodiments having a sharing module , applications  rely on sharing module  to coordinate and implement the overall sharing of personal information shared by applications . Portable electronic device  can alternatively comprise multiple sharing modules  which are each associated with a particular application of applications . Sharing module(s)  may be integral to one or more of the applications .","Each one of applications  is responsible for identifying, generating and formatting personal information to be sent to other electronic devices via communication mechanism . Using a location application as an example of one of applications , the location application is, among other things, configured to monitor the geographic location of portable electronic device  and to identify that a predetermined threshold of change in the geographic location of portable electronic device  has been exceeded. Upon identifying the change in geographic location, the location application retrieves a current geographic location, generates and formats an encoded information message indicative of the new geographic location and sends the encoded personal information message to other electronic devices via communication mechanism . Similar procedures are used by each of applications  to share relevant personal information as is well known in the art.","Detecting module  detects requests to alter the sharing mode of portable electronic device .

Server  uses and re-sends personal information using well known personal information sharing mechanisms.","As described above in relation to , portable electronic device  comprises applications  which share personal information, and controlling module  which is responsible for establishing and enforcing a desired sharing mode detected by detecting module . There are a number of methods by which controlling module  controls the level of personal information being shared.","In a first exemplary method, shown in , controlling module  operates in cooperation with Application Programming Interface (API)  to receive and execute requests from applications  to share personal information. According to such an exemplary method, applications  are not by themselves capable of sharing personal information. In order to share personal information applications  must send a request, or message, to controlling module  pursuant to API . Upon receipt of a request, controlling module  operates to filter or not filter requests, by either suppressing or transmitting received requests, according to the current sharing mode. For example, if the current sharing mode is set to a full privacy mode, controlling module  filters all received requests to share personal information, ensuring that applications  are not able to share personal information with other electronic devices.","In the example shown in , two personal information sharing messages are sent from applications  to controlling module  via API . The personal information sharing messages are, for example, update messages sent from a social networking application about the current status of portable electronic device . First personal information sharing messages  indicates, for example, that portable electronic device  has been placed into a silent mode, indicating to interested parties that the user of portable electronic device  is not to be disturbed. Second personal information sharing message  indicates, for example, that portable electronic device  has been placed into a low-power mode, indicating to interested parties that the user of portable electronic device  is turning off their portable electronic device. Such exemplary personal information messages could describe a sequence of events where, for example, a user of portable electronic device  arrives home from work, turns the ringer on their device off and at a later time turns their device off when they go to sleep.","According to the example shown in , first personal information sharing message  is sent from applications  to controlling module  via API  while the current sharing mode of portable electronic device  is set to full sharing mode. As shown in , controlling module  does not filter first personal information sharing message . Controlling module  passes first personal information sharing message  (as message \u2032) to communication mechanism  so that first personal information sharing message  can be transmitted to another electronic device (as message \u2033).","According to the example shown in , second personal information sharing message  is sent from applications  to controlling module  via API  after the current sharing mode of portable electronic device  has been changed to full privacy mode. As shown in , controlling module  filters second personal information sharing message  and does not pass it along for transmission by communication mechanism .","In a second exemplary method, as shown in , controlling module  operates to notify applications  about switches to the current level of personal information sharing. Controlling module  notifies applications  of detected changes to the current sharing mode so that applications  behave according to the current sharing mode by only sending requests to controlling module  which are commensurate with the current level of personal information sharing.","In the example shown in , personal information sharing message  is sent from applications  to controlling module . Personal information sharing message  is, for example, an update message sent from a shopping application regarding a recent internet search performed at portable electronic device . Personal information sharing message  includes, for example, information indicating that a user of portable electronic device  has searched for restaurants in New York City using an internet browser application executing at portable electronic device .","According to the example shown in , personal information sharing message  is sent from applications  to controlling module  while the current sharing mode of portable electronic device  is set to full sharing mode. As shown in , controlling module  does not filter personal information sharing message . Controlling module  passes personal information sharing message  (as message \u2032) to communication mechanism  so that personal information sharing message  can be transmitted to another electronic device (as message \u2033).","According to the example shown in , at some time after personal information sharing message  has been sent by applications , detecting module  detects a request to alter the sharing mode of portable electronic device  to a full privacy mode. Pursuant to detecting module  detecting the request, controlling module is notified of the request to enter full privacy mode via message . After receiving message , controlling module  notifies each of the applications of applications  of the change to full privacy mode via message(s) \u2032. Upon receipt of message(s) \u2032, applications  suppress any personal information sharing messages which would have been sent if portable electronic device  were operating according to a full sharing mode.","In a third exemplary method, as shown in , applications  include an unknown, non-registered or non-authorized (i.e. suspect) application  which is executing at portable electronic device . Suspect application  includes applications that are not designed to cooperate with controlling module  and which do not respond to, or behave according to, messages to and from controlling module  (as depicted in and ). According to the example shown in , controlling module  identifies any suspect applications , by, for example, scanning a list of applications executing at portable electronic device . If the scanning identifies any suspect applications , controlling module  may actively monitor messages originating from the suspect applications  for transmission via communication mechanism . Monitoring messages comprises intercepting and inspecting messages originating from suspect applications  before they are sent to other electronic devices by communication mechanism . In some embodiments, during inspection, controlling module  is able to intercept and discard messages which are identified as personal information messages.","As shown in , suspect application  sends two potential personal information sharing messages, both sent while portable electronic device  is operating in a full privacy mode.","As shown in , first potential personal information sharing message  is intercepted by controlling module  at inspection . During inspection , controlling module  determines that first potential information sharing message  is not a personal information sharing message. Controlling module  passes first potential information sharing message  along (as message \u2032) for transmission by communication mechanism  as message \u2033.","As shown in , second potential personal information sharing message  is intercepted by controlling module  at inspection . During inspection , controlling module  determines that second potential information sharing message  is a personal information sharing message. Controlling module  discards or blocks second potential information sharing message  to ensure that second potential information sharing message  is not transmitted to other electronic devices by communication mechanism  according to the full privacy mode.","According to the third exemplary method, controlling module  may prompt a user of portable electronic device  for permission to send intercepted messages, controlling module  may allow the user to establish rules for handling intercepted messages or controlling module  may provide an indication, as described in further detail below in relation to , that controlling module  may not be capable of ensuring that personal information is being shared according to the current sharing mode.","In a fourth exemplary method controlling module  requires applications  to be registered or authorized before they are able to be installed or execute at portable electronic device . Registration and authorization are accomplished according to well known registration or authorization methods, and ensure that applications  are compliant with the controlled sharing of personal information. Such registration or authorization may include testing of personal information sharing functionality to ensure that applications  comply with sharing mode specifications. Such registration or authorization may also include other methods of verifying that applications  will only share personal information in accordance with the current sharing mode and can include source code inspections, code signing or other methods which accomplish this goal.","As shown in , , , and , portable electronic device  is capable of sharing personal information with other electronic devices using communication mechanism . The level of personal information which is shared is controlled by controlling module  according to sharing modes. Controlling module  determines a desired sharing mode through requests from detecting module . Upon receiving, from detecting module , a request to alter the sharing mode, controlling module  restricts or increases the level of personal information being shared by applications  according to the requested sharing mode. Portable electronic device  is, accordingly, capable of providing controlled sharing of personal information.","Turning to , an exemplary method of controlling the sharing of personal information is provided.  describes a method having three steps which cooperate to enable controlled sharing of personal information. The method of  is, for example, carried out at a portable electronic device such as portable electronic device .","During step , personal information is being shared at a specified sharing mode. For example, personal information may be shared according to a full sharing mode, wherein any and all personal information may be shared.","During step , a request to alter the sharing mode is detected. For example, a request may be detected indicating that personal information should be shared according to a full privacy mode, wherein no personal information may be shared.","During step , the sharing mode of step  is altered to correspond to the request detected during step . For example, the sharing mode is altered from full sharing mode to full privacy.","Subsequent to altering the sharing mode in step , step  is resumed. Step  is resumed with an altered sharing mode according to the request detected in step  and the alteration made during step .","Turning to , a first exemplary user interface of a portable electronic device  for controlled sharing of personal information is shown. Portable electronic device , generally defined by its housing , has user interface elements comprising display , keyboard  and navigation device . Display  operates to display graphical user interface elements and in some embodiments is operable to receive user input via touch detection.

Upon actuation of universal sharing toggle , in the example displayed in , all personal information sharing at portable electronic device  is restricted, effectively placing portable electronic device  in full privacy mode. Using the example of , an actuation of universal sharing toggle  initiates a request to alter the sharing mode which is detected by detecting module . Detecting module  passes the request to controlling module  which initiates and imposes a full privacy mode, for example, according to one of the methods shown in , and ","Sharing toggle  further comprises individual sharing toggles  which indicate the status of personal information sharing for a single application of portable electronic device . In the example of , individual sharing toggle indicates that a location application is sharing personal information, individual sharing toggle indicates that a social messaging application (or group of social messaging applications) is not sharing personal information and individual sharing toggle indicates that a messaging application is also not sharing personal information.","An actuation of any of individual sharing toggles  initiates a restriction (or loosening) of the respective application's continued sharing of personal information. In the example of , a first actuation of individual sharing toggle initiates a restriction of personal information sharing permitted by a location application. Similarly, a first actuation of individual sharing toggle initiates an enabling of personal information sharing by a social networking application (or group of social networking applications). Detecting module  is configured to detect actuations of individual sharing toggles  and pass appropriate messages to controlling module  which will initiate and impose a sharing mode according to the requested restriction or enabling of sharing of individual applications.","It is understood that more or fewer individual sharing toggles may be present in sharing toggle  depending on the specific applications of portable electronic device . In some embodiments, groups of applications having a common functionality (such as a group of social networking applications) are included as a single individual sharing toggle.","Sharing toggle  further includes additional access points  which provide access to additional information and options relevant to the sharing of personal information.","Additional access point provides access to a user interface element which provides detailed information about the current status of personal information sharing.","Additional access point provides access to a user interface which permits the modification of options relevant to the sharing of personal information. Such options include the ability to establish automated toggling of personal information sharing according to a schedule or other criteria, such as toggling the sharing mode in step with changes to a notification profile or a sharing profile and the like, the ability to alter the granularity (or level of detail) of shared personal information and the like, to define types, classes and amounts and levels of personal information shared at any given sharing mode and to define new sharing modes and modify existing sharing modes as well as to create, modify and delete privacy profiles.","A privacy profile is associated with a sharing mode and allows a user of portable electronic device  to define certain categories of personal information sharing. For example, a user might create a first privacy profile called \u2018At Home\u2019 and a second privacy profile called \u2018At Work\u2019. A portable electronic device operating according to the \u2018At Home\u2019 privacy profile might not share any personal information about location, but might share personal information about messaging, for example. Similarly, a portable electronic device operating according to an \u2018At Work\u2019 privacy profile might share personal information related to a location application and a calendar application but might not share personal information related to a social networking application.
