title: Change notification query multiplexing
abstract: In order to efficiently handle change notification requests to a storage system based on a database data store and a database engine, the change notification requests are multiplexed. This can be done by issuing a query which refers, for information about what changes are being tracked, to a data structure. The information about what changes to track for each request to be multiplexed is stored in the data structure. Additionally, information about the request can be stored in the data structure. By adding information to the data structure, the query can be altered without needing to directly modify or reissue the query.

No. 10\/646,580, filed on Aug. 21, 2003, entitled \u201cSYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DATA MODELING IN AN ITEM-BASED STORAGE PLATFORM\u201d.","The present invention relates generally to the field of information storage and retrieval, and, more particularly, to a storage platform providing change notifications regarding changes in stored information.","In many computer systems, the storage and retrieval of information for and by computer applications is handled by one or more central storage systems. For example, one type of storage system commonly used in personal computers is a file-folder-and-directory-based system, also termed a \u201cfile system.\u201d Such file systems organize pluralities of files into hierarchies to create an abstraction of the physical organization of the storage medium used to store the files. Generally, such organization into a hierarchy occurs at the operating system level. The files stored generally include the file hierarchy itself (the \u201cdirectory\u201d) embodied in a special file maintained by the file system. This directory, in turn, maintains a list of entries corresponding to all of the other files in the directory and the nodal location of such files in the hierarchy (herein referred to as the folders).","The use of file system for central storage has several limitations. These may be overcome by using relational database technology as the underpinning of a central storage system, as described in the patent in the patent applications referenced above in the \u201cCross-Reference\u201d section.","In an application using data stored in a storage system, some activity of the application may be predicated on changes to the data stored in the storage system. For example, an email program may wish to know when a new email message arrives. In certain systems, email messages arrive and are stored on the storage system. When a new message arrives, the email program can then perform any internal processing using the fact that a new email message has arrived or using the content of the email message. For example, some email programs contain rules used to process messages. The application of these rules is triggered, in some cases, by the arrival of a new message. Additionally, there may be user interface changes based on changes to data stored in the storage system. For example, upon the arrival of a new message, an alert may be presented to the user which indicates that a new message has arrived. A list of messages may be refreshed to include the new message.","In view of the foregoing, there is a need for a change notifier that can be used in a database-based storage system and provides for good performance and scalability. The present invention satisfies this need.","The invention provides for the multiplexing of change notification requests through the issuing of a combined query. In one embodiment, the invention is a storage platform which includes a data store, a database engine which provides a way for interaction to occur with the data store, and an API that provides a way for application programs to issue change notification requests. At least two change notification requests are multiplexed and a combined query is used to query the data store (via a query to the database engine). A data structure, in one embodiment in the form of a table including query parameters, can be used to multiplex queries. The data structure stores the parameters for a change notification request and a query is issued which refers to the data structure to determine what changes are being tracked for notification. When a compatible second change notification request is received, the parameters for that second change notification request is added to the data structure. This alters the query without requiring the reissuing of the query to the database engine. Methods according to the invention can be implemented by instructions stored on a computer-readable medium","Other features and advantages of the invention may become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention and accompanying drawings.","Numerous embodiments of the present invention may execute on a computer.  and the following discussion are intended to provide a brief general description of a suitable computing environment in which the invention may be implemented. Although not required, various aspects of the invention may be described in the general context of computer executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer, such as a client workstation or a server. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures and the like that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover, the invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand held devices, multi processor systems, microprocessor based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers and the like. The invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.","As shown in , an exemplary general purpose computing system includes a conventional personal computer  or the like, including a processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory to the processing unit . The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. The system memory includes read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the personal computer , such as during start up, is stored in ROM . The personal computer  may further include a hard disk drive  for reading from and writing to a hard disk, not shown, a magnetic disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable optical disk  such as a CD ROM or other optical media. The hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  are connected to the system bus  by a hard disk drive interface , a magnetic disk drive interface , and an optical drive interface , respectively. The drives and their associated computer readable media provide non volatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the personal computer . Although the exemplary environment described herein employs a hard disk, a removable magnetic disk  and a removable optical disk , it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media which can store data that is accessible by a computer, such as magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video disks, Bernoulli cartridges, random access memories (RAMs), read only memories (ROMs) and the like may also be used in the exemplary operating environment. Likewise, the exemplary environment may also include many types of monitoring devices such as heat sensors and security or fire alarm systems, and other sources of information.","A number of program modules may be stored on the hard disk, magnetic disk , optical disk , ROM  or RAM , including an operating system , one or more application programs , other program modules  and program data . A user may enter commands and information into the personal computer  through input devices such as a keyboard  and pointing device . Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite disk, scanner or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a serial port interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interfaces, such as a parallel port, game port or universal serial bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor , personal computers typically include other peripheral output devices (not shown), such as speakers and printers. The exemplary system of  also includes a host adapter , Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) bus , and an external storage device  connected to the SCSI bus .","The personal computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be another personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the personal computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) . Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the personal computer  is connected to the LAN  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, the personal computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the wide area network , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, is connected to the system bus  via the serial port interface . In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the personal computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","As illustrated in the block diagram of , a computer system  can be roughly divided into three component groups: the hardware component , the hardware\/software interface system component , and the applications programs component  (also referred to as the \u201cuser component\u201d or \u201csoftware component\u201d in certain contexts herein).","In various embodiments of a computer system , and referring back to , the hardware component  may comprise the central processing unit (CPU) , the memory (both ROM  and RAM ), the basic input\/output system (BIOS) , and various input\/output (I\/O) devices such as a keyboard , a mouse , a monitor , and\/or a printer (not shown), among other things. The hardware component  comprises the basic physical infrastructure for the computer system .","The applications programs component  comprises various software programs including but not limited to compilers, database systems, word processors, business programs, videogames, and so forth. Application programs provide the means by which computer resources are utilized to solve problems, provide solutions, and process data for various users (machines, other computer systems, and\/or end-users).","The hardware\/software interface system component  comprises (and, in some embodiments, may solely consist of) an operating system that itself comprises, in most cases, a shell and a kernel. An \u201coperating system\u201d (OS) is a special program that acts as an intermediary between application programs and computer hardware. The hardware\/software interface system component  may also comprise a virtual machine manager (VMM), a Common Language Runtime (CLR) or its functional equivalent, a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or its functional equivalent, or other such software components in the place of or in addition to the operating system in a computer system. The purpose of a hardware\/software interface system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute application programs. The goal of any hardware\/software interface system is to make the computer system convenient to use, as well as utilize the computer hardware in an efficient manner.","The hardware\/software interface system is generally loaded into a computer system at startup and thereafter manages all of the application programs in the computer system. The application programs interact with the hardware\/software interface system by requesting services via an application program interface (API). Some application programs enable end-users to interact with the hardware\/software interface system via a user interface such as a command language or a graphical user interface (GUI).","A hardware\/software interface system traditionally performs a variety of services for applications. In a multitasking hardware\/software interface system where multiple programs may be running at the same time, the hardware\/software interface system determines which applications should run in what order and how much time should be allowed for each application before switching to another application for a turn. The hardware\/software interface system also manages the sharing of internal memory among multiple applications, and handles input and output to and from attached hardware devices such as hard disks, printers, and dial-up ports. The hardware\/software interface system also sends messages to each application (and, in certain case, to the end-user) regarding the status of operations and any errors that may have occurred. The hardware\/software interface system can also offload the management of batch jobs (e.g., printing) so that the initiating application is freed from this work and can resume other processing and\/or operations. On computers that can provide parallel processing, a hardware\/software interface system also manages dividing a program so that it runs on more than one processor at a time.","A hardware\/software interface system shell (simply referred to herein as a \u201cshell\u201d) is an interactive end-user interface to a hardware\/software interface system. (A shell may also be referred to as a \u201ccommand interpreter\u201d or, in an operating system, as an \u201coperating system shell\u201d). A shell is the outer layer of a hardware\/software interface system that is directly accessible by application programs and\/or end-users. In contrast to a shell, a kernel is a hardware\/software interface system's innermost layer that interacts directly with the hardware components.","While it is envisioned that numerous embodiments of the present invention are particularly well-suited for computerized systems, nothing in this document is intended to limit the invention to such embodiments. On the contrary, as used herein the term \u201ccomputer system\u201d is intended to encompass any and all devices capable of storing and processing information and\/or capable of using the stored information to control the behavior or execution of the device itself, regardless of whether such devices are electronic, mechanical, logical, or virtual in nature.","As discussed above, it is useful, for some applications, to have a notification of a change to data stored in the storage system. In at least one storage system using relational database technology, Microsoft Corp.'s WinFS, such notifications are handled by a notification service. In WinFS, an application programming interface (API) allows for such notification requests in WinFS. WinFS API watchers are a set of classes that allow applications to be selectively notified of changes in the WinFS store and provide state information that can be persisted by the application to support suspend\/resume scenarios. Through the API an application can create a watcher to watch for specific changes in the storage system. When the change occurs, the watcher raises an event and sends data regarding the change.","A watcher watches for specified changes in the data. In WinFS, data to be stored in the storage system is stored as items. Each item has an associated type. The type of the item is a schema which defines the structure of and properties for the item. In addition, the storage system stores associations between items, known as relationships. An extension can also be associated with an item. Extensions are used to extend a type. An application defines an extension to an item type. For an example, for the \u201cperson\u201d type, the schema used by the storage system defines first name, last name, and birth date, etc. as the fields of an item of this type. However, no field for eye color data exists in the person type. If one is needed, then an application can extend the person type by defining an eye color extension. When such an extension is in place, eye color data can be stored in this extension as part of an item of type person.","The watcher class can notify your application of changes to different aspects of WinFS objects, including the following:","Item changes","Item extension changes","Relationship changes","Watchers can act on complicated items. For example, where an item is a hierarchy of other items, the watcher can watch the item and the items in the hierarchy for any changes.","Event data is returned when a watcher raises an event (because it is determined that the change for which notification was requested has occurred). This event data includes data which allows the requesting entity to understand what has occurred, e.g., the identity of the item changed, the type of change (add, modify, delete), etc.","When a watcher raises an event, it sends watcher state data with the event notification. The application can store this state data for later retrieval. Subsequently, the watcher state data can be used to request notification of events for all changes that occurred after the state was generated.","The watcher APIs can be implemented using a command which waits for a result from a query or for a timeout. One such command in the SQL language is \u201cwaitfor.\u201d Thus, a watcher which is being requested to look for a change to a certain item ItemToBeWatched might use a query Q(ItemToBeWatched) which only returns when and if a change in ItemToBeWatched occurs, and the watcher would implement a command analogous to the following pseudocode command:","waitfor (Q(ItemToBeWatched))","Appendix A includes actual SQL code which can implement the such a query. The SQL code in Appendix A includes a waitfor query which waits for any item changes to occur in a folder item (folderId). The first portion (\u201cSELECT 1 . . . \u201d) is a query which returns when an item is added to the folder. The second portion (\u201cSELECT 2 . . . \u201d) is a query which returns when an item in the folder is modified. The third portion (\u201cSELECT 3 . . . \u201d) is a query which returns when an item in the folder is deleted.","Thus, change notifications may be accomplished for an application. However, there may be many changes in the data stored in the storage system which are of interest to an application, and so an application may create many watchers to watch different kind of changes. Knowledge about changes in various items, extensions, and relationships may require the use of many change notifiers. However, such queries issued against the database which is at the core of the storage system places a high load on the database server. This high load may cause decreased performance of the storage system by using CPU time and memory. Additionally, scalability is adversely affected; even if a storage system can adequately handle having a number of watchers, it may be impossible to scale up the system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["310","320","310","320","310","320","310","310","310","320"]},"The data store  and data engine  are used as a central storage system for computer system . The data store  provides the storage for the computer system , the database engine , among other tasks, provides storage functionality for application programs . One way in which functionality is provided by the database engine  for application programs  is by exposing application programs interfaces (APIs) . One of these APIs  is watcher API (). The watcher API () allows a watcher to be requested by an application program . The application program  can request a watcher in order to request notification whenever a specific change occurs to data in the data store . For example, an application program  may request to be notified when a document is modified. In the case where data store  supports folder trees with a hierarchy that arranges documents under the folder tree, an application program  may specify a folder tree, and request notification when any document is modified under that folder tree.","The watcher API () queries to the database engine . The query returns only when the specified change occurs. In one embodiment, the watcher notifies the requesting application only that the change has occurred. In another embodiment, the watcher includes in the change notification to the requesting application program  information about the type of change that has occurred. In some embodiments, if no changes occur within a timeout period, the change notification request expires. In one such an embodiment, expiration is not reported to the requesting application program . Watcher API () just resubmits the query request after a query expires. The expiration is, in one embodiment, reported to the requesting application program .","In order to provide the advantages of the present invention, some change notification requests are multiplexed.
