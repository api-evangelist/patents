{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The U.S. Government may have certain rights in this invention in accordance with Contract No. N00019-96-C-0080 awarded by the Dept. of the Navy.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates generally to gas turbine engine turbine blade squealer tip cooling and, more specifically, to turbine blade squealer tips cooled using cooling holes through a tip shelf.","2. Description of Related Art","Gas turbine engine turbine blades extract energy from hot combustion gas for powering the compressor and providing output power. Since the turbine blades are directly exposed to the hot combustion gas, they are typically provided with internal cooling circuits which channel a coolant, such as compressor bleed air, through the airfoil of the blade and through various film cooling holes around the surface thereof. One type of airfoil extends from a root at a blade platform, which defines the radially inner flowpath for the combustion gas, to a radially outer tip cap, and includes opposite pressure and suction sides extending axially from leading to trailing edges of the airfoil. The cooling circuit extends inside the airfoil between the pressure and suction sides and is bounded at its top by the airfoil tip cap. A squealer tip blade has a squealer tip wall extending radially outwardly from the top of the tip cap and completely around the perimeter of the airfoil on the tip cap to define a radially outwardly open tip cavity.","The squealer tip is a short radial extension of the airfoil wall and is spaced radially closely adjacent to an outer turbine shroud to provide a relatively small clearance gap therebetween for gas flowpath sealing purposes. Differential thermal expansion between the blade and the shroud, centrifugal loading, and radial accelerations cause the squealer tips to rub against the turbine shroud and abrade. Since the squealer tips extend radially above the tip cap, the tip cap itself and the remainder of the airfoil is protected from damage, which maintains integrity of the turbine blade and the cooling circuit therein.","However, since the squealer tips are solid metal projections of the airfoil, they are directly heated by the combustion gas which flows thereover. They are cooled by heat conduction with the heat then being removed by convection into the tip cap and cooling air injected into the cavity by passages through the tip. The cooling air from within the airfoil cooling circuit is used to convect heat away from tip and to inject into cavity. The squealer tip typically operates at temperatures above that of the remainder of the airfoil and can be a life limiting element of the airfoil in a hot turbine environment.","Since the pressure side of an airfoil typically experiences the highest heat load from the combustion gas, a row of conventional film cooling holes is typically provided in the pressure side of the airfoil outer wall immediately below the tip cap for providing a cooling film which flows upwardly over the pressure side of the squealer tip. U.S. Pat. No. 6,164,914 discloses a turbine blade including a hollow airfoil having a squealer tip wall extending outboard from a tip cap enclosing the airfoil. Film cooling holes extend through the junction of the tip cap below the pressure-side portion of the tip rib for discharging the coolant in a layer of film cooling air for flow along the exposed pressure side of the squealer tip wall. It is difficult to entrain the cooling air flow in a boundary layer along the exposed pressure side of the squealer tip wall. Often the film cooling holes will direct the cooling air to impinge on the pressure side of the squealer tip wall and a large portion will bounce off and not be entrained in the boundary layer.","However, cooling of the squealer wall is limited in effectiveness, and thermal gradients and stress therefrom are created which also affect blade life. The exposed squealer wall runs hotter than the airfoil sidewalls with the tip cap therebetween running cooler. Tip cooling must therefore be balanced against undesirable thermal gradients.","A turbine blade includes an airfoil having an airfoil outer wall extending longitudinally outwardly from a root, pressure side and suction sides extending laterally from a leading edge to a trailing edge of the airfoil, and a squealer tip at a radially outer end of the airfoil. The squealer tip includes a radially outer tip cap attached to the airfoil outer wall, a continuous squealer tip wall extending radially outwardly from and continuously around the tip cap forming a radially outwardly open tip cavity, and a recessed tip wall portion recessed inboard from the pressure side of the airfoil outer wall forming a tip shelf therebetween. An internal cooling circuit extends longitudinally outwardly from the root to the tip cap and a plurality of film cooling shelf holes are disposed through the tip shelf to the internal cooling circuit and spaced away from a junction between the recessed tip wall portion and the tip shelf.","In an exemplary of the turbine blade, the film cooling shelf holes have shelf hole centerlines passing through pierce points in the shelf angled at compound angles with respect to vertical lines passing through the pierce points. The compound angles have orthogonal first and second component angles. The first component angles lie in first planes defined by the vertical lines and first coordinate lines that are normal to the vertical lines and extend between the vertical lines and the recessed tip wall portion. The second component angles lie in second planes defined by the vertical lines and second coordinate lines that are normal to the vertical lines and normal to the first coordinate lines. At least a majority of the shelf hole centerlines are angled in outboard directions away from and outboard of the squealer tip wall. Their shelf hole centerlines are angled at the second component angles in downstream lateral directions with respect to vertical lines wherein the downstream lateral directions are normal to corresponding ones of the outboard directions and the vertical lines.","In a more particular embodiment of the turbine blade the first coordinate lines lie along transverse lines which are substantially shortest distances between the vertical lines are shortest distances between the vertical lines and the recessed tip wall portion. The shelf hole centerlines are spaced away from a fillet at the junction. The film cooling shelf holes extend into the fillet no more than 50 percent of a fillet width of the fillet as measured along the tip shelf. The majority of first component angles are in a range between 2 degrees and 16 degrees. A first plurality of the film cooling shelf holes have shelf hole centerlines with the positive first component angles in a range between 0.5 degrees and 5 degrees. The turbine blade is made with a nickel-base superalloy having a free sulfur content less than about 1 part per million by weight.","Illustrated in  is an exemplary gas turbine engine turbine rotor blade  configured for use as a first stage high pressure turbine blade. The blade  includes a dovetail  having suitable tangs  for mounting the blade in corresponding dovetail slots in the perimeter of a rotor disk (not shown). The blade  further includes an airfoil  joined to the dovetail  at an airfoil base  at an integral platform  and a squealer tip  at a radially outer end  of the airfoil. The squealer tip  includes an airfoil shaped squealer tip cap . The airfoil  further includes a continuous outer wall  with laterally opposite pressure and suction sides  and , respectively, extending longitudinally between a leading edge  and an opposite trailing edge  and radially from the airfoil base  to the tip cap . The airfoil is designed to withstand the deteriorating effects of a hot flowpath gas .","The airfoil  further includes an internal cooling channel or circuit  which extends from the tip cap  to the root and through the dovetail  for circulating or channeling a suitable coolant , such as air which may be bled from a conventional compressor (not shown) for cooling the blade . The internal cooling channel or circuit  is radially outwardly bound by the tip cap . The exemplary embodiment of the blade  is formed as a one-piece casting of the dovetail , airfoil , and platform  of a suitable high temperature metal such as nickel-base superalloys in a single crystal configuration which enjoys suitable strength at high temperature operation. A particular embodiment of the blade  is made of a more particular nickel-base superalloy having a free sulfur content less than about 1 part per million by weight (ppmw) which is disclosed in greater detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,333,121. This low sulfur nickel-base superalloy (also referred to as N5) material helps reduce oxidation of the squealer tip .","The squealer tip  includes a continuous squealer tip wall  extending radially outwardly from and entirely around the airfoil shaped tip cap  along the pressure and suction sides  and , respectively, of the airfoil . The squealer tip wall  and tip cap  may be integrally formed or cast with the airfoil or be brazed or welded or otherwise attached to the airfoil. The squealer tip wall  extends around the tip cap  between laterally spaced apart leading and trailing edges  and  of the airfoil  to define a radially outwardly open tip cavity .","Further referring to , a recessed tip wall portion  is recessed inboard from the pressure side  of the airfoil outer wall  forming a tip shelf  between the recessed tip wall portion  and the pressure side  of the airfoil outer wall . Thus the internal cooling circuit  is bounded in part by the recessed tip wall portion. A plurality of film cooling shelf holes  are disposed through the tip shelf  to the internal cooling circuit . The shelf holes  are spaced away from a junction  between the recessed tip wall portion  and the tip shelf . The shelf hole centerlines  are spaced away from a fillet  having a fillet radius R at the junction . The film cooling shelf holes  may extend into the fillet no more than 50 percent of a fillet width W of the fillet as measured along the tip shelf  from the end of the fillet to the recessed tip wall portion . The location of the film cooling shelf holes  away from the recessed tip wall portion  reduces or avoids crack initiation. The exemplary embodiment of the turbine blade is designed to have between 18 and 23 shelf holes  each having a hole diameter DH in a range of about 14\u201318 mils (0.014\u20130.018 inches).","Further referring to , the film cooling shelf holes  have shelf hole centerlines  passing through pierce points  in the shelf  and angled at compound angles C with respect to the vertical lines  passing through the pierce points . The compound angles C have orthogonal first and second component angles A and B. The first component angles A lie in first planes E defined by the vertical lines  and first coordinate lines , normal to the vertical lines , between the vertical lines  and the recessed tip wall portion . The second component angles B lie in second planes F defined by the vertical lines  and second coordinate lines  that are normal to the vertical lines  and normal to first coordinate lines . In the exemplary embodiment of the blade  illustrated herein the first coordinate lines  lie along transverse lines which are substantially shortest distances  between the vertical lines  and the recessed tip wall portion .","A majority of the film cooling shelf holes  have shelf hole centerlines  have positive first component angles A and which point in generally outboard directions  away from and outboard of the squealer tip wall . Thus, the majority of the shelf hole centerlines  are angled in outboard directions  away from and outboard of the squealer tip wall . The shelf hole centerlines  are angled at the second angles B in downstream lateral directions  with respect to vertical lines  and the downstream lateral directions  are normal to corresponding ones of the outboard directions .","Referring to exemplary Table 1 illustrated in , the exemplary embodiment of the blade  has 23 tip wall film cooling holes H\u2013H of which H\u2013H are the film cooling shelf holes . The tip wall film cooling holes H\u2013H are used to film cool the pressure side  of the airfoil outer wall  including the recessed tip wall portion . The shelf hole centerlines  of the film cooling shelf holes  have positive first component angles A in a range between O degrees and 16 degrees. The tip wall film cooling holes H\u2013H, H\u2013H, and H\u2013H illustrate a majority of the film cooling shelf holes  having shelf hole centerlines  with the positive first component angles A between 2 degrees and 16 degrees. The tip wall film cooling holes H\u2013H, H\u2013H, and H\u2013H illustrate a plurality of the film cooling shelf holes  having shelf hole centerlines  with the positive first component angles A between 0.5 degrees and 5 degrees. The pressure side  of the airfoil outer wall  including the recessed tip wall portion  is angled away from the shelf hole centerlines  in inboard directions at tip angles D as illustrated in  and Table 1. The positive first component angles A of the shelf hole centerlines  of the film cooling shelf holes  direct the cooling air to be entrained in the boundary layer and not impinge on the pressure side of the squealer tip wall so as to cause a large portion of the cooling air to bounce off the wall and not be entrained in the boundary layer.","Referring to , an external surface  of the outer wall  of airfoil  is film cooled by flowing cooling air through leading edge shower head cooling holes  and downstream angled film cooling airfoil holes  along the outer wall . The tip wall film cooling holes H\u2013H and H\u2013 are radially outwardly angled shaped cooling holes  disposed through the pressure side  of the airfoil  immediately below the tip cap  for flowing cooling air radially outwardly along an outboard side  of squealer tip wall . The squealer tip wall  includes a flat top  for maintaining a relatively small radial gap G between the tip wall and a turbine shroud  for reducing leakage of the flowpath gas  therebetween during operation. During portions of the engine's operation, the squealer tip wall  will rub against the shroud  protecting the remainder of the airfoil  and tip cap  from damage. This will cause an acceptable and planned amount of cracking in the tip wall  which is periodically replaced during overhauls. A plurality of chordally spaced apart tip cap supply holes  extend radially through the tip cap  in flow communication with the cooling circuit  inside the airfoil  for channeling respective portions of the coolant  therefrom and into the tip cavity  for cooling the tip, the cavity, and inboard side  of the tip wall  by convection. The tip cap supply holes  are located near the tip wall  along the suction side  of the continuous outer wall  to help purge the cavity  of hot gases and cool the tip wall .","Illustrated in  is a thermal barrier coating (TBC)  which coats the entire inner surface bounding the tip cavity  along inboard side  of the squealer tip wall , a radially outwardly facing surface  of the tip cap  within the squealer tip wall , the flat top , the outboard side , and the external surface  of the airfoil  along both the pressure and suction sides  and , respectively, from the root  to the squealer tip . The TBC coatings may be of any well known and conventional composition, such as yttria stabilized zirconia, which is a thermally insulating ceramic material. The thermal barrier coating (TBC) inside and outside the tip cavity  and on the tip cap  and the flat top  of the squealer tip wall  insulates the squealer tip  from hot gas ingestion and spikes in temperature during engine transients.","The present invention has been described in an illustrative manner.
