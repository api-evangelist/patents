title: Point-of-use status indicator
abstract: A point-of-use energy status indicator monitoring the presence or absence of energy at a monitored device that is required for proper operation of a point-of-use device. The point-of-use indicator being in two-way communication with a status determining device that monitors the monitored device. The status determining device being capable of overriding a utility or energy management system curtailment of energy to the monitored device in response to receiving a signal from a means for overriding located in the point-of-use energy status indicator.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENTS","STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["Not applicable","Not applicable","The present invention relates to various energy consuming devices that can be remotely controlled by utility companies and\/or energy management systems to conserve energy and\/or reduce energy cost, and particularly to a point-of-use status indicator for indicating the energy status of such devices.","It is well known for utility companies to request voluntary curtailment of commodities such as electricity and gas during peak consumption periods. These curtailments have generally been accomplished by utility demand response systems in which the customer receives some incentive for permitting a utility operated shutoff to be place on certain high energy consuming appliances such as hot water heaters, clothes dryers, HVAC systems, etc. These shutoff devices have generally been located on or near the particular appliance being controlled and usually can not be easily accessed or controlled by the customer. Home and small businesses owners have also voluntarily restricted commodity consumption to reduce utility cost. This has generally been accomplished by manually operating the circuit breakers for high energy using appliances to prohibit use during peak and\/or high cost usage time. Manual curtailment generally requires access to the electrical service entrance panel to turn the appliance circuit breakers ON and OFF, which is extremely inconvenient if use of the curtailed appliance is required immediately. Computer controlled energy management systems are now being developed for residential and small business use. These systems automatically monitor energy consumption, utility rates, peak usage periods, etc., and control energy costs by curtailing energy usage according to criteria selected by the resident or business owner, such as energy cost, peak usage time or time of day, which are programmed into the system.","The present invention provides a point-of-use status indicator and an energy curtailment override device. The status indicator indicates to a potential user of a particular point-of-use device, the power status of a monitored device that could be the particular point-of-use device or a remote appliance or device required for proper use of the particular point-of-use device. The power status being one of power available at the monitored device or power not available at the monitored device. If the monitored device is not receiving energy from a power source the indicator provides a user defined message indicating why energy is not being supplied to the monitored device. Example messages could be SLEEP indicating a user initiated energy curtailment, UTILITY indicating a utility company demand response event, PEAK indicating a peak energy cost curtailment or OUTAGE indicating a utility company outage. The indicator can also indicate how long power has been curtailed. In some applications, the status indicator can also indicate to the potential user whether the available power source for the monitored device is from the utility or a backup generator. The override device permits the potential user to over ride a utility or voluntarily initiated energy curtailment of the monitored device from the point-of-use location.","Before one embodiment of the invention is explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction described herein or as illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in various other ways. Further, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A-1F","b":"10"},"Referring now to , which represent the floor plan of a typical two story residence, the invention will be described in greater detail. The point-of-use status indicator  can be located either on or near a point-of-use appliance or device  and indicates the status of a monitored device , which is required for proper operation of the point-of-use device . The point-of-use device  can include appliances or devices such, as but not limited to, a shower , bath tub , faucet , clothes washer , clothes dryer , dish washer , electric or gas range and oven , gas logs  or a thermostat  controlling a HVAC system that can include A\/C, heat pump, gas or electric furnace (generically indicated by reference numeral ) etc., that are spread throughout the residence, as shown in . The monitored device  is generally, but not always, an appliance or device located remotely from the point-of-use device . The monitored device  can be the point-of-used device  or other appliances or devices such as, but not limited to, a hot water heater , a remotely operable branch circuit breaker  in a load center , a relay or remotely operable electrical switch, generally indicated as , or an electrically operated gas or oil valve  controlling the electrical, gas or oil power required for proper operation of the point-of-use devices  indicated above.","A status determining device , located at the monitored device , determines the presence or absence of power at the monitored device  and is linked by wired or wireless two-way communications means to the status indicator . The status determining device  can be an integral part of the monitored device  or a separate relay or sensor of appropriate type to determine the presence of power (electricity, gas, oil) at the monitored device .","Referring again to , each point-of-use status indicator  is associated with a particular point-of-use device  and includes a power indicator  that indicates whether the monitored device , required for proper operation of the associated point-of-use device , is or is not receiving energy from the utility company or other source, such as a generator  (). In its simplest form, the power indication  can be a LED', which is illuminated if the monitored device  is not receiving power. If the monitored device  is not receiving power a display  can provide an indication of the reason energy is not being supplied. This can be a user defined message or a menu selectable message. Example energy curtailment status messages, such as PEAK, SLEEP, RESTORED 2 HRS, UTILITY and OUTAGE are shown on the displays  in . The messages can be provided as text messages on display  as shown in the figures or as an audible recording through a small speaker . The status indicator  can also include a means , such as a button, for overriding a curtailed monitored device . The override button  is also linked to the monitored device , by wired or wireless means, for providing an override signal to the monitored device . Depending on the type of monitored device  being overridden, one push of the override button  can either provide an override of the monitored device  until the next curtailment event or for some preset time period, such as 30 minutes. A second push of the override button  can either reinstate the curtailment of the monitored device  or add an additional preset time period to the override. The status indicator  can also include an occupancy sensor (not shown) for initiating the status indicator  operation when a potential point-of-use device user enters a room in which the point-of-use device  is located. Since the status indicator  is essentially a stand alone device and is intended to operate during a power outage it also includes a battery (not shown) for power."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The features of the invention will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description of the invention read together with the drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A-1F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
