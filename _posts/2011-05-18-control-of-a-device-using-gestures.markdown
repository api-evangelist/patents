{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This patent application relates generally to controlling a device using gestures.","A gesture can refer to a predefined movement across the touch screen of a device, such as a mobile telephone. An example of a gesture is a swipe of a finger from corner-to-corner of the touch screen. This gesture, or others like it, can trigger the device to perform a particular function, such as performing a search on the device. Other programs also employ gesture-based control. For example, the FIREFOX Web browser can be configured, using third-party plug-ins, to react to commands input by predefined mouse gestures.","Among other things, this patent application describes a method performed on a processing device, in which the following operations may be performed in an operating system on the processing device: detecting a gesture input via a user interface; identifying an operating system operation that corresponds to the gesture; performing the operating system operation; identifying an application running on the operating system that has subscribed to gesture input; and passing data corresponding to the gesture to the application for use by the application. The data may be passed via an application programming interface (API) for the operating system. The method may include any appropriate features described herein, examples of which are the following.","The data corresponding to the gesture may be used by the application to perform an application operation that is different from the operating system operation. The operating system operation may include at least one of opening the application, copying data, pasting data to the application, deleting data, and moving data. The application operation may include at least one of opening a note, opening a message, and adding a recipient to an existing message. Identifying the application running on the operating system that has subscribed to gesture input may include referencing a database associated with the operating system.","This patent application also describes a method performed on a processing device, in which the following operations may be performed in an operating system on the processing device: receiving an input via a user interface; identifying data corresponding to one or more gestures based on the input; sending the data, via an API, to an application running on the operating system; determining that the data corresponds to one or more operating system operations; and performing the one or more operating system operations. The following operations may be performed in the application: receiving the data; determining that the data corresponds to one or more application operations; and performing the one or more application operations. The method may include any appropriate features described herein, examples of which are the following.","The data may correspond to plural operating system operations, and the operating system may perform the plural operating system operations in response to the data. The data may correspond to plural application operations, and the application may perform the plural application operations in response to the data. The operating system may perform an operation that corresponds to the data; and the application may perform another operation that corresponds to the data and that is different from the operation performed by the operating system. The one or more operating system operations performed by the operating system may include activating the application; and the one or more application operations performed by the application may include activating a function of the application.","The application may be a first application, and the one or more operating system operations performed by the operating system may include: copying data from a second application running on the operating system, activating the first application, and pasting the data from the second application into the first application.","The user interface may include a touch screen, the input may include coordinates on the touch screen, and the operating system may identify the input as corresponding to the one or more gestures by correlating the coordinates to data corresponding to the gesture.","This patent application also describes a method performed on a device that includes a touch screen, which runs an operating system and one or more computer program on the operating system. The method may include the following operations: receiving an input via the touch screen; interpreting the input as one or more gestures; controlling one or more functions of the operating system using at least one of the one or more gestures; and controlling one or more functions of the one or more computer programs using at least one of the one or more gestures. The method may include any appropriate features described herein, examples of which are the following.","A same one of the one or more gestures may control both the one or more functions of the operating system and the one or more functions of the one or more computer programs. Different gestures of the one or more gestures may control the one or more functions of the operating system and the one or more functions of the one or more computer programs.","Interpreting the input as one or more gestures may include the following operations: converting the input to data, and comparing the data against data for predefined gestures to identify the one or more gestures. The data may be passed from the operating system to the one or more computer programs via an application programming interface. Controlling one or more functions of the operating system may include copying data from a first one of the one or more computer programs and pasting the copied data into a second one of the one or more computer programs. Controlling one or more functions of the one or more computer programs may include activating a function of the second one of the one or more computer programs into which the copied data is pasted.","All or part of the systems and processes described herein may be implemented as a computer program product that includes instructions that are stored on one or more non-transitory machine-readable storage media and that are executable on one or more processing devices. Examples of non-transitory machine-readable storage media include e.g., read-only memory, an optical disk drive, memory disk drive, random access memory, and the like. All or part of the systems and processes described herein may be implemented as an apparatus, method, or electronic system that may include one or more processing devices and memory to store executable instructions to implement the stated functions.","The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.","Described herein is a process, which may be performed on a device, such as a smartphone or tablet computer, that includes a user interface (e.g., a touch screen), and that runs an operating system and one or more computer program on the operating system. The process includes receiving an input via the user interface, interpreting the input as one or more gestures, controlling one or more functions of the operating system using at least one of the one or more gestures, and controlling one or more functions of the one or more computer programs using at least one of the one or more gestures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","101","101","102","100","102","102","100","100","103","104","105"],"i":["a ","b"]},"A gesture may be input to the smartphone by tracing one's finger across the touch screen. In the example of , a gesture  in the shape of the letter \u201cN\u201d has been traced across the touch screen. This gesture  may trigger actions by both the smartphone's operating system and by an app that runs on that operating system. For example, the smartphone's operating system may be configured to recognize this gesture (the traced \u201cN\u201d), and to execute the NOTES app in response. Likewise, the NOTES app may be configured also to recognize this same gesture  and to open a new note document into which a note can be typed. The resulting NOTES app interface , into which a new note can be typed, is then displayed on touch screen interface , as shown in . Thus, this \u201cshortcut\u201d gesture  takes the place of two or more actions that would otherwise be required to write a note using the NOTES app. For example, the gesture  may eliminate the need to locate NOTES app on another page of the touch screen. The gesture  also eliminates the need to touch, and thereby execute, NOTES app . And, the gesture  eliminates the need to separately control the NOTES app to open-up a new note (thereby eliminating the need to display a NOTES app interface , which is depicted crossed-out to indicate that it is not displayed).","In another example, a single gesture  (e.g., the traced \u201cN\u201d above) may trigger execution of an app, and no app-specific functionality. For example, the single gesture may open NOTES app only, and not trigger any functionality within NOTES app ","A sequence of gestures may be used to trigger app execution and app-specific functionality. In the example of , a series of gestures (\u201cN's\u201d) , are traced across touch screen . Only two are shown here, but any number of gestures may be traced. The smartphone's operating system may recognize the initial gesture as a trigger to execute NOTES app . The operating system may also recognize the second gesture as an instruction to NOTES app . As described below, the operating system may identify data (e.g., a command) associated with that second gesture , and pass that data to NOTES app , which may perform a corresponding function in response to that data. For example, in response to a command, NOTES app may automatically open a new note document (NOTES app interface ) into which a note can be typed. This variation provides the advantages described above, including eliminating display of NOTES app interface  (). In addition, this variation provides additional flexibility in that the second gesture in sequence may vary to control different functions of the app. In the case of NOTES app , for example, the gesture sequence may be \u201cND\u201d, with the gesture \u201cN\u201d instructing the smartphone operating system to open the NOTES app, and the gesture \u201cD\u201d instructing the NOTES app to delete a first note in the NOTES app.","In an extension of the foregoing variation, the input gesture may be \u201cND2\u201d, \u201cND3\u201d, etc., to instruct execution of the NOTES app and deletion of the second, third, etc. note in the NOTES app.","In another example, gestures may be used to pass information between apps on a smartphone. In the example of , a browser app is executed, and displays a list of search results . The gesture , in this case, may be to trace a perimeter around one or more of the search results. In this case, the operating system may recognize the gesture  as an indication to copy information (e.g., text and images) within the bounds of the perimeter or an area otherwise associated with the perimeter. The gesture  may also indicate, to the operating system, to open or maximize another app, such as NOTES app , and to paste the copied information into the interface  of that other app. Similar actions may be used to copy and\/or paste content at the landing page or other target of a link associated with the search results, provided that gesture is appropriately programmed. In the example of , a highlighting gesture (e.g., a finger traced over the same area more than once) is used to copy text  from a Web search into a search application interface , which may be part of the same search app or a different search app.","In still another example, a series of gestures may be used as above, e.g., to indicate to the operating system to copy information from one app and to apply that information to another app. For example tracing a perimeter followed by an \u201cN\u201d may indicate to copy information from the perimeter to NOTES app , which may be designated by the \u201cN\u201d gesture. Tracing a perimeter followed by an \u201cS\u201d may indicate to copy information from the perimeter to the search app , which may be designated by the \u201cS\u201d gesture.","Generally speaking, one or more gestures may be used to control one or more functions of the operating system, and to control one or more functions of one or more computer programs running on the operating system. For example, the same gesture, or a sequence of gestures, may be used to open a first app (e.g., a WEATHER app), perform a function in the first app (e.g., copy today's weather); open a second app (e.g., an e-mail app); and perform a function in the second app (e.g., open a new e-mail and paste today's weather into the e-mail).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 1 to 4","FIGS. 1 to 4","FIG. 5"],"b":"200"},"System  includes a client  and server . Client  and server  are connected via network . Network , in conjunction with one or more of client  and server , may be part of a cloud computing system.","Network  represents a mobile communications network that can allow devices (e.g., client ) to communicate wirelessly through a communication interface (not shown), which may include digital signal processing circuitry where necessary. Network  can include one or more networks available for use by client  for communication with server , such as a local area network, a wide area network, and\/or the Internet. The network(s) may provide for communications under various modes or protocols, such as Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) voice calls, Short Message Service (SMS), Enhanced Messaging Service (EMS), or Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) messaging, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Personal Digital Cellular (PDC), Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), CDMA2000, or General Packet Radio System (GPRS), among others. For example, the communication may occur through a radio-frequency transceiver. In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a Bluetooth, WiFi, or other such transceiver.","Client  depicted in  is a smartphone, such as smartphone  of . Generally, a smartphone may be a mobile device that offers computing capabilities, such as the ability to execute applications and to communicate with a server or another appropriate computing device. Client , however, need not be a smartphone, but rather may be representative of various forms of client devices and personal computing devices. Client  can be, or can include, a cellular telephone or personal digital assistant (PDA). In addition, the client and personal computing devices can be, or can include, but are not limited to, a laptop computer, a handheld computer, a tablet computer, a network appliance, a camera, an enhanced general packet radio service (EGPRS) mobile phone, a media player, a navigation device, an electronic mail (e-mail) device, a game console, or a combination of any two or more of these data processing devices or other data processing devices. In some implementations, the personal computing device can be included as part of a motor vehicle (e.g., an automobile, an emergency vehicle (e.g., fire truck, ambulance), a bus). In some implementations, the personal computing device can be included as part of a desktop computer.","Client  may include a storage system  for storing an operating system , data , and applications (\u201capps\u201d ), and a processing device  (e.g., a microprocessor) and memory  (e.g., RAM) for executing the apps. A display screen , such as an LCD or a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) displays, to a user, images that are generated by client . As is known, display on a display screen (e.g., a smartphone interface) physically transforms the display screen. For example, if the display screen is LCD-based, the orientation of liquid crystals can be changed by the application of biasing voltages in a physical transformation that is visually apparent to the user. As another example, if the display screen is a CRT, the state of a fluorescent screen can be changed by the impact of electrons in a physical transformation that is also visually apparent.","Display screen  may be touch-sensitive, allowing a user to enter information onto the display screen via a virtual keyboard and other touch-based commands, including gestures. On some clients, such as a desktop or smartphone, a physical QWERTY keyboard and scroll wheel may also be provided for entering information onto the display screen. The client, and applications executed thereon, may also be configured to accept voice commands, and to perform functions in response to such commands.","Operating system  may be, e.g., a version of GOOGLE ANDROID or APPLE iOS. Computer programs, including apps  execute on top of the operating system. Among these computer programs may be a Web Browser for accessing data from server . Other apps that run on operating system  may include, but are not limited to, an e-mail app, an SMS app, a NOTES app for generating and storing notes, and a WEATHER app for displaying weather information for various times and cities or other geographic regions.","Storage system  may also include a database  that stores information about gestures. The gestures may correspond to motions made, e.g., across a touch screen or with a computer mouse. The database may contain tables, for example, that correlate particular gestures (represented, e.g., by differences in on-screen coordinates) to data, including commands, for performing actions by the operating system and\/or apps running on the operating system. In some implementations, for example, the database may correlate the operating system and different apps to data for particular gestures (e.g., the same gesture) or sequence of gestures. For example, a gesture may have one meaning to the operating system, another meaning to an app #, and still another meaning to an app #, all of which may be triggered by input of that gesture. The tables or other data structures in the database may correlate functions of the gestures, and the gestures themselves, to the operating system and to the various apps for which the gestures have meaning.","Server  may include a storage system , e.g., RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks), for storing data and computer programs, and one or more processing device(s)  (e.g., one or more microprocessors) and memory  (e.g., RAM) for executing computer programs. Server  runs an operating system , such as a version of LINUX. Server  may host, or otherwise provide access to, information contained therein. For example, a user at a client  may sign onto a Web site hosted by server  (or, e.g., for which server  is a portal). In response, e.g., through an appropriate HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) exchange, server  may provide, to client , access to a virtual app store  or other facility for obtaining, among other things apps to download to, and run on, client .","Other examples of clients and servers on which the processes described herein may be implemented are provided below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["300","300","301"]},"The operating system may compare () the input, e.g., coordinates or differences in coordinates, to information stored in a database, such as database . The database may be either on the device itself or one a remote server, such as server  (). The database may include one or more tables, which correlate traces (e.g., coordinates or differences in coordinates) to gestures. Both the operating system, and apps executing on the operating system may be configured to recognize () one or more gestures, and to perform one or more operations in response to those gesture(s). For example, the operating system may be programmed to recognize a gesture, and retrieve () data (e.g., a command) from the database or elsewhere, and to perform () an operation in response to that data. In the example of , for instance, the command may be to open\/execute an app, such as a NOTES app ","Apps running on the operating system may also recognize gestures input to the device. Apps may subscribe to gesture-based control, e.g., in response to user input. That is, upon installation, an app may prompt a user to accept, or decline, gesture controls. If the user accepts, the app subscribes to gesture control with the operating system. For example, the app instructs the operating system that it will accept data for gesture controls. The operating system may store, in an appropriate location, a set of apps that have subscribed to gestures, and may reference this list when determining whether to send data for gestures to an app. In an example, the operating system may have an application programming interface (API), through which apps may obtain data (e.g., commands) corresponding to input gestures. So, for example, one or more gestures input and recognized by the operating system (and which trigger one or more operations on the operating system) may also be recognized by an app (and trigger one or more operations on the app). In another example, an app, (e.g., an app that is already operating) may recognize a gesture independently of the operating system. That is, the app may recognize the gesture input to its user interface (UI), or a designated portion thereof, and operate in accordance with that gesture.","In an implementation, the app may receive () data corresponding to the gesture via the API (e.g., the operating system may pass the data to the app through an interface). The app may be programmed to recognize that data as a command to perform () a specific operation, or it may be programmed to look-up, in a database (e.g., the same database  used by the operating system or a different database), an operation that is triggered by the data. In the example of , for instance, data obtained via the \u201cN\u201d gesture triggers both activation of the NOTES app by the operating system, and opening of a new note by the NOTES app. A similar process may apply for multiple gestures.","More specifically, traces for two gestures may be input to the operating system via a device's display. The operating system may obtain, from the database, data (e.g., commands for both gestures). Data for the first gesture may be used to control an action of the operating system (e.g., opening the NOTES app in ). Data for the second gesture may be passed to the app, where it may be used to control an action of the app (e.g., opening a new note in NOTES app of ). This concept may be extended to more than two gestures, as explained above. Furthermore, the same series of gestures may be used to control functions on both the operating system and one or more apps. As explained above, data for such gestures may be passed to the app(s) from the operating system, and predefined actions may be performed by the apps(s) in response to that data. In other implementations, data may be passed between apps, and not through the operating system. As described above, the function of each gesture vis-\u00e0-vis the operating system and various apps is stored in a database, which may be queried by the operating system and apps to determine how each is to react to given gesture(s).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["400","450","400","450"]},"Computing device  includes a processor , memory , a storage device , a high-speed interface  connecting to memory  and high-speed expansion ports , and a low speed interface  connecting to low speed bus  and storage device . Each of the components , , , , , and , are interconnected using various buses, and may be mounted on a common motherboard or in other manners as appropriate. The processor  can process instructions for execution within the computing device , including instructions stored in the memory  or on the storage device  to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input\/output device, such as display  coupled to high speed interface . In other implementations, multiple processors and\/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also, multiple computing devices  may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system).","The memory  stores information within the computing device . In one implementation, the memory  is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, the memory  is a non-volatile memory unit or units. The memory  may also be another form of computer-readable medium, such as a magnetic or optical disk.","The storage device  is capable of providing mass storage for the computing device . In one implementation, the storage device  may be or contain a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. A computer program product can be tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product may also contain instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier may be a non-transitory computer- or machine-readable medium, such as the memory , the storage device , or memory on processor . Other examples of non-transitory machine-readable storage media include, but are not limited to, read-only memory, an optical disk drive, memory disk drive, random access memory, and the like.","The high speed controller  manages bandwidth-intensive operations for the computing device , while the low speed controller  manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of functions is exemplary only. In one implementation, the high-speed controller  is coupled to memory , display  (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to high-speed expansion ports , which may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In the implementation, low-speed controller  is coupled to storage device  and low-speed expansion port . The low-speed expansion port, which may include various communication ports (e.g., USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet, wireless Ethernet) may be coupled to one or more input\/output devices, such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a scanner, or a networking device such as a switch or router, e.g., through a network adapter.","The computing device  may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure.

In addition, it may be implemented in a personal computer such as a laptop computer . Alternatively, components from computing device  may be combined with other components in a mobile device (not shown), such as device . Each of such devices may contain one or more of computing device , , and an entire system may be made up of multiple computing devices ,  communicating with each other.","Computing device  includes a processor , memory , an input\/output device such as a display , a communication interface , and a transceiver , among other components. The device  may also be provided with a storage device, such as a microdrive or other device, to provide additional storage.

The processor may be implemented as a chipset of chips that include separate and multiple analog and digital processors. The processor may provide, for example, for coordination of the other components of the device , such as control of user interfaces, applications run by device , and wireless communication by device .","Processor  may communicate with a user through control interface  and a display interface coupled to a display .

The display interface may comprise appropriate circuitry for driving the display  to present graphical and other information to a user. The control interface  may receive commands from a user and convert them for submission to the processor . In addition, an external interface  may be provide in communication with processor , so as to enable near area communication of device  with other devices. External interface  may provide, for example, for wired communication in some implementations, or for wireless communication in other implementations, and multiple interfaces may also be used.","The memory  stores information within the computing device . The memory  can be implemented as one or more of a computer-readable medium or media, a volatile memory unit or units, or a non-volatile memory unit or units. Expansion memory  may also be provided and connected to device  through expansion interface , which may include, for example, a SIMM (Single In Line Memory Module) card interface. Such expansion memory  may provide extra storage space for device , or may also store applications or other information for device . Specifically, expansion memory  may include instructions to carry out or supplement the processes described above, and may include secure information also. Thus, for example, expansion memory  may be provide as a security module for device , and may be programmed with instructions that permit secure use of device . In addition, secure applications may be provided via the SIMM cards, along with additional information, such as placing identifying information on the SIMM card in a non-hackable manner.","The memory may include, for example, flash memory and\/or NVRAM memory, as discussed below.

The term \u201cmachine-readable signal\u201d refers to any signal used to provide machine instructions and\/or data to a programmable processor.","To provide for interaction with a user, the systems and techniques described here can be implemented on a computer having a display device (e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor) for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.","The systems and techniques described here can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the systems and techniques described here), or any combination of such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d), a wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d), and the Internet.","The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.","A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.","In addition, the logic flows depicted in the figures do not require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In addition, other steps may be provided, or steps may be eliminated, from the described flows, and other components may be added to, or removed from, the described systems.

For example, in an e-mail application, a gesture may be used to add a recipient; and, in a notes application, a gesture may be used to open a new note. In a messaging application, a gesture may be used to open a new message. In an OS, gestures may be used, e.g., to open an application, copy data from one place (e.g., application) to another, paste such data, and delete data or other information. Such functions may also be performed within apps.","The concepts described herein may also be extended. For example, a command corresponding to a gesture may be passed from the operating system to two or more applications. That same gesture therefore may be used to control functions and\/or activate the two or more applications.","Elements of different implementations described herein may be combined to form other implementations not specifically set forth above. Elements may be left out of the processes, computer programs, Web pages, etc. described herein without adversely affecting their operation. Furthermore, various separate elements may be combined into one or more individual elements to perform the functions described herein.","Other implementations not specifically described herein are also within the scope of the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 1 to 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
