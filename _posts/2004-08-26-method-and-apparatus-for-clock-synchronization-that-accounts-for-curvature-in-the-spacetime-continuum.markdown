No. 60\/499,411, filed 26 Aug. 2003, which is entirely incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.","The invention generally relates to clock synchronization.","\u201cTime transfer\u201d is important to many segments of a technologically advanced society. Modern communication systems, such as cryptographic communication systems, computer networks, navigation and positioning systems, and even electric grids, among others, rely upon precise timing and the synchronization of events over a distributed network.","Currently, \u201ctime transfer\u201d is generally accomplished by sending reference signals from a master clock, which is highly accurate and highly precise. The reference signals carry a time stamp from the master clock, and recipients of the reference signals can then employ the time stamps to synchronize their local clocks with the master clock. Time transfer systems such as global positioning systems are generally so precise that they account for propagation delays of the reference signals caused by the reference signals being transmitted through the Earth's atmosphere. In addition, time transfer systems account for some special relativistic effects such as time dilation and for some general relativistic effects such as the effect of the Earth's gravitational field on the rate of clocks, such as clocks onboard GPS satellites. However, what is sought is a method and a system that accounts for other general relativistic effects due to propagation of the reference signals through the Earth's gravitational field, and the resulting effects on the measured values of the reference signals, which propagate between the reference signal source, such as a GPS satellite, and the user's receiver.","An apparatus and a method for applying a correction that accounts for curvature in the space-time continuum in the context of clock synchronization are provided. Briefly described, one embodiment of an apparatus includes a memory having a curved space-time correction module and a processor. The processor is adapted to receive a reference message having a time-stamp from a master-clock and determine a correction to the time-stamp using the curved space-time correction module, wherein the correction accounts for curvature in space-time.","An embodiment of a method can be broadly summarized by the following steps: receiving at a receiver a reference signal from a transmitter, the reference signal carrying a timestamp that is related to the time the reference signal was emitted from the transmitter; and determining the time that the reference signal was received at the receiver using the reference signal, wherein the determination of the time includes applying a correction that accounts for curvature in the space-time continuum, wherein correction for curvature in the space-time continuum is a function of both rand r, where ris the position of the transmitter at the time of emission of the reference signal, and where ris the position of the receiver at the time of reception of the reference signal.","Other systems, methods, features, and\/or advantages will be or may become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features, and\/or advantages be included within this description and be protected by the accompanying claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10"]},"GPS  includes a plurality of satellites  of which only (A)-(G) are illustrated and a ground control system . Each one of the satellites  completes an orbit around the Earth  in approximately 12 hours. The ground control system  monitors the orbits of the satellites  and provides the satellites  with trajectory information. Each satellite  uses its trajectory information to determine its position and each satellite broadcasts reference signals or navigation messages. Other embodiments include, but are not limited to, a system having geo-synchronous satellites, and a system having terrestrial transmitters.","A navigation message from a given satellite such as satellite (F) includes a time stamp and the current position of the satellite (F). The time stamp corresponds to the time of transmission (t) from the satellite (F) as measured by an internal clock  in the satellite (F). Each one of the satellites  has its own internal clock . The internal clocks  are set so that they compensate for time dilation due to their motion and to compensate for being in a state of gravitational potential energy that is higher than the gravitational potential energy of terrestrial objects. Those skilled in the art recognize that the heart of the GPS  is synchronization of the internal clocks . Consequently, the internal clocks  must perform with a high degree of accuracy and precision, which is why the internal clocks  are atomic clocks. Furthermore, for the purposes of this disclosure, the internal clocks  can be regarded as being \u201cmaster\u201d clocks to which other clocks are synchronized.","A mobile receiver  and a stationery receiver  receive navigational messages. The mobile receiver  includes a local mobile receiver clock . Using navigation messages and its local mobile receiver clock , the mobile receiver  is adapted to determine its position.","The stationery receiver  includes a local receiver clock . The stationery receiver  knows its position, and knowing its position, the stationery receiver  is adapted to use navigation messages and its local receiver clock  to determine, among other things, a time correction that accounts for curvature in the space time continuum. Typically, primarily for reasons related to cost and portability, among others, the local mobile receiver clock  and the local receiver clock  are only approximately synchronized with the internal clocks . Clocks that are accurate enough to be synchronized with the internal clocks  are generally expensive and large.","In some embodiments, the stationery receiver  is part of a communication system that employs precise timing information as part of an encryption scheme. For example, the stationary receiver referred to above may not be stationary, but may be in motion with respect to the Earth-centered inertial frame or with respect to the Earth-centered Earth-fixed frame. This receiver may be part of a high-speed communication system that uses cryptographic communications. In other embodiments, the stationary receiver  is part of a telephone network, a communication network, a computer network, an electrical power grid, or other system\/apparatus known to those skilled in the art that employs \u201ctime transfer.\u201d","Those skilled in the art recognize that a reference frame is defined by four coordinates (z, z, z, z), where z=c\u03c4 where c is the universal constant for the speed of light in a vacuum, and \u03c4 is time measured in that coordinate system, and (z, z, z) are three orthonormal spatial coordinates such as Cartesian coordinates. Those skilled in the art know that distances in a reference frame are not properly measured in Euclidean spatial coordinates, but are instead properly measured by accounting for curvature in the space-time continuum.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A and 2B","b":["28","30","28","28","1","1","3"]},"The ECEF reference frame  accounts for the Earth's rotation and is fixed with respect to the Earth, i.e., the ECEF reference frame rotates with the Earth. The vectors y and y lay in the equatorial plane of the Earth, and the vectors y and y lay in the prime meridian plane of the Earth. The vector y of the ECEF frame is aligned with the rotational axis of the Earth. In addition to spatial\/geometric coordinates x, x, x and y, y, y of the ECI frame  and ECEF frame , respectively, events measured in the ECI frame  and ECEF frame  are properly measured using a four vector which includes x and y, respectively. x of the ECI frame is equal to c\u00b7\u03c4, where c equals the speed of light in a vacuum, and \u03c4 equals a unit of time as measured in the ECI frame. y of the ECEF frame  is equal to c\u00b7\u03c4\u2032, where \u03c4\u2032 is a unit of time measured in the ECEF frame . For the purposes of this disclosure, the coordinates of the ECI frame  are denoted by the four vector X={x, x, x, x}, and the coordinates of the ECEF frame  are denoted by the four vector Y={y, y, y, y}.","The internal satellite clocks  are synchronized with respect to the ECI frame. As an approximation, both the ECI and ECEF reference frames  and  respectively, ignore the Earth's rotation around the sun. The ECI frame  and ECEF frame  can be related by a time dependent rotation matrix having a periodicity of approximately one Earth rotation, i.e., approximately 24-hours.
