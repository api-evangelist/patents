{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT","GLOSSARY OF ELEMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to computer software and, more particularly, to a shell, or explorer, graphical user interface, and system, for the management of digital content.","The explorer or shell browser is the traditional paradigm for interfacing with information and content in most modern software, operating and network systems. In this paradigm the user interface primarily consists of a single treeview control, usually on the left hand side of the window, and a view pane on the right. The treeview is distinguished by hierarchical groupings of nodes, depicted usually as folders that can contain nested levels of subnodes. The contents of any given node are displayed in the pane either as icons representing their informational type or as grids of metadata; e.g. filename, creation date and size.","Additionally filters and search features are commonly provided to help the user find what they are seeking when they are unsure as to the location of information sought. The problem with this paradigm is one of both integration and scale. There exists an inverse relationship between the volume of data being managed and the efficacy of the system itself. Since the paradigm for grouping related information together is to create nested subfolders in the treeview, i.e. vertically integrated categorization, users often find themselves with deeply nested layers of subfolders that are simply unwieldy to interact with. This further prevents the integration of information categorized in different nodes; i.e. horizontal integration. For example, if two recipes for chocolate cake are stored in different folders it is up to the user's ingenuity to find those recipes. The vertical categorization inherent in the treeview control necessitates additional systems and processes to enable users to work with their data when it is not contained in the same, or at least, a nearby node. In other words, while two recipes for chocolate cake may be associated in a user's mind, the explorer offers no easy way to make those types of horizontal integrations. One must either search, or filter, to access horizontally integrated information.","The problems of integration are quickly exacerbated by scale. The more information maintained by the system; the more difficult and time consuming it becomes to access that information. Essentially one has to rely upon memory or conduct key word searches to get to the data sought. While the explorer shell has largely solved the problem of graphically representing system contents it has not solved the problem of accessing and integrating the information intuitively when faced with large underlying data repositories.","As the volume of system data increases users are stressed by the inability of the explorer paradigm to get them the information they want quickly and easily. In short the exploration becomes increasingly expensive in terms of time and effort.","Most solutions to date have focused on improving the existing paradigm by creating virtual folder systems along with improved search, display and filter features. However, these developments merely represent incremental or evolutionary changes to the paradigm itself. To date, the explorer or shell paradigm remains relatively unchanged since the advent of the graphical user interface driven explorer.","Prior art explorer or shell interfaces are inherently unwieldy due to vertical nesting of subfolders. Any attempts to increase system efficacy through metadata based virtual folder systems do not address the vertical nesting issue and merely represent incremental and symptomatic remedies of the issue. It would be advantageous to provide an explorer or shell interface featuring dynamically cross-referenced treeview controls characterized by the display of folders, or nodes, representing a dual categorization methodology for storing data within the system.","It would also be advantageous to allow each treeview's root-level folders to dynamically create and display subfolders illustrating existent category-pairs found within items in the system.","It would also be advantageous to allow each treeview's subfolders to provide a trigger for an auto-synchronization feature that enables users to horizontally integrate the data under management to explore \u201cone-off\u201d relationships amongst the data.","It would also be advantageous to embody these category-pairings found in the data as a finite, two-level hierarchy represented by the treeview controls to prevent unpredictable and unwieldy subfolder nesting as found in prior art shell or explorer interfaces.","In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a user interface and file and digital content processor for the management of digital data. The graphical user interface is characterized by two treeview controls capable of transforming the screen display of items under management by acting as a filtering mechanism for the category value pairs inherent in every item under management. The treeview controls folders or nodes transform the screen display of data under management to filter by the category values represented by the treeview controls' folders.","For purposes of clarity and brevity, like elements and components will bear the same designations and numbering throughout the figures.","With reference to , an exemplary system for implementing this embodiment includes a general purpose computing device in the form of a conventional personal computer , including a processing unit , system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory  to the processing unit . The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, or a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. The system memory  includes read-only memory  (ROM) and random access memory  (RAM).","A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the personal computer , such as during start-up, is stored in ROM. The personal computer  further includes a hard disk drive  for reading from or writing to a hard disk , a magnetic disk  drive for reading from or writing to a removable magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable optical disk , such as a CD-ROM or other optical media.","The hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drives  are connected to the system bus  by a hard disk drive  interface, a magnetic disk drive interface , and an optical drive interface , respectively. The drives and their associated computer-readable media provide non-volatile storage of computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data for the personal computer .","Although the exemplary environment described herein employs a hard disk , a removable magnetic disk , and a removable optical disk , it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer-readable media which can store data accessible by a computer, such as dedicated file servers, magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video disks, Bernoulli cartridges, random access memories (RAMs), read-only memories (ROMs), and the like, may also be used in the exemplary operating environment.","A number of program modules may be stored on the hard disk , magnetic disk , optical disk , read-only memory  (ROM) or, random access memory  (RAM), including an operating system , one or more application programs , other program modules and program data . A user may enter commands and information into the personal computer  through input devices such as a keyboard  and mouse  or similar pointing device.","Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a serial port interface  that is coupled to the system bus , but may also be connected by other interfaces, such as a parallel port, serial port or a universal serial bus (USB). A display in the form of a monitor  is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video adapter  or video card. One or more speakers  may also be connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as an audio adapter . In addition to the display and speakers , personal computers typically include other peripheral output devices (not shown), such as printers.","The personal computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more personal computers, such as a remote computer. The remote computer may be another personal computer , a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the personal computer . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network  (LAN) and a wide area network  (WAN). Such networking environments are commonplace in homes or offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets, and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the personal computer  is connected to the local area network  through a network interface  or adapter. When used in a WAN networking environment, the personal computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the wide area network  such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, is connected to the system bus  via the serial port interface . In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the personal computer  or, portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. It will be appreciated that the network  connections shown are exemplary, and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","As implemented on a system of the type illustrated in , this embodiment utilizes an integrated, dynamically cross-referenced and synchronized, dual treeview and dual view pane shell browser interface, integrated with a file and digital content processor  capable of synchronizing the shell browser and view component  with the embodiment's relational database  and file server .","The dynamically cross-referenced, and synchronized, dual treeview controls, and dual view panes provide a user interface experience which makes it substantially easier for users to perform common tasks around file and digital content management by manipulating system data in the context of user defined project-category-pairs.","The embodiment's dual classification system for all items under management, tightly integrated through all tiers of the system, directly addresses the issue of information overload constantly challenging modern computer users.","Two treeview controls allow two ways to classify information. The folders and subfolders become exemplary of the user's individual project and category classifications, thus further integrating data storage, representation and manipulation in a user-specific or customized idiomatic framework.","The dynamic linking of the two treeview controls to automatically synchronize via requests to the file and digital content processor  is based upon the organization of the two treeview controls as mirror image representations of the project-category-pairs populated by interrogating the project and category attribute values for all items in the system. The categories treeview control , conversely, lists all categories as root-level folders and dynamically populates associated projects as a single, nested level of subfolders.","This represents the category-project perspective for the same items. Thus the two treeview controls, working in tandem, allow users to visually comprehend how items are related to one another by a two dimensional grouping of the same data acting as classificatory categories; e.g. projects and categories in this embodiment.","Users can see which projects are associated with which categories and vice-versa by using any specific project-category-pair as a pivot point that reveals all project-category-pairs for any item's project and category attribute values.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":"94"},"In this embodiment a plethora of client devices, e.g., desktop, laptop, netbook, and other mobile devices like blackberries, PDAs, iPads, iPhones, etc., can connect via a network connection.","The network  in this embodiment consists of an unlimited number of networked application servers , networked file servers , and networked relational database servers . As those skilled in the art will appreciate, this creates multiple benefits, not the least of which is a centralized means of accessing the network  from a variety of digital devices where each device is capable of connecting to the network , and initiating a user session.","Additional benefits include those typically associated with networked systems in general; namely, a scalable, central repository to house and serve information to multiple network clients  for further interaction upon.","Further, a networked embodiment for the file and digital content management system  can deliver information not only to connected users via a multitude of network enabled digital devices, but the file and digital content processor  component operates independently of the shell browser and view component as it simply reveals an API (application programming interface) lending itself to machine-initiated requests as easily as human use-case generated requests. This is the request-response methodology that the shell browser and view component  utilizes to transform screen data.","Thus, a network based embodiment lends itself equally to other network capable systems as clients, capable of further transforming the data under management. The file and digital content processor  in this embodiment can remain client agnostic, accepting requests from either computer systems or from human clients.","Thus, not only does such an embodiment enable scalability it also enables extensibility. Additional systems can be created as desired, and existing systems can be extended as desired, thereby creating additional functionalities for the items, and files, the file and digital content management system  controls and transforms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":"94"},"As will be described in more detail below, the project-category-pair type organization of treeview controls in the shell browser and view component  allows the user to orient the digital content and files viewed on screen within the context of simultaneous horizontal and vertical integration.","This integrated vertical and horizontal capability is provided by the treeview controls modeling of project-category relationships as classificatory categories for the digital data items under management.","As previously mentioned, there are two distinct types of virtual folders in this embodiment; folders and subfolders. A folder is a direct representation of one of the two requisite attributes required to save an item in the system; namely project and category.","A subfolder however, exists as a representation of a relationship modeled by items; i.e., a requisite project-category-pair assignment. Therefore treeview root-level folders can be empty which simply means the project or category they represent has yet to be associated with an item. However, if even only one item uses the project, or category, a subfolder will be dynamically created beneath it. This serves to model said item's project-category-pair within the treeview controls as a root-level folder containing a single, nested level of subfolders.","Further, a folder is capable of containing exactly one nested level of subfolders, representing a distinct list of complementary project-category-pair attributes, discovered by the file and digital content processor's query builder component's generated SQL output.","For example, an expanded root-level project folder will list any categories found in a query of items filtered by the selected project's attribute value; stored in the relational database's items table ; and added to the project folder's attributes by the file and digital content processor's  databinding component .","The converse is true for a category folder. Every root-level category folder acts in a classificatory manner in relation to the digital items managed, and will accordingly contain a nested list of subfolders acting not merely as another classificatory list of categories but as a category-pairing shorthand, thus representing matching projects returned by an item query filtering on the selected category attribute passed to the request broker component . The file and digital content management system  is capable of managing folder to subfolder relationships by cross-referencing project and category attributes via the system's dynamic query capability.","The files, which are linked or associated in the relational database  to items, via a requisite item identifier , can be filtered too, as if they were items, obtaining both project and category attribute values by proxy or inheritance. The query builder component  is capable of running additional queries against the relational database's files table  thereby matching files by the associated item's  project-category-pair. As a result, the file and digital content management system  offers users a dual mode explorer shell that can be toggled between an item-centric, or file-centric viewpoint, by leveraging the shared item identifier  resident in both items and attached files.","An item-centric approach, in this embodiment, displays files in the shell browser and view component  files pane , as they relate to individual items through the shared item identifier  required to add files to the system. This particular viewpoint can be likened to how emails can contain attachments in a generic email system. It is similar to how one email can contain many attachments.","As previously described, the item-centric, or item explorer view, will filter items by project and category, displaying files in the system on a strict item by item basis. Thus, selecting an item in the items pane  will dynamically display any file(s) that have been attached to said item.","A file-centric, or file explorer view, links files to items by proxy, through the file and digital content processor  such that the user can view files in the shell browser and view component  as if they were no different from items; i.e. directly filtered by the project and category folders, and subfolders, selected by a user. This feature extends the power of vertical and horizontal integration not just to items, but to files as well, providing a single paradigm for manipulating all digital content.","The integrated and dynamic nature of the embodiment opens up new possibilities for organizing, discovering, and sharing, both information and files for users on a system. The file and digital content processor  file broker component , working in conjunction with the request broker component , allows both files and digital content to be copied, moved, viewed, downloaded, renamed, searched, and cloned, not just for solitary users but also between users on the system.","Such a simple, yet powerful, paradigm possesses ramifications for a fundamental shift in the way users, and networks of users, can leverage data. The embodiment provides leverage that covers a productivity spectrum ranging from a user's own stored items and files, all the way to an exponentially expanding, globally available, loosely connected, and fully compatible, data management solution.","The shell browser and view component's  item explorer\/file explorer toggle feature; the explorer mode toggle checkbox  allows users to quickly determine not just the project and category to which files belong, but also view the context within which the file was saved; namely the item's identifier attribute stored with each file attachment in the relational database . This adds, by default, an entire user-generated layer of metadata, i.e. using items as proxies for screen transformations, in addition to the files own metadata, e.g. date, size, etc., stored in the relational database .","The horizontal and vertical integration of the shell browser and view component's dual linked treeview controls, act in concert as both a, \u201crelationship or project-category-pair directory\u201d and as a filter engine, for a dual mode explorer allowing the system's features to be leveraged in tandem to suit individual users own style of working with data. This enables users to integrate all manner of information within one cohesive shell supporting both vertical and horizontal integration, to more efficiently leverage the system's capabilities for manipulating data within a system; e.g. add, edit, delete, print, share, etc.","Thus, the file and digital content management system  enables items, or files, to be automatically filtered by the selection of folders, and subfolders, displayed within the treeview controls. Selecting a top level folder will apply a single filter based upon the project, or category, that the selected folder represents. Category-pair filters are additive in nature, and may be removed at any time, such that a user can tailor the view of items and files to add, or remove, both project and category filters at will, as well as change the filter focus to be either item-centric, or file-centric. This powerful capability of the system is achieved by simply passing in a token to request broker component  by simple selection of the explorer mode toggle checkbox  in the shell browser and view component .","Subfolders present a special filtering case, in that the selection of a subfolder applies two filters to the data; that of the project, or category, represented by the subfolder itself, as well as the automatic inclusion of a second filter, derived from the project, or category, represented by the parent or root-level folder. The project-category-pair subfolder behavior visually, and functionally, relates information within the system on two dimensions of integration; vertical and horizontal.","Vertical integration of information is achieved by the direct filtering functions of the folders, and subfolders. Horizontal integration is achieved by the subfolders representation of other existing project-category-pairs found for any given project, or category, root-level folder.","Further, selecting a subfolder will automatically synchronize the opposite treeview control in the shell browser and view component  such that it displays the same root folder as the opposite treeview's selected subfolder. Subfolder synchronization creates a dynamic mechanism for discovering, and manipulating, large amounts of information, and files, by leveraging the file and digital content management system's support of a dual classification methodology; i.e. project-category-pairs. Each subfolder selected triggers a synchronization of the opposite treeview and opens the doorway to discovering and integrating large amounts of related information that would not otherwise be obvious in single treeview shell browser or explorer interface paradigm.","As an example, a user could select a project folder named \u201cpatents\u201d from the projects treeview control . The user would then be presented with the filtered results for a query of all files, or items, depending upon the explorer mode toggle checkbox  setting, in the system with possessing a specific project attribute of \u201cpatents\u201d.","By selecting the folder, the file and digital content processor  will render beneath the project folder, a nested level of subfolders representing existing category matches; e.g. \u201clawyers\u201d, \u201clinks\u201d, \u201cbackups\u201d, \u201cphone calls\u201d, \u201cappointments\u201d, etc.","By selecting subfolders, both the subfolder's attribute value, i.e. project or category, and the containing parent folder's value, will be passed to the file and digital content processor  to transform the visible items and files. The opposite treeview control will automatically synchronize such that the system selected folder in the opposite treeview represents the same attribute as the user selected subfolder.","Thus a new level of subfolders for the newly synchronized tree will be made available to the user representing both the current project-category filter, and any related pairings displayed by the freshly synchronized treeview control.","Using the above example, the user might then click on the \u201clawyers\u201d subfolder of the \u201cpatents\u201d project. Doing so would automatically synchronize the categories treeview folder such that the \u201clawyers\u201d folder would be selected, and all associated projects would be displayed, thus revealing other projects joined to the \u201clawyers\u201d category. A subfolder of the \u201clawyers\u201d category might be the \u201ccopyright\u201d project subfolder. Clicking on the \u201ccopyright\u201d subfolder would then automatically change the projects treeview control's  selected project from \u201cpatents\u201d to \u201ccopyright\u201d thus applying a new filter to the data based upon the project-category-pair, \u201ccopyright\u201d and \u201clawyers\u201d, respectively.","This allows the user to not only tailor the screen view based upon the selection of projects and categories, but to intuitively browse similar and related information by leveraging the subfolders visual representation of other items sharing one attribute of the requisite project-category-pair.","As illustrated in , the file and digital content management system  includes a file and digital content processor , a file server  which could be a hard disk , or any other media capable of storing digital files, a relational database , and a shell browser and view component .","The file and digital content processor  contains a request broker component , a file broker component , an input\/output component , a filter component , a cross-referencing component , a query builder component , a rowset parser component , an enumerator component , a type factory component , and a databinding component .","The shell and browser component handlers allow common user actions, including use of keyboard , mouse , stylus, or touchpad, clicking and right-clicking of project, and category, folders, and subfolders, as well as the dragging and dropping of shell browser and view component  objects; e.g. files to be uploaded, moved or copied amongst items, clicking column headers of the items pane  and files pane , for sorting by respective column(s), and other shell browser and view component  controls commonly used in graphical shell browser interfaces, thus enabling a fully interactive, or dynamic transformation, of the system's data along user defined contexts.","It further provides, as previously mentioned, a checkbox control for setting the dual-explorer mode to determine which shell browser and view component  object; items pane  or files pane ; the file and digital content processor  should apply the results of the treeview initiated filtering process against.","The shell browser and view component  further provides a tabular data entry form for adding, editing, deleting, sharing, cloning, and otherwise manipulating files and digital content within the system. Additional features of the embodiment include a publication feature generating text and graphical based links to items and files within the system.","The shell and browser component further includes a visual interface component that enables any computer user with a network or internet connection and an HTML browser to view any user's items, including rich digital content such as audio, video, embedded objects including web pages, as well as files displayed in a files pane  featuring links for downloading, previewing, etc., and a cloning mechanism whereby any items viewed can be duplicated completely by the user as a new item possessing the same attributes and files as the originally viewed item; i.e. the system items become templates for new items through the data entry and item viewer capabilities of the system.","The shell browser and view component , through the file and digital content processor's  API, is equipped with the capability of transforming user actions such as clicking on folders and subfolders, into parameterized item and file requests. The generated requests include an identifier for the originating treeview control, an identifier for the type of folder selected, folder or subfolder, the project identifier  and\/or category identifier  involved in the user selection, the explorer mode requested, i.e. item or file, and other useful filters for sorting information set by the user and supplied to the request broker component .","The request broker component  is tasked with notifying the various components of the file and digital content processor  of received parameters to enable efficient query building and rowset processing to satisfy user requests for information.","The query builder component  is responsible for building and executing SQL queries to be applied against the relational database . The query builder component  is capable of creating SQL queries for creating, reading, updating, and deleting projects, categories, items and files, stored in the relational database . Depending upon the information obtained from the filter component  and the cross-referencing component , queries can be created and executed against the relational database  that return requisite data allowing the enumerator component , the type factory component , and the databinding component , to transform the information represented by the browser and shell component. The cross-referencing component  possesses the capability of determining if the request was initiated by a subfolder, in which case, the filter component  supplies the identity of the originating treeview that the user selected a subfolder from. This is the mechanism by which synchronization of the opposite treeview, i.e. the treeview the user did not select a subfolder from, can be synchronized against.","Generally, the query builder component  yields a set of rows (in other words a table). The rowset parser component  then takes each row, and using column names and information supplied by the type factory component , transforms the row received into a well known system or object type sharing attributes that map directly to the columns of the tables in the relational database . The types, e.g. an item, file, project, category, etc., can then be bound to the objects of the shell browser and view component , e.g. files pane , items pane , projects treeview, categories treeview, etc.","It is the system types that bridge the gap between the information stored in the relational database  with the shell browser and view component's  user control or screen display objects; namely the treeview and view pane controls.","The relational database  stores properties about all projects, categories and system users, as well as properties about all files stored physically; e.g. on a hard disk , file server , or other similar storage mechanism, including metadata such as file location, file type, file size, and date modified last on the system. It also stores records, or rows, of general information referred to as \u201citems\u201d, that form the basic building blocks of the system.","Items in this embodiment include a field for the inclusion of rich digital content such as multimedia files, hypertext markup language (HTML) and active scripts, embedded web pages via iframe technology, and properties for descriptive information such as item subject, item type, deadline, urgent status, completed status, date modified last, etc., that can be leveraged for task and project management oriented features and functions within the system.","The relational database  receives SQL queries from the query builder component . The relational database  also sends SQL rowsets to the rowset parser component , which in turn passes each parsed row to the enumerator component , which obtains the item type being parsed from the type factory component , assembles the parsed rowset into a format, e.g. projects type , or categories type , that can then be bound to the shell browser and view component's  treeview controls by the data binding component, along with dynamically parsed instructions containing instantiated type information forming the basis for parameterizing subsequent user requests. Examples of instantiated type information might be the folder attribute values allowing the system to map a visually rendered folder on the screen display to a specific project, or category, in the relational database .","The file broker component  receives file oriented requests from the request broker component . File oriented requests span a plethora of common tasks; e.g. attaching, adding, or uploading files to a local hard disk , a network connected file server , or any other type of media capable of directory creation and file storage. Additional requests received by the file broker component  consist of operations that rename, delete, copy, or move files throughout the file server  or hard disk . Additionally the file broker component  can take the physical address of a file under system management and generate a web enabled address, i.e., URL type links, for stored files on the hard disk  or file server  of the embodiment.","The file broker component  is responsible for passing requests to the input\/output component . Requests are then passed along to the input\/output component , responsible for reading from and writing to the hard disk  or file server . These requests directly manipulate both physical directories, and the physical files, as required to satisfy the file broker component's  received request.","In the embodiment, each user's unique system identifier, i.e. their userid, becomes the name for the file server  directory where their files are stored. Further, each item's unique identifier value becomes the name for subdirectories where files are stored. This subdirectory or folder naming process occurs on a one to one basis where each item represents one discrete subfolder\/directory on the file server  and will physically house all files associated with said item in the system.","The input\/output component  ensures proper directories currently exist, or are created on-demand, prior to reading from, or writing to, the file server  or hard disk . The outcome of the operation; namely success or failure, is then sent back to the file broker component , which will then parse the results into a new request submitted to the request broker component  to update both the system's database and shell browser and view component  through the file and digital content processor . Thus, rather than taking an unwieldy physical storage methodology for the system's file tier, the system opts to abstract the physical details, or characteristics of file storage, through simultaneous integration, and synchronization, with the relational database's files table .","Each record in the files table  maps directly to a file on the file server . Further, as previously mentioned, the files table  maintains location information which is used to create links to enable the downloading, previewing, copying, moving, deleting, and sharing of the files on the file server  or hard disk .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0134","num":"0133"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["106","86","96","98","102","108"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0135","num":"0134"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["90","66","118"]},"At a block, the file and digital content processor gets a file related request from user . At a block, the file and digital content processor  reads from and\/or writes to the file server . In a block, the file and digital content processor  passes a query to the relational database  to reflect the changes resultant from the file related operation . At a block, the file and digital content processor  provides results to the user as treeview folders and subfolders, items and files .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0137","num":"0136"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["132","120","86","122","86","124","86","126"]},"In a decision block, the user decides to select a different folder or subfolder . A new query generated  by the file and digital content processor  begins the process all over again as described above.","This routine may be considered the heart of the system by which users can explore their items and files both horizontally, and vertically. By selecting folders users gain immediate views of all items and files pertaining to said folder. By selecting subfolders, users gain immediate views of all items pertaining to not just that subfolder, but its parent folder as well.","This is the form and function of the project-category-pairs. Each folder selected reveals subfolders that can be selected to browse other project-category-pairs related to the subfolder's represented project, or category attribute value. The process is not unlike an abbreviated family tree structure where the project can be thought of as the father of an item and the category can be thought of as the mother of the item.","Each item can have full sibling relationships through identical project-category-pairs. As in real life, items, like children, can have half-siblings that share a single parent. In this case items can be related through a shared project, or category, but not both.","Thus, the folder\/subfolder structure of the treeviews may be thought of as representations of an extended family structure where all candidates capable of bringing children, i.e. items, into the world, are represented in each treeview control as root-level folders capable of displaying nested subfolders. The subfolder is the indicator that items or children exist and represent all pairings that resulted in the creation of items, and associated files.","The subfolders can be thought of as representing all the partners used to sire offspring from the perspective of the folder. To give a concrete example: a project named \u201cmusic\u201d may have items in the system with category attribute values such as \u201cblues\u201d, \u201cclassical\u201d, \u201crock and roll\u201d, \u201ccountry\u201d, \u201cswing\u201d, \u201csalsa\u201d, etc. Thus, clicking on the \u201cmusic\u201d project folder can show all items in the system pertaining to \u201cmusic\u201d.","The same is true for files when in file explorer mode. Clicking on the \u201cmusic\u201d folder would render to the screen all files currently attached to items having a project attribute value of \u201cmusic\u201d. In the above, abbreviated, extended family-tree analogy, selecting the \u201cmusic\u201d folder not only reveals all information stored in the system filtered by the \u201cmusic\u201d project (father), but the simultaneous dynamic population of associated categories as subfolders of the \u201cmusic\u201d project allows the user to then reverse the view by selecting a subfolder which will automatically synchronize the opposite treeview. The opposite treeview will now allow users to examine the other relationships any category related to \u201cmusic\u201d might share with any other project.","For example, selecting the \u201cmusic\u201d project's \u201cblues\u201d subfolder would have the following effect: items displayed on the screen would all have the project \u201cmusic\u201d and the category \u201cblues\u201d. In addition, the categories treeview control  would automatically display and select the \u201cblues\u201d category; i.e. automatic synchronization.","Expanding the \u201cblues\u201d category in the categories treeview control  would then display all projects that the \u201cblues\u201d category has paired with in the relational database's items table . For example, the category \u201cblues\u201d may list other projects as subfolders besides \u201cmusic\u201d, such as \u201cguitar\u201d, \u201csongwriting\u201d, \u201cvacations\u201d, \u201cnightclubs\u201d, etc.","From this point the user can select the \u201cnightclubs\u201d project subfolder and then the screen will automatically select all items with a project attribute value of \u201cnightclubs\u201d and a category attribute value of \u201cblues\u201d.","For example, one item matching this project-category filter of \u201cblue\/nightclubs\u201d might be an item with a subject of, \u201cBB King's Blues & Supper Club\u201d. This item may contains links, videos, driving instructions, an embedded webpage of the nightclub's website, etc.; all pertaining to the user's favorite New York City blues music related nightspot. The last selection would then re-synchronize the projects treeview control  to display all categories as subfolders under the \u201cnightclubs\u201d project folder in the projects treeview control .","This in turn, would show the \u201cblues\u201d category as a subfolder, and could contain other related categories such as \u201cdancing\u201d, \u201csupper\u201d, \u201ctechno\u201d, \u201cover 25\u201d, etc. Thus, users now can structure digital content and files according to a project-category-pair paradigm and manipulate the information under management by fast relationship discovery of related information simply by clicking on subfolders.","Users can, of course, browse data vertically, by selecting folders and subfolders to reveal matching items and files. However, a new and powerful dimension of folder and item\/file browsing is revealed via the system's dual treeview controls; horizontal browsing. The process is as simple as jumping from one treeview control to another to investigate items and file via a project-centric or category-centric perspective.","The projects treeview control  provides the project-centric view of data and the categories treeview control  provides the category-centric view of data. At any time, users can easily change the pivot, or viewpoint, by simply selecting a different folder, or by toggling the interface between file explorer and item explorer mode via the explorer mode toggle checkbox .","Finally, both items and files can be filtered not only on project-category-pair basis, but also by the column values of the files and items panes themselves. For example, the items pane [] provides a filter function by subject, allowing users to filter by partial text matches, similar to the way Google searches web pages. The same is true for the files pane . For example, the user can filter the files pane  by a partial text match on file name.","The file and digital content management system  addresses a major issue that modern computer users face; not being able to find files, or other important information, e.g. appointments, contacts, emails, etc. within the systems they rely upon to manage their data.","Whether the user does not know the exact location of files on a hard disk  or file server , or simply because they don't know or remember, the exact name of the file, email, appointment, etc. Either way undue effort must be applied in prior art to manage information efficiently.","The file and digital content management system  however, renders it virtually impossible to lose any item or file stored in the system. The dynamically linked treeview controls simultaneous vertical and horizontal integration via the project-category-pair methodology, combined with the powerful dual explorer mode methodology (item explorer mode or file explorer mode), not to mention partial text matching filters on items and files themselves, as well as multi-column sorts in the items pane  and files pane , all work in conjunction to suss out any information a user might seek in the system.","The ramifications of file and digital content management system  impact all manner of embodiments that might benefit digital users. For example, a social networking website that enables users to publish items to a public version of the system, where the items and files contributed by users would automatically be classified through the project-category-pairs. Users can then discover endless amounts of files and information; be it music, video, books, scientific articles, etc. Users could then \u201cwalk the treeviews\u201d discovering similar information that might be of interest simply by following the subfolder synchronization feature described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0157","num":"0156"},"figref":["FIG. 5B","FIG. 5"],"b":["86","514","516","84","82","86"]},"Following the system logic from the dual perspectives of both the projects treeview control  and the categories treeview control , illustrates the interconnectedness of the treeview controls to one another, as well the items and files pane . This dynamic interrelatedness forms the foundation for the graphical user interface that represents the \u201cuser experience\u201d. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art of designing user interfaces that anticipation of use-cases as a mechanism for integrating user interface components, yields systems that users are more inclined to perceive as both friendly and intuitive.","Thus, from a projects treeview use-case, at a block the user selects a folder from the projects treeview control . In a decision block the system determines whether the selected folder is a root-level project folder or a category subfolder . If the user has selected a root-level project folder, no cross-referencing or auto-synchronizing of the opposite treeview control is required, and execution flows to the block set project filter .","However, if the user has selected a subfolder in the projects treeview control , a three-step process must be executed by the file and digital content processor  to transform the shell browser and view component . Thus, at a block the system will obtain the category identifier  value of the subfolder, which represents the category filter to be applied to all screen transformations .","As previously mentioned, the category subfolder exists by virtue of its relationship to a containing project, which represents a specific project-category-pair used by the system for filtering both the files pane  and the items pane , as dictated by the explorer mode toggle checkbox  setting.","Selecting a subfolder always has the effect of climbing the treeview to obtain the value of the containing folder. Thus, at a block the system will set the project filter to the project identifier  value represented by the category subfolder's direct, root-level parent, in the treeview control structure; i.e., a project.","The dual treeview controls enforce an auto-synchronization process that is triggered by the subfolder selection use-case. Each subfolder's identifier value can be mapped to a root-level folder in the opposite treeview control. The subfolders are, after all, merely a marker indicating a value from the opposite treeview, which indicates the existence of a project-category-pair in the relational database's items table .","Thus, to enforce the embodiment's auto-synchronization mandate, at a block the system transforms the categories treeview control  such that it displays and highlights the same category  as that of the selected subfolder.","At this point the bifurcated segment of the projects treeview selection use-case concludes. The projects treeview selection flow has covered any project and category specific requirements for generating requests to the file and digital content processor . Thus, before completing the flow began in block , it may be appreciated by those skilled in the art the benefits of comparing and contrasting the corollary process from the perspective of the remaining treeview control; namely the categories treeview.","Therefore, at a block the user selects a folder from the categories treeview control . In a decision block the system next determines whether the selected folder is a root-level category folder or a project subfolder . If the user has selected a root-level category folder, no cross-referencing or auto-synchronization of the projects treeview control  is required and execution flows to the block set category filter .","However, if the user has selected a subfolder in the categories treeview control , another three-step process must be executed by the file and digital content processor  to transform the shell browser and view component .","Thus, it becomes apparent that treeview controls have a great deal in common when in it comes to generating system requests. The root-level folder always represents a single filter to be applied. The subfolder always represents a pair of filters.","Thus, in a block the system will obtain the project identifier  value of the categories treeview subfolder representative of the project filter to be applied  to all screen transformations. Like the category subfolder, the project subfolder exists only by virtue of its relationship to a containing folder, in this case, a category, as resolved through the project and category attributes of any given item in the system, and by association, any file.","Thus, user selection of a subfolder from the categories treeview always represents a product; items possessing the project identifier  value of the subfolder, and the category identifier  value of the containing folder. Again, these can be thought of as the parents of an item. Subfolder selection always applies a specific project-category-pair used by the system for filtering the files pane  and items pane . As mentioned above, selecting a subfolder always has the effect of climbing the treeview structure to obtain the value of the containing folder. In this case, at a block the system will set the category filter to the category identifier  value represented by the project subfolder's direct root-level parent in the treeview control structure .","As abundantly mentioned, the dual treeview controls enforce an auto-synchronization process that is triggered by subfolder selection. Each subfolder's identifier value can be mapped to a root-level folder in the opposite treeview control; and this is precisely what makes the treeviews dynamic. This is the heart of exposing data constructs capable of browsing horizontal relationships.","By revealing \u201cone-offs\u201d of specific project category-pairs as ancillary, unselected subfolders of selected folders, users can easily and quickly change the pivot, or viewpoint used, to examine items and files representing the products of other couplings of root-level folders.","It cannot be emphasized enough the earth-shaking ramifications represented by such a dramatic departure from traditional folder browsing. Users now possess the means, and methodology, to visually explore the relationships inherent, yet hitherto lost, in traditional systems; namely simultaneous horizontal and vertical integration along two dimensions; project-centric and category-centric browsing.","The capacity for horizontal and vertical integration thus quadruples the basic views available to users of the system. All that is required to realize this informational cornucopia is an understanding of two relatively uncomplicated concepts; namely project-category-pairs, and item\/file explorer modalities.","Further, the proximate visualization of other pairings for a containing folder, modeled as subfolders, empowers users to discover files and items that may possess an interconnected relationship that is simply incapable of visual representation in single treeview style shell explorer paradigm.","Prior art is severely challenged by the single treeview control methodology. There can be no simultaneous alternate visual representation of a dual cross-referenced relationship because the concept of basic data building-blocks, or units, i.e., items and files, requiring two parents for creation, is counter-intuitive to current explorer, or information management systems, which adopt physical, or pseudo-physical, i.e., virtual folder system, methodologies.","The absence of a second treeview in prior art embodiments, let alone one that is dynamically connected via a cross-referencing methodology of dual categorization pairings, is, in a nutshell, uncharted territory in the wilderness that is information management. The requirement is not merely to examine dual representations of the same thing, but also to view offshoots that are partially correlated to any given project-category-pair from both sides of the pairing; namely project to category, or, category to project. The dual treeviews taken together create the simultaneous viewpoint with no toggling required by the user.","In short, the embodiment eliminates a tremendous amount of unnecessary folder browsing. To even achieve a pale imitation of this capability a user would be forced to open two separate instances of an explorer and view them side by side. Any and all associations would require human thought, and manual folder browsing in separate disconnected, static instances of a prior art shell browser.","Thus, in the embodiment, to automatically synchronize the projects treeview control  with the selected categories treeview control's selected project subfolder, in a block the system transforms the projects treeview control  such that it displays and highlights the same project as that of the selected subfolder .","At this point the categories treeview control  oriented portion of the logical bifurcation, supporting the dual, auto-synchronized treeview control shell browser and view component  is satisfied. Once again logical flow of both use-cases has converged after all procedural steps have been completed that are necessary to populate parameter values for requests to the file and digital content processor  request broker component .","Now that the use-case specific flow has converged, yet another critical requirement of the system must be satisfied; which explorer mode for the view panes to implement; item or file?","Thus, in a decision block the system determines whether its dual explorer mode is set to its default of item explorer mode , or, the user has toggled the explorer mode toggle checkbox  to put the system into file explorer mode. File explorer mode transforms the files pane  such that all associated files are displayed through the resolution of their associated item identifier  values as queried by the system, matching by current project, or category filters, as may exist due to the aforementioned use-case scenarios.","Should item explorer mode be controlling the screen transformation request, in a block the items pane is transformed to display all items corresponding to the various use-case scenarios  as they relate to treeview selection. This always results in the same general process executing in the various components of the file and digital content processor .","Requests are received by the request broker component  containing multiple parameters, including the explorer mode active; as well as identifier values representing various filters the embodiment offers the user for refining data displayed. The project and category filters, as depicted in this diagram, are of paramount importance to the system when constructing queries to the relational database . These become the values for the SQL \u201cwhere\u201d filters supplied to the SQL query, generated by the query builder component . These are stored in, and served by the filter component  in an on-demand basis to the query builder component .","Therefore, at the point where the request broker component  receives a request generated by the use-case of selecting a folder in a treeview control, the file and digital content processor  can parcel or subdivide the request into different components, to most efficiently transform the data sent back to the user. For example, the filter component  can store values for project, category, item subject, file name, etc., throughout the user's session. Thus, the filters possess a \u201cstickiness\u201d in that once a folder is selected it will affect the project filter, the category filter, or both in the case of subfolder selection, which always includes its containing folder, as a parameter, in requests issued to the file and digital content processor .","However, those skilled in the art will recognize that the absence of filters is as valuable as the filters themselves. Further, the system should remember previous filters until they are changed to reduce user effort unnecessarily. Therefore, to remove a project or category filter, the user must first take affirmative action, or the filter's most recent value, even if it is a default value of \u201cno filter\u201d, will persist for the duration of the user's session. For example, the remove project filter button , and the remove category filter button , will remove the project and category filters respectively, and represents affirmative action on the user's part. It must be noted that in this embodiment, filter pairs are always optional, i.e. the user can see all items for a project, all items for a category, or all items for a project-category combination. Further, there is no requirement to have either project or category filters active, in which case data under management can be viewed for all projects and categories.","No skill in the art is required to appreciate that files are often associated with a primary data representation. In the case of this embodiment, the primary data unit that organizes and integrates files throughout the system is the item. This arrangement is on par with the typical email system, and can be appreciated by anyone familiar with how an email system functions. Emails are the primary unit of an email system. Emails possess individual attributes, e.g., a subject, a recipient, a sender, perhaps a \u201ccc\u201d (carbon copy list) thereby to include other recipients, a document body containing the email text, any images, etc. The email, like the item, has its own unique value or meaning, that is system, or, implementation specific.","Yet regardless of the context represented by basic units in a data management system they generically integrate as the fundamental building blocks of said system. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that no contemporary information management system can be considered complete without a way to manage files. Items, like emails, can have files associated with them as \u201cattachments\u201d.","Using our email analogy we find that this email to attachments\/files relationship creates a conundrum when it comes to dealing with files; how to simultaneously model two separate relationships; namely attachments to emails and attachments to other attachments connected with other emails, and finally all files in the system independent of emails.","Therefore most email systems choosing to simply model the email to attachments relationship do their users a disservice by preventing a broader perspective of all files on a system, not to mention different sub categorizations thereof; e.g. by related emails.","For example, in an email system, emails containing attachments usually have a paperclip icon next to the e-mail's subject. The user interprets this as meaning the email has one or more attachments. Thus, to view said attachments, the user must open the email, whereby a mechanism is presumed to display the attached files and allow further interaction with them.","While this methodology is relatively straight-forward it is, unfortunately, tremendously limited. It completely neglects the relationship of emails to one another, and how that might affect the relationships of attached files. For example, two separate emails could be part of an email thread concerning a job applicant sending their resume to a corporate recruiter to try and land the job of their dreams. There might be documents in both emails added as attachments, and presumably, they would relate to the same subject; getting a job. However, to access both sets of files in an integrated fashion, the user would have to view each email separately, perhaps by opening the email program twice if that is possible. Regardless of whatever hoops a user is willing to jump through to bridge the gap, the lack of specific integration features, or functions, for toggling the view mode to model or represent the files\/attachments to items relationships, in addition to the file to file relationships, as resolved both through the emails, and amongst the files themselves, remain absent.","The file and digital content management system  takes a different approach than that of the typical information management system, be it an email system or a file shell browser style explorer system. The embodiment stresses the interconnectedness of not just items as they relate to both projects and categories, but also to files as they relate not just to items, but as they relate to projects, and categories, too.","As every file can be traced to an associated item , and every item can be traced to both a project and a category, the files pane  can either represent the direct file to item association to control file display, as is the case in item explorer mode, or it can use the associated items  by proxy, to treat files like items for the purpose of project and category-wide browsing of files, i.e.; file explorer mode.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that data is a valuable commodity and further, that data is relativistic, in the sense that data exists in a context. Certainly, systems that do not support a methodology empowering system users to easily and intuitively discover the interconnected relationships existent in their data is one that is sorely lacking. The great advantage of digital systems is, in a word; automation, and it is an irony that users must still resort to tedious treeview folder browsing to remain productive, as is required by \u201cprior art\u201d embodiments of shell browser style explorer paradigms. Thus, in a block the system transforms the files pane  by any available project, and\/or category, filter(s), that are either in the immediate request generated by a treeview control use-case, or resulting from a current request combined with previous filters stored in the filter component .","This covers all combinations of transforming items, and files, as they relate to both one another, and to projects and categories. From this point on additional granularity can only be achieved by further refining the filtered data, for example by applying a partial text match on an item name or file name, date range filters, shopping cart style selected item and file filters, etc.","As illustrated in , and labeled as \u201cPRIOR ART\u201d, a folder is a \u201cmy documents\u201d  folder. At a first level, the \u201cMy Documents\u201d  folder includes a \u201cClient 1\u201d  folder, a \u201cClient 2\u201d  folder, and a \u201cClient 3\u201d  folder. Continued folder expansion or browsing reveals an additional level of folders, namely the \u201cClient 1 Contracts\u201d  folder, \u201cClient 2 Contracts\u201d  folder and the \u201cClient 3 Contracts\u201d  folder. Browsing ever deeper through the folder structure then reveals the existence of the \u201cClient 1 2001 Contracts\u201d  folder, the \u201cClient 2 2001 Contracts\u201d  folder, and the \u201cClient 3 2001 Contracts\u201d  folder, in addition to the \u201cClient 1 2002 Contracts\u201d  folder, the \u201cClient 2 2002 Contracts\u201d  folder and the \u201cClient 3 2002 Contracts\u201d  folder.","It will be appreciated that a number of obstacles are presented to the user who wishes to navigate a physical folder file structure contained within one treeview control, as illustrated in . For example, if the user wishes to work with all of the contracts that the user has produced, the user will first need to navigate to the folder to work with the contracts for \u201cClient 1\u201d , and then will have to re-navigate to the folder to reach the contracts for \u201cClient 2\u201d , and will again have to re-navigate to the folder for the contracts for \u201cClient 3\u201d .","This arrangement makes it difficult for the user to access all of the contracts, and in general, prevents simultaneous viewing and manipulation of all of the contracts. Similarly, if the user wishes to view all of the contracts produced in the year 2001, the user will have to navigate and re-navigate to the \u201cClient 1 2001 Contracts\u201d  folder, the \u201cClient 2 2001 Contracts\u201d  folder and the \u201cClient 3 2001 Contracts\u201d  folder.","The dual treeview controls of this embodiment provide a satisfying alternative to unlimited, unpredictable, and unwieldy hierarchies of folder structures characteristic of single treeview explorer shell interfaces mapping to physical directories on a hard disk , or other similar media. Few long time computer users could claim immunity from the \u201cneedle in a haystack\u201d trap this paradigm ceaselessly threatens to spring upon any but the most vigilant, organized and conscientious users.","Currently, the alternative paradigm is the virtual folder system. While offering more possibilities than the traditional, physically structured treeview hierarchical representation, nonetheless, it too, suffers from many of the same deficiencies described in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0202","num":"0201"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"212"},"As will be described in more detail below, virtual folders etc. location-independent views that allow users to manipulate their files and folders in abstracted ways, attempting to bridge the gap between location and content, insofar as the information relates to organization, presentation, and manipulation. As shown in  virtual folders are represented as stacks. A virtual folder is an \u201cAll items\u201d folder . At a first level, the \u201cAll items\u201d folder  presents the same information as , in three root-level folders, namely the \u201cClients\u201d folder , the \u201cContracts\u201d folder , and the \u201cYear\u201d folder . At a second level the \u201cClients\u201d folder  expands to reveal the \u201cContracts\u201d subfolder , and the \u201cYear\u201d subfolder .","While this enables users to change the view perspective, or pivot, by clients, contracts and year respectively, nevertheless users must still manually dig into the folder structure to toggle views of files and items; in other words, the user cannot see all the pivot views simultaneously. Further, as attributes, or metadata, are leveraged to create stacks in these types of systems, additional vertical nesting of folders as attributes will be drawn to the screen, thereby increasing the level of complexity of both the relationships being modeled, and the steps required to manipulate information. By providing three different views of the same data the user must confront three top level choices, and then, yet another two additional nested choices.","This type of matrix results in a situation where one more folder, e.g. \u201ctax records\u201d would result in four first level choices and three second level choices. Yet another modeled metadata attribute, e.g., \u201cpurchase orders\u201d, would now result in 5 first level folders and four nested folders per first level folder. There is both a multiplicative, and a duplicative effect on the treeview structure. Rather than one folder modeling contracts, we end up with one \u201cContracts\u201d first level folder, and then one \u201cContracts\u201d subfolder  per first level folder, namely a \u201cContracts\u201d subfolder  under \u201cclients\u201d and under \u201cyear\u201d. Further complicating matters, should the nesting level in  grow in size, so too does the virtual folder system in . For example if \u201cyears\u201d were further divided into fiscal quarters, four additional folders would be added to the structure; e.g. \u201c2001 quarter 1\u201d, \u201c2001 quarter 2\u201d, \u201c2001 quarter 3\u201d, and \u201c2001 quarter 4\u201d.","In  that would result in a third level of the treeview structure and an additional 12 folders. Should the \u201cFiscal Quarters\u201d folders be further sub-classified the process would continue, adding one level of virtual folder per every folder on the parent level. The complexities of representation, and therefore manipulation, inherent in a single treeview folder structure, regardless of physical modeling or virtual modeling, remain; except now the problems of duplication required to model the different categories create new challenges to the user. Further, as treeviews are contained by the height of the screen, duplication can easily lead to errors as users have to scroll up and down to discern the context of the folder viewed; i.e., is it the \u201cContracts\u201d folder of the \u201cClients\u201d folder  or the \u201cYear\u201d folder ?","The greater the number of levels, the more horizontal and vertical scrolling required to keep one's place, and therefore, train of thought. Fatigue and errors are often the result and productivity suffers accordingly. In short, the single treeview shell, irrespective of virtual or physical folder methodology or modeling, does not scale well vertically, and does not scale at all horizontally, as all attributes are modeled by adding levels to the single treeview. Thus, the prior art embodiments still leave a wide gap between the way data is modeled on the screen versus how it is mentally or conceptually modeled by human users; in other words the natural way we relate information in our heads is diametrically opposed to the endless, unwieldy, vertical nesting, inherent in all shell browser paradigms to date.","In terms of abstraction required to create a hierarchical deeply nested treeview modeling the type of virtual folder systems existing in prior art, the user is expected to associate folders with columns; a major paradigmatic shift that is counter-intuitive. In traditional tabular, or row and column based depictions of data as found in relational databases, spreadsheets, and general listings of information, each column represents attributes of the thing described. For example a file has a name, a size, a date modified, and a type amongst other possible attributes. For a virtual folder system like the one described in , to model this paradigm, folders would be created for all files, filename, data modified, type, etc.","The tabular format pre-dates the popularity of the personal computer , and is both familiar and self-explanatory to most computer users. Things are visualized horizontally.","A single file would be depicted as one row comprising many columns. This is a horizontal, discrete conceptualization of data. The virtual folder system converts this row into a vertical column of folders, thus changing the physical orientation of the way data is typically visualized. Additionally, each view in the type of virtual folder system described in  must create one folder per column and then nest all additional columns as subfolders.","Thus, eight columns for a \u201cthing\u201d results in eight primary folders containing seven subfolders, the unwieldiness growing in direct correlation to its size. This is in direct contradiction to a tabular format where there is only one row to represent one \u201cthing\u201d; the concept of \u201cone\u201d representing the quintessence of simplicity. However, with the file and digital content management system , the simplicity of the traditional tabular structure for listing items and files is maintained by the simple realization that single treeview structures are ill-suited for the modeling of horizontal structures.","The typical shell browser interface is overstressed trying to represent horizontal and vertical relationships simultaneously. This embodiment, by simply creating two complementary treeview structures to model the same data along dual dimensions; namely project and category, can maintain the simplicity of the tabular format for representing attributes, or columns of a \u201cthing\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0213","num":"0212"},"figref":"FIG. 7B","b":"180"},"While the embodiments described in the other diagrams all refer to \u201cproject-category\u201d pairings, it must be stressed that the specific names used to label the two categories; e.g. projects, categories, etc., are completely arbitrary assignments that in no way should be construed as limitations of the invention or to any specific embodiment.","While an individual can have their name legally changed they are still, after all, the same person, and such is the case with the dual categorizations naming convention. The essence of the dual treeview categorization, and organization methodology is the flexibility inherent therein.","The naming of the two categories can be any arbitrary assignment whatsoever, much in the way a rose by any other name would still smell as sweet. Thus, to clarify the flexible nature of the dual-categorization methodology that lies at the heart of the invention we can imagine that the two broad categorizations used to create items can be named in any manner beneficial to the types of items saved. Further, while the embodiments discussed elsewhere presume the user is naming the root-level folders or categories of the system, this can be done at a systems level.","For example, in an embodiment for organizing clothing for a retail website we may have two broad categories labeled as \u201capparel\u201d and \u201cmanufacturer\u201d. Thus all items would contain an \u201capparel-manufacturer\u201d category-pairing. In this case the user would presumably not be naming the individual category assignments, or root-level folders.","For example, the system could automatically name the folders based upon items found in inventory, thus one item might be a men's suit from the manufacturer \u201cHugo Boss\u201d. Here the item could be \u201cGrey Single Breasted Suit 42R\u201d and the category-pair could be \u201cMen's Suits-Hugo Boss\u201d. Thus  distills the invention to its essence, a generic and flexible dual taxonomic methodology for identifying, organizing, and manipulating stored digital items. Items can represent absolutely anything from suits, to compact-discs, to movies, to DNA Sequences. Further, the names of the two umbrella categorizations can be anything that best suits any particular embodiment, and finally the origination of the individual category assignments can be user, or system generated, or both.","For a medical oriented embodiment we might have two broad categories such as \u201cdiseases\u201d and \u201ctreatments\u201d and all items would then simply consist of \u201cdisease-treatment\u201d category-pairs. Or, in a music-related embodiment the categories could be labeled, \u201cgenres\u201d and \u201cartists\u201d and every music-related item would possess a \u201cgenre-artist\u201d category-pair. The underlying process, and requisite hardware, required to implement any customized embodiment would be no different, only the names of the treeviews would change to accommodate the desired embodiment's theme. Or, as in , we can simply have two broad categories for illustration of the flexible and generic nature of the cross-referencing methodology entitled, \u201cCategory 1\u201d and \u201cCategory 2\u201d.","This should drive home the point that the invention is completely adaptable to any type of digital data items that require manipulation. Further, there is no absolute requirement that the system needs to manipulate computer files, in addition to digital data. An embodiment of the invention could simply manipulate digital items without the need for associated computer files.","For example, an embodiment that comprises an online encyclopedia e.g., \u201cwikipedia\u201d, could benefit from the dual-categorization methodology by creating two broad categorizations, \u201cfield\u201d and \u201ccontributors\u201d and could thus organize encyclopedic items utilizing \u201cfield-contributor\u201d category-pairs. Here, there would be no \u201chard\u201d requirement to include a digital file management system in this hypothetical encyclopedia embodiment, and all the benefits of the dual treeview categorization methodology would remain intact.","However, should it be perceived at any point the addition of an associated file management feature would be beneficial, the system, as mentioned throughout this document, is equipped to support it.","Thus, we can isolate the key features of the system's dual-categorization and dynamically linked treeview controls in the most generic fashion; namely filtering, and dynamic cross-referencing of treeviews via subfolder selection, as is the case with .","Here we have two treeview controls. The first is a treeview style control representing generic \u201cCategory 1\u201d . The second is a treeview style control representing \u201cCategory 2\u201d .","The \u201cCategory 1\u201d treeview  contains a root-level category node, or folder, \u201cA\u201d , and a system generated \u201cCategory 2\u201d subfolder \u201cB\u201d , indicative of one, or more, existent category-pairs found within the system's items.","The \u201cCategory 2\u201d treeview  contains a root-level category node, or folder, \u201cB\u201d , and a system generated \u201cCategory 1\u201d subfolder \u201cA\u201d , indicative of one, or more, existent category-pairs found within the system's items.","The items pane  lists the digital items under management in this example. It contains a list of items containing three key attributes, represented by the column headers of the items pane ; namely, \u201cITEM\u201d , \u201cCATEGORY 1\u201d , and \u201cCATEGORY 2\u201d . The \u201cITEM\u201d column  lists the name of the item, the \u201cCATEGORY 1\u201d column lists the \u201cCategory 1\u201d attribute values as they relate to the root-level folders of the \u201cCategory 1\u201d treeview. The \u201cCATEGORY 2\u201d column lists the \u201cCategory 2\u201d attribute values as they relate to the root-level folders of the \u201cCategory 2\u201d treeview.","The folders and subfolders from either treeview act as a filter upon said items pane . The treeviews contain two types of folders or nodes; root-level and subfolders. The root-level folders act as independent transformative filters on the items pane. Thus, \u201cCategory 1\u201d treeview root-level folders apply an independent filter transforming the items pane  to display items with a \u201cCategory 1\u201d attribute value corresponding to the value represented by the root-level folder. The same is true for \u201cCategory 2\u201d treeview root-level folders the only difference being the filter operates against the items \u201cCategory 2\u201d attribute.","Subfolders, as mentioned above, are the other type of folders found in treeviews and by definition, and design, appear beneath root-level folders. As the subfolder represents existent category-pairs within the items of the system, they apply a dual-filter; the value of the subfolder, and the value of the containing root-level folder. Further, selecting a subfolder from one treeview will automatically synchronize the opposite treeview control such that it will display and highlight the root-level folder that corresponds to the selected subfolder.","Thus, if a user selects root-level folder \u201cA\u201d  from the \u201cCategory 1\u201d treeview , the items pane  will be transformed such that only items with a \u201cCategory 1\u201d attribute  value of \u201cA\u201d  will be displayed. Thus the item, \u201cmy first item\u201d,  which possesses a \u201cCategory 1\u201d attribute  value of \u201cA\u201d will become part of the newly transformed items pane rendered information along with any other items containing the same value \u201cA\u201d.","Similarly, if a user selects root-level folder \u201cB\u201d  from the \u201cCategory 2\u201d treeview , the items pane  will be transformed such that only items with a \u201cCategory 2\u201d attribute  value of \u201cB\u201d  will be displayed. Thus, again, the item \u201cmy first item\u201d  which possesses a \u201cCategory 2\u201d attribute  value of \u201cB\u201d will become part of the newly transformed items pane rendered information along with any other items containing the same value \u201cB\u201d.","In this simplified example, the \u201cCategory 1\u201d treeview subfolder \u201cB\u201d  maps directly to the \u201cCategory 2\u201d treeview root-level folder \u201cB\u201d . Likewise, the \u201cCategory 2\u201d treeview subfolder \u201cA\u201d  maps directly to the \u201cCategory 1\u201d treeview root-level folder \u201cA\u201d . This illustrates the view-centric nature of the dual treeview methodology; every pairing of the two categories results in two views of the data displayed simultaneously; each view from alternate sides of the category-pair's perspective.","In this case the items listed in the items pane  all possess the category-pair \u201cA-B\u201d. The \u201cCategory 1\u201d treeview  affords the user a \u201cCategory 1\u201d-centric view of the data and the \u201cCategory 2\u201d treeview  affords the user a \u201cCategory 2\u201d-centric view of the data. Should a user simply wish to view all items with a \u201cCategory 1\u201d attribute  value of \u201cA\u201d they would select the \u201cCategory 1\u201d root-level folder \u201cA\u201d , and be sure to clear any pre-existing selections from the \u201cCategory 2\u201d treeview as category-pair filtering, or folder selection is additive. In this case, if there were category-pairings such as \u201cA-B\u201d, \u201cA-C\u201d, and \u201cA-D\u201d, they would all be displayed in the items pane .","Similarly, if the user wished to view all items with a \u201cCategory 2\u201d attribute  value of \u201cB\u201d they would select the \u201cCategory 2\u201d treeview root-level folder \u201cB\u201d , once again removing any \u201cCategory 1\u201d pre-existing filter if necessary. In this case, if there were category-pairings \u201cF-B\u201d, \u201cG-B\u201d, and \u201cH-B\u201d, they would all be displayed in the items pane . Thus, the independent filtering nature of the root-level folders enables users to view data as it pertains to one unit of the pair.","However, as  illustrates, selecting either the subfolder \u201cB\u201d  from the \u201cCategory 1\u201d treeview , or, the subfolder \u201cA\u201d  from the \u201cCategory 2\u201d treeview  will create a full pair filter; \u201cA-B\u201d, as we see illustrated in the items pane  of .","All the rows in the items pane  have a \u201cCATEGORY 1\u201d  value of \u201cA\u201d and a \u201cCATEGORY 2\u201d  value of \u201cB\u201d. Further, the automatic synchronization feature of the dual treeviews as previously mentioned, will display and highlight the corresponding root-level folder in the opposite treeview, along with any subfolders representative of existent category-pairings. This is the foundation of the system upon which all other embodiments, or manifestations will rest upon, a generic, dual taxonomic, or categorization system that can filter items along one, or both, sides of the category-pairings.","Thus, it becomes clear that the specific names of the two broad categories are malleable, it is the fact that two categories are required to create items in the system that is fundamental to understanding the system under discussion. A dynamically cross-referenced dual treeview shell or explorer interface can quickly, and easily, enable users to manipulate items under system management along these two broad categorizations. The ramifications of this approach to managing digital data shall be discussed further throughout the remainder of the diagram descriptions, and will hopefully become obvious to the reader in the embodiments provided beginning with .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0238","num":"0237"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":"84"},"In  the information is broken into project-category-pairs.

As will be seen in  the simple act of checking the explorer mode toggle checkbox  will create a file-centric pivot or perspective of the same data, opening exciting possibilities for understanding the data within the dynamic \u201cat-a-glance\u201d methodology of the embodiment.","The first thing to notice is the horizontal integration made possible by utilizing a dual treeview structure. At a glance the user can see by the item count display  that there are six items to view and by the attachments count display  that there is one file on display. The user can see that all items have a category attribute value of \u201cContracts\u201d, the selected category as visually indicated by the highlighted display of the \u201cCONTRACT\u201d category filter .","The existence of the paperclip icons for each row serves as a visual indicator that all six items have associated files, and thus, can be viewed in the files pane  simply by clicking the desired item's attachment link, i.e. the paperclip icon. Further, the user can see that there are items corresponding to the \u201cClient 1\u201d project  folder, the \u201cClient 2\u201d project  folder and the \u201cClient 3\u201d project  folder, visually indicated by the nesting of the \u201cClient 1\u201d project subfolder , the \u201cClient 2\u201d project subfolder , and \u201cClient 3\u201d project subfolder .","This is the category to project perspective previously mentioned. The exact same information shown in the items pane  is depicted in reverse, or \u201cupside-down\u201d fashion by the projects treeview control . Here we can see that the three projects, the \u201cClient 1\u201d project  folder, the \u201cClient 2\u201d project  folder and the \u201cClient 3\u201d project  folder, all share a pairing to the \u201cContracts\u201d category as evidenced by the existence of the \u201cClient 1 Contracts\u201d subfolder , the \u201cClient 2 Contracts\u201d subfolder , and \u201cClient 3 Contracts\u201d subfolder .","Subfolder nesting in either treeview control can never exceed one level; i.e. the depth of the project-category-pair. Thus, there is a predictability inherent in the treeview controls' modeling of project-category-pairs.","The projects treeview control  will always list projects at the root-level and contains exactly one level of nested subfolders; specifically the categories subfolders. Conversely, the user can count on the fact that the categories treeview control  will always possess one root-level of folders representing categories, and exactly one level of nested subfolders; specifically projects.","Items or files are always grouped by either a project-centric view in the projects treeview control  as project folders and category subfolders; or by a category-centric view as depicted in the categories treeview control  as category folders and project subfolders. Rather than resort to the additional creation and nesting of folders to model \u201cYear\u201d or \u201cClients\u201d as in , determining the year is as simple as taking advantage of the sorting and filtering functions offered by the items pane .","For example, a partial text match containing the text string, \u201c2001\u201d, would only show items where the text string \u201c2001\u201d existed somewhere within the subject; namely all 2001 Contracts. Additional client specific filters can be applied simply by clicking the project folders.","Further, by storing all projects and categories in the relational database , each treeview control can be quickly filtered by typing a partial text match, for example, typing \u201cclient\u201d in the project treeview text filter  would be sufficient to display all projects concerning clients. Applying the Google type search or filter methodology to refining projects, categories, items, and files provides a welcome alternative to managing very large treeview structures and leverages the project-category-pair paradigm in familiar and intuitive ways to minimize unnecessary user fatigue, and errors, resultant from browsing complex, and often abstract, hierarchies of folders.","The remove project filter button  in the projects treeview control  and the remove category filter button  in the categories treeview control  can quickly remove filters. This enables users to easily and intuitively filter by project, category, both, or neither. The column headers of the treeview controls and the view panes in the embodiment allow single, or additive multi-column sorting, in addition to partial text filtering.","This scenario not only provides a mechanism for horizontal and vertical scaling of data in the file and digital content management system  but encourages it by offering users a centralized interface that does not overwhelm with the abstractions and complexities inherent in prior art explorer type systems.

Thus unlike other prior art systems, the file explorer mode can use the item as a metadata store; i.e. the file can be selected and viewed within the context of an item and all its associated attributes, e.g. modified last, details, subject, etc.","What file explorer mode does not change however, is the project-category-pair methodology. With elegant simplicity, the user can now store any type of rich digital content as an item, associate files with it, and take macro or micro perspectives of the data by simply selecting folders from the treeview controls. Further, the simple act of checking and unchecking, the explorer mode toggle checkbox  enables users to easily toggle explorer modes, thus integrating their data from a multitude of perspectives previously unavailable in the prior art.

The userid column  found in the projects and categories table , enables the embodiment to operate on a macro scale or a per user scale.","Thus, the embodiment can function as a single user file and digital content management shell for individuals, groups, or for a global information sharing network. This allows for embodiments where various roles can be assigned to users, e.g. administrative, as might be used in an embodiment for a company intranet information management system. The types allow the enumerator component  to transform the rows and columns of the relational database  returned by the rowset parser component , in response to user generated queries. The transformation is achieved by instantiating the types as objects, e.g. a project, that can be mapped to a column attribute.","For example, the column of the relational database's projects table , maps to the projects type  project identifier  attribute. The query results can be transformed such that information in the system is dynamically linked via shared attributes.","For example, the project identifier  exists in both the project type and the item type. This enables the shell browser and view component  to link projects to the items type . The same is true for the categories type , which links to the items type . Further, the relationship between files in the system, as modeled by the files type  and the items type , can also share. The categoryid and the projectid columns in the relational database  enforce the relationships required to enforce referential integrity amongst the system data.","They further provide the queries with a methodology for joining tables by the key columns, e.g. projectid, categoryid, itemid, userid, etc., to dynamically deliver the information required by the cross-referencing component  of the file and digital content processor's  request to populate subfolders for the treeview controls. The enumerator component  of the file and digital content processor  can reconcile the column values supplied, on a row by row basis, by the rowset parser component .","Each column value supplied to the enumerator component  is simply mapped to a corresponding attribute of the instantiated type; e.g. the projectid column  value becomes the value of the categories types  category identifier  attribute. These types then are transformed and bound by the databinding component  to represent objects such as treeview folders. This enables project identifiers , category identifiers , and the like, to be leveraged by the shell browser and view component  to dynamically link user actions; e.g. clicking on a folder, to specific requests to the request broker component .","At any point in the process, user actions are automatically capable of creating parameterized queries to the file and digital content processor . For example, the projects type  contains the project identifier  attribute used to filter items, and files, by specific project folder selected by the user in the shell browser and view components projects treeview control . The attachmentid column  in the files table  is used in the embodiment to enable users to select one or more files for participation in common file management system scenarios, e.g. copy, move, delete, download, etc. The user identifier  can also be used to not only filter information by single users, or groups of users, but also facilitates communication by rapidly allowing shared items to be identified with their original author.","For example, if a user in the embodiment generates a hyperlink to enable an item to be viewed in a browser, that link can be emailed to multiple recipients. Those recipients in turn can forward those links. At any given point, a recipient of the item link can identify the original author of the content through the embedded user identifier . In a social networking paradigm, this can facilitate security and collaboration scenarios, e.g. getting in touch with the original author to discuss the content, or contacting a provider to complain about objectionable material. No user is anonymous in the system and can always be readily identified as the system grows to accommodate vast amounts of content. Further, intellectual property rights can be easily respected by having a mechanism to quickly remove material that any individual user does not have the right to publish.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0298","num":"0297"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":["288","258","290","292","88","90","91","294","91","90","280"]},"In the embodiment, the file and digital content processor's  request broker component  and file broker component  work in tandem to keep the files synchronized with the database; critical in maintaining the system's referential integrity. While the embodiment provides for an atomic transactional model, i.e. file operations and database operations either succeed or fail as a whole, the structuring of the information provides a failsafe whereby the file server  can be audited at any time by the system for missing links, etc., by comparing the identifiers in the relational database  with the physical directory structures. Further, the embodiment's physical file structure methodology provides a major additional benefit; security through obfuscation.","As the folder naming mechanism is based, not upon text, but the unique computer generated values representing users and items, the content and ownership of the files is obscured. In other words, looking for a specific file is like searching for a needle in a haystack without intimate knowledge of the storage methodology implemented. An additional benefit appreciated by those tasked with administration responsibilities is that, like the treeview controls, the file system does not nest folders beyond the item level. Administrators need only know the user identifier , and item identifier , to manipulate physical files on the system.","No unpredictable folder nesting (a major deficiency of file shell browsers themselves) is introduced anywhere in the system. Thus, additional applications can be applied to the file system in accordance with the overall methodology of the embodiment; for example, an embodiment of the file and digital content management system  for system administrators. In such a scenario, the projects might consist of users and the categories of items. A system administrator can therefore manage files by groups of users. Thus, the system is not only scalable it is extensible; i.e. easy to modify, for new and previously unanticipated uses.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0302","num":"0301"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["84","196","300","298","198","304","302"]},"If a user selects a subfolder in either treeview control, it will trigger a call to the other treeview control to synchronize to display the subfolder clicked as a parent level folder in the opposite tree control. Additionally, as previously mentioned, this will activate the project and category filters that pass query requests to the file and digital content processor's  request broker component . This mechanism continuously synchronizes the entire shell browser and view component  and dynamically displays all related pairings as subfolders. At a glance, we understand the filter logic project folder is a subfolder in the categories treeview control , representing the two available combinations of associated items ; i.e. project-category or category-project.","The user can also see other pairings, represented as subfolders. Thus, it is apparent that the filter logic project has pairings with categories such as \u201cCODE\u201d, and \u201cUML\u201d, in addition to \u201cDRAWINGS\u201d. The user can see their filter logic project not only has associated drawings, but also code and uml type information.","In the case depicted; the information might be used to create drawings and diagrams in a patent application. The user can also see, at a glance of the categories treeview control , that the \u201cDRAWINGS\u201d category, in addition to being associated with the \u201cFILTER LOGIC\u201d project, is also associated with the \u201cORM DIAGRAM\u201d, \u201cRECYCLE\u201d, and \u201cGUI AS A WHOLE\u201d, projects.

One particular advantage of a web enabled embodiment is that a centralized storage location can be accessed from any Internet, or similar network connected, client.","The physical location of any particular machine becomes superfluous as any browser becomes capable of hosting the shell browser and view component ; and therefore, the entire file and digital content management system  becomes globally available, regardless of any specific client machine. The advantages of storing information in a globally available computer network enable a scalable, network of linked users, who can quickly share information and files through the file sharing features of the embodiment. This physical proximity of global file servers yields performance advantages for copying files between users in the system, and is equally effective in, for example, corporate intranets as it is in public extranets and the Internet itself.","Sharing files and information in this type of embodiment only requires that files be copied from one directory on the file server  to another directory; rather than from one computer to another, eliminating that paradigm's resultant latency of network upload and downloading wait-times required in such a single computer embodiment.","The data entry form is broken into sections through the form's tabbed control . The form's tabbed control  contains an \u201cItem Info\u201d tab , a \u201cDetails Editor\u201d tab , an \u201cAttachments\u201d tab , an \u201cAdd Video\u201d tab , and a \u201cMiniBrowser\u201d tab . This compartmentalized structure breaks the key aspects of the data entry paradigm into attribute, e.g. subject, and task related, e.g. \u201cEmail\/Share\u201d sections to help users quickly manipulate the items and attachments that represent the files and digital content under management.","The diagram depicts the first tab of the data entry form, the item info tab; where metadata for the item is entered, the item subject field , for example. The item info tab is broken into sections to group related fields, thereby clarifying the relationships of the fields modeled.","For example, the cross reference information section  contains dropdowns for projects and categories, which are required to save any item in the system. Further, an item type identifier  dropdown is provided so that any item can be toggled between two broad conceptual categories, namely \u201cto do\u201d or \u201cother\u201d. \u201cTo do\u201d items model tasks to be addressed by users, and \u201cother\u201d indicates the opposite; the item is not a task, e.g. a phone number or address stored as part of a \u201ccontacts\u201d category.","The to do\/task info section  models the task management aspect of the embodiment as a dual, digital content library-style, repository for collections of digital information; as well as a project, or task management system, possessing fields for the entry of attribute values such as deadline date and time, urgent status, and completed status.","Thus, the data entry form in this embodiment supports a generic, extensible, and multi-purpose management set. Items are general containers for all manner of rich content. They can be extended in multiple alternate embodiments to support all manner of information management systems capable of benefiting from the integrated and dynamic features of the file and digital content management system's  dual categorization and synchronization features.","It takes no skill in the art to realize that information generally falls into two broad categories; things we store persistently over time (such as a collection of music or the past 7 years tax returns), and things that imply some type of action on a user's part is required (such as a task).","There is a great deal of overlap and integration to be leveraged between these two broad distinctions, such as a persistent collection of driving directions and maps that are stored in a category; \u201cMAPS\u201d. These types of items can be combined with task type items to enable users to conduct their professional, academic, and personal lives more efficiently.","Another example occurs when a user enters an item with a subject of \u201cget grandma at the airport\u201d. The user can label the item as a \u201cTo Do\u201d type item and add the deadline date and time. The item would help to ensure grandma is not stood up at the airport.","Directions to the airport can be obtained from the maps category, and the two items can work in concert to help the user get to the airport to pick up grandma. Rich digital content can easily be copied and pasted between items through the \u201cdetails\u201d tab of the data entry form. For example, as will be illustrated in , a user can save an item with a subject of \u201cdriving to Kennedy airport\u201d and embed a live Google map into the item through the detail tab's rich web editor\/word processor feature. This item could be stored under a project \u201cDRIVING\u201d and category \u201cMAPS\u201d.","The data entry form further includes a save button ; for saving an item; and an add another item button ; for creating a new template with which a brand new item can be inserted into the relational database . A resync button  is provided in the embodiment to allow users to update displayed data entry forms with the latest data, as it is saved in the relational database  and on the file system hard disk  or file server . The system, in a web enabled embodiment, allows the shell browser and view component  to be opened multiple times; for example, in a tabbed browser.","Thus, the user can work with multiple, simultaneous views of the data under management, as is common in modern internet browser applications, e.g. Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari, etc. A resync feature would enable a user to ensure they are always viewing the latest available snapshot of the data as it is stored in the relational database  and on the file system. Further, in a multi-user embodiment, more than one user might make changes to items a user is currently working with. Thus, the user would appreciate a fast method for guaranteeing they are viewing up-to-date data. As those skilled in the art would appreciate, web enabled embodiments require a way to bridge the disconnected nature of clients on a network.

The user of the file and digital content management system  can always modify, or delete the item after the link is sent. Therefore, the user has fine grain control over communications not only right up to the point where it is received and viewed but even after the fact.","For example, if the user thinks of something else to add, or remove to an item, or if additional files need to be attached, it can be done after a link has already been sent via email.

The file and digital content processor  component can simply iterate through the list, performing its normal processes of modifying the contents of the file server  and relational database  as previously described.","Manipulating information through simple group and select features, combined with the ability to perform manipulations in batches, results in a greater productivity yield for individual users and furthermore suggests that tremendous productivity gains can be achieved in a networked file sharing embodiment, as said productivity yields are multiplied across large numbers of users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0383","num":"0382"},"figref":"FIG. 47","b":["488","488","490","492","84","66","86","278","66"]},"The search results listing  contains the link to the item. The link, just like the Email\/Share tab function of the data entry form, lists the item's subject attribute value, the project, and the category. Clicking on this link will filter the items pane  to display the selected item filtered by user selected search result . Thus, we see the items pane  contains one item, \u201cCSI DOCUMENTATION UPDATE WITH METHODS\u201d, matching the link selected. Once the item is displayed in the items pane  viewer, the user can select the filter on selected item project-category-pair  button and automatically synchronize the projects treeview control  and the categories treeview control  on the selected search result's project-category-pair; revealing other project-category-pairings, thus offering an additional level of horizontal system-wide integration; searchability. The visual indicator rich digital content search mode  reminds the user that they are in search mode. Simply unchecking the checkbox in this embodiment will return the shell browser and view component  to its default mode.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that no matter how intuitive a paradigm for information management is presented to the user, it is always possible to misplace an item through user error. Thus, a generalized digital content search feature provides another complementary integration mechanism of the file and digital content management system . In this embodiment, a partial text match is all that is required to return project-category-pairs, and item subject information, along with surrounding text, and rich digital content, enabling the link to convey the primary information the item represents. At this point, the user can leverage all the other integrated features of the system; e.g., project-category-pair filters, to further refine the data displayed. The shopping cart selected items, and files lists, can be modified to add the searched item or file to the general shopping cart lists for items and files. Thus, the user has another way to add items to be used in batch operations, and need never sacrifice productivity when confronted with the limitations of any general shell paradigm. All general use-cases are contemplated, and integrated, into the shell browser and view component's multi-tabbed paradigm, allowing key features required for maintaining control over ever-growing data repositories.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0386","num":"0385"},"figref":"FIG. 48","b":"180"},"The embodiment leverages just such a popular paradigm to enable users to quickly view contents, files, details, search, and other common features, and functions, associated with a full featured, rich digital content management and file browser system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0388","num":"0387"},"figref":"FIG. 49","b":["506","512","508","510","180"]},"Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the system offers a separate comma separated values (CSV) export feature enabling programmers to manipulate items in other programming environments, thus providing one of many potential extensible interface to programmers interested in system extension.","Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that the embodiment provides a multitude of integrated grouping, sorting, selecting, relating, viewing, exporting, cloning, deleting, copying, moving, editing, embedding, searching, filtering and synchronizing features, enabling embodiments to be further customized via the addition of new toolbar type buttons capable of further transforming the selected, grouped, or otherwise viewed information. Therefore, without needing to change the underlying schema of the file and digital content processor's  type system, or the schema of the relational database , additional features could be added to the embodiment on a system wide scale. For example, a browser like \u201cfavorites\u201d function could be added to the system to enable users to embed favorite web pages and favorite system items, in a table of the relational database  called \u201cfavorites.\u201d The \u201cfavorites\u201d could be linked to the items table  by item identifier . Thus, a new spin-off, \u201cfavorites\u201d, could be integrated throughout the system, i.e. dropdowns, tabs, etc., and provide users with shortcuts to favorite items that can be found via partial text matching, as used elsewhere throughout the system.","Although specific examples of carrying out the invention have been described, those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are numerous other variations and permutations of the above described systems and techniques. As but one such variation, some or all of the user interface controls in the items pane region or treeview region may be selectable using a keyboard. For example, a user might press a tab key to highlight a particular control and then activate that control by pressing the \u201cEnter\u201d key. As another example, a particular control may have a corresponding key combination (e.g., \u201cAlt+S\u201d).","In at least some embodiments, an application developer can modify aspects of how the categorizations modeled by the nodes, or folders of the treeview are created. For example, an application developer can enable a user to create root-level nodes in each of the treeview controls or may instead opt to create these directly from pre-existing items that are either created by one or more system users, external programs, or imported into the system from external sources. For example, a retail business may obtain inventory from a distributor and may opt to automatically create the various categories and representative folders in the treeviews directly from the imported data files. Further, an application developer could employ a mix of machines, methods and means allowing item categorizations to be created by system users, business personnel, parsed from external data sources, imported data feeds, or any combination thereof that is deemed advantageous to provide any desired outcome.","Embodiments of the invention also include a computer-readable medium having instruction recorded thereon which, when executed by a processor, perform steps of a method and\/or that implement a software architecture.","While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, it will be appreciated that the locations of the various user interface features that are shown herein are illustrative and may be altered, and that different placements of the various user interface features will still fall within the sprit and scope of the invention. Furthermore, the different aspects of the invention described herein may be formed in various combinations, also without departing from the sprit and scope of the invention. In addition, the various steps in the described processes may be rearranged, modified, and\/or deleted as desired to implement a selected subset of features described herein.
