The inclusion of such organic solvents in pharmaceutical compositions is potentially toxic and is thus preferably avoided. HPCD is relatively well tolerated but must be admixed with R-100 in a ratio of >20:1 (HPCD:R-100) in order to fully dissolve said compound. The upper limit of safety for clinical administration of HPCD is unknown, but the greatest amount approved for use in humans via an intravenous route is a daily quantity of 7 grams. Given the minimum usable ratio of 20:1 for the dissolution of R-100 and HPCD, and the limit of 7 grams of HPCD per day, the maximal amount of R-100 delivered in such an intravenous formulation would be 350 mg daily.","In order to overcome the limitations presented above, prodrugs of R-100, e.g., 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-(nitrooxymethyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl acetate, herein identified R-107, have been prepared. As surprisingly found, R-107 is stable oil until exposure to plasma, after which it is readily converted to its corresponding 1-pyrrolidinyloxy derivative R-100. R-107 has a density of 1.12 mg\/ml and may be administered in either pure form or diluted, e.g., in polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-400, via diverse routes including intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and topical, e.g., to the skin, wounds, ulcers, oral cavity, vagina, and anal canal.","In one aspect, the present invention thus provides a compound of the general formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0008"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"33.44mm","wi":"51.22mm","file":"US09604932-20170328-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"or an enantiomer, diastereomer, racemate, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof,","wherein","Reach independently is selected from H, \u2014OH, \u2014COR, \u2014COOR, \u2014OCOOR, \u2014OCON(R), \u2014(C-C)alkylene-COOR, \u2014CN, \u2014NO, \u2014SH, \u2014SR, \u2014(C-C)alkyl, \u2014O\u2014(C-C)alkyl, \u2014N(R), \u2014CON(R), \u2014SOR, \u2014SONHR, \u2014S(\u2550O)R, or a nitric oxide donor group of the formula \u2014X\u2014X\u2014X, wherein Xis absent or selected from \u2014O\u2014, \u2014S\u2014 or \u2014NH\u2014; Xis absent or is (C-C)alkylene optionally substituted by one or more \u2014ONOgroups; and Xis \u2014NO or \u2014ONO, provided that at least one Rgroup is a nitric oxide donor group;","Reach independently is selected from (C-C)alkyl, (C-C)alkenyl, or (C-C)alkynyl;","Ris selected from (C-C)alkyl, (C-C)cycloalkyl, (C-C)aryl, or 4-12-membered heterocyclyl, each of which may optionally be substituted with \u2014OH, \u2014COR, \u2014COOR, \u2014(C-C)alkylene-COOR, \u2014CN, \u2014NO, \u2014(C-C)alkyl, \u2014O\u2014(C-C)alkyl, \u2014N(R), \u2014CON(R), \u2014SOR, \u2014SONHR, or \u2014S(\u2550O)R;","Reach independently is selected from H, (C-C)alkyl, (C-C)cycloalkyl, (C-C)aryl, or 4-12-membered heterocyclyl, each of which other than H may optionally be substituted with \u2014OH, \u2014COR, \u2014COOR, \u2014OCOOR, \u2014OCON(R), \u2014(C-C)alkylene-COOR, \u2014CN, \u2014NO, \u2014SH, \u2014SR, \u2014(C-C)alkyl, \u2014O\u2014(C-C)alkyl, \u2014N(R), \u2014CON(R), \u2014SOR, \u2014SONHR, or \u2014S(\u2550O)R;","Reach independently is selected from H, (C-C)alkyl, (C-C)cycloalkyl, (C-C)aryl, or 4-12-membered heterocyclyl; and","n is an integer of 1 to 3.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the general formula I as defined above, or an enantiomer, diastereomer, racemate, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

A non-limiting example of a method for obtaining optically active materials is transport across chiral membranes, i.e., a technique whereby a racemate is placed in contact with a thin membrane barrier, the concentration or pressure differential causes preferential transport across the membrane barrier, and separation occurs as a result of the non-racemic chiral nature of the membrane that allows only one enantiomer of the racemate to pass through. Chiral chromatography, including simulated moving bed chromatography, can also be used.

The compositions can be prepared, e.g., by uniformly and intimately bringing the active agent into association with a liquid carrier, a finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. The compositions may be in liquid, solid or semisolid form and may further include pharmaceutically acceptable fillers, carriers, diluents or adjuvants, and other inert ingredients and excipients. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is formulated as nanoparticles.","The compositions can be formulated for any suitable route of administration, but they are preferably formulated for parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intrapleural, intratracheal, subcutaneous, or topical administration, as well as for inhalation. Pharmaceutical compositions formulated for intramuscular injections may be suitable, inter alia, for emergent use such as in CILI; and pharmaceutical compositions formulated for topical administration may be suitable, inter alia, for treatment of skin ulcers and wounds, elevated intraocular pressure and uveitis (by application to the cornea), and erectile dysfunction (by application to the penile), as well as for increasing genital lubrication (by vaginal application). The dosage will depend on the state of the patient, and will be determined as deemed appropriate by the practitioner.","The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension, which may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing, wetting or suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent. Acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed include, without limiting, water, Ringer's solution, polyethylene glycol (PEG), 2-hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HPCD), Tween-80, and isotonic sodium chloride solution.","Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention, when formulated for inhalation, may be administered utilizing any suitable device known in the art, such as metered dose inhalers, liquid nebulizers, dry powder inhalers, sprayers, thermal vaporizers, electrohydrodynamic aerosolizers, and the like.","Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention, when formulated for administration route other than parenteral administration, may be in a form suitable for oral use, e.g., as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous, or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs.","Pharmaceutical compositions intended for oral administration should be formulated so as to inhibit the release of the active agent in the stomach, i.e., delay the release of the active agent until at least a portion of the dosage form has traversed the stomach, in order to avoid the acidity of the gastric contents from hydrolyzing the active agent to its highly water insoluble form, i.e., its corresponding 1-pyrrolidinyloxy, 1-piperidinyloxy or 1-azepanyloxy derivative. Particular such compositions are those wherein the active agent is coated by a pH-dependent enteric-coating polymer. Examples of pH-dependent enteric-coating polymer include, without being limited to, Eudragit\u00ae S (poly(methacrylicacid, methylmethacrylate), 1:2), Eudragit\u00ae L 55 (poly (methacrylicacid, ethylacrylate), 1:1), Kollicoat\u00ae (poly(methacrylicacid, ethylacrylate), 1:1), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP), alginates, carboxymethylcellulose, and combinations thereof. The pH-dependent enteric-coating polymer may be present in the composition in an amount from about 10% to about 95% by weight of the entire composition.","Pharmaceutical compositions intended for oral administration may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and may further comprise one or more agents selected from sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be, e.g., inert diluents such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate, or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, e.g., corn starch or alginic acid; binding agents, e.g., starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, e.g., magnesium stearate, stearic acid, or talc. The tablets may be either uncoated or coated utilizing known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated using the techniques described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108, 4,166,452 and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsion.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be formulated for controlled release of the active agent. Such compositions may be formulated as controlled-release matrix, e.g., as controlled-release matrix tablets in which the release of a soluble active agent is controlled by having the active diffuse through a gel formed after the swelling of a hydrophilic polymer brought into contact with dissolving liquid (in vitro) or gastro-intestinal fluid (in vivo). Many polymers have been described as capable of forming such gel, e.g., derivatives of cellulose, in particular the cellulose ethers such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, methylcellulose or methyl hydroxypropyl cellulose, and among the different commercial grades of these ethers are those showing fairly high viscosity. In other configurations, the compositions comprise the active agent formulated for controlled release in microencapsulated dosage form, in which small droplets of the active agent are surrounded by a coating or a membrane to form particles in the range of a few micrometers to a few millimeters.","Another contemplated formulation is depot systems, based on biodegradable polymers, wherein as the polymer degrades, the active ingredient is slowly released. The most common class of biodegradable polymers is the hydrolytically labile polyesters prepared from lactic acid, glycolic acid, or combinations of these two molecules. Polymers prepared from these individual monomers include poly (D,L-lactide) (PLA), poly (glycolide) (PGA), and the copolymer poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG).","In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a compound of the general formula I as defined above, or an enantiomer, diastereomer, racemate, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, for use in prevention, treatment or management of a disease, disorder or condition associated with oxidative stress or endothelial dysfunction.","In yet another aspect, the present invention relates to use of a compound of the general formula I as defined above, or an enantiomer, diastereomer, racemate, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for prevention, treatment or management of a disease, disorder or condition associated with oxidative stress or endothelial dysfunction.","In still another aspect, the present invention relates to a method for prevention, treatment or management of a disease, disorder or condition associated with oxidative stress or endothelial dysfunction in an individual in need thereof, comprising administering to said individual an effective amount of a compound of the general formula I as defined above, or an enantiomer, diastereomer, racemate, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof.","In one particular embodiment, the method of the present invention is for treatment of CILI.","The invention will now be illustrated by the following non-limiting Examples.","A suspension of 3-carboxyproxyl (77.5 g, 0.416 mol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (THF, 500 ml) was cooled to 0\u00b0 C.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats are placed onto a thermostatically-controlled heating mat, and body temperature is maintained at 38\u00b11\u00b0 C. by means of a rectal probe attached to a homeothermic blanket. A tracheotomy is performed to maintain airway patency and to facilitate spontaneous respiration. A midline laparotomy is performed, and the bladder is cannulated. Both kidneys are located, and the renal pedicles, containing the artery, vein, and nerve supplying each kidney, are carefully isolated.","Rats (Groups 2 and 3) are allowed to stabilize for 30 minutes before they are subjected to bilateral renal occlusion for 30 minutes using artery clips to clamp the renal pedicles. Reperfusion commenced once the artery clips are removed (control animals). Occlusion is verified visually by change in the color of the kidneys to a paler shade and reperfusion by a blush. The other rats (Group 1), which underwent identical surgical procedures similar to control animals but did not undergo bilateral renal clamping, are subjected to sham operation (sham operated) and are maintained under anesthesia for the duration of the experiment.

Urine is collected from the rats during the following periods: (i) 2 hours prior to ischemia until 30 minutes prior to ischemia; (ii) from the onset of reperfusion until 1.5 hours after the onset of reperfusion; (iii) from 1.5 hours after the onset of reperfusion until 3.0 hours after the onset of reperfusion; (iv) from 3 hours after the onset of reperfusion until 4.5 hours after the onset of reperfusion; and (v) from 4.5 hours after the onset of reperfusion until 6.0 hours after the onset of reperfusion. Arterial blood samples are obtained at 0, 1.5 hours, 3.0 hours, 4.5 hours, and 6.0 hours after the onset of reperfusion. R-107 (80 mg\/kg; Group 3) is administered as a 10 minute IV infusion beginning 20 minutes after the onset of ischemia.","At the end of the reperfusion period, blood (1 ml) samples are collected via the carotid artery into S1\/3 tubes containing serum gel, and the samples are centrifuged (6000 rpm for 3 minutes) to separate plasma. All plasma samples are analyzed for biochemical parameters within 24 hours after collection. Urine samples are collected during the reperfusion period, and the volume of urine produced is recorded. Urine concentrations of Na are measured and are used in conjunction with plasma Na concentrations to calculate fractional excretion of sodium (FE) using standard formulae, which is used as an indicator of tubular function. Plasma and urine concentrations of creatinine are measured as indicators of impaired glomerular function. Creatinine clearance is calculated using the formula UV\/P, where U refers to creatinine concentration in urine, V refers to urine volume\/min and P refers to serum creatinine. Plasma concentrations of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) are evaluated as indicated by the commercial kit. Urine concentration of NGAL is evaluated as indicated by the commercial kit.","Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in kidneys is used as an indicator of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell infiltration using a method previously described. Briefly, at the end of the experiments, kidney tissue is weighed and homogenized in a solution containing 0.5% (wt\/vol) hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide dissolved in 10 mmol\/l potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 20,000 g at 4\u00b0 C. An aliquot of supernatant is then removed and added to a reaction mixture containing 1.6 mmol\/l tetramethylbenzidine and 0.1 mmol\/l hydrogen peroxide (HO). The rate of change in absorbance is measured spectrophotometrically at 650 nm. MPO activity is defined as the quantity of enzyme required to degrade 1 mmol of HOat 37\u00b0 C. and is expressed in U\/g wet tissue.","Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in kidneys are determined as an indicator of lipid peroxidation following a protocol described previously. Briefly, kidney tissue is weighed and homogenized in a 1.15% (wt\/vol) KCl solution. A 100 ml aliquot of homogenate is then removed and added to a reaction mixture containing 200 ml 8.1% (wt\/vol) lauryl sulfate, 1.5 ml 20% (vol\/vol) acetic acid (pH 3.5), 1.5 ml 0.8% (wt\/vol) thiobarbituric acid, and 700 ml distilled water. Samples are then boiled for one hour at 95\u00b0 C. and centrifuged at 3000\u00d7g for 10 minutes. The absorbance of the supernatant is measured spectrophotometrically at 650 nm. MDA levels are expressed as \u03bcM\/100 mg wet tissue.","At post-mortem, a 5 am section of kidney is removed and placed in formalin and processed through to wax. Five millimeter sections are cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histologic assessment of tubular necrosis is determined semiquantitatively using a method modified from McWhinnie et al., 1987, 29(4), 214-223. Random cortical fields are observed using a \u00d720 objective. A graticule grid (25 squares) is used to determine the number of line intersects involving tubular profiles. One hundred intersections are examined for each kidney, and a score from 0 to 3 is given for each tubular profile involving an intersection: 0=normal histology; 1=tubular cell swelling, brush border loss, nuclear condensation, with up to one third of tubular profile showing nuclear loss; 2=same as for score 1, but greater than one third and less than two thirds of tubular profile shows nuclear loss; 3=greater than two thirds of tubular profile shows nuclear loss. The total score for each kidney is calculated by addition of all 100 scores.","Similar studies may be conducted with compounds of the general formula I other than R-107.","In this study, the efficacy of R-107 in subacute murine model of retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury is tested, using male C57BL\/6 mice (n=10 per group). Briefly, the anterior chamber of the right eye is cannulated with a 30 gauge needle attached to a line infusing sterile saline. The intraocular pressure (IOP) is raised to 110 mmHg by elevating the saline reservoir. The left eye undergoes sham surgery, in which the needle is inserted into the anterior chamber without elevating IOP. R-107 is injected (30 mg\/kg\/day IP BID) commencing directly before reperfusion. 2 vehicle controls (normal saline and HPCD) is compared to drug therapy. Treatments are repeated twice daily thereafter until sacrifice. The outcome of these pharmacologic studies is quantitatively assessed by using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) to measure retinal cell death (after 3 days), confocal imaging to quantify survival of ganglion cell layer neurons (after 7 days), and electroretinogram recordings to measure retinal neuronal function (after 21 days).","Similar studies may be conducted with compounds of the general formula I other than R-107.","In this study, a porcine model of acute retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury (n=6 per group) is induced by equilibration with an elevated saline reservoir to create a static IOP of 90 mmHg for 90 min. Task #1: Microvascular responsiveness: A dose-response of parenteral R-107 (0, 10, 30, 80 mg\/kg\/day IV BID) is initiated 10 minutes before reperfusion. 1 hour after reperfusion, retinal microvessels are harvested and cannulated for ex vivo analysis of vascular responsiveness to endothelium dependent and independent vasodilators. Task #2: Retinal function and morphology: R-107 is given 10 minutes before reperfusion (at a dose determined by Task #1) and its efficacy judged by electroretinogram (1, 2, 7 days post-reperfusion) and retinal histology, ultrastructure, and drug concentration (Day 7).","Similar studies may be conducted with compounds of the general formula I other than R-107.","In order to test the efficacy of R-107 in a myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury, male aged Sprague-Dawley rats are dosed with R-107 (0, 10, 30, 80 mg\/kg IV) 10 minutes prior to the end of a 30 minutes period of ischemia produced by occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Cardiac function is monitored by a Millar catheter for the determination of heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), left ventricular (LV) systolic BP, LV end-diastolic BP (LVEDP), \u00b1dP\/dt, pressure-volume (PV) loop, and tau (\u03c4). 3 hours post-ischemia, blood and myocardium are analyzed for morphologic, histochemical, and bioanalytical injury. The area of necrosis, as a % of area at risk (AAR), and the extent of the no-reflow zone are quantified.","Similar studies may be conducted with compounds of the general formula I other than R-107.","In this study, the efficacy of R-107 in a limb ischemia reperfusion injury (LIRI) is tested. In a large animal model of acute LIRI (n=6 minipigs per group) induced by an endovascular balloon occlusion of the femoral artery for 6 hours, parenteral R-107 (0, 10, 30, 80 mg\/kg\/day TID) is initiated 10 minutes before reperfusion via direct arterial infusion, followed by an IV infusion thereafter. At 7, 14, and 21 days after reperfusion, limb perfusion (by Doppler flow) is correlated with nerve conduction velocity (NCV, per electromyography, EMG), and muscle strength (by foot pressure on a walking surface) with simultaneous plasma concentrations of R-107.","Similar studies may be conducted with compounds of the general formula I other than R-107.","In order to test the efficacy of R-107 in contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), a single-blinded study of CIN is carried out in Sprague-Dawley rats (n=10 per group) subjected to dehydration, prostaglandin synthetase inhibition, and an IV challenge of contrast media (CM). A sham injury group is compared to treatment of CM-challenged healthy rats with R-107 (10, 20, 40 mg\/kg\/day in 5% dextrose, BID IV), N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 100 mg\/kg\/day in 5% dextrose, BID), or vehicle control (hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin, HPCD) initiated 10 min before CM administration and continued for 48 hours. Rats are evaluated at 48 hours for renal function (blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio, BUN:creatinine) and parameters reflecting renal injury, including protein release into the blood (NGAL; kidney injury molecule-1, KIM-1), pro-inflammatory transcription factor expression (cytoplasmic IkBa degradation, nuclear p65 translocation), histologic damage (H&E), mitochondrial swelling (electron microscopy), and nuclear damage and DNA repair (PARP activation and nitrosative stress as noted by poly(ADP-ribose) and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) tissue immunoreactivity).","In order to better model the patient population at greatest risk of CIN, the optimal dose of R-107 is then further evaluated, using the same experimental approach and design as before, but in Sprague-Dawley rats previously rendered diabetic 2 weeks earlier by injection of streptozotocin (STZ; 60 mg\/kg IV). A control group of rats with STZ-induced diabetes receive vehicle control. If efficacy of R-107 in the diabetic group is less than in healthy rats, additional groups are evaluated at higher doses of R-107 in order to establish the optimal response in this clinically-relevant model of diabetes and CIN. Finally, we investigate whether further benefit may be obtained in the diabetic setting by combining the administration of R-107 with aggressive volume resuscitation, based on the apparent current clinical consensus that increased hydration ameliorates CIN. Diabetic rats in the elevated hydration group receive 10 ml\/kg IV normal saline (NS) boluses coincident with the administration of R-107. A control group receives IV NS alone.","Similar studies may be conducted with compounds of the general formula I other than R-107.","In this study, the effect of R-107 in treatment of CILI is tested. Balb\/c mice are exposed in a cylindrical glass chamber that is flushed continuously for 60 minutes at a rate of 2 liters\/minute with humidified gas obtained from a calibrated cylinder containing air and 400 ppm Cl. After the end of the 30 minute exposure, the chamber is opened and mice are removed and immediately placed in cages in room air. Two and six hours after the conclusion of Clexposure, mice are administered intraperitoneal (IP) with various doses of R-107. At 24 hours post-exposure to the Cl-containing air, a midline incision from the neck to the pubis is created for access to the chest and abdominal cavities. Blood samples are obtained from the inferior vena cava just before sacrifice, the heart-lung block is rapidly excised, and the pulmonary circulation is flushed through the main pulmonary artery with 20 ml of normal saline. The lungs are separated from the mediastinal tissues and are taken for biochemical assays and histological examination (H&E staining). The following morphological criteria are used for scoring: grade 0, normal lung; grade 1, minimal edema or infiltration of alveolar or bronchiolar walls; grade 3, moderate edema and inflammatory cell infiltration without obvious damage to lung architecture; and grade 4, severe inflammatory cell infiltration with obvious damage to lung architecture. Similar studies may be conducted with compounds of the general formula I other than R-107.","In a particular study, the effect of R-107 in treatment of CILI was tested according to the protocol above. Male Balc\/c mice were divided to the following 5 groups: (i) Sham (n=5); (ii) vehicle, HPCD (n=5); (iii) vehicle, PEG-400 (n=5); (iv) R-100 formulated in HPCD, 80 mg\/kg\/dose, total 160 mg\/kg\/day, IP (n=10); and (v) R-107 formulated in PEG-400, 100 mg\/kg\/dose, total 200 mg\/kg\/day, IP (n=10).  show representative photomicrographs demonstrating H&E-stained lung sections taken from Sham-operated mice (A, B), animals treated with Cl+HPCD (C), animals treated with Cl+saline (D), animals treated with Cl+R-100 (E), and animals treated with Cl+R-107 (F).  shows that R-107 as well as its corresponding 1-pyrrolidinyloxy, R-100, when administered 2 and 6 hours post a 60 minute exposure to Clcontaining air, significantly attenuated CILI in mice 24 hours post exposure as exemplified by the improved histology scores.","In another study conducted according to the protocol described above, male Balc\/c mice were divided to the following 5 groups: (i) Sham (n=2); (ii) vehicle, olive oil (n=4); (iii) R-107 formulated in olive oil, 10 mg\/kg\/dose, total 20 mg\/kg\/day, IP (n=4); (iv) R-107 formulated in oil, 30 mg\/kg\/dose, total 60 mg\/kg\/day, IP (n=4); and (v) R-107 formulated in oil, 80 mg\/kg\/dose, total 160 mg\/kg\/day, IP (n=4). Drug was administered 2 and 6 hours post a 60 minute exposure to Cl(400 ppm) containing air, and at 24 hours, the mice were sacrificed and lung histology examined. Table 11 shows that R-107 dose-responsively attenuated CILI in mice 24 hours post exposure as exemplified by the improved histology scores.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0161","num":"0159"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00011","num":"00011"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 11"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"R-107 dose-responsively attenuates CILI in mice 24 hours post exposure"},{"entry":"as exemplified by the improved histology scores"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"Histology score"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Nmice","80 mg\/kg","30 mg\/kg","10 mg\/kg","vehicle","Sham"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","2.2","2.8","3.0","3.8","0"]},{"entry":["2","1.5","2.2","3.0","4.8","0"]},{"entry":["3","2.0","2.4","3.5","3.4"]},{"entry":["4","1.8","3.2","3.2","4.7"]},{"entry":["Mean","1.88","2.64","3.18","4.17","0.00"]},{"entry":["SD","0.2986","0.4488","0.2375","0.6611","0"]},{"entry":["SE","0.1493","0.2244","0.1187","0.3306","0"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"In order to test the efficacy of R-107 in erectile dysfunction (ED), a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, single-blinded study of ED is carried out in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats (n=10 per group). A sham injury group is compared to treatment with R-107 (80 mg\/kg\/day BID IV) initiated 10 minutes before crush injury of the cavernosal nerves of the penis and continued for 1 week. After 1 week, rats undergo in vivo neurogenic-mediated evaluation of the erectile response. At the completion of the physiologic evaluation, rats are euthanized and tissues removed for biochemical, morphologic, and inflammatory analyses. The crush injury is produced as follows: After IP injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg\/kg) for anesthesia, the abdomen is shaved and prepared with an iodine-based solution and a lower midline abdominal incision is made. The prostate gland is exposed and cavernosal nerves tracking posterolateral are identified and isolated. In a sham group there is no further surgical manipulation. In the remaining groups crush injury is created using a hemostat clamp for 3 minutes. The abdomen is then closed in 2 layers in all rats. 1 week after surgical intervention, all rats undergo an in vivo neurogenic-mediated erectile response study. Rats are anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg\/kg IP) and placed on a thermally regulated surgical table. The trachea is cannulated using PE-240 polyethylene tubing to maintain a patent airway and the animals breath room air enriched with 95% O\/5% CO. A carotid artery is cannulated with PE-50 tubing to continuously measure systemic blood pressure (MAP) using a Statham transducer attached to a data acquisition system and connected to a computer. A 25 gauge needle filled with heparin (250 U\/ml) and connected to PE-50 tubing is inserted into the right crura and connected to a pressure transducer to permit continuous measurement of intracavernous pressure (ICP). The cavernosal nerve (CN) is identified posterolateral to the prostate on 1 side and an electrical stimulator with a stainless steel bipolar hook is placed around the CN. The CN is stimulated with a square pulse stimulator (Grass Instruments, Quincy, Mass.). CN stimulation (CNS) at a frequency of 15 Hz and pulse width of 30 sec is performed in each rat. CNS at 2.5, 5, and 7.5 V is used in the current protocol to achieve significant consistent erectile responses. The duration of stimulation is 1 minute with a rest period of 3-5 minutes between subsequent CNSs. The total erectile response or total ICP is determined by the area under the curve in mm Hg per second from the beginning of CNS until ICP returned to baseline or prestimulation pressure. The ICP\/MAP ratio at the peak erectile response is determined to control for variations in MAP.","Similar studies may be conducted with compounds of the general formula I other than R-107."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A-1F","b":["1","1","1","1","1","1"],"sub":["2","2","2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2","sub":"2 "}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
