title: Operator for sculpting solids with sheet bodies
abstract: A computer-implemented solid modeling system provides a graph-based method that sculpts solids with sheet bodies by performing a selective Boolean operation on a part body and one or more sheet bodies, wherein faces of the sheet bodies separate the part body into regions of space such that the regions are separated from each other by the faces of the sheet bodies. Cells thus formed are selected for inclusion or exclusion in the resulting solid as is specified by an option (“join” or “cut”).

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to computer-assisted design (CAD) systems, and in particular, to a graph-based method for sculpting solids using sheet bodies in a computer-implemented solid modeling system.","2. Description of the Related Art","Over the last decade, designers have changed their fundamental approach to graphics design, moving from two-dimensional (2D) drawing systems to three-dimensional (3D) solid modeling systems. New software makes solid modeling technology available and affordable to virtually anyone.","Solid modeling is a technique that allows designers to create dimensionally accurate 3D solid models in a 3D space represented within a computer, rather than traditional 2D drawings. 3D solid models include significantly more engineering data than 2D drawings, including the volume, bounding surfaces, and edges of a design.","With the graphics capabilities of today's computers, these 3D solid models may be viewed and manipulated on a monitor. In addition to providing better visualization, 3D solid models may be used to automatically produce 2D drawing views, and can be shared with manufacturing applications and the like.","Some 3D solid modeling systems generate parametric feature-based models. A parametric feature-based model is comprised of intelligent features, such as holes, fillets, chamfers, etc. The geometry of the parametric feature-based model is defined by underlying mathematical relationships (i.e., parameters) rather than by simple unrelated dimensions, which makes them easier to modify. These systems preserve design intent and manage it after every change to the model.","An operation often performed by solid modeling systems is the modification of solid bodies using sheet data, such as that recited in of co-pending and commonly-assigned U.S. Utility application Ser. No. 09\/887,651, filed on Jun. 21, 2001, by Kenneth J. Hill, entitled \u201cGRAPH-BASED METHOD FOR MULTI-BODIED SWEEP TERMINATIONS,\u201d now U.S. Pat. No. 6,906,711 issued Jun. 14, 2005, which application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) of co-pending and commonly-assigned U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/269,831, filed on Feb. 20, 2001, by Kenneth J. Hill, entitled \u201cGRAPH-BASED METHOD FOR MULTI-BODIED SWEEP TERMINATIONS,\u201d both of which applications are incorporated by reference herein.","However, there is a need for one or more operations to sculpt solids in solid modeling systems. Moreover, the sculpting of solids is a non-trivial operation. This is especially true when multiple bodies are involved in the sculpting operation.","To address the requirements described above, the present invention discloses a computer-implemented solid modeling system that sculpts solids with sheet bodies by performing a selective Boolean operation on a part body and one or more sheet bodies, wherein faces of the sheet bodies separate the part body into regions of space such that the regions are separated from each other by the faces of the sheet bodies. Cells from the selective Boolean operation are chosen for inclusion or exclusion from the output solid according to a \u201cjoin\u201d or \u201ccut\u201d option.","In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and which is shown, by way of illustration, an embodiment of the present invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Overview","The present invention is a parametric, feature-based solid modeling system that provides an operator for sculpting solids using sheet bodies.","Hardware and Software Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","100"]},"The computer  usually operates under the control of an operating system , which is represented by a window displayed on the monitor . The preferred embodiment of the present invention is implemented by a computer-implemented graphics program , which is also represented by a window displayed on the monitor , that operates under the control of the operating system . The graphics program  preferably comprises a parametric feature-based solid modeling system, although other graphics programs  could be used as well.","Generally, the operating system  and graphics program  comprise logic and\/or data embodied in or readable from a device, media, or carrier, e.g., one or more fixed and\/or removable data storage devices  connected directly or indirectly to the computer , one or more remote devices coupled to the computer  via data communications devices, etc.","Those skilled in the art will recognize that the exemplary environment illustrated in  is not intended to limit the present invention. Indeed, those skilled in the art will recognize that other alternative environments may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Computer-Implemented Graphics Program",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["108","108","200","202","204","206","208","210"]},"The Graphical User Interface  displays information to the user and provides the functionality for the user's interaction with the graphics program .","The Image Engine  processes the Database  or files  and delivers the resulting graphics to an output device. In the preferred embodiment, the Image Engine  provides a complete application programming interface (API) that allows other computer programs to interface to the graphics program  as needed.","The Geometric Modeler  primarily creates geometry and topology for models. The Feature-Based Modeler , which interacts with the Geometric Modeler , is a parametric feature-based solid modeler that integrates 2D and 3D mechanical design tools, including parametric assembly modeling, surface modeling, 2D design, and associative drafting. The Feature-Based Modeler  provides powerful solid-, surface-, and assembly-modeling functionality.","The Database  is comprised of two separate types of databases: (1) a 3D database  known as the \u201cworld space\u201d that stores 3D information; and (2) one or more 2D databases  known as the \u201cvirtual spaces\u201d or \u201cview ports\u201d that stores 2D information derived from the 3D information. The 3D database  captures the design intent and behavior of a component in a model.","Object Structure",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","212","300","302","304","306","300","212","304","300","212"]},"Operation of the Preferred Embodiment","Boundary Representations (B-Reps)","A solid is represented in the Feature-Based Modeler  by means of a boundary representation (b-rep) model. The boundary representation comprises a hierarchy of topological objects that define the boundaries of successively simpler elements of the model.","Each solid is comprised of disconnected parts called \u201clumps.\u201d Most solids have only one lump, although most boundary representation models allow solids to have multiple lumps.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIGS. 4 and 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"]},"Each lump contains one or more \u201cshells.\u201d These shells are comprised of a collection of faces that separates the inside portion of the lump from the outside. A lump can have several shells. There is typically an exterior shell which bounds the infinite void from the material, but there may also be interior shells which separate the material from pockets of empty space.","Each shell contains a set of one or more \u201cfaces.\u201d These faces are the infinitely thin boundaries between what is inside the solid and what is outside. A spherical lump might have only one face (on the one shell), or its surface might be chopped up into a patchwork of faces. A cube typically has six faces, but could have more if some of the sides are split. Each face is required to be smooth in the sense that there are no sharp ridges in the interior of the face. Underlying each face is a surface that represents the geometry associated with the face. The surface gives the face structure.","In some b-rep models, there is a topological entity called a \u201chalf-face\u201d that determines what side of the face is considered outside of the lump. Other b-rep models describe half-faces as special faces. When half-faces are present, the shells are comprised of half-faces, and the half-faces are associated to a face.","Each face is bounded by zero or more loops. A loop is to a face what a shell is to a lump. A spherical face might have no loops. The side of a block typically has one loop. A side of a cube with a round hole in it has two loops: one for the square outer boundary of the face, one for the round hole.","Each loop is comprised of multiple \u201chalf-edges\u201d (often called \u201cco-edges\u201d or \u201cfins\u201d). These half-edges represent the usage of an edge (the next lower topological item) by a face. The half-edge answers the question \u201cdoes the loop traverse an edge in the same parametric direction of the edge, or in the reverse direction?\u201d","Associated with each half-edge is an \u201cedge.\u201d An edge can be thought of as being an infinitely thin wire. Each edge has a direction of traversal based on the underlying mathematical equation of the curve associated with the edge.","Edges are bounded by zero, one, or two \u201cvertices.\u201d Vertices connect a physical point as a termination to an edge.","The topology chart of  shows the hierarchy of topological entities used to represent a solid and their associated geometry entities: solid, lump, shell, half-face, face\/surface, loop, half-edge, edge\/curve, and vertex\/point.","Attributes","The Feature-Based Modeler 206 has the ability to attach data to topological entities. Each such datum is usually called an \u201cattribute.\u201d Attributes typically have programmable behaviors so that they can respond appropriately to common operations such as splitting, merging, copying, or transforming the entity to which they are attached.","For example, to track how a certain face is split during a Boolean operation, an attribute can be placed on that face with the following behaviors:\n\n","After the Boolean operation is completed, all faces are examined to see which ones contain the attribute.","Suppose that the system needs to track two faces, one of type A and one of type B. An attribute could be created for each type to track, but a more compact way of doing it is to create an attribute (perhaps called AttribFaceTrack) with two Boolean data members (data items containing true or false values). These data members can be distinct bits of a single machine word, for example, wherein the first bit indicates whether the face is of type A, and the second bit indicates whether the face is of type B. The merge behavior could then be changed so that if each of the merging faces has an attribute of type AttribFaceTrack but with different faces indicated, the attribute on the resultant face has both faces indicated. After the Boolean operation, some faces will have no attribute of type AttribFaceTrack, some will have type A indicated, some will have type B indicated, and others will possibly have type A and B indicated.","This multi-face tracking behavior will be used in a slightly more complex form to perform the sculpting operator of the present invention.","Cellular Topology","When speaking of the physical world, one expects that two bodies will not occupy the same space at the same time. In the symbolic world, there is no such restriction. When solids intersect, space is divided into the following types of disjoint regions: regions that are outside of both bodies (called \u201cthe void\u201d); regions that are inside the first body, but outside the second; regions that are inside the second body, but outside the first; and regions that are inside both bodies. The disjoint regions, interior to at least one of the solids, are called \u201ccells.\u201d There may be more than one cell of the same type.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0090"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["0","1","2"]},"Two cells are called \u201cadjacent\u201d if they share at least one common face. In the two dimensional analogs that will be frequently used herein for illustration purposes (e.g. ), cells will be adjacent when separated by a common edge.","From the cells of intersecting bodies and the notion of adjacency, one may use graph theory to generate a useful abstraction of the connectivity of the cells. Let each cell (other than the void cells) be represented as a vertex on the graph (not to be confused with the b-rep vertices) and let two vertices be connected by an edge (again, not a b-rep edge) if and only if the cells associated with those vertices are adjacent. The resulting graph is called a \u201ccellular topology graph\u201d or simply a \u201cct-graph.\u201d For example,  is a ct-graph for .","One can augment the ct-graphs by labeling the vertices by their kind: 1 if the associated cell is in the first body, 2 if in the second body, and 1,2 if the associated cell is in both bodies.","Selective Boolean Operations on Two Solid Bodies","A \u201cBoolean operation\u201d between two bodies creates a new solid from portions of each body, wherein the body being modified is called the \u201cblank body,\u201d and the body doing the modification is called the \u201ctool body.\u201d After a \u201cjoin\u201d Boolean operation, the blank body is modified to contain all the material from both the original blank body and the tool body. After a \u201csubtract\u201d Boolean operation, the entire material interior to the tool body is removed from the blank body. An \u201cintersect\u201d Boolean operation replaces the blank body with only that material which is in both the tool body and the original blank body.","Each of the Boolean operations types presented above can be represented in terms of cellular topology. The system creates the ct-graph for the intersecting bodies, and then decides which vertices of the ct-graph to keep. If a particular vertex present in the resulting ct-graph is kept, then its associated cell is present in the resulting solid. In this application, the convention is that the tool body is associated with the \u201c1\u201d vertices and the blank body is associated with the \u201c2\u201d vertices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0097"},"figref":["FIGS. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 11","FIG. 12","FIG. 13"],"b":["11","12","13"]},"There may be times when operations other than the three above are needed. When this is occurs, an algorithm may choose to do a \u201cselective Boolean\u201d in which the algorithm explicitly selects which vertices (and therefore which cells) are kept. For example, perhaps it is desired to keep all the cells except the right \u201c1\u201d vertex. Removing one vertex from the ct-graph can do this, as shown in , which illustrates a selective Boolean removing only one cell.","Selective Boolean Operations on Two Sheet Bodies","A selective Boolean on two sheet bodies produces a ct-graph, wherein the vertices represent cells and the edges represent the connectivity between the cells. The cells are not bounded regions of space as in the solid selective Boolean, but rather bounded subsets of the original sheets.","As in the description of selective Boolean operations on two solid bodies, selective Booleans on sheets can be described using planar analogs. Curves on the plane represent cells and hence are vertices in the ct-graph, while the junctions between these curves are the connective entities and therefore represent the edges of the ct-graph.","For example,  shows the cellular topology of two intersecting (edge aligned) sheets.  shows a 2D analog of  and  is a ct-graph for the configuration of . Note that each face in  connects to every other face (through the edge of intersection), and thus the ct-graph of  is fully connected.","Selective Boolean Operations on One Solid and One Sheet Body","When a selective Boolean operation is performed on a solid body and a sheet body, the faces of the sheet body may separate the solid into regions of space such that the regions are separated from each other by faces from the sheet body.","This can be discussed using a 2D analog. Solid bodies are represented in 2D as regions and sheet bodies as curves.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0106"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0107"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0108"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 18"]},"Input","In the preferred embodiment, the input to the operation includes the following:","1. A solid body on which to operate, called a \u201cpart body.\u201d If no part body is provided, some operations may still be allowed.","2. An option: join or cut. Join specifies that material will be added to the part body, and cut specifies that material will be taken away from the part body.","3. A set of sheet bodies, known as \u201climiting sheets.\u201d Associated with each sheet body is a face side label that indicates which side of the sheet should be used. Possible values are \u201cnormal,\u201d \u201canti-normal,\u201d or \u201cboth.\u201d","4. Other data which can be used to modify the solution. For example, alternate embodiments of this invention could allow users to select faces that indicate where material is to be added or deleted.","Output","A new solid is created that replaces the input solid (if any).","In the case of a join, the output of the operation is to add any regions of space that are bound by the part body and the limiting sheets, and that use the correct side of the sheets according to their face side labels, or that satisfy some other selection criteria.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0118"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0116","num":"0119"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},"For a cut, any regions of the part body that are bound by the faces of the part body and the limiting sheets, and which are on the side of the sheets specified by the face side label, are removed. Since there is ambiguity as to which portion of the part body is to be cut, the face side labels must not be BOTH.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0121"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIG. 24"]},"Logic of the Preferred Embodiment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0123"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},"Block  represents the step of performing a pre-processing phase to create a cellular topology graph of a tool body and a blank body created from the part body and\/or sheet bodies.","Block  represents the step of performing an analysis phase to categorize and convert cells in the cellular topology graph.","Block  represents the step of performing a post-processing phase to integrate results from the analysis phase to create an output part body.","These steps are described in more detail below in conjunction with .","Preprocessing",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0129"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},"Block  represents the step of labeling faces in the part body and sheet bodies. All faces in the part body are marked with an attribute that identifies them as being part of the part body, and all faces on the limiting sheets are marked with an attribute that identifies them as being part of the limiting sheets. The behavior of these attributes are set so that as faces are split and merged back together, the algorithm will be able to identify where they originally came from.","Block  represents the step of creating a blank body from the part body and sheet bodies. The first step is turning the input part body (if any) into a 2D manifold, i.e., a hollowed-out part body, leaving only the shell. The faces are still there and they still have their \u201coriginal part body\u201d attribute, but they now form a sheet body, not a solid body. Each face in this sheet body is considered to be double-sided, whereas before they were single-sided. The blank body is created by uniting all the limiting sheets together with the hollowed-out part body. The result of this union is (in general) a non-manifold sheet body\u2014non-manifold because there will be edges that are adjacent to more than two faces, as when the limiting sheets penetrate the faces from the original part body or other sheets.","Block  represents the step of creating an ambient solid tool body (known as the \u201cuniverse\u201d) that is large enough to contain the blank body in its entirety. The tool body for this operation is a simple solid. An easy way to do this is to create a tool body slightly larger than the bounding box of the blank body. This large tool body is also called \u201cthe universe body\u201d and the faces on this tool body, being further out than any other relevant geometry, are called collectively \u201cthe edge of the universe.\u201d The faces comprising the edge of the universe are labeled with an identifying attribute so they can be recognized at other stages of the algorithm.","Block  represents the step of applying a selective Boolean operation to the tool body and blank body to generate a collection of solid cells, which are sub-solids of the universe body. To be precise, the union of all these cells is identical to the universe body. Furthermore, the intersection of any two cells will contain no volume; that is, they are disjoint except perhaps that they may share faces at their boundary.","Block  represents the step of generating a ct-graph that contains a vertex for each cell in the collection of solid cells, and graph edges between pairs of vertices whenever their associated cells in the collection of solid cells are adjacent.","Analysis","Block  represents the step of creating the meta-graph from the ct-graph and the part body.","Some of the cells in the collection of solid cells contain volume that was interior to the original part body, and the remaining cells in the collection of solid cells contain volume that was not, i.e., that was exterior to the original part body. The meta-graph provides a tool to identify the type (interior or exterior) of each cell in the collection.","A new graph is created, wherein the new graph is called G\/P. G refers the ct-graph created in the preprocessing step above, and P refers the original part body. The new graph contains all the vertices of G. The edges of G represent adjacency of cells. Adjacent cells are separated by faces. All edges of G are put in G\/P, except those that represent adjacency through faces from the original part body. These faces are readily identifiable because they are labeled with identifying attributes that tracked the faces as they were split during creation of the blank body.","Because the faces of the part body must separate space (one cannot pass from the inside of the part body to the outside without passing though a face of the part body), the graph G\/P contains at least two components. (In graph theory, a component is a maximal connected subset of a graph.) By construction, G is a single component, but G\/P is G split apart.","Using this technique, each component of G\/P is a set of vertices whose associated cells are either all interior or all exterior to the original part body.","The meta-graph is constructed from G\/P as follows: A vertex is created in the meta-graph for every component of G\/P. An edge is created in the meta-graph between two vertices whenever the associated components are adjacent in G. In other words, if there is at least one cell from each component that were adjacent in G via one of the edges removed in the creation of G\/P.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0139","num":"0142"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0140","num":"0143"},"figref":"FIG. 28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0141","num":"0144"},"figref":["FIG. 29","FIG. 28"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0142","num":"0145"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0143","num":"0146"},"figref":"FIG. 31","b":["2","3","2","3","2","4"]},"Block  represents the step of categorizing the meta-graph's cells as either I-cells (\u201cinside\u201d or interior cells) or O-cells (\u201coutside\u201d or exterior cells).","By construction, there is exactly one vertex in the meta-graph that contains a cell with faces from the edge of the universe. To be more precise, at the cost of being less clear, there is exactly one vertex of the meta-graph that is associated to a component of G\/P that contains a cell with faces from the edge of the universe. The distinction being that the meta-graph does not actually contain cells (it contains vertices), but the distinction can be blurred since every cell is associated with exactly one vertex in the meta-graph.","This unique vertex with faces from the edge of the universe is called the \u201cuniverse vertex.\u201d An integer is assigned to each vertex of the meta-graph according to the minimum number of edges that must be traversed to get to this vertex from the universe vertex. This integer is called the \u201cdistance\u201d between the vertex in question and the universe vertex. The universe vertex itself is distance  from itself, components adjacent to the universe vertex have are distance , etc.","The distance operator indicates how whether the cells are \u201cinside\u201d or \u201cinterior to\u201d the original part body or whether the cells are \u201coutside\u201d or \u201cexterior to\u201d the original part body. If a cell is in a vertex of the meta-graph that is an even numbered distance from the universe vertex, then it is exterior to the part body. If a cell is in a vertex of the meta-graph that is an odd numbered distance from the universe vertex, then it is interior to the part body.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0148","num":"0151"},"figref":["FIG. 32","FIG. 31","FIG. 28"],"b":["1","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0149","num":"0152"},"figref":"FIG. 33","b":["2","6"]},"Block  represents the step of selectively converting the categorized cells from interior to exterior or exterior to interior based on the choice of option, cut or join, respectively.","At this point, much of the operation has been performed. The set of cells created by applying a selective Boolean operation on the tool body and blank body breaks up space into a collection of solid cells. These cells are sorted into groups that are either inside the part body or outside the part body. If post processing was performed immediately, the resulting solid would be exactly the input solid. Hence, this step is the one that actually effects a change to the part body.","A cell is called \u201ccritical\u201d if the faces bounding the cell are all either faces of the part body or faces of the limiting sheets used on the side determined by the face side label. The universe cell is never critical.","Alternative embodiments of the present invention could use other criteria for critical cells. For example, cells may be considered critical if they if they satisfy the previous requirements, and additionally they contain one of a specific set of faces selected by the user. Such an alternative embodiment would allow the user to better restrict where new material is added or deleted.","If a join is being performed, then all critical exterior cells are converted to interior cells. On the other hand, if a cut is being performed, then all critical interior cells are converted to exterior cells.","Note that for the join, no part body is necessary, but for the cut, a part body is required. If there is no part body in the cut, there are no interior cells for cut to operate on. For the join, however, in the absence of a part body, any set of limiting sheets that bound a region of space may be used to form new solid cells, thereby creating a part body where one did not exist before.","Consider, for example, .  illustrates four stylized sheet bodies that bound the face of a solid that is the basis for a mouse design.  shows how, after a fill command is performed, an interior formed by the sheet bodies becomes solid.  shows that the solid can then be used for further operations.","Post-Processing","Block  represents the step of combining the cells marked as interior to create an output part body.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0159","num":"0162"},"figref":"FIG. 37"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0160","num":"0163"},"figref":"FIG. 38"},"Conclusion","This concludes the description of the preferred embodiment of the invention.
