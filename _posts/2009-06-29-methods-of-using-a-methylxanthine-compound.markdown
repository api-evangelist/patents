Sepsis-associated myocardial dysfunction is often profound and can lead to refractory hypotension and cardiovascular collapse.","Altered mitochondrial function and impaired oxidative phosphorylation have been implicated in the development of sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction and dysfunction in other organs Diminished function of any of the electron transport complexes could limit aerobic ATP synthesis and lead to bioenergetic failure. Cytochrome oxidase (CcOX), the terminal oxidase of the respiratory chain, uses electrons donated by cytochrome c to reduce oxygen to water. Coupled with the reduction of oxygen, CcOX pumps hydrogen ions across the mitochondrial inner membrane to the inter-membrane space. This creates and maintains a hydrogen ion gradient between the inside of the mitochondria and the inter-membrane space. This gradient generates the proton motive force that is crucial for ATP synthesis.","Myocardial CcOX is inhibited during sepsis. This inhibition is competitive and reversible early following cecal ligation and puncture (CLP, a well-established, well-accepted animal sepsis model that closely mimics human sepsis) and progresses becoming noncompetitive and irreversible during the late phase of sepsis. The onset of the hypodynamic phase and mortality in sepsis coincide with maximal competitive CcOX inhibition.","Accordingly, a need exists for improved methods and compositions for treating CcOX mediated diseases or medical conditions.","In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for treating a cytochrome oxidase (CcOX) mediated disease or medical condition, in a subject, the method comprising the step of administering to said subject a composition comprising a methylxanthine compound, thereby treating said CcOX mediated disease or medical condition.

In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989). In another embodiment, polymeric materials are used; e.g. in microspheres in or an implant. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system is placed in proximity to the target cell, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984); and Langer R, Science 249: 1527-1533 (1990).","The compositions also include, in another embodiment, incorporation of the active material into or onto particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid, polglycolic acid, hydrogels, etc.","Also included in the present invention are particulate compositions coated with polymers (e.g. poloxamers or poloxamines) and the compound coupled to antibodies directed against tissue-specific receptors, ligands or antigens or coupled to ligands of tissue-specific receptors.","Also comprehended by the invention are compounds modified by the covalent attachment of water-soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol, copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol, carboxymethyl cellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone or polyproline. The modified compounds are known to exhibit substantially longer half-lives in blood following intravenous injection than do the corresponding unmodified compounds (Abuchowski et al., 1981; Newmark et al., 1982; and Katre et al., 1987). Such modifications may also increase the compounds solubility in aqueous solution, eliminate aggregation, enhance the physical and chemical stability of the compound, and greatly reduce the immunogenicity and reactivity of the compound. As a result, the desired in vivo biological activity may be achieved by the administration of such polymer-compound abducts less frequently or in lower doses than with the unmodified compound.","Each of the above additives, excipients, formulations and methods of administration represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.","The methylxanthine compound may be administered alone (monotherapy), or in combination with one or more therapeutically effective agents or treatments (combination therapy). The other therapeutically effective agent may be conjugated to the compound, incorporated into the same composition as the compound, or may be administered as a separate composition. The other therapeutically agent or treatment may be administered prior to, during and\/or after the administration of the compound. The other therapeutically effective agent may be administered to augment the therapeutic effect of the compound, or to diminish the negative side effects of the compound.","As used herein, the terms \u201ctreat\u201d and \u201ctreatment\u201d refer to therapeutic treatment, wherein the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) an undesired physiological change associated with a disease, syndrome or disorder.

They should in no way be construed, however, as limiting the broad scope of the invention.","Test Animals","The care of the animals in this study was in accordance with NIH and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Under isoflurane general anesthesia (up to 2%), 250 g male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Boston, Mass., USA) underwent cecal ligation and double puncture (CLP) with an 18-gauge needle or sham operation as previously described. All animals were administered 50 ml\/kg saline subcutaneously immediately post procedure and every 24 hours. Once awake, animals were given access to food and water ad libitum.","Caffeine Injection","Twenty four and 48 hours post-procedure, rats received either an intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of caffeine (7.5 mg\/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) or equal volume saline (1 mL). Rats were sacrificed one hour after the 48 hour injection following euthanasia with 150 mg\/kg of intraperitoneal pentobarbital. Four cohorts were evaluated: SHAM saline, SHAM caffeine, CLP saline, CLP caffeine. N=5 per group. The 24-hour time point was chosen for initial intervention based on the onset of the hypodynamic phase when cardiac function begins to deteriorate and the presence of reversible CcOX inhibition. Studies were performed at the 48-hour time point because this time point represents the late phase of sepsis when cardiac function is markedly depressed and mortality is 75%.","Mitochondrial Isolation","Cardiac ventricles were harvested and homogenized in ice-cold H medium (70 mM sucrose, 220 mM mannitol, 2.5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4 and 2 mM EDTA). The homogenate was spun at 1500\u00d7g for 10 min at 4\u00b0 C. Supernatants were removed and centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7g for 10 mM at 4\u00b0 C. Pellets were resuspended in H medium and centrifuged again at 10,000\u00d7g for 10 min at 4\u00b0 C. Pellets were again resuspended in H medium and mitochondrial protein concentration determined using the method of Lowry.","Cytochrome Oxidase Steady-state Kinetics","CcOX kinetics were assayed by the method of Smith in which the rate of oxidation of ferrocytochrome c was measured by following the decrease in absorbance at 550 nm. Assays were executed in a 1-mL reaction volume containing 50 mM PO4(pH 7.0), 2% lauryl maltoside, and 1 \u03bcg of mitochondrial protein. Ferrocytochrome c was added at a concentration of 40 mM to initiate the reaction. Specific activity was calculated from mean values of three to four measurements using 21.1 mM\u2212cmas the extinction coefficient of ferrocytochrome c at 550 nm.","Citrate synthase activity was measured via spectrophotometry based on the change in absorbance at 412 nm induced by the cleavage of the thiol ester bond of acetyl-CoA and the utilization of oxaloacetate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.). CcOX activities were normalized to citrate synthase activities","Steady-state Levels of Cardiac Cytochrome Oxidase Subunit I (The Active Site)","10 \u03bcg samples of mitochondrial protein were subjected to SDS-acrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Blots were labeled with a primary polyclonal antibody to mouse CcOX I (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg., USA) and secondarily exposed to rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, Calif.). Mitochondrial protein loading was assessed with a primary monoclonal antibody to mouse porin (VDAC, Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg., USA) and secondarily exposed to rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, Calif.). The signal was detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J., USA), and density was measured using scanning densitometry. Five animals per group per experiment were evaluated.","Isolated Rat Heart Preparation","Rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital (70 mg\/kg) and heparinized (1000 U IP). The heart was excised rapidly and the aorta was cannulated. Retrograde perfusion was initiated at constant flow (12 mL\/g-min) with a modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing (mmol\/L) NaCl 120, KCl 4.7, MgSO1.2, KHPO1.2, CaCl1.25, NaHCO25, and glucose. The non-recirculating buffer was maintained at pH 7.4 equilibrated with 95% O-5% COat 37\u00b0 C. Isovolumetric left ventricle pressure (LVP) was measured with a transducer connected to a saline-filled latex balloon inserted into the left ventricle through the left atrium. The balloon was inflated to maintain an end-diastolic pressure of 10 mmHg Hearts were immersed in a water-jacketed chamber maintained at 37\u00b0 C. and allowed to stabilize for 30 minutes.","Heart rate, LVP, the maximum rate of positive and negative change in LVP (+\/\u2212dP\/dt), and aortic pressure were collected with an analog-to-digital converter system (Power Laboratory 4SP, ADlnstruments, Castle Hill, Australia). All variables were displayed and recorded (Chart ver. 4.12, ADInstruments). Measurements were obtained at coronary flow rates (CF) of 12, 10, 8, 6, and 4 mL\/g-min Coronary inflow oxygen tension (PaO) and coronary sinus oxygen tension (PvO2) were measured (GEM Premier 3000, Instrumentation Laboratory, Belgium). Percent O2 extraction was calculated as 100\u00d7(PaO-PvO\/PaO). Myocardial Oconsumption (MO) was calculated as CF\/g\u00d7(PaO-PvO)\u00d7Osolubility at 760 mmHg Osolubility is 24 |il\/ml HO at 37\u00b0 C. Coronary perfusion pressure was calculated as the difference between mean aortic pressure and LV end-diastolic pressure. Coronary resistance was calculated by dividing perfusion pressure by coronary flow.","Survival","The survival was followed in a separate cohort of animals in this two treatment parallel-design study to 96 hours. Each animal was injected with either caffeine (7.5 mg\/kg i.p.) or equal volume of saline (1 mL i.p.) every 24 hours beginning 24 hours following CLP or sham operation. Twenty animals per group were evaluated based on the probability being 80 percent that the study will detect a treatment difference at a two-sided 5.0 percent significance level, if the true hazard ratio is 3.","Statistics","Data are presented as mean +\/\u2212 standard deviation. Statistical significance was assessed using ANOVA and post hoc Tukey's test with p<0.05. Statistical significance in the survival study was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Mantel-Cox log-rank test.","Myocardial CcOX activity was measured via spectrophotometry in isolated mitochondria and normalized to citrate synthase activity. Consistent with prior findings, normalized myocardial CcOX activity significantly decreased 48 hours following CLP in rats that received saline injection (). Caffeine injection, however, restored CcOX kinetic activity in CLP rats to sham values (). There was no significant difference in CcOX activity between saline injected and caffeine injected sham animals ().","Immunoblot analysis for CcOX subunit I (the active site) was performed. There was no significant difference in steady-state myocardial CcOX I levels between all groups (). Thus, change in CcOX activity following CLP in saline injected animals was not on the basis of changes in enzyme levels.","To assess the effect of caffeine on cardiac function, an isolated rat heart preparation was used and heart rate, LVP, and the maximum rate of positive and negative change in LVP (+\/\u2212dP\/dt) were measured over a range of coronary flow rates. There was no significant difference in heart rate between groups (263+\/\u221230 bpm, sham saline; 276+\/\u221211 bpm, sham caffeine; 260+\/\u221217 bpm, CLP saline; 262+\/\u221211 bpm CLP caffeine; p=NS).","However, CLP induced significant reductions in LVP in saline injected animals across all coronary flow rates compared to both sham cohorts (). Caffeine significantly improved LVP following CLP compared to saline injection at all flow rates greater than 4 mL\/g-min (). LVP in caffeine injected CLP animals approached saline injected sham values except at 12 mL\/g-min coronary flow where it was significantly lower than both sham cohorts (). Interestingly, caffeine significantly increased LVP in sham operated animals compared to all other groups at the highest coronary flow rates ().","As with LVP, CLP caused significant reductions in dP\/dt in saline injected animals (). Compared to both sham cohorts, saline injected CLP significantly decreased +dP\/dt at the majority of coronary flow rates and decreased \u2212dP\/dt at all flow rates (). Caffeine significantly improved both +dP\/dt and \u2212dP\/dt following CLP toward saline injected sham values at most flow rates (). Again, caffeine significantly increased +dP\/dt and \u2212dP\/dt following sham operation compared to both CLP groups at all coronary flow rates and significantly increased +dP\/dt and \u2212dP\/dt compared to saline injected sham values at the highest flow rates ().","With regard to coronary perfusion pressure, CLP caused significant reductions in both saline and caffeine injected cohorts compared to sham controls at almost all coronary flow rates (). Compared to saline injected CLP, caffeine injection significantly increased coronary perfusion pressure at 12 mL\/g-min of coronary flow (). Interestingly, caffeine injection significantly reduced coronary perfusion pressure at the highest flow rate following sham operation compared to saline injection (). Similar changes were seen with regard to coronary resistance ().","Caffeine injection significantly increased coronary resistance following CLP and significantly decreased resistance following sham operation compared to their saline injection counterparts, respectively suggesting alternative mechanisms (). Significant reductions in resistance in both CLP groups were consistent with sepsis-induced vasodilation.","To assess in situ mitochondrial function, myocardial oxygen extraction and oxygen consumption were measured at 12 mL\/g-min coronary flow following stabilization. Consistent with CcOX inhibition, both oxygen extraction and consumption significantly decreased following CLP in saline injected animals compared to all groups (, B). Caffeine, however, significantly increased both oxygen extraction and consumption following CLP compared to saline injected sham values (, B). Following sham operation, caffeine significantly increased myocardial oxygen consumption compared to both CLP cohorts ().","In order to assess the effect of caffeine on sepsis-induced mortality, survival was tracked in a separate cohort of animals receiving either a daily injection of caffeine or equal volume of saline. Following CLP, 60% of saline injected animals survived to 48 hours, 25% survived to 72 hours, and none survived to 96 hours post procedure (). On the other hand, caffeine injection significantly improved survival post CLP. Eighty percent of caffeine injected animals survived to 48 hours, 55% survived to 72 hours, and 40% survived to 96 hours post CLP (). There was no mortality observed in either sham cohort ().","A daily injection of caffeine beginning 24 hours post CLP (roughly equivalent to the human consumption of a single cup of coffee) restored CcOX function to sham values at 48 hours. Increased oxygen extraction and myocardial oxygen consumption in the isolated rat heart preparation corroborated this finding in situ. These data strongly suggest that caffeine stimulated oxidative phosphorylation during sepsis and were associated with significant improvements cardiac function and survival.","It is important to note that, despite caffeine-induced restoration of CcOX function following CLP, LVP was significantly less than sham values at the highest coronary flow rate. In addition, although caffeine considerably improved survival to 96 hours post CLP, mortality remained significantly high. This may be explained a number of ways. First, depressed LVP in the setting of restored oxygen consumption suggests that caffeine may have potentially uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation. In other words, electron transport and oxygen consumption were dissociated from ATP production. Therefore, bioenergetic capacity would not be restored entirely and limited ATP synthesis could continue to impair cardiac function. Another explanation is the multifactorial nature of sepsis. It is very likely that impaired CcOX activity by itself is not solely responsible for sepsis-induced organ failure. Thus, abrogation of myocardial CcOX inhibition during sepsis may not completely restore cardiac function. In addition, cardiac dysfunction likely contributes to sepsis-induced mortality but may not be the sole cause it. Thus, marked improvement in myocardial function may not necessarily equate with marked improvements in survival.","These results demonstrate that caffeine, given in a dose equivalent to the average daily human consumption, results in restoration of myocardial CcOX activity, improved cardiac function, and enhanced survival during sepsis.","Having described preferred embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the precise embodiments, and that various changes and modifications may be effected therein by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
