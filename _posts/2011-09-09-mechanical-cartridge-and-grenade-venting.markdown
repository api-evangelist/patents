title: Mechanical cartridge and grenade venting
abstract: To hinder activation caused by unplanned stimuli, a munition may include first and second discrete, separable parts. The first and second parts may include interlocking components to prevent relative axial translation of the first and second parts. The first and second parts may be torsionally biased in opposite directions. A binder with a low melting temperature may fix the first and second parts together to prevent the torsional bias from rotating the first and second parts in the opposite directions. When the binder melts, the torsional bias may cause the first part to rotate with respect to the second part. Relative rotation of the first and second parts may allow relative axial translation of the first and second parts.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to methods for safeguarding munitions that may be exposed to unplanned stimuli.","United States law may require that munitions meet certain safety standards, known as insensitive munition (IM) standards, to protect against unplanned stimuli. Two tests may be used to simulate munitions exposed to a fire, a slow cook off test (SCO) and a fast cook off test (FCO). In SCO, a munition in packaged configuration may be heated at a rate of 6\u00b0 F.\/hour until the munition reacts. In FCO, a munition may be engulfed in a flame of at least 800\u00b0 C. until the munition reacts. It may be desirable for the reaction to be limited to no more than burning (Type 5 reaction). A detonation (Type 1 reaction) may not be acceptable.","Munitions may demonstrate a Type 1 reaction when exposed to either the SCO or FCO tests. It has been found that when propellant is heated, gases may be given off and, if pressure is allowed to accumulate in a cartridge, the munition may detonate. Venting the gases may delay the point in time at which the detonation occurs. If the venting of gases is adequate, the propellant may burn vigorously without detonating.","Previous attempts at venting munitions have involved melt-away round plugs or threaded plugs. Some ionomer plastic plugs may not fully melt, thereby obstructing the vent. Some eutectic metal plugs may have a low tensile and shear strength, thereby causing the plug to fail under test firing. Some cartridges, for example, 25 mm cartridges, have been most difficult to render IM compliant. The difficulty may be due to the high propellant pressure generated and\/or the small cartridge diameter.","Other munitions, such as grenades, for example, also generate gases when heated. A grenade, such as the M67 grenade, may contain a primary energetic material such as Composition B. If pressure is allowed to accumulate in the grenade body, the Composition B may detonate. If venting is adequate, the Composition B may burn vigorously without detonating. Past attempts at IM compliance included removing the fuse from the grenade to create a vent, or threading the circumference of the grenade body so that the grenade may split in half when the internal pressure rises. Neither solution has proven satisfactory.","A need exists for apparatus and methods for rendering munitions compliant with IM standards.","It is an object of the invention to provide apparatus and methods for rendering munitions compliant with IM standards.","One aspect of the invention is a munition having first and second discrete, separable parts. The first and second parts may include interlocking components that prevent relative axial translation of the first and second parts. A spring may torsionally bias the first and second parts in opposite directions. Energetic material may be disposed in the munition. A binder may fix the first and second parts together to prevent the spring from rotating the first and second parts in the opposite directions. The binder may have a melting temperature lower than melting temperatures of the first and second parts and lower than an ignition temperature of the energetic material. When the binder melts, the spring may rotate the first part with respect to the second part to allow relative axial translation of the first and second parts.","In one embodiment, the first part may be a cartridge case and the second part may be a plug that includes a primer pocket. The plug may be disposed in an end of the cartridge case.","In a second embodiment, there may be a plurality of second discrete, separable parts having interlocking components to prevent relative axial translation of the first part and the plurality of second parts. A plurality of springs may torsionally bias the first part and the plurality of second parts in opposite directions. A plurality of binders may fix the first part and the plurality of second parts together to prevent the springs from rotating the first part and the plurality of second parts in the opposite directions. When the binders melt, the springs may rotate the first part with respect to the plurality of second parts to allow relative axial translation of the first part and the plurality of second parts.","In a third embodiment, the first and second parts may be first and second mating portions of a grenade body and the interlocking components may include projections on the first mating portion and projections on the second mating portion.","Another aspect of the invention is a method that may include providing a munition having first and second discrete, separable parts. The first and second parts may include interlocking components to prevent relative axial translation of the first and second parts. The first and second parts may be torsionally biased in opposite directions. The method may include binding the first and second parts together with a binding material to prevent relative rotation of the first and second parts in the opposite directions. After the binding material is melted, the first part may be rotated with respect to the second part.","After rotating the first part with respect to the second part, the method may include axially translating the first part with respect to the second part.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","A munition may include first and second discrete, separable parts. The first and second parts may include interlocking components. The interlocking components may prevent relative axial translation of the first and second parts. The first and second parts may be torsionally biased in opposite directions. The torsional bias may be supplied by, for example, a spring.","A binder may fix the first and second parts together to prevent the torsional bias from rotating the first and second parts in the opposite directions. The binder may have a melting temperature lower than melting temperatures of the first and second parts. When the binder melts, the torsional bias may cause the first part to rotate with respect to the second part.

The melting temperature of the solder may be less than a temperature at which propellant  in cartridge  may ignite. The melting temperature of the solder may be greater than the temperature to which the solder rises during a normal firing of cartridge  in a gun. Thus, when cartridge  is fired from a gun in a normal manner, plug  will remain in place in end  of cartridge case  because locking portions  may bear on bearing portions  and prevent relative axial translation of plug  and cartridge case .","If cartridge  is exposed to a stimulus, propellant  in cartridge  may begin an exothermic reaction. The stimulus or the exothermic reaction may raise the temperature of the solder on surfaces  and  to or beyond the melting temperature of the solder. Then, the solder may fail. Failure of the solder on surfaces  and  may allow spring or springs  to rotate plug  in a counterclockwise direction, as oriented in .
