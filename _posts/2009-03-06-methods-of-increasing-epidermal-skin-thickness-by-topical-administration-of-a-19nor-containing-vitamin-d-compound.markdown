No. 61\/034,401 filed on Mar. 6, 2008.","U.S. patent Nonprovisional patent application Ser. No. 11\/966,504 is commonly owned and discloses related subject matter.","Not applicable.","The skin is made up of three layers including the epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous or fat layer. The epidermis of the skin is the outer layer and is a continuously renewing tissue. The majority of cells in the epidermis are keratinocytes that originate in the basal layer. The keratinocytes migrate from the basal layer to the outermost layer known as the stratum corneum.","The epidermis provides a protective barrier against transcutaneous water loss. The epidermis also prevents most bacteria, viruses and other foreign substances from entering the body. The epidermis also protects the internal body from trauma.","The dermis is a layer of fibrous and elastic tissue that provides the skin flexibility and strength. The underlying fat layer provides insulation from heat and cold. The fat layer also provides an energy depot.","When skin ages, the epidermal and dermal layers atrophy. It has been reported in studies that aged skin is characterized by a thinning epidermis. (Gambichler et al., 2006, 44:145-152). It has also been reported that the epidermal turnover rate slows with aging. (Baumann, 2007, 211:241-251). As a result, a protracted rate of stratum corneum replacement occurs. Moreover, epidermal atrophy and slower wound healing can also occur. Often, less effective desquamation is also prevalent. Such decelerated cell turnover can cause the skin surface to appear rough and dull in appearance. In sum, as skin ages it becomes dry, wrinkled and fragile, and a loss of skin barrier function results.","Photoaging superimposes the effect of chronic ultraviolet induced (UV-induced) damage in addition to normal intrinsic skin aging, which leads to further changes in the skin. It has been reported that epidermal atrophy may occur in some individuals. (Yaar et al., 2007, 157:874-887).","In addition to skin aging, treatment using glucocorticoid hormones may inhibit keratinocyte proliferation. However, chronic glucocorticoid hormone treatment is accompanied by side effects including reduced epidermal thickness, decreased number of keratinocytes, and loss of skin barrier function. (Chebotaev et al., 2007, 127:2749-2758).","One aspect of the invention is a method of increasing the thickness of the epidermal layer in the skin of a human comprising topically administering a

in a mammal, preferably a human. By increasing epidermal thickness, several therapeutic benefits are realized, such as skin barrier function, a reduction in wrinkling, improved wound healing, restoration of the epidermis upon glucocorticoid-induced skin atrophy, and, skin atrophy due to declining hormone (e.g., estrogen and testosterone) levels and\/or age and thinning of the skin due to disease.","The active hormonal form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(1,25(OH)D), is known to affect cellular proliferation and differentiation. 1,25(OH)Dalso has immunomodulatory activity.","1,25(OH)Dacts by binding to a member of the nuclear receptor super-family being the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The VDR is a ligand-activated transcription factor that (in conjunction with the retinoid X receptor) regulates the transcription of 1,25(OH)Dtarget genes. Skin cells (including keratinocytes, fibroblasts and a number of cells in the immune system that are also present in skin) express VDR.","The vitamin D hormone and analogs have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in skin diseases involving defective keratinocyte differentiation, such as psoriasis. 1,25(OH)Dhas been reported to inhibit the proliferation of keratinocytes in culture. (Hosomi et al., 1983113:1950-1957). 1,25(OH)Dmay also be effective in treating keratinocyte hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation in psoriatic patients. Topical administration of 1,25(OH)Dto the skin of the hairless C3H mouse has also been reported to induce epidermal proliferation and to increase epidermal thickness. (Gniadecki et al., 199549:621-624).","Solutes of the instant vitamin D analog compounds may be made using a pharmaceutically suitable solvent, such as propylene glycol and\/or ethanol.","The pharmaceutically suitable topical carrier systems (also referred to as drug delivery systems, which are modern technology, distributed with or as a part of a drug product that allows for the uniform release or targeting of drugs to the body) preferably include FDA-approved and\/or USP-approved inactive ingredients.

According to 21 CFR 210.3(b)(7), an active ingredient is any component of a drug product intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body of humans or other animals. Active ingredients include those components of the product that may undergo chemical change during the manufacture of the drug product and be present in the drug product in a modified form intended to furnish the specified activity or effect.

Animals and dose administration. Rhino mice 6-8 weeks old were dosed daily via the topical route. The mice were weighed three times per week. Doses of API were adjusted weekly based on body weight. The topical formulations dosage forms were made by mixing the API with two different topical carriers. One topical carrier consisted of 70 vol % propylene glycol and 30 vol % ethanol. The other topical carrier consisted of 30 vol % propylene glycol and 70 vol % ethanol. The topical vehicle control for a given comparative example was the vehicle carrier used in the API-formulated topical dosage form. Animals were euthanized 72 hours after administration of the final topical dose, and dorsal skin was collected for histological analysis.","Measurement of epidermal thickness. The extent of the efficacious increase in epidermal thickness was assessed by measuring the thickness (i.e., depth) of the epidermal layer of the skin. The degree of increase in epidermal thickness (as compared to the increase in epidermal thickness in carrier vehicle-only treated skin) was indicative of the degree of efficacy.","Epidermal thickness was determined by histological analysis of tissue sections. Skin was fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0 C. with gentle agitation. The skin was dehydrated the following day in 100% methanol. Samples were embedded in paraffin. Nine sections, each measuring 10 \u03bcm and each separated by 150 \u03bcm, were taken from each mouse and stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain. Five of the nine sections were digitally imaged (6\u00d7 magnification) for analysis of the epidermal thickness using Metamorph Imaging Software (single line function).","The thickness of the epidermis adjacent to each comedone (open or healed) on each respective image of the five sections was also then measured using a Wacom Intuos 3 Graphics Tablet interfaced with the software. The average width was determined for each Rhino mouse from multiple measurements. Individual epidermal thickness average was determined from a composite of measurements taken from all 5 images. Such average for each mouse was used to calculate the treatment group mean.

Separate concentrated ethanolic stock solutions of each API were diluted to a predetermined dose concentration using a topical carrier vehicle. Two different carrier vehicles were used. One topical carrier consisted of 70 vol % propylene glycol and 30 vol % ethanol. The other topical carrier consisted of 30 vol % propylene glycol and 70 vol % ethanol. The vehicle was thoroughly mixed with the API. The topical dosing formulation and dosage form delivered a predetermined amount of API on a per kilogram body weight basis.","A 100 \u03bcL dose was administered to the back of the mouse.
