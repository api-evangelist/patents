title: Terahertz analog-to-digital converter employing active-controlled spoofed surface plasmon polariton architecture
abstract: A high-speed terahertz analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is provided. The ADC is comprised of an interferometer, a modulator and an array of detectors. The interferometer is configured to receive a carrier signal and guide a spoofed surface plasmon polariton (SSPP) wave in each of its two arms. The SSPP waves are emitted from the free end of each arm into a propagation space and combined in the space to form an interference wave. The modulator modulates the carrier signal in at least one of two arms with a modulating signal, where the radiation pattern of the interference wave in a far field of the propagation space is shifted in accordance with the amplitude of the modulating signal. The array of detectors are spatially separated from the interferometer by the propagation space and arranged to receive the interference wave.

The entire disclosure of the above application is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made with government support under FA9550-12-1-0402 awarded by the United States Air Force\/AFOSR. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present disclosure relates to an analog-to-digital converter employing active-controlled spoofed surface plasmon polariton architecture.","Structures and devices designed to work in the frequency range of 0.1-10 THz are proved to be essential in imaging, spectroscopy, biosensing and other applications alike. They are also strong candidates for building the next-generation integrated circuits that will eventually close the gap between electronics and optics. Concentration of terahertz radiation in small volumes can facilitate the sub-wavelength transmission of the signal, generating new possibilities for low-loss, low-dispersion delivery of terahertz radiation over distance. The strong confinement of the E-M field can also enhance the signal-matter interaction, hence maximizing the modulation efficiency in active device designs.","Strong mode localization at terahertz frequency is realized by adding periodic surface features onto the material interface of conventional waveguide structures. Unlike using resonant structures with dimensions comparable with the wavelength, the metamaterial created by the sub-wavelength surface modifications can support a special surface mode, named spoofed surface plasmon polariton (SSPP) mode. With discrete transmission peaks and valleys, the SSPP modes can be modulated by changing geometric dimensions and material parameters of the structure. In most of the studies employing SSPP terahertz architectures, the discrete passing bands and their amplitude modulation due to external stimuli serve at the backbone of the device functionality.","Kramers-Kronig relationship dictates coupled evolution of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant. Therefore, the change in transmittance must be accompanied with the shift in phase accumulation. The inclusion of phase information is, hence, critical in the effort to achieve higher resolution and sensitivity for the SSPP terahertz devices. A metamaterial terahertz phase modulator based on metallic split-ring resonator design has been proposed. In the proposed design, voltage across the Schottky contact formed by the doped semiconductor (GaAs) layer and metal electrode causes depletion of free carriers, changing the complex transmittance of the structure at terahertz frequencies. Phase modulators in the form of waveguides have also been proposed and fabricated by a number of research groups, where doped Si is used to form a thin strip ring resonator. The phase of the propagating signal can be adjusted by free carrier injection through a p-i-n junction, and as a result, the coupling efficiency of the ring resonator can be modulated. Due to the large loss tangent of Si in terahertz domain however, such design can only be effectively applied up to near-infrared frequencies.","In this disclosure, a terahertz beam bender is presented that can be actively controlled through free carrier density modulations. Based on this phenomenon, a multibit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) can be realized that utilizes terahertz signals. The disclosure is organized as follows. First, the mathematical analysis of the DC-SSPP structure will be briefly described and phase modulation with refractive index change in a simplified model will be presented. Next, finite-element simulations for the terahertz beam bender operating in the enhancement mode and depletion mode will be discussed, followed by a section on design and analysis of the ADC.","This section provides background information related to the present disclosure which is not necessarily prior art.","This section provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.","An analog-to-digital converter is presented. The analog-to-digital converter includes: an interferometer, a modulator interfaced with the interferometer, and an array of detectors spatially separated from the interferometer by the propagation space and arranged to receive an interference wave from the interferometer. The interferometer has an input configured to receive a carrier signal and two arms. Each arm is configured to guide a spoofed surface plasmon polariton wave from one end of the arm to the free end of the arm, such that the spoofed surface plasmon polariton waves propagate at a speed slower than the carrier signal and are emitted from the free end of each arm into a propagation space and combine in the propagation space to form an interference wave. The modulator modulates the carrier signal in at least one of the two arms with a modulating signal, where the modulating signal has an amplitude in a predefined range of values and the radiation pattern of the interference wave in a far field of the propagation space is shifted in accordance with the amplitude of the modulating signal.","Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided herein.

With the free carrier concentration of N=2\u00d710cm, the phonon resonance can be clearly marked by the sharp peak at  in the curve of imaginary \u2208 versus frequency (and abrupt change in the curve of real \u2208) to be 8.05 THz. To illustrate the significance of the phonon resonance, the dielectric constant calculated without the second term in (4) is also included in  (thin dashed line at ) with visibly large discrepancies.","Among the common semiconductor materials, GaAs has low intrinsic free carrier density, moderate carrier mobility, and electron effective mass. As observed from , in terahertz frequencies, GaAs demonstrates effective change of the real \u2208 with different free carrier densities, as indicated at  and mild change to the small imaginary \u2208 at the same time as indicated at . Such properties are desirable in this application, where large modulation depth and stable power output throughout the working range are required. As a result, GaAs is deployed as the semiconductor material in the design of the terahertz beam bender. While particular reference is made to GaAs, it is readily understood that other types of semiconductor materials having low intrinsic free carrier density, moderate carrier mobility and electron effective mass, such as InSb, also fall within the scope of this disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["40","41","42","44","42","41","42","42","44","43","42","41","42","44"]},"In the example embodiment, the entire beam bender structure  is made of an intrinsic semiconductor (e.g., GaAs) covered by metal, with an exception in the grooves , where dopants are introduced to create a thin layer of n-type GaAs. In some embodiments, dopants may be introduced throughout the entire region of grooves or some select portions thereof depending on the application. In other embodiments, the intrinsic semiconductor material is encased in a metal structure of varying dimensions (e.g., thickness). Although not a focus of this particular report, this structure can be fabricated following conventional procedures, including electron beam lithography for patterning, dopant implantation for defining the n-GaAs region, and physical vapor deposition for forming the metal shell.","For the beam bender, spoofed surface plasmon polariton (SSPP) waves are derived from the input carrier signal and traverse through the arms  of the waveguide along the metal-dielectric interface, where the SSPP waves propagate at a speed slower than the input carrier wave. In particular, the SSPP mode is largely confined to the groove region near resonance. The localized n-GaAs can, therefore, effectively lower the insertion loss of the device without sacrificing the performance.","Free carriers are injected into the semiconductor material of one or both arms  via an external stimulus. Such stimuli can be thermal, optical, or electrical depending on its specific applications. For example, thermal carrier injection can be achieved via direct thermal contact of the heated metal. In another example, free carriers are injected electrically using a metal electrode formed on an exterior surface of the beam bender. A forward bias voltage is applied to the junction formed by the metal and the semiconductor. The applied voltage serves as a modulating signal having an amplitude selected from a predefined range of values. In either case, free carriers are injected into the semiconductor which in turn changes the effective refractive index of the material. Consequently, the radiation pattern (i.e., angle of radiation) of wave in the far field is shifted in accordance with the amplitude of the modulating signal.","HFSS is used to simulate the beam bender structure as mentioned previously, with the dimensions of each SSPP arm being",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00006","num":"00006"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"d","mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"4.9","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mi":"\u00b5m"}},{"mfrac":{"mi":["a","d"]},"mo":"=","mn":"0.1"},{"mfrac":{"mi":["h","d"]},"mo":"=","mn":"0.7"},{"mfrac":{"mi":["t","d"]},"mo":"=","mn":"0.3"},{"mfrac":{"mi":["W","d"]},"mo":"=","mn":"3"}],"mo":[",",",",",",",",","]}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00007","num":"00007"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":["D","d"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"2.5","mo":"."}}}},"br":{},"figref":["FIGS. 5A and 5B","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B"],"sup":["16 ","\u22123","16 ","\u22123 ","17 ","\u22123 "],"b":["501","502"]},"The slight nonlinearity of the curve in  comes from the modified Drude model. From equations (4) and (5), and , it is easy to notice the linear evolution of \u2208 with N. The phase change, on the other hand, is proportional to n=\u221a{square root over (\u2208)}\u221d\u221a{square root over (N)}. A simple mathematic routine of Taylor expansion, however, shows that such nonlinearity can be mostly corrected when carriers are injected in both arms in a differential manner. That is, the carrier density in one arm is increased while that in the other arm is decreased, keeping the overall carrier concentration a constant. This may be accomplished, for example by applying modulating signals to both arms of the interferometer such that the modulating signals are 180 degrees out of phase with each other. The insertion loss, on the other hand, is obtained as the portion of output power versus input to be 4 dB. About 2 dB of this loss is found to come from reflection of the bifurcated MZI structure and the Fabry-Perot (F-P) echelon effect, which can be further alleviated by optimizing the design therein.","In addition to the given example, the beam bending effect is not confined by specific structural dimensions. In fact, the initial doping concentration of n-GaAs and operating frequency of the structure can change in pairs, as long as the imaginary refractive index is not too large to prevent effective wave propagation. Correspondingly, the dimensions of the structure can be adjusted in scale, making this design highly adaptable to various requirements. As an example, using (4), the operating frequencies of initial doping density of N=2\u00d710cmand N=2\u00d710cmare calculated to be 11 and 24 THz, corresponding to the refractive indices of n=2.54+i0.03 and n=2.49+i0.02, respectively. For these operating frequencies, the beam bender has the size of d=4.2 \u03bcm and d=1.9 \u03bcm individually. The output angle as a function of free carrier density in those two cases ( and ) is illustrated in . Similarly, the beam deflection is accompanied with nonlinearity, which can be effectively overcome when differential carrier injection is applied. The refractive indices in these two cases are chosen such that the insertion losses are comparable, and of which a significant contribution still comes from the MZI structure itself.","Since the doping concentration of GaAs layer is much higher than its intrinsic free carrier density (N=2.1\u00d710cm), the beam bender  can also operate in depletion mode. In this mode, a Schottky contact is formed by the metal electrode and the underlying semiconductor material.

Again, such nonlinearity can be mostly corrected when differential voltage is applied to both arms of the MZI structure.","Earlier, the beam bending effect of the DC-SSPP architecture was demonstrated. The ability to control the deflection angle of the output through external stimuli makes such a structure valuable in building a number of active devices. A spatial-resolved terahertz ADC is one of the many important applications.","Analog-to-digital conversion is an indispensable technology for mixed-signal circuits. Although electronic ADCs have been primarily used for the task, alternatives such as optically assisted and all-optical ADCs have been intensely studied to overcome the performance limitations of the electronic ADCs. Among them, the idea of an optical ADC operating on diverted far-field radiation patterns has been proposed by H. F. Taylor in the \u201cAn optical analog-to-digital converter\u2014Design and analysis\u201d, IEEE J. Quantum Electron, Vol. 15, No. 4, pp. 210-216, April, 1979, where multiple phase shifters with geometrically increasing lengths were used. In recent years, further works have been conducted in an effort to realize high-speed analog-to-digital conversion. For example, others have used the quantum-confined Stark effect to induce the phase change in one or both arms of an MZI waveguide consisting of travelling-wave shifters. The diverted beam is received by detector arrays arranged in binary manner and digitized output is readout directly.","Despite its wide bandwidth (BW) in theory, the speed advantage of optical ADC has yet been fully utilized due to the lack of resonant conversion between photons and electrons. Terahertz frequency band, on the other hand, can interact coherently with electronics, and is hence a more promising candidate for building high-speed integrated components. A terahertz ADC design can serve as a gateway to emerging landscapes of broadband, terahertz-assisted, as well as all-terahertz systems.","In the terahertz domain, the index-guiding waveguide design shows small modal confinement factor and high signal power loss, hence is incapable of delivering signals at these frequencies with good beam quality and radiation efficiency. To overcome this problem, the DC-SSPP structure is applied to realize confined propagation of terahertz wave in the form of a spoofed surface mode. Room-temperature, spatial-resolved ADC operations employing terahertz carrier signals can be realized by having the DC-SSPP beam bender  as the first stage , as is shown in the architecture shown in .","In the proposed ADC design, depletion mode is chosen as the operating mode to enable beam steering, and the control voltage  serves as the analog input. The change in the position of radiation maxima can be interpreted into binary bits by the detector arrays when their positions and properties are carefully designed.","In the example embodiment, the beam deflector stage of the terahertz ADC consists of 10 periods of grooves on each arm of the interferometer structure and has dimensions of",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00010","num":"00010"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"d","mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"4.75","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mi":"\u00b5m"}},{"mfrac":{"mi":["a","d"]},"mo":"=","mn":"0.1"},{"mfrac":{"mi":["h","d"]},"mo":"=","mn":"0.7"},{"mfrac":{"mi":["t","d"]},"mo":"=","mn":"0.3"},{"mfrac":{"mi":["W","d"]},"mo":"=","mn":"3"},{"mrow":[{"mi":"and","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mfrac":{"mi":["D","d"]}},{"mn":"2.5","mo":"."}],"mo":"="}],"mo":[",",",",",",",",","]}}},"br":{},"sup":["17 ","\u22123"],"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9B"],"b":["901","902"]},"In ideal cases of the ADC design employing beam steering mechanisms, the main peak of the radiation pattern needs to be coupled independently into separate detectors in order to directly readout the digitized bits of the analog input. By applying classic diffraction theories, it is easy to conclude that in this case, at least N=2phase shifters in the first stage are needed in order to realize an n-bit ADC. In this design, however, only two SSPP branches are used to form the MZI structure. Therefore, for any attempt to have more than 1-bit digitized output, the radiation peak can only be partially coupled into separate detectors. The outcome as a result of the partial coupling is shown in , where eight identical linear detectors are used in an attempt to obtain a 3-bit output. It is observed that only one period of the sign change can be obtained at  for all 3 bits in this case, which indicates an actual ADC resolution of only 1 bit.","To tackle this problem, detectors operating in saturated conditions are employed. With carefully designed gains and nonlinearities for the detector arrays, up to 2periods of sign change within 2\u03c0 phase shift for the nth bit output can be achieved.

The non-unity relative gain is used to emphasize the edges of the main radiation peak.

Despite the small jitter of the pulses, the repetition rate of the state-of-the-art mode-locked laser is mostly in the sub-gigahertz range.

Moreover, sampling frequency can be further increased by using the concept of temporal interleaving as shown in . As illustrated, the sampling rate can be increase by more than four times. By scaling the temporal interleaving structure, it is envisioned that the sampling frequency can be increased even more. These techniques can lead to a ADC with very high sampling rates and an implementation of 250 to 500 GS\/s as shown in .","In this disclosure, a terahertz beam steering structure is designed utilizing SSPP mode E-M propagation through the doubly-corrugated closed waveguide having sub-wavelength dimensions. The SSPP mode propagation is further enhanced by adding a thin layer of doped n-GaAs on the groove walls of the waveguide. The modulation to the free carrier concentration of GaAs causes the change in phase for the propagating terahertz wave, which, by combining two corrugated waveguides to construct an interferometer, can induce significant deflection of the output beam.","The beam bender can operate in either the enhancement mode or the depletion mode, depending on the nature of the free carrier density modulation. In the enhancement mode, free carriers are injected thermally, optically, or electronically into the GaAs layer. In the depletion mode, free carriers are extracted from the semiconductor via an external voltage across the Schottky contact. In both cases, the radiation angle of the output is effectively modulated. The visible nonlinear change of the diversion angle can be effectively corrected when differential controls are applied to the double arms of the MZI structure. The dielectric constant of the GaAs varies with its free carrier concentration as well as frequency. As a result, for both operating modes, different combinations of the two parameters can be used to optimize the design, making it highly adaptable to various applications.","In an effort to achieve higher operating speed for analog-to-digital conversion, the SSPP beam bender is utilized in a spatial-resolved binary encoded sensor array with terahertz response time. With a differential voltage input asserted to both the arms of the MZI, a symmetric deflection angle change as large as \u00b120\u00b0 is achieved with nearly perfect linearity. Due to the beam steering effect being realized with only two interferometric branches, the far-field radiation pattern is not suitable for coupling into independent detectors. As a result, detectors with carefully designed gains and saturation powers are used in order to readout multiple bits. By employing the beam deflector operating in depletion mode, a 3-bit ADC is realized with the speed of operation exceeding 60 GS\/s. The maximum speed of the device is limited by the drifting carrier transit time across the space-charge region, as well as the parasitic RC constant of the Schottky contact. These time constants can be potentially minimized with a higher initial doping concentration of the n-GaAs that will further boost the operating BW of the proposed ADC design.","The foregoing description of the embodiments has been provided for purposes of illustration and description.
