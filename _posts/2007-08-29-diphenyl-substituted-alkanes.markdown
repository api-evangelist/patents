Leukotrienes are potent contractile and inflammatory mediators derived through the oxygenation of arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase.","One class of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors are those known to act through inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). In general, 5-LO inhibitors have been sought for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, asthma and inflammatory conditions including arthritis. One example of a 5-LO inhibitor is the marketed drug zileuton, which is indicated for the treatment of asthma. More recently, it has been reported that 5-LO may be an important contributor to the atherogenic process; see Mehrabian, M. et al., Circulation Research, 2002 Jul. 26, 91(2):120-126.","A new class of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors (now known as FLAP inhibitors) distinct from 5-LO inhibitors is described in Miller, D. K. et al., \u201cIdentification and isolation of a membrane protein necessary for leukotriene production,\u201d Nature, vol. 343, No. 6255, pp. 278-281 (18 Jan. 1990). See also Dixon, R. A. et al, \u201cRequirement of a 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein for leukotriene synthesis,\u201d Nature, vol 343, no. 6255, pp. 282-4 (18 Jan. 1990). 5-LO inhibitor compounds were used to identify and isolate the inner nuclear membrane 18,000 dalton protein 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP). These compounds inhibit the formation of cellular leukotrienes but have no direct effect on soluble 5-LO activity. In cells, arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by the action of cytosolic phospholipase 2. This arachidonic acid is transferred to nuclear membrane bound 5-lipoxygenase by FLAP. The presence of FLAP in cells is essential for the synthesis of leukotrienes. Additionally, based on studies described in Helgadottir, A., et al., Nature Genetics, Vol 36, No. 3 (March 2004) pp. 233-239, it is believed that the gene encoding 5-lipoxygenase activating protein confers risk for myocardial infarction and stroke in humans.","Despite significant therapeutic advances in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis and ensuing atherosclerotic disease events, such as the improvements that have been achieved with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, further treatment options are clearly needed. The instant invention addresses that need by providing compounds, compositions and methods for the treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis as well as related conditions.","The instant invention relates to compounds of Formula I which are FLAP inhibitors, methods for their preparation, and methods and pharmaceutical formulations for using these compounds in mammals, especially humans.

This inhibition of the mammalian biosynthesis of leukotrienes indicates that the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions thereof are useful to prevent or reduce the risk for, treat or ameliorate in mammals and especially in humans: 1) pulmonary disorders including diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and related obstructive airway diseases, 2) allergies and allergic reactions such as allergic rhinitis, contact dermatitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and the like, 3) inflammation such as arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, 4) pain, 5) skin disorders such as atopic eczema, and the like, 6) cardiovascular disorders such as angina, formation of atherosclerotic plaques, myocardial ischemia, hypertension, platelet aggregation and the like, 7) renal insufficiency arising from ischaemia induced by immunological or chemical (cyclosporin) etiology and 8) migraine or cluster headache, 9) ocular conditions such as uveitis, 10) hepatitis resulting from chemical, immunological or infectious stimuli, 11) trauma or shock states such as burn injuries, endotoxemia and the like, 12) allograft rejection, 13) prevention of side effects associated with therapeutic administration of cytokines such as Interleukin II and tumor necrosis factor, 14) chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, bronchitis and other small- and large-airway diseases, 15) cholecystitis, 16) multiple sclerosis, 17) proliferation of myoblastic leukemia cells, 18) pulmonary fibrosis, 19) respiratory syncytial virus, 20) acne and 21) sleep apnea. Moreover, the compounds of this invention can be administered to patients, including adult and pediatric patients, for the relief of symptoms of allergic rhinitis, including seasonal allergic rhinitis.","Particularly, the compounds of this invention can be administered to patients, including adult and pediatric patients, for the prophylaxis of asthma and for chronic treatment of asthma. The compounds of this invention can be administered to patients, including adult and pediatric patients, for the treatment of asthma: (1) as an alternative to low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for patients with mild persistent asthma, (2) as concomitant therapy with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for patients with mild persistent asthma, or (3) as concomitant therapy in patients with persistent asthma who are inadequately controlled on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or on combined ICS\/long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) therapy. The compounds can be used for treatment of asthmatic patients including, but not limited to, steroid resistant\/non-responder asthmatics, asthmatics for whom leukotriene modifiers have previously failed, smoking asthmatics, and aspirin sensitive asthmatics.","The compounds can be administered to patients to: (1) improve FEV1 (Forced Expitory Volume in one minute), (2) improve morning and evening PEF (Peak Expitory flow), (3) reduce beta-agonist use (measured by puffs\/day), (4) reduce inhaled\/systemic steroid use. (5) improve daytime asthma symptoms, (6) reduce number of nocturnal awakenings, 7) improve asthma control days, (8) reduce number of asthma exacerbations, wherein an exacerbation is defined as: requiring systemic steroid, an emergency room visit, hospitalization, an unscheduled asthma related doctor visit, decrease in A.M. PEF by >20% or A.M. PEF <180 l\/min, increased SABA (short-acting beta-agonist) use >70% from baseline (minimum increase 2 puffs), or increased symptom score of >50%, (9) reduce the number of asthma attacks (measured as % of days with at least one attack over a specified period of total days), wherein the attack is one that requires systemic steroid use, an emergency room visit, hospitalization, or an unscheduled asthma related doctor visit, (10) reduce the number of acute asthma attacks, (11) reduce blood and sputum eosinophils, and\/or (12) prevent and treat EIB (exercised induced bronchoconstriction).","The FLAP inhibitors of this invention can also be used in a therapeutically effective amount for promoting osteogenesis in a patient in need of such treatment. For example, the compounds could be used to promote osteogenesis to accelerate or enhance bone fracture healing, treat bone defects, and enhance bone formation. The compounds can be administered alone or in combination with one or more additional active agents that inhibit bone resorption, regulate calcium resorption from bone, enhance bone accumulation, enhance bone formation, induce bone formation, impair growth of microorganisms, reduce inflammation, and\/or reduce pain.","The compounds of the present invention may also be used to treat or prevent mammalian (especially, human) disease states such as erosive gastritis; erosive esophagitis; diarrhea; cerebral spasm; premature labor, spontaneous abortion; dysmenorrhea; ischemia; noxious agent-induced damage or necrosis of hepatic, pancreatic, renal, or myocardial tissue; liver parenchymal damage caused by hepatoxic agents such as CCland D-galactosamine; ischemic renal failure; disease-induced hepatic damage; bile salt induced pancreatic or gastric damage; trauma- or stress-induced cell damage; and glycerol-induced renal failure. Leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors also act as inhibitors of tumor metastasis and exhibit cytoprotective action and therefore the compounds of this invention may also be useful in this regard.","The FLAP inhibitors of this invention can also be administered for prevention, amelioration and treatment of glomerulonephritis (see Guasch A., Zayas C. F., Badr K F. (1999), \u201cMK-591 acutely restores glomerular size selectivity and reduces proteinuria in human glomerulonephritis,\u201d Kidney Int., 56:261-267); and also for and prevention, amelioration and treatment of kidney damage resulting from diabetes complications (see Valdivielso J M, Montero A., Badr K F., Munger K A. (2003), \u201cInhibition of FLAP decreases proteinuria in diabetic rats,\u201d J. Nephrol., 16(1):85-940.)","In addition, the compounds of this invention can also be used for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As described in S. Kilfeather, Chest, 2002, vol 121, 197, airway neutrophilia in COPD patients is believed to be a contributing source of inflammation and is associated with airway remodeling. The presence of neutrophils is mediated in part by LTB, and treatment with the instant compounds could be used to reduce neutrophilic inflammation in patients with COPD and reduce the rate of COPD exacerbations. In particular, the compounds of this invention could be used for daily, preferably once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction associated with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.","The cytoprotective activity of a compound may be observed in both animals and man by noting the increased resistance of the gastrointestinal mucosa to the noxious effects of strong irritants, for example, the ulcerogenic effects of aspirin or indomethacin. In addition to lessening the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the gastrointestinal tract, animal studies show that cytoprotective compounds will prevent gastric lesions induced by oral administration of strong acids, strong bases, ethanol, hypertonic saline solutions, and the like. Two assays can be used to measure cytoprotective ability. These assays are: (A) an ethanol-induced lesion assay and (B) an indomethacin-induced ulcer assay and are described in EP 140,684.","In particular, the compounds of the invention would be useful to reduce the gastric erosion caused by co-administration of a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor and low-dose aspirin. Cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors are widely used as effective anti-inflammatory drugs with less potential for gastrointestinal complications as compared to traditional, non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, the combined use of a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor with low-dose aspirin for cardio protection may compromise the gastrointestinal safety of this class of compounds. By virtue of its activity as a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, the compounds of the invention would be expected to be gastric protective in this regard. See Fiorucci, et al. FASEB J. 17:1171-1173, 2003. Cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors for use with the invention include but are not limited to etoricoxib (ARCOXIA\u2122) and celecoxib (CELEBREX\u00ae). A compound of this invention in combination with a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor could be administered in unit dosage form or separately to a patient on low-dose aspirin therapy. Alternatively, the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor could be administered in unit dosage form with low-dose aspirin, in which case a compound of this invention would be administered separately. All three active ingredients in unit dosage form is also encompassed. Conventional dosage amounts of the cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor and aspirin (for cardio protection) may be utilized. Aspirin could be administered at 81 mg once daily.","The term \u201cpatient\u201d includes mammals, especially humans, who use the instant active agents for the prevention or treatment of a medical condition. Administering of the drug to the patient includes both self-administration and administration to the patient by another person. The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition, or may desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk of onset of atherosclerosis.","The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, a system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. The term \u201cprophylactically effective amount\u201d is intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue, a system, animal or human by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician.","It is understood that a specific daily dosage amount can simultaneously be both a therapeutically effective amount, e.g., for treatment to slow progression of existing atherosclerosis, and a prophylactically effective amount, e.g., for prevention of an atherosclerotic disease event or formation of new lesions.","In general, FLAP inhibitors can be identified as those compounds which have an ICin the \u201cFLAP Binding Assay\u201d that is less than or equal to 1 \u03bcM, and preferably 500 nM or less, more preferably 100 nM or less, and most preferably 25 nM or less.","An effective amount of a FLAP inhibitor in the method of this invention is in the range of about 0.01 mg\/kg to about 30 mg\/kg of body weight per day, preferably 0.1 mg to about 15 mg per kg, and most preferably 0.5 to 7.5 mg per kg, in single or divided doses. A single daily dose is preferred but not necessary. For an average body weight of 70 kg, the dosage level is therefore from about 1 mg to about 2000 mg of drug per day, e.g. 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 125 mg, 150 mg, 175 mg, 200 mg, 250 mg or 500 mg per day, preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to four times a day, or in sustained release form. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the patient's condition. A consideration of these factors is well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled clinician for the purpose of determining the therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective dosage amount needed to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition. It is expected that the FLAP inhibitor will administered chronically on a daily basis for a length of time appropriate to treat or prevent the medical condition relevant to the patient, including a course of therapy lasting months, years or the life of the patient.","One or more additional active agents may be administered with a compound of Formula I. The term \u201cadditional active agent (or agents)\u201d is intended to mean a pharmaceutically active agent (or agents) different from the compound of Formula I. In a broad embodiment, any suitable additional active agent or agents, including but not limited to anti-atherosclerotic agents such as a lipid modifying compound, anti-diabetic agents and\/or anti-obesity agents and agents used for the treatment of metabolic syndrome, may be used in combination with the compound of Formula I in a single dosage formulation, or may be administered to the patient in a separate dosage formulation, which allows for concurrent or sequential administration of the active agents. The additional active agent or agents may have more than one pharmaceutical activity, for example it may have both lipid-modifying effects and anti-diabetic activity. Examples of additional active agents which may be employed include but are not limited to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, which include statins in their lactonized or dihydroxy open acid forms and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof, including but not limited to lovastatin (MEVACOR\u00ae, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,342,767), simvastatin (ZOCOR\u00ae, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,444,784), pravastatin, particularly the sodium salt thereof (PRAVACHOL\u00ae, see U.S. Pat.

No. 5,260,440); 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors; cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, for example JTT-705; HMG-CoA synthase inhibitors; squalene epoxidase inhibitors; squalene synthetase inhibitors (also known as squalene synthase inhibitors), acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitors including selective inhibitors of ACAT-1 or ACAT-2 as well as dual inhibitors of ACAT-1 and -2; microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitors; niacin; niacin receptor agonists such as acipimox and acifran, as well as niacin receptor partial agonists; bile acid sequestrants; LDL (low density lipoprotein) receptor inducers; platelet aggregation inhibitors, for example glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa fibrinogen receptor antagonists and aspirin; human peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) agonists including the compounds commonly referred to as glitazones for example pioglitazone and rosiglitazone and, including those compounds included within the structural class known as thiazolidinediones as well as those PPAR\u03b3 agonists outside the thiazolidinedione structural class; PPAR\u03b1 agonists such as clofibrate, fenofibrate including micronized fenofibrate, and gemfibrozil; PPAR dual \u03b1\/\u03b3 agonists; vitamin B(also known as pyridoxine) and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof such as the HCl salt; vitamin B(also known as cyanocobalamin); folic acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof such as the sodium salt and the methylglucamine salt; anti-oxidant vitamins such as vitamin C and E and beta carotene; beta-blockers; angiotensin II antagonists such as losartan and losartan with hydrochlorothiazide; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors such as enalapril and captopril; calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine and diltiazam; endothelian antagonists; agents that enhance ABCA1 gene expression; FXR and LXR ligands including both inhibitors and agonists; bisphosphonate compounds such as alendronate sodium; and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors such as etoricoxib, celecoxib and valdecoxib. Anti-obesity agents can be employed in combination with a compound of this invention including, but not limited to, sibunamine, orlistat, topiramate, naltrexone, bupriopion, phentermine, and phentermine\/topiramate combination (QNEXA\u00ae); NPY5 antagonists; Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase-1 and -2 (ACC) inhibitors; MCH1R antagonists; and CB1 antagonists\/inverse agonists such as those described in WO03\/077847 and WO05\/000809. Additional anti-diabetes agents which may be employed in combination with a compound of this invention include but are not limited to DPP-4 (dipeptidylpeptidase-4) inhibitors such as sitagliptin (JANUVIA\u00ae) and vildagliptin (GALVUS\u00ae); sulfonylureas e.g., chlorpropamide, tolazamide, glyburide, glipizide, and glimepiride; biguanides, e.g., metformin; alpha-glucosidase inhibitors e.g., acarbose and miglitol; meglitinides e.g., repaglinide; glucagon-receptor antagonists; and glucokinase activators.","Other advantageous pharmaceutical combinations comprise the compounds of this invention in combination with anti-cholinergics such as ipratropium bromide and tiotropium, bronchodilators such as the beta agonist salbutamol, metaproterenol, terbutaline, fenoterol, salmeterol, formoterol and the like, and the anti-asthmatic drugs theophylline, choline theophyllinate and enprofylline, the calcium antagonists nifedipine, diltiazem, nitrendipine, verapamil, nimodipine, felodipine, etc., and the corticosteroids, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, betamethasone, dexamethasone, beclomethasone, and the like. Particularly, for the prophylaxis and treatment of asthma, compounds of this invention can be used in combination with orally inhaled corticosteroids, such as beclomethasone (e.g. QVAR\u00ae Inhalation Aerosol), budesonide (e.g. Pulmicort Respules), flunisolide (e.g., AEROBID\u00ae and AEROBID\u00ae-M Inhaler System), fluticasone (e.g., FLOVENT\u00ae DISKUS\u00ae inhalation powder, FLOVENT\u00ae HFA Inhalation Aerosol), mometasone (e.g., ASMANEX\u00ae TWISTHALER\u00ae), and triamcinolone (e.g., AZMACORT\u00ae Inhalation Aerosol), and also with inhaled corticosteroid\/LABA products such as fluticasone propionate\/salmeterol (e.g., ADVAIR DISKUS\u00ae). The instant compounds could also be used in combination with leukotriene receptor antagonists such as montelukast (e.g., SINGULAIR\u00ae); phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitors such as roflumilast, N-Cyclopropyl-1-[3-(1-oxido-3-pyridinylethynyl)phenyl]-1,4-dihydro[1,8]naphthyridin-4-one-3-carboxamide and the compounds disclosed in PCT Publication WO2003\/018579; and Very Late Antigen 4 (VLA4) inhibitors such as the compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,229,011, particularly R411 (N-(2-Chloro-6-methylbenzoyl)-4-[(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)amino]-L-phenylalanine-2-(diethylamino)ethyl ester which is an ester pro-drug of the active moiety, N-(2-chloro-6-methylbenzoyl)-4-[(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)amino]-L-phenylalanine), and the compounds disclosed in PCT publication WO2006\/023396.","Still another type of agent that can be used in combination with the compounds of this invention are cholesterol absorption inhibitors. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors block the movement of cholesterol from the intestinal lumen into enterocytes of the small intestinal wall. This blockade is their primary mode of action in reducing serum cholesterol levels. These compounds are distinct from compounds which reduce serum cholesterol levels primarily by mechanisms of action such as acyl coenzyme A\u2014cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) inhibition, inhibition of triglyceride synthesis, MTP inhibition, bile acid sequestration, and transcription modulation such as agonists or antagonists of nuclear hormones. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors include but are not limited to those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,966, U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,365, U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,115, U.S. Pat. No. 6,133,001, U.S. Pat. No. 5,886,171, U.S. Pat. No. 5,856,473, U.S. Pat. No. 5,756,470, U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,321, U.S. Pat. No. 5,919,672, U.S. Pat. No. 6,498,156, US2004\/0082561, US2004\/0067913, US2004\/0063929, US2002-0137689, WO 05\/047248, WO 05\/021497, WO 05\/021495, WO 05\/000353, WO 04\/005247, WO 00\/63703, WO 00\/60107, WO 00\/38725, WO 00\/34240, WO 00\/20623, WO 97\/45406, WO 97\/16424, WO 97\/16455, and WO 95\/08532. An exemplary cholesterol absorption inhibitor is ezetimibe, marketed in the U.S. under the tradename ZETIA\u00ae described in U.S. Pat. No. Re 37721 and the Physician's Desk Reference as well as VYTORIN\u00ae, which is a combination of ezetimibe with simvastatin.","This and other cholesterol absorption inhibitors can be identified according to the assay of hypolipidemic compounds using the hyperlipidemic hamster described in U.S. Pat. Re 37721, beginning in column 20, in which hamsters are fed a controlled cholesterol diet and dosed with test compounds for seven days. Plasma lipid analysis is conducted and data is reported as percent reduction of lipid versus control.","Therapeutically effective amounts of cholesterol absorption inhibitors include dosages of from about 0.01 mg\/kg to about 30 mg\/kg of body weight per day, preferably about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 15 mg\/kg. For an average body weight of 70 kg, the dosage level is therefore from about 0.7 mg to about 2100 mg of drug per day, e.g. 10, 20, 40, 100 or 200 mg per day, preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response when the cholesterol absorption inhibitor is used in combination with a compound of the instant invention.","In the method of treatment of this invention, the FLAP inhibitors may be administered via any suitable route of administration such as orally, parenterally, or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, infrasternal injection or infusion techniques. Oral formulations are preferred.","For oral use, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention containing the active ingredient may be in forms such as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc.","Oral immediate-release and time-controlled release dosage forms may be employed, as well as enterically coated oral dosage forms. Tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. One example of a time-controlled release device is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,366,738. They may also be coated by the technique described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for controlled release.","Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with water or miscible solvents such as propylene glycol, PEGs and ethanol, or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.","Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxy-propylmethycellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more colouring agents, one or more flavouring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.","Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.","Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavouring agents.","Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Cosolvents such as ethanol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols may also be used. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.","The instant invention also encompasses a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising combining a compound of Formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Also encompassed is the pharmaceutical composition which is made by combining a compound of Formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I can be used for the preparation of a medicament useful for treating or preventing any of the medical conditions described herein, in dosage amounts described herein. For example, a compound of Formula I can be used for the preparation of a medicament useful for preventing or reducing the risk of developing atherosclerotic disease, halting or slowing the progression of atherosclerotic disease once it has become clinically manifest, and preventing or reducing the risk of a first or subsequent occurrence of an atherosclerotic disease event. Additionally, the medicament may be useful for the treatment of asthma, allergies and allergic conditions, inflammation, COPD or erosive gastritis. The medicament comprised of a compound of Formula I may also be prepared with one or more additional active agents, such as those described herein.","The compounds of structural Formula I of the present invention can be prepared according to the procedures of the following Schemes and Examples, using appropriate materials and are further exemplified by the specific examples which follow. Moreover, by utilizing the procedures described herein, one of ordinary skill in the art can readily prepare additional compounds of the present invention claimed herein. The compounds illustrated in the examples are not, however, to be construed as forming the only genus that is considered as the invention. All temperatures are degrees Celsius unless otherwise noted.

It is customary to perform the reaction in an inert organic solvent such as DMF or DCM, at temperatures between 0\u00b0 C. and the reflux temperature of the solvent, frequently at room temperature and for periods of 1-24 hours.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0164","num":"0180"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00036","num":"00036"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00036","he":"109.05mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US08440672-20130514-C00036.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"As shown in reaction scheme P, 47 can also be elaborated using the Fukuyama modification of the Mitsunobu reaction (Fukuyama, T.; Jow, C.-K.; Cheung, M. 1995, 36, 6373-74). For example, 47 may be reacted with an arylsulfonyl chloride such as 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride, 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride or 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride and a tertiary amine base such as 2,4,6-collidine or 2,6-lutidine in an inert organic solvent such as DCM. Alternatively, the reaction can also be performed under the classical Schotten-Baumann conditions as shown in scheme P, in which 47 and the arylsulfonyl chloride are allowed to react in aqueous alkaline solution. The product of this reaction is the sulfonamide of type 51, which can be further modified by reaction with an alcohol of type 52 in the presence of triphenylphosphine and an activating agent such as DEAD, DIAD, or the like. The reaction is performed in a suitable inert organic solvent such as benzene, toluene, THF or mixtures thereof, typically at room temperature, and the reaction is generally complete in 0.5-3 hours. The product of this reaction is the dialkylsulfonamide of type 53, which can be desulfonylated by treatment with either a nucleophilic amine like n-propylamine, in a solvent such as DCM, or with mercaptoacetic acid and triethylamine in DCM. In either case, the reaction is conducted typically at room temperature, for periods of 5 minutes to 1 hour. When a 2- or 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl derivative is employed, the cleavage of the sulfonamide is accomplished with either the combination of thiophenol and potassium carbonate in a solvent like DMF, or with mercaptoacetic acid and lithium hydroxide in DMF. In either case, the reaction is conducted at room temperature, for periods of 1-3 hours. The secondary amine product of type 54 can be modified further using a variety of methods known in organic synthesis to provide other compounds of the present invention. For example, 54 may be subjected to a reductive amination reaction with an aldehyde or ketone of type 55 using the conditions described in the bottom of reaction Scheme P to afford compounds of type 56.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0166","num":"0182"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00037","num":"00037"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00037","he":"230.12mm","wi":"69.34mm","file":"US08440672-20130514-C00037.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00038","num":"00038"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00038","he":"54.02mm","wi":"30.73mm","file":"US08440672-20130514-C00038.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0010","list-style":"none"},"li":"In compound 56, substituent \u2014CHRR=a group within the scope of Ras defined in formula I or a group that can be converted to R"}}}},"Scheme Q illustrates in the most generalized manner how compounds of type 57 can be elaborated to a variety of heterocyclic derivatives of structural formula 58 using known methods in organic synthesis.

Total binding was Compound A bound to membranes in the absence of competitor; non-specific binding was Compound A bound in the presence of 10 uM Compound B.
