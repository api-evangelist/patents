title: Photopolarimetric lidar dual-beam switching device and mueller matrix standoff detection system and method
abstract: An optomechanical switching device, a control system, and a graphical user interface for a photopolarimetric lidar standoff detection that employs differential-absorption Mueller matrix spectroscopy. An output train of alternate continuous-wave COlaser beams [ . . . L:L . . . ] is directed onto a suspect chemical-biological (CB) aerosol plume or the land mass it contaminates (S) vis-à-vis the OSD, with L [L] tuned on [detuned off] a resonant molecular absorption moiety of CB analyte. Both incident beams and their backscattered radiances from S are polarization-modulated synchronously so as to produce gated temporal voltage waveforms (scattergrams) recorded on a focus at the receiver end of a sensor (lidar) system. All 16 elements of the Mueller matrix (M) of S are measured via digital or analog filtration of constituent frequency components in these running scattergram data streams (phase-sensitive detection). A collective set of normalized elements {} (ratio to M) susceptible to analyte, probed on-then-off its molecular absorption band, form a unique detection domain that is scrutinized; i.e., any mapping onto this domain by incoming lidar data—by means of a trained neural network pattern recognition system for instance—cues a standoff detection event.

More particularly, the present invention relates to an optical switching device for use in a system for detecting and identifying target contaminants such as chemical or biological warfare materials (CBs), or simulants of such compounds at a distance, based on Mueller matrix spectroscopy.","Distant detection of chemical and\/or biological warfare materials and contaminates (CBs) is vitally important to joint force and homeland security operations. Once the presence of a CB is detected at a location, preventive measures may be taken prior to entering the area. Intensive research is being conducted to develop systems that are able to perform rapid and reliable detection and identification of CBs at safe standoff distances.","In general, CB standoff detectors receive electromagnetic energy radiated from a target and attempt to identify substances present at the target from characteristics of the radiated energy. Some systems are passive and rely solely on detection of target luminescence and\/or absorption\/emission spectra in the presence of ambient electromagnetic energy. Other systems actively probe a target with electromagnetic beams and analyze scattering radiant spectra to identify the substances present. While CB detection systems using electromagnetic energy ranging from terahertz and long-wave infrared bands to ultraviolet have been tried, middle infrared (MIR) light has been found to be particularly useful since spectral bands lying in the MIR region can be found in which there are distinctive absorption spectra for CB molecular structures (the so-called MIR \u201cfingerprint\u201d) and in which the natural atmosphere is essentially transparent. A variety of MIR CB sensing systems use scattered light to determine properties of CBs at a distance. While some systems measure only the intensity of backscattered light, others also attempt to collect and analyze polarization states to better characterize CB molecular structures.","One technique to obtain polarization data from backscattered light is differential absorption Mueller matrix spectroscopy (DIAMMS). A DIAMMS-based CB detection system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,060,710, issued on May 9, 2000 to Carrieri, et al. (\u201cthe '710 patent\u201d), incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth. In general, a DIAMMS system undertakes identification of unknown substances at a distance by probing a target surface or an aerosol cloud with at least two polarization-modulated middle infrared laser (MIR) beams. One beam (the \u201cexcitation\u201d beam) is tuned to a known absorption\/extinction wavelength for substances of interest to drive it into molecular vibrational resonance, and a second \u201creference\u201d beam is tuned to a nearby offset wavelength at which there is essentially no absorption by substances of interest and thus nil resonant molecular vibrations. A detector collects the backscattered polarization modulated radiation or \u201cscattergrams\u201d for both beams. The scattergrams are time varying waveforms which can be Fourier transformed to extract complex frequency components from which excitation and reference Mueller matrices can be derived. A differential Mueller matrix may then be calculated from the excitation and reference matrices and mathematically analyzed to compare it with differential Mueller matrix models of known substances.","Improvements in CB identification by differential-absorption Mueller matrix spectroscopy have been desired. In particular, there is a need for a robust, reliable, field-ready selective CB standoff identification system.","In accordance with one aspect, an Optical Switching Device (OSD) is employed to perform photopolarimeter beam switching functions in one or more embodiments of DIAMMS detection systems according to the present invention. In accordance with another aspect, a photopolarimetric lidar standoff detection system provides a plurality of laser beams, a plurality of spectrum analyzers and an OSD. The OSD provides means for configuring the system into a first mode of operation in which a first laser beam is directed to a first spectrum analyzer and a second laser beam is directed to a beam terminator; a means for configuring the system into a second mode of operation in which the first laser beam is directed to a beam terminator and the second laser beam is directed to a second spectrum analyzer; means for configuring the system into a third mode of operation in which the second laser beam is directed to a beam terminator and the first laser beam is directed to a backscatter surface; a means for configuring the system into a fourth mode of operation in which the first laser beam is directed to a beam terminator and the second laser beam is directed to a backscatter surface; and a means for configuring the system into a fifth mode of operation in which each of the laser beams are directed to a beam terminator.","In accordance with another aspect, a computer program includes instructions for operating a photopolarimetric lidar standoff detection system having an optical switching device, a plurality of laser beams and a plurality of spectrum analyzers. The program instructions include instructions to configure the optical switching device for a first mode of operation in which a first laser beam is directed to a first spectrum analyzer and a second laser beam is directed to a beam terminator. The program instructions also include instructions to configure the optical switching device for a second mode of operation in which the first laser beam is directed to a beam terminator and the second laser beam is to a second spectrum analyzer. The program instructions also include instructions to configure the optical switching device for a third mode of operation in which the second laser beam is directed to a beam terminator and the first laser beam is directed to a backscatter surface. The program instructions also include instructions to configure the optical switching device for a fourth mode of operation in which the first laser beam is directed to a beam terminator and the second laser beam is directed to a backscatter surface. The program instructions also include instructions to configure the optical switching device for a fifth mode of operation in which each of the laser beams are directed to a beam terminator.","In yet another aspect according to an embodiment of the present invention, the program instructions include instructions to provide a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI may include icons representing one or more components of the multiple beam photopolarimetric lidar standoff detection system. The GUI also may include objects to receive control inputs from an operator. The GUI also may include a display of status information for the one or more components of the multiple beam photopolarimetric lidar standoff detection system as well as a display of measurement data provided by the photopolarimetric lidar standoff detection system.","The polarization state of a light beam can be completely represented by a 1\u00d74 vector known as the Stokes vector. When a light beam is scattered by a body or changed by an optical element, the Stokes vector s of the light beam undergoes a linear transformation to a new Stokes vector s\u2032. This transformation can be represented by a 4\u00d74 matrix called the Mueller matrix (M), i.e., s\u2032=Ms. By definition, s and s\u2032 are parameterized in real terms of complex amplitude and phase of the beam's electric field (E-field) orthogonal components. Accordingly, since the Stokes vector contains all the polarization information for a beam of light, the Mueller matrix contains all the polarization information in an elastic scattering process. Moreover, M may be used to derive physical and geometrical properties to uniquely characterize S, where S has a complex refractive index N=\u03b7(\u03bb)+i\u03be(\u03bb) and polar-azimuth angle orientation dependencies \u03b8 and \u03c6, respectively, relative to the normal vector n of infinitesimal surface element dS and incident electromagnetic wave vector k.","A Jones (complex matrix

A typical scenario may include: (i) an ambient aerosol plume as generated from a detonated projectile or as released from an aircraft; and (ii) the aftermath surface contamination coverage when contaminated rain deposits and settles onto\/within terrain (e.g., soil, sand) or synthetic inhomogeneous dielectrics (e.g., asphalt, concrete).","In general, in the preferred embodiment according to the present invention, two polarization-modulated continuous-wave laser beams are tuned to nearby middle-infrared wavelengths in the region of absorption bands of the molecules of interest (i.e., 9.1-12.1 \u03bcm). These two beams are alternately transmitted in the form of a symmetric square wave-train [ . . . L:L . . . ]to a suspected surface contaminant or airborne aerosol analyte (S). L and L are preferably emitted by regular and isotopic COlaser waveguide cavities. Switching between beams is accomplished through a feedback controlled optomechanical switching device . The sent beams interrogate and target constituent CB molecules of surface\/mass S in the following manner: absorption of E-field by beam L, referred to as the \u2018analytic\u2019 probe laser beam, drives a bonded \u201cbackbone\u201d primary group of threat agent molecules into a fundamental rock, stretch, or wag resonance vibration mode while the E-field of alternate beam L, referred to as the \u201creference\u201d probe laser beam, is totally scattered since it is detuned completely off all absorption cross-sections of molecular target , thus relaxing the molecular vibration resonance state. Furthermore, the E-fields of beams L and L are each polarization-modulated at separate frequencies in the range of 30-100 KHz, in order to obtain two Mueller matrix responses from which a differential-absorption Mueller matrix response (\u0394M) from excited CB molecules is derived (L: vibration resonance mode, part laser beam scattering, part absorption, relative to L: off resonance relaxation mode, all laser beam scattering). Polarization-modulation actions on alternate incident and backscattering beams (which are performed independently on [ . . . L:L . . . ]and [ . . . L:L . . . ]) make possible the electronic measurement of a unique discriminate of the analyte; i.e., a susceptible group of differential-absorption Mueller matrix elements \u0394M.","The term \u201cpolarization-modulation\u201d is used in this disclosure in an optical encoding context. It entails the use of optical stress-birefringence elements to modulate the probe-interrogation laser beams sent to surface S as well as the backscattered beams received from surface S. This is accomplished in the preferred embodiment by means of two photoelastic modulation (PEM) operations induced on [ . . . L:L . . . ]and [ . . . L:L . . . ]beams via stress-birefringent crystals. The PEM modulators preferably employ infrared-transparent salt ZnSe crystals with anti-reflection coatings on the front and back planer surfaces (and other IR materials including a single-crystal Ge that is cleaved, polished, and coated, as would be known to those of skill in the art). An oscillatory birefringence is induced at opposite ends of the cleaved crystal across its symmetry plane. In the preferred embodiment, a bonded piezoelectric transducer element (T) drives the ZnSe slab, at opposite ends, into its natural mechanical resonant frequency. With the crystal in harmonic mechanical resonance, the components of the E-fields of laser beams L and L that are aligned along the slow or extraordinary axis (eo-axis) and center of crystal aperture experience a periodic phase delay in transmission expressed as: \u03b4=\u03b4cos \u03c9t, where \u03b4is the maximum amplitude of phase retardation in the beam's traversing electromagnetic wave (and the maximum compression of crystal), cos \u03c9t is the oscillatory phase delay, and \u03c9 is frequency of the transducer element driving the crystal's compression-relaxation action-reaction. There is essentially no delay in the orthogonal components of the E-fields of beams traversing the fast or ordinary axis of ZnSe crystal (o-axis, which is perpendicular to eo-axis of crystalline structure), i.e., \u03b4=0. This non-linear property of the crystal, \u03b4, is called stress-birefringence. Accordingly, orthogonal components of the E-field of an incident beam linearly polarized at 45\u00b0 to the PEM (i.e., exactly between eo- and o-axes of the crystal) add vectorally at the ZnSe-air exit plane producing polarization states that sweep in a continuum from left-to-right through linear, elliptical, and circular states at the frequency \u03c9[viz, photoelastic modulation (PEM) action]. Thus, surface target S experiences probe beams [ . . . L:L . . . ]with this periodic polarization continuum property. The backscattering response or echo in [ . . . L:L . . . ]is, furthermore, polarization-modulated a second time at a distinct frequency \u03c9by a separate PEM centered on-axis in a receiver end that includes optical elements with a detector\/sensor at the focus.","This combination of polarization modulations on incident beams and their backscattered radiances provides an electromagnetic encoding that makes possible a simultaneous measurement of M-elements of S, as described below.","Embodiments of DIAMMS-based photopolarimetric lidar (LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR)) systems according to the present invention preferably include a linear polarizer (Ge)-photoelastic modulator (ZnSe) mated optic pair (POL-PEM, (Polarizer-Photoelastic Modulator) mounted on a computer controlled precision rotary stage) which is positioned to intercept [ . . . L:L . . . ]just after that beam-train exits OSD . Systems further comprise another PEM-POL pair (also mounted on a precision computer controlled rotary stage) to intercept the backscattered radiance of the incident beams in the sensor's collector-receiver. (The optical order of linear polarizer and photoelastic modulation optics is reversed in the collector-receiver.) The POL-PEM:PEM-POL (transmitter:receiver) optical group or photopolarimeter with laser source beams L and L is called a Mueller matrix spectrometer (MMS) (not illustrated). The integrated electro-optic\/optomechanical apparatus and ancillary electronics, together with the software subsystems described below is referred to as a DIAMMS Photopolarimetric lidar standoff detection system.","An MIR detector D (also not illustrated) is positioned at the focus of the MMS receiver. Detector D preferably comprises a liquid Ncooled HgCdTe semiconductor detector chip (1\u00d71 mm, typically). The detector D produces a photocurrent referred to as a scattergram, provided that both ZnSe crystals of MMS are under active (and proper) transduction via their respective tensor (T) PEM circuits. This scattergram product manifests an intensity modulation of the form\n\n()\n\n","In embodiments according to the present invention, a digital data acquisition system is preferred for acquiring all elements Mas such, directly from the full temporal scattergram waveform (I). The digital data acquisition system preferably includes a high-speed serial vector network analyzer that samples I at 800 KHz or beyond (to eliminate aliasing).","There are 15 modulo 2 normalized differential M-elements {}=[M\u2032(\u03bb)\/M\u2032(\u03bb)\u2212M(\u03bb)\/M(\u03bb)] produced by the photopolarimeter, with the photopolarimetric lidar's switched-beams transmit and received wave-trains [ . . . L:L . . . ]; where M\u2032and Mdesignate the Mueller elements on-resonance (analytic beam L) and off-resonance (reference beam L) of analyte; respectively, and i,j1,2,3,4\u22601,1. A sample of these data sets for select crystalline amino acids and sugar compounds in wafer form\u2014the building blocks of proteins and precursors of biological warfare agents that the photopolarimetric lidar must ultimately detect, is provided in Table 3 of the '701 patent.","Success in identifying the chemical-biological (CB) target S, via pattern recognition from these DIAMMS data sets, requires mapping at least one (normalized) susceptible member element, from the full field of 15 in {}, onto the target S with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. The detection uniqueness picture becomes clearer, however, when more of the available 15-member {} DIAMMS elements show susceptible behavior to target (analyte, CB agent\/simulant, contaminant, and target are synonymous) as prompted by the polarization-modulated probe beams [ . . . L:L . . . ]causing the excite-then-relax molecular vibration activity in targeted molecules.","Several neural network models were built and trained-validated-tested against susceptible {} elements in the analyte's unique Mueller-domain space. Repeated training of a best-performance network model yielded an optimum weight matrix product. This weight matrix is essentially a collection of all parallel interneuron strengths between architectural layers of the network, and, may be deployed in the photopolarimetric lidar system as a passive pattern recognition filter accordingly. In particular, any mapping of real-time preprocessed DIAMMS data fed through the neural network's weight matrix and onto the Mueller domain-space of analyte would cue an alarm condition against that analytic compound. Some target CBs will need less than all differential-absorption Mueller matrix elements to be identified. Embodiments of systems according to the present invention may be configured to extract only those elements needed to identify certain target CBs.","In general, OSD  interfaces to a robust networked computer host system via standard I\/O interfaces, such as a pair of RS-232 serial ports, SP and SP (not illustrated), which are positioned on an electronics expansion box (not illustrated) supporting bidirectional computer OSD  data transfers. SP and SP provide status and control that monitor and control a series of precision, logical, translation and shunted actions on flat infrared mirror optics inside OSD , as described below. Although RS-232 interfaces are employed in this embodiment, other communications protocols and interfaces such as USB, RS-485, RS422, IEEE1394, Firewire, Ethernet, WiFi, and the like, may be implemented in alternative embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIGS. 1","i":["a","d ","a","d "],"b":["1","2","2","100","1","1","2","2","1","1","1","2","2","2","1","1","2"]},"As shown in -and -, a preferred embodiment of an OSD  includes a housing  that provides an optically sealed enclosure through which there are provided a number of input and output ports for passage of MIR light.

Class CDIAMMSDlg is multi-threaded such that information in the GUI widgets (operator-to-lidar interface) is retained. This information is embedded in subroutines which control scattergram acquisitions, the M-elements processed from those scattergrams, and the individual M-elements graphical display. Safety precautions are also implemented in this class; e.g., it is forbidden to call calibration routines (Cases W-W, -and -) when an M-elements measurement sequence is in progress (Cases MM-MM, -and -).

These include maintaining the required \u03b4=2.404 phase-retardation of beams' through feedback by the PEM's controller circuits, the synchronous gating of scattergram streams into digital or analog data acquisition channels, the electronic transfer\/storage of M-elements into computer memory, and the display of these data onto computer screen. Periods of dwell in beams [ . . . L:L . . . ] may, however, last upwards of a few minutes to perhaps an hour for laboratory experiments where time-series acquisition of M-elements is desired or necessary. (When resolving the dynamic relationships of M-elements by aerosols disseminated inside a chamber, at lengthy time intervals, for instance.)","How data is presented from a typical DIAMMS run is portrayed in , where each sector of the 4\u00d74 M array is populated via the \u2018Data Collected\u2019 portal , shown in the middle-right section of GUI . The coordinates (ordinate and abscissa) of all M-elements graphed, as shown, are inclusive of data set members {M\u2032(\u03bb)\/M\u2032(\u03bb)}, {M(\u03bb)\/M(\u03bb)} For illustrative purposes,  displays the susceptible M-elements of crystalline mannose and a racemic mixture of tartaric acid (targets S). Size of the susceptible M-elements, as shown, is bounded by standard deviation on respective data set members: {M\u2032(\u03bb)\/M\u2032(\u03bb)} and {M(\u03bb)\/M(\u03bb)}. Generally, in embodiments according to the present invention, these identification domain components with standard deviations (i.e., the intersection of horizontal and vertical solid lines in grids of ) provide decreased area with increased precision of measurement, decreased accumulative error of photopolarimeter optics (i.e., alignment, and stability of PEMs), and increased signal-to-noise ratio in the sensor's detector element photoconductive HgCdTe chip with amplifier).","The centroid of each domain component (i.e., cross-hairs, ) has coordinates [<{M\u2032(\u03bb)\/M\u2032(\u03bb)}>, <{M(\u03bb)\/M(\u03bb)}>], where the bracketed entity < > refers to the time-averaged experimental value per set M-element measurement. Preferred selection rules for ascertaining an analyte's unique identification domain components are as follows.","Selection rules are used to assure distinctness in the same Mueller matrix element data sets, on-then-off molecular resonance beam backscattering from the analyte by [ . . . L:L . . . ], as measured by the polarization lidar sensor. Selection Rule 1: {}\u2229{\u2032}=\u00d8. Select the same Mueller matrix element sets that move in opposite direction on-then-off molecular resonance beam backscattering from the analyte via [ . . . L:L . . . ]; i.e., check for an anti-correlation coefficient between like data sets as, Selection Rule 2: {}\u00b7{\u2032}<0. Choose only those elements with coordinates [{M\u2032(\u03bb)\/M\u2032(\u03bb)}, M(\u03bb)\/M(\u03bb)}] that lie furthest from the diagonal line in Mueller space (i.e., the 45\u00b0 line in each grid of ) in the following manner, Selection Rule 3: {[{<>}, {<\u2032>}]\u2200i,j\u2208[1,2,3,4] s.t. \u03c1\u2267\u2208}, where: the time average <>=<M(\u03bb)>\/<M(\u03bb)> is the on-resonance, normalized, backscattering Mueller element; <\u2032>=<M(\u03bb)>\/<M(\u03bb)> is the off-resonance, normalized, backscattering Mueller element; c is an arbitrarily-chosen scalar threshold quantity; \u03c1 is the Mueller element domain discriminate (also a scalar) given by \u03c1=|v|{cos [tan(<\u2032>\/<>)\u2212sin [tan(<\u2032>\/<>)]}\/2; v is the Mueller element vector from graphic origin to centroid (one per each grid of ), and the magnitude of this vector |v|=[>>+<>].",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["318","1","2"],"sub":["i,j","on","1,1","on","i,j","off","1,1","off","i,j ","i,j ","i,j","on","1,1","on","i,j","off","1,1","off"]},"As shown in , each display for a Mueller Matrix element data set includes an x-axis component represented by a horizontal dotted line that shows on resonance backscattering (beam L) and y axis component represented by a vertical dotted line that shows off resonance backscattering (beam L). The on and off resonance components are bounded by solid lines representing the standard deviation.","Embodiments of an OSD  according to the present invention may be integrated into a future prototype Chemical-Biological defense photopolarimetric lidar standoff detection system based on differential-absorption Mueller matrix spectroscopy (DIAMMS). The OSD  embodies logistics feedback to maintain: (1) switching integrity; (2) a failsafe modus operandi such that beams L and L are internally confined inside the OSD  whenever a systems error is identified during lidar runtime; and (3) synchronization of switching action to vital external functions including operation of two photoelastic modulators to provide photoelastic modulation of beams, retardation adjustment in the PEMs per beam wavelength in [ . . .
