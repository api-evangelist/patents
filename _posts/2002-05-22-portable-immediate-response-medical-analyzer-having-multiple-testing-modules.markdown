{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["The present application is a complete application claiming priority based on co-pending Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/053,406, filed Jul. 22, 1997 and entitled \u201cIMMEDIATE RESPONSE MEDICAL ANALYZER HAVING MULTIPLE TEST MODULES\u201d.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention is directed generally to a stationary or portable diagnostic system or electroanalytical systems for analyzing preselected characteristics of a patient's blood and other fluids. More particularly the present invention is concerned with a portable diagnostic device or analytic instrument that includes a plurality of test modules for analyzing various body fluids of a patient, wherein the modules are coupled to a common display, printer, power supply, and communication ports. The portable diagnostic device interfaces and utilizes disposable cartridges, reagent diagnostic test strips, or other means to determine, for example, a patient's blood pH, pO, pCO, Na, Ca, K, hematocrit, glucose and\/or other parameters including oxygen saturation, coagulation or hemoglobin fractions. The modules may determine the parameters through a variety of methods such as electrochemical, electrical, optical, or mechanical analysis of a fluid biological sample extracted from the patient. The disposable cartridge may utilize a bank of sensors for the pertinent electroactive species to provide input in the form of analog electrical signals for the relevant determinations.","II. Related Art","During clinical, surgical, diagnostic and other medical procedures the measurement of certain physical\/chemical characteristics or conditions of the blood and other fluids of a patient are useful in order to evaluate the condition of a patient. For example, a patient's blood pH, pO, pCO, Na, Ca, K, hematocrit, glucose and other parameters including oxygen saturation coagulation or hemoglobin fractions may be measured. These conditions may provide important indications of the patient's stability including, for example, the efficiency of the blood\/gas exchange occurring in the lungs of the patient, the relative acid\/base balance, or the concentration of certain indicative ion species in the blood. Such determinations are particularly useful in emergency circumstances.","In the past, the equipment provided to make such determinations has typically been complex and permanently installed in a hospital laboratory. Also, the user operating the equipment has been oftentimes required to be a highly-trained and skilled technician, which thereby increases the cost of operating the equipment and limits the number of potential users. With such equipment, in order to analyze a sample of fluid from the patient, a sample must be drawn from the patient and delivered to the laboratory, avoiding all external contacts.","During the transfer and delivery, the drawn fluids may be kept in close proximity to ice packs in order to maintain sample integrity. The sample is then injected into a designated receptacle of the diagnostic equipment and the equipment operated to perform the diagnostics on the sample. This procedure is time consuming, labor intensive, and usually disadvantageous in the operating room, emergency room or other area of the hospital, or outside the hospital where time is of the essence. Hence, portable devices that reduce the time required to make accurate blood-gas and related determinations, in order that proper and more timely corrective steps may be taken, are highly sought.","Many situations arise where it is impractical to deliver a patient's fluid sample to a hospital laboratory in order to analyze the patient's blood analytes. It would be desirable for paramedics and in-home health care providers, for example, to analyze a sample at the point of collection without having to first deliver a sample to a hospital laboratory. To this end, it would also be desirable to provide a single portable diagnostic device capable of analyzing simultaneously several samples and\/or conducting several electrochemical, electrical, optical, or mechanical analysis simultaneously or in rapid succession to determine, a patient's blood pH, pO, pCO, Na, Ca, K, hematocrit, glucose and other parameters including oxygen saturation, coagulation or hemoglobin fractions.","There have been attempts at point-of-care blood-gas analysis. One on-site analytic device, described by Enzer et al in U.S. Pat. No. 4,786,394, is designed for direct connection to a heart\/lung machine to monitor critical blood gases during open-heart surgery. It employs a discardable sensor cartridge which contains a bank of sensors for making the electrochemical determinations. A further patent to Enzer et al (U.S. Pat. No. 4,397,725) also discloses a clinical blood chemistry analyzer in which a discardable cartridge interfaces with an analytical machine. Although the analyzer may be utilized on-site during surgery, the device disclosed by Enzer remains relatively stationary and immobile. Morris et al in U.S. Pat. No. 5,325,853 (of common assignment with the present invention) disclose a self-calibrating disposable sensor system.","Carter et al in U.S. Pat. No. 5,628,890 describe an electrochemical sensor for measuring the glucose concentration in a patient's blood. Such a sensor is limited to the particular analyte being measured and requires an interface with an electrochemical sensor. Stark in U.S. Pat. No. 5,433,197 describes a non-invasive glucose measurement device that requires illumination of the patient's eye with near infrared radiation. The capability of the Stark device is limited to determining blood glucose. Phillips et al in U.S. Pat. No. 5,563,042 describe a device that measures glucose concentration in whole blood optically using a reflective reading apparatus and a whole blood glucose test strip.","A further reference is contained in U.S. Pat. No. 4,849,340 to Oberhardt discloses a device that measures coagulation in whole blood using a liquid assay device and method.","Although somewhat useful, such devices are limited in application and address only part of the drawbacks of prior systems. There remains a need for a rapidly responding, portable blood chemistry analytical device. A need also exists for a single, portable, self-calibrating, instant activation, rapid response diagnostic device capable of simultaneous analysis of several samples and\/or conducting several electrochemical, electrical, optical, or mechanical analysis simultaneously or in rapid succession to determine, blood pH, pO, pCO, Na, Ca, K, hematocrit, glucose and other parameters including oxygen saturation, coagulation or hemoglobin fractions. The present invention meets these needs and overcomes the disadvantages of prior devices.","The present invention provides a point-of-care medical analyzer that enables an operator without special training or skills to obtain rapid, accurate blood-gas, glucose, and other analyte determinations at the time and location the sample is drawn. The device is compact, light-weight, easily transported and ready for immediate use. The analyzer is designed for rapid processing of electrical signals generated by electrochemical, electrical, optical, or mechanical sensors of an associated module having both calibration and sample determination modes and utilizing one-time use or disposable cartridges. The modules may be removed from the analytic device and interchanged.","The plug-in disposable electrochemical sensor cartridge which may be similar to that depicted in the above-cited U.S. Pat. No. 5,325,853, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose, employs an array of sensors, typically a bank of aligned sensors on a ceramic chip in a flow-through chamber. The flow-through chamber, as packaged, further contains a calibration medium retained in situ with respect to corresponding sensors to be calibrated such that when the disposable cartridge is activated in conjunction with insertion into and electrical connection with the analytical device, calibration signals are produced by the sensors on the disposable cartridge which enables immediate automatic calibration of the sensors. The sample may thereafter be introduced through an entry port in a manner which causes the calibration medium to be displaced from the flow-through chamber and replaced by the blood or other fluid sample then in direct contact with the sensors. The array of electrochemical sensors then produces electrical signals in accordance with the characteristics of the sample.","The disposable sample cartridge carries a heater in the form of a thin or thick film resistor carried on the sensor chip itself designed to bring the sample quickly to the temperature desired for the analytic determination based on an optical sensor and remote control from within the analytical device. Such a system is depicted in Hieb et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,232,667, assigned to the same assignee as the present invention, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. Once the desired temperature is reached, the electrical signals from the electrochemical sensors are received and processed by the portable analyzer and the results made available on a display and\/or in printed form. Other suitable \u201ccartridges\u201d are used in association with the other modules.","It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the analytical instrument is required to provide only the signal processing systems for calibration and measurement. The remote temperature sensing and control system provided in the portable instrument, for example, controls only the electric input to a heater located in the disposable cartridge. There is no heating system, per se, in the analytical instrument. The heating control system preferably includes an IR probe or other remote temperature sensing device which is used in association with a programmed control or set point temperature to rapidly establish and maintain the desired temperature in the disposable cartridge. Further details of the temperature control arrangement are contained in the above-referenced patent issued to Hieb et al (U.S. Pat. No. 5,232,667).","In operation, the fully portable analytical instrument is brought to the point of sampling, i.e., the location of the patient. A predetermined number of disposable cartridges are removed from a temperature-stabilized packaging and inserted or plugged into corresponding modules of the analyzer. The instrument is activated; the sensors are calibrated automatically and the calibration electronically compensated with respect to an ensuing set of measurement signals. A sample of interest is obtained from the patient and a portion may immediately be transferred to the sample inlet port of the calibrated sensor system on each disposable cartridge. The sample displaces the calibration medium to a storage chamber and avails the electrochemical sensors for an immediate sensing of the corresponding species of interest in the sample. Other types of sensors including electrochemically active reagent test strips may be exposed to the sample and inserted into a corresponding module.","The user determines the particular needs for testing and determines which modules to attach to the base unit of the immediate response medical analyzer. Plugging the disposable cartridges and inserting relevant sample strips into the respective module of the portable medical analyzer activates the system. The activation of the system also activates the temperature control system which maintains the sensor chip, or equivalent, at the desired calibration and analysis temperature for those determinations that require temperature control. If the sample within the cartridge is at a different temperature, the temperature control system reacts quickly and controls the sensors to restore the desired temperature to the system. Of course, some determinations, including glucose measurement, do not require temperature control.","After the determinations have achieved equilibrium and the corresponding signals have been read by the analyzer, the analyzer computes the results based on the sensor outputs. The results are made immediately available on a combination touch screen LCD display and as a printed record using an integral printer. It is anticipated that the entire operation from first insertion of the cartridges and activation of the system until printout of the results, assuming the immediate availability of the sample, can be achieved in less than three minutes. In addition to the rapid availability, the results are also stored by the device in memory for later retrieval by touch screen, printer or to be sent via a communications port to an external or remote computer or laboratory.","It is accordingly a principal object of the present invention to provide a portable, rapidly responding, point-of-care medical device having several modules capable of independently determining a plurality of predetermined analytes from a fluid biological sample.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a rapidly responding, portable medical analytical instrument capable of interfacing with several self-contained, self-calibrating, or pre-calibrated, disposable fluid sample devices of varying construction.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a portable sophisticated medical analyzer capable of simplistic user friendly operation.","A further object of the invention is to provide a self-contained point-of-care blood analyte analyzer capable of instant activation and almost immediate response in determining a patient's blood pH, pO, pCO, Na, Ca, K, hematocrit, glucose and other parameters including oxygen saturation, coagulation or hemoglobin fraction.","The present invention includes a point-of-care and immediate response portable medical analyzer that features automated calibration and analysis for a variety of uses. The analyzer includes several interchangeable modules that allow the user to analyze several samples or analyze one sample for several predetermined criteria at the point-of-care without extended delays. Thus blood-gas analysis results can be made available to the attending physician, surgeon, or other health care provider within a minute or two after the drawing of a sample. Moreover, it takes no particular skill to operate the portable medical analyzer inasmuch as both calibration and sample analysis have been automated in conjunction with a unique self-calibrating system. A disposable plug-in cartridge unit interfaces with the medical analyzing device or a reagant strip is automatically interfaced with an output system. While the illustrated embodiments described below are directed to blood-gas and blood-electrolyte analysis, it will occur to those skilled in the art that these are meant as examples and are in no way intended to introduce limitations to the scope of the invention and that the system can be adapted to other analyses involving blood or other body sera without departing from the essential premises of the invention. It will be appreciated from the views of  that one advantage of the portable analyzer of the invention is that it is mechanically simple and eliminates the need for medical personal to transport samples to a plurality of diagnostic analyzers.","With this in mind attention is directed first to  where a portable analytic device in accordance with the present invention is shown generally at .
