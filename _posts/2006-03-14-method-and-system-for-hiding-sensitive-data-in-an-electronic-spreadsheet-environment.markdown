title: Method and system for hiding sensitive data in an electronic spreadsheet environment
abstract: A method and system for hiding sensitive data in an electronic spreadsheet. A first output equation expresses output data as a function of at least one first input data and at least one first intermediary result. The at least one first and second intermediary result are assigned as content of intermediary cells of the spreadsheet. A second output equation is generated and expresses the output data as a function of a subset of the at least one first and second input data with no functional dependence on the plurality of intermediary results. Generation of the second output equation utilizes the first output equation and the plurality of first intermediary equations. The output data of the second output equation is assigned as content of an output cell of the spreadsheet. The content of the intermediary cells is removed, resulting in the plurality of intermediary results not being identifiable in the spreadsheet.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. Technical Field","The present invention is directed to the field of electronic spreadsheets and more particularly to a method, system and computer program for hiding sensitive data within models in an electronic spreadsheet environment.","2. Related Art","Before computers, numerical analyses, particularly financial ones, were usually prepared on an accountant's columnar pad or spreadsheet, with pencil and calculator in hand. By organizing data into columns and rows, spreadsheets afford the rapid assimilation of information by a reader. The task of preparing a spreadsheet on paper, however, is not quite so fast. Instead, the process tends to be very slow, as each entry must be tediously calculated and entered into the spreadsheet. Manually prepared spreadsheets are also prone to errors. Hence, preparation of spreadsheets by hand is slow, tedious, and unreliable.","With the advent of microcomputers, a solution was forthcoming in the form of \u201celectronic spreadsheets.\u201d Better known simply as \u201cspreadsheets,\u201d these software programs provide a computerized replacement for the traditional financial modeling tools: the accountant's columnar pad, pencil, and calculator. In some regards, spreadsheet programs are to those tools what word processors are to typewriters. Spreadsheets offer dramatic improvements in ease of creating, editing, and using financial models.","A typical spreadsheet program configures the memory of a computer to resemble the column\/row or grid format of an accountant's columnar pad, thus providing a visible calculator for a user. Because this \u201cpad\u201d exists dynamically in the computer's memory, however, it differs from paper pads in several important ways. Locations in the electronic spreadsheet, for example, must be communicated to the computer in a format which it can understand. A common scheme for accomplishing this is to assign a number to each row in a spreadsheet, and a letter to each column. To reference a location at column A and row 1 (i.e., the upper-left-hand corner), the user types in \u201cA1\u201d. In this manner, the spreadsheet defines an addressable storage location or \u201ccell\u201d at each intersection of a row with a column.","Data entry into an electronic spreadsheet occurs in much the same manner that information would be entered on an accountant's pad. After a screen cursor is positioned at a desired location, the user can enter alphanumeric information. Besides holding text and numeric information, however, spreadsheet cells can store special instructions or \u201cformulas\u201d specifying calculations to be performed on the numbers stored in spreadsheet cells. In this fashion, cell references can serve as variables in an equation, thereby allowing precise mathematical relationships to be defined between cells. The structure and operation of a spreadsheet program, including advanced functions such as functions and macros, are documented in the technical, trade, and patent literature. For an overview, see e.g., Cobb, S., 2, Borland-OsborneIMcGraw-Mll, 1990; and LeBlond, G. and Cobb, D., 1-2-3, Que corp., 1985. The disclosures of each of the foregoing are hereby incorporated by reference.","Electronic spreadsheets offer many advantages over their paper counterparts. For one, electronic spreadsheets are much larger (i.e., hold more information) than their paper counterparts; electronic spreadsheets having thousands or even millions of cells are not uncommon. Spreadsheet programs also allow users to perform \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios. After a set of computational relationships has been entered into a worksheet, thanks to imbedded formulas for instance, the spread of information can be recalculated using different sets of assumptions, with the results of each recalculation appearing almost instantaneously. Performing this operation manually, with paper and pencil, would require the recalculation of every relationship in the model with each change made. Electronic spreadsheet systems are well suited to solve \u201cwhat-if\u201d problems, that is, changing an input and seeing what happens to an output.","Electronic spreadsheets are commonly used for implementing costing and pricing tools, typically for service oriented offerings. Such tools are simply an implementation of a model (either a costing model or a pricing model) featuring a set of output data, based on a set of input data.","Costing\/pricing models can be quite complex and the resulting spreadsheet tool can also be complex, involving a large number of formulas spreading across different sheets. Such formulas involve intermediary results, themselves involving either input data or other intermediary data. If a costing\/pricing tool spreadsheet is disclosed to a person, this person can easily \u201creverse engineer\u201d this tool to determine all the different intermediary results which are part of the model. Such intermediary results can contain confidential information that the costing\/pricing tool spreadsheet author does not want to share with third parties. Nevertheless the costing\/pricing tool spreadsheet author may want to share a tool which produces the output data when fed with the input data.","A typical example corresponding to this case is the following. Assume that a company X is currently delivering an offering through direct sales channel, and wants to rely on indirect channels, like business partners, to reach a wider opportunity base. If an internal cost\/price model is disclosed to a business partner, then this business partner will easily access information that this company X refuses to disclose. On the contrary, every effort must be done by the company X to give to this business partner all the relevant tools streamlining the sales cycle, such as a costing\/pricing tool.","This dilemma cannot be solved with conventional spreadsheet tools, since spreadsheet protection can easily be broken by cracks available on the Internet.","The present invention provides a computer-implemented method for hiding sensitive data in an electronic spreadsheet, wherein a first output equation expresses an output data as a function of at least one first input data and at least one first intermediary result, wherein a plurality of first intermediary equations relates the at least one first intermediary result to at least one second intermediary result and at least one second input data, wherein a plurality of input data denotes the at least one first input data and the at least one second input data collectively, wherein a plurality of intermediary results denote the at least one first intermediary result and the at least one second intermediary result collectively, said method comprising:","assigning the plurality of intermediary results as content of intermediary cells of the spreadsheet;","generating a second output equation that expresses the output data as a function of a subset of the plurality of input data with no functional dependence on the plurality of intermediary results, said generating the second output equation utilizing the first output equation and the plurality of first intermediary equations;","assigning the output data of the second output equation as content of an output cell of the spreadsheet; and","after said assigning the output data, removing the content of the intermediary cells, resulting in the plurality of intermediary results not being identifiable in the spreadsheet.","The present invention provides a computer program stored in a memory of a computer system, said computer program comprising instructions that when executed by a processor of a computer system implement a method for hiding sensitive data in an electronic spreadsheet, wherein a first output equation expresses an output data as a function of at least one first input data and at least one first intermediary result, wherein a plurality of first intermediary equations relates the at least one first intermediary result to at least one second intermediary result and at least one second input data, wherein a plurality of input data denotes the at least one first input data and the at least one second input data collectively, wherein a plurality of intermediary results denote the at least one first intermediary result and the at least one second intermediary result collectively, said method comprising:","assigning the plurality of intermediary results as content of intermediary cells of the spreadsheet;","generating a second output equation that expresses the output data as a function of a subset of the plurality of input data with no functional dependence on the plurality of intermediary results, said generating the second output equation utilizing the first output equation and the plurality of first intermediary equations;","assigning the output data of the second output equation as content of an output cell of the spreadsheet; and","after said assigning the output data, removing the content of the intermediary cells, resulting in the plurality of intermediary results not being identifiable in the spreadsheet.","The present invention provides a computer system comprising a processor and a memory coupled to the processor, said memory containing instructions that when executed by the processor implement a method for hiding sensitive data in an electronic spreadsheet, wherein a first output equation expresses an output data as a function of at least one first input data and at least one first intermediary result, wherein a plurality of first intermediary equations relates the at least one first intermediary result to at least one second intermediary result and at least one second input data, wherein a plurality of input data denotes the at least one first input data and the at least one second input data collectively, wherein a plurality of intermediary results denote the at least one first intermediary result and the at least one second intermediary result collectively, said method comprising:","assigning the plurality of intermediary results as content of intermediary cells of the spreadsheet;","generating a second output equation that expresses the output data as a function of a subset of the plurality of input data with no functional dependence on the plurality of intermediary results, said generating the second output equation utilizing the first output equation and the plurality of first intermediary equations;","assigning the output data of the second output equation as content of an output cell of the spreadsheet; and","after said assigning the output data, removing the content of the intermediary cells, resulting in the plurality of intermediary results not being identifiable in the spreadsheet.","The following description is presented to enable one or ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and is provided in the context of a patent application and its requirements. Various modifications to the preferred embodiment and the generic principles and features described herein will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiment shown but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features described herein.","The method and system of the present invention provides, within an electronic spreadsheet, a tool implementing a costing\/pricing model: giving to the tool user a limited visibility on the model internals, while maintaining full control of all the parameters, including the model data, for the tool author.","The method and system of the present invention specifies within an electronic spreadsheet, the cells containing either an output data, or a scope data or a model data.","The method and system of the present invention builds an internal table representing a sequence of intermediary results establishing a set of hierarchical relationships between the output data and both the scope and model data.","The method and system of the present invention establishes a relationship tying directly the output data from the scope and model data.","The method and system of the present invention specifies which model data is to be hidden.","The method and system of the present invention establishes a relationship tying directly the output data from the scope data and from the not hidden model data.","The method and system of the present invention removes cells referencing either intermediary results or hidden model data, so that the resulting electronic spreadsheet file only comprises the output data, the scope data and the not hidden model data.","The following description comprises the sections:\n\n","As shown in , the present invention may be embodied on a computer system  comprising a central processor , a main memory , an input\/output controller , a keyboard , a pointing device  (e.g., mouse, track ball, pen device, or the like), a display device , and a mass storage  (e.g., hard disk). Additional input\/output devices, such as a printing device , may be included in the system  as desired. As illustrated, the various components of the system  communicate through a system bus  or similar architecture.","Illustrated in , a computer software system  is provided for directing the operation of the computer system . Software system , which is stored in system memory  and on disk memory , includes a kernel or operating system  and a shell or interface . One or more application programs, such as application software , may be \u201cloaded\u201d (i.e., transferred from storage  into memory ) for execution by the system . The system  receives user commands and data through user interface ; these inputs may then be acted upon by the system  in accordance with instructions from operating module  and\/or application module . The interface , which may be a graphical user interface (GUI), also serves to display results, whereupon the user may supply additional inputs or terminate the session. In one embodiment, operating system  and interface  are Microsoft Win95, available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. Application module , on the other hand, includes a spreadsheet notebook of the present invention as described in further detail herein below.","2. Interface","The following description will focus on the embodiments of the present invention, which are embodied in spreadsheet applications operative in the Microsoft Windows environment. The present invention, however, is not limited to any particular application or any particular environment. Instead, those skilled in the art will find that the system and methods of the present invention may be advantageously applied to a variety of system and application software, including database management systems, word processors, and the like. Moreover, the present invention may be embodied on a variety of different platforms, including Macintosh, UNIX, NextStep, and the like. Therefore, the description of the exemplary embodiments which follows is for purposes of illustration and not limitation.","Referring now to , the system  includes a windowing interface or workspace . Window  is a rectangular, graphical user interface (GUI) for display on screen ; additional windowing elements may be displayed in various sizes and formats (e.g., tiled or cascaded), as desired. At the top of window  is a menu bar  with a plurality of user-command choices, each of which may invoke additional submenus and software tools for use with application objects. Window  includes a client area  for displaying and manipulating screen objects, such as graphic object  and text object . In essence, the client area is a workspace or view port for the user to interact with data objects which reside within the computer system .","Windowing interface  includes a screen cursor or pointer  for selecting and otherwise invoking screen objects of interest. In response to user movement, signals from the pointing device , the cursor  floats (i.e., freely moves) across the screen  to a desired screen location. During or after cursor movement, the user may generate user-event signals (e.g., mouse button \u201cclicks\u201d and \u201cdrags\u201d) for selecting and manipulating objects, as is known in the art. For example, Window  may be closed, resized, or scrolled by \u201cclicking\u201d (selecting) screen components , \/, and \/, respectively.","In one embodiment, screen cursor  is controlled with a mouse device. Single-button, double-button, or triple-button mouse devices are available from a variety of vendors, including Apple Computer of Cupertino, Calif., Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., and Logitech Corporation of Fremont, Calif., respectively. The screen cursor control device  may be a two-button mouse device, including both right and left \u201cmouse buttons.\u201d","Programming techniques and operations for mouse devices are well documented in the programming and hardware literature; see e.g., , Microsoft Press, 1989. The general construction and operation of a GUI event-driven system, such as Windows, is also known in the art: see, e.g., Petzold, C., , Second Edition, Microsoft Press, 1990. The disclosures of each are hereby incorporated by reference.","Shown in , a spreadsheet notebook interface of the present invention will now be described The spreadsheet notebook or workbook of the present invention includes a notebook workspace  for receiving, processing, and presenting information, including alphanumeric as well as graphic information. Notebook workspace  includes a menu bar , a toolbar , a current cell indicator , an input line , a status line , and a notebook window . The menu bar  displays and invokes, in response to user inputs, a main level of user commands. Menu  also invokes additional pull down menus, as is known in windowing applications. Input line  accepts user commands and information for the entry and editing of cell contents, which may include data, formulas, macros, and the like. Indicator  displays an address for the current cursor (i.e., active cell) position. At the status line , system  displays information about the current state of the workbook; for example, a \u201cREADY\u201d indicator means that the system is ready for the user to select another task to be performed.","The toolbar , shown in further detail in , comprises a row or palette of tools which provide a quick way for the user to choose commonly-used menu commands or properties. In an exemplary embodiment, toolbar  includes file manipulation buttons , printing buttons , an undo button , cut, copy, and paste buttons , information pop-up window buttons tool , a range selection button , a style copy button , a column resizing button , and a sum button . The functions of these buttons are suggested by their names. For instance, buttons  cut, copy and paste data and objects to and from Windows' clipboard. The same actions are also available as corresponding commands in the Edit menu (available from menu bar ).","The notebook, which provides an interface for entering and displaying information of interest, includes a plurality of spreadsheet pages. Each page may include conventional windowing features and operations, such as moving, resizing, and deleting. In a preferred embodiment, the notebook includes 256 spreadsheet pages, all of which are saved as a single disk file on the mass storage . Workspace  may display one or more notebooks, each sized and positioned (e.g., tiled, overlapping, and the like) according to user-specified constraints.","Each spreadsheet page of a notebook includes a 2-D spread. Page A from the notebook , for example, includes a grid in row and column format, such as row 3 and column F. At each row\/column intersection, a box or cell (e.g., cell C4) is provided for entering, processing, and displaying information in a conventional manner. Each cell is addressable, with a selector being provided for indicating a currently active one (i.e., the cell that is currently selected).","As shown in , individual notebook pages are identified by page identifiers , preferably located along one edge of a notebook. In one embodiment, each page identifier is in the form of a tab member (e.g., members , , ) situated along a top edge of the notebook. Each tab member may include representative indicia, such as textual or graphic labels, including user selected titles representing the contents of a corresponding page. In , the tab members  are set to their respective default names. For example, the first three tab members (members , , ) are respectively set to A, B, and C. Tab members are typically given descriptive names provided by the user, however. As shown in , for example, the first three tab members have now been set to \u201cContents\u201d (tab member ), \u201cSummary\u201d (tab member ), and \u201cJan\u201d (tab member ). In a similar manner, the remaining tabs are set to subsequent months of the year. In this manner, the user associates the page identifiers with familiar tabs from an ordinary paper notebook. Thus, the user already knows how to select a page or spread of interest: simply select the tab corresponding to the page (as one would do when selecting a page from a paper notebook).","In addition to aiding in the selection of an appropriate page of information, the user-customizable page identifiers serve aid in the entry of spreadsheet formulas. For example, when entering a formula referring to cells on another page, the user may simply use the descriptive page name in the formula itself (as described herein infra), thus making it easier for the user to understand the relationship of the cell(s) or information being referenced.","A general description of the features and operation of the spreadsheet notebook interface may be found in Quattro Pro for Windows (), available from Borland International.","3. Hiding Sensitive Data","In embodiments described infra, a single output data is provided by the model under study. For real cases where several output data are featured, the model can be considered as a collection of different models, where each of them specifies a single output data.","The input data comprises scope data and model data. Scope data is specific to a quotation and quantifies the scope of service to be delivered (e.g., the number of objects to be managed for a remote management offering). Model data specifies parameters which are not scope dependent, but rather are model dependent (e.g., a labour rate, giving the hourly cost for a person with a given skill level).","The following notation and naming conventions are utilized herein.","OD corresponds to the output data.","{SD} corresponds to the set of scope data. Here it is assumed that several of these scope data are part of the model under study. Scope data is identified by an index i.","{MD} corresponds to the set of model data. Here it is assumed that several of these model data are part of the model under study. Model data is identified by an index j.","{IR} corresponds to the set of intermediary results. Here it is assumed that several of these intermediary results are part of the model under study. Intermediary results are identified by an index k.","The different relationships defined between the above data correspond to the different formulas found within the electronic spreadsheet cells hosting these data. These relationships are also formally represented by mathematical functions, as follows:\n\n()\u2003\u2003(1)\n","All the available input data ({SD} and {MD}) are not necessarily present in the above formula. The same remark also applies for the formula translating the relationship defining the intermediary data (see infra).\n\n()\u2003\u2003(2)\n","It is assumed that there is no circular reference (that is a data which is a function of itself) in the electronic spreadsheet; thus some intermediary results are such that:\n\n()\u2003\u2003(3)\n","Thus, the intermediary results in equation (3) rely only on the input data. Equations (1), (2), and (3) will be referred to as equations of category (1), (2), and (3), respectively.","Accordingly, the set of relationships can be formalized through a tree structure, as shown in . The tree structure in  defines a hierarchy between a lowest level, corresponding to the output data OD , and arbitrarily set to 1, and a highest level corresponding to an intermediary result which is the deeper in the sequence of antecedents. Within the case illustrated by the , a first intermediary result IR is at level 2, while the level 3 corresponds to a second intermediary result IR, to a scope data SD and to a model data MD. Conventional techniques, not described herein, are available to assign such levels.","The present invention relies on computer algebra along the following sequence of steps A, B, C, and D.\n\n","This can be done by recursively replacing in each equation of category (2), IR=F(SD, MD, IR), each argument IRby the corresponding equation of either category (2) IR, =F(SD, MD, IR) or category (3) IR=F(SD, MD). For instance, if each argument IRis replaced by an equation of category (2), IR=F(SD, MD, IR), the step will comprise building the following relationships IR=F(SD, MD, F(SD, MD, IR). In the present case, all the resulting equations are of category (2). The next step comprises replacing each argument IRof each equation of category (2) by an equation either of category (2) or (3). This iterative process ends when each argument can be defined by an equation of category (3) and when the output data can be represented in an equation of category (4).","If each argument IRis replaced by an equation of category (3), IR=F(SD, MD), the step comprises building the following relationships IR=F(SD, MD, F(SD, MD)) which are equations of category (3). The next step comprises replacing in equation of category (1) all the arguments IRby the corresponding equations of category (3) to obtain an equation of category (4).","If at least one argument IRis replaced by an equation of category (2), IR=F(SD, MD, IR), at least one of the resulting equations will be of category (2). The next step comprises replacing each argument IRof each equation of category (2) by an equation either of category (2) or (3). This iterative process ends when each argument can be defined by an equation of category (3) and when the output data can be represented in an equation of category (4).\n\n","The resulting new formula (5) OD=F(SD) supersedes the set of formulas corresponding to the equations (1), (2) and (3). These equations (1), (2) and (3) can be simply removed from the electronic spreadsheet file by deleting the content of the corresponding cells. Obviously the resulting data needs to be recorded in a new file, to avoid the loss of the root information made by the equations (1), (2) and (3).","Computer algebra is today a well known technique, available either within commercial product such as \u201cMaple\u201d, \u201cMathematica\u201d, \u201cMatLab\u201d, and \u201cMuPad\u201d, or as sharewares like \u201cYacas\u201d. Such techniques are available in tools that can be easily interfaced by office applications, such as electronic spreadsheets, due to industry standard Application Programming Interfaces which can be invoked by macros. The present invention does not assume one particular tool related to formula simplification (e.g., through factorization techniques) or formula evaluation, since most of the available tools share a wide range of similar functions which fit the needs of the present invention.","4.

the present example, the first two steps A and B, as previously described, are performed as follows, starting with the equation of highest level 12, that is \u201ccoef(1)=1\u201d, followed down to

Flow Chart of Methodology",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0118"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"At step , the spreadsheet user is prompted to specify the cell which comprises the Output Data OD. If a single output data is produced by the model, then a single cell must be specified within the electronic spreadsheet file. For a model producing a plurality of output data, the present method can be repeated for each individual output data.","At step , the spreadsheet user is prompted to specify the cells corresponding to the Scope Data {SD}","At step , the spreadsheet user is prompted to specify the cells corresponding to the Model Data {MD}","At step , an Intermediary Result Table (IRT) is created to record the set of intermediary results IR in the spreadsheet and to link the output data with both the Scope Data and the Model Data. This IRT is made of a collection of records, each record comprising the following fields: a Cell Address (CA) field, but if the cell is named then the cell name can replaces the cell address; a Cell Type (CT) field; a Cell Level (CL) field; Cell Content (CC) field.","The IRT is built by starting with the first record corresponding to the output data, where the Cell Level defaults to 1. The creation of the following records comprises the steps of: parsing the formulas of the CC (Cell Content) field of already existing records; and identifying in the parsed formulas, variables which are neither a SD (Scope Data) nor a MD (Model Data). Such variables correspond to Intermediary Results (IR). For each created record corresponding to a given IR, the value given to the CL (Cell Level) field is equal to the highest value of the CL field of the parent IR, incremented by 1. This process completes when for all the created records, the formula points to variables which are either SD or MD or recorded IR.","The table of  is an example of an IRT.","At step , the computer algebra engine is fed with the formulas comprised in the CC fields of the IRT in order to build a formula of type (4) OD=F(SD, MD). This is also done iteratively by starting feeding the computer algebra engine with the formulas CC of highest CL, and simplifying the last fed CC. This sequence of steps is illustrated in the previous example.","At step , the resulting formula built by the computer algebra engine is recorded in a cell of the spreadsheet file, for instance within a cell previously void, or as a new version of the cell previously containing OD (Output Data).","At step , the electronic spreadsheet user is prompted to specify which are the MD (Model Data) which need to be hidden. This can be done through conventional user interface techniques, such as pop-up windows and dialog box, or this can even be reduced to a void step, assuming by default that all the MD must be hidden (if it is not the case, then an input data is specified as Scope data in step ).","At step , the hidden MD are replaced by their values, within the formula recorded at step .","At step , the computer algebra engine is fed with this formula (where hidden MD are replaced by their values) for simplification.","At step , the simplified formula returned by the computer algebra engine is recorded in a cell of the spreadsheet file, with the same approach as for step .","At step , all the IR (intermediary result) cells (including obviously the original OD cell) and all the hidden MD cells are removed from the electronic spreadsheet file.","At step , the user is prompted for renaming and saving the resulting updated file.","6. Particular Embodiment","In a conventional costing\/pricing tool, end users can easily determine all the different intermediary results which are part of the model. Such intermediary results can contain confidential information (typically the model data) that the costing\/pricing tool spreadsheet author does not want to share with third parties. Nevertheless the author may want to share a tool which produces the output data when fed with the scope data.","The present invention can be advantageously used to share a costing\/pricing model with third parties without disclosing intermediary results can contain confidential information (typically the model data).","For instance a company X is currently delivering an offering through direct sales channel, and wants to rely on indirect channels, like business partners, to reach a wider opportunity base. With the present invention, it is possible to share with one or a plurality of business partners, an internal cost\/price model while preserving the confidentiality of sensible information.","7. Discussion of Method","The method of the present invention is next discussed in a formulation as illustrated by the detailed worked-out example, discussed supra.","A first output equation (tcv=mlc\u00d7year\u00d712+otc) expresses an output data (tcv) as a function of at least one first input data (year) and at least one first intermediary result (mlc, otc). A plurality of first intermediary equations (nodes in levels 2-12 of ) relates the at least one first intermediary result (mlc, otc) to at least one second intermediary result (mlcm, mlch, . . . , coef2, coef1) and at least one second input data (dev, loc, srvcap, . . . , hiny). A plurality of input data (year, dev, loc, srvcap, . . . , hiny) denotes the at least one first input data (year) and the at least one second input data (dev, loc, srvcap, . . . , hiny) collectively. A plurality of intermediary results (mlc, otc, mlcm, mlch, . . . , coef2, coef) denotes the at least one first intermediary result (mlc, otc) and the at least one second intermediary result (mlcm, mlch, . . . , coef2, coef) collectively.","The plurality of intermediary results are assigned as content of intermediary cells of the spreadsheet (Intermediate Result Table in step  of ).","A second output equation (tcv=(dev\/12 . . . )\u00d7year\u00d712+ . . . , namely the level  equation for tcv resulting from execution of steps A and B) is generated, wherein the second output equation expresses the output data (tcv) as a function of a subset of the plurality of input data with no functional dependence on the plurality of intermediary results.

Generation of the second output equation utilizes the first output equation (tcv=mlc\u00d7year\u00d712+otc) and the plurality of first intermediary equations (nodes in levels 2-12 of ).","The output data (tcv) of the second output equation is assigned as content of an output cell of the spreadsheet (see step  of ).","After the output data is assigned, the content of the intermediary cells is removed, resulting in the plurality of intermediary results not being identifiable in the spreadsheet (see step  of ).","Generating the second output equation may comprise recursively eliminating the at least one second intermediary result (mlcm, mlch, . . . , coef2, coef1) from the plurality of first intermediary equations (nodes in levels 2-12 of ) to transform the plurality of first intermediary equations into at least one second intermediary equation (level 2 equation for otc and mlc resulting from execution of steps A and B) that expresses the at least one first intermediary result (mlc, otc) in terms of the at least one second input data (dev, loc, srvcap, hiny) with no dependence on the at least one second intermediary result (mlcm, mlch, . . . , coef2, coef). The at least one first intermediary result from the at least one second intermediary equation is substituted into the first output equation (tcv=mlc\u00d7year\u00d712+otc) to generate the second output equation (tcv=(dev\/12 . . . )\u00d7year\u00d712+ . . . , namely the level 1 equation for tcv resulting from execution of steps A and B).","The subset of the plurality of input data may not include at least one selected input data of the plurality of input data.
