{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCES","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is with and incorporates by reference in its entirety U.S. Utility patent application Ser. No. 10\/346,475 titled \u201cRule-based System and Method for Machining a Part\u201d by Charles D. B. Mathews, et. al., filed Jan. 17, 2003.","The invention relates generally to the field of computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing (CAD\/CAM) and in particular to manufacturing a part using one or more computer controlled machines.","The use of a computer controlled machines to automatically machine parts has allowed the quick production of precise parts. For the specific case of machining parts, these machines are called computer numerically controlled (CNC) machines and are basically a computerized machinist that cuts material away from a block of material, e.g., metal or plastic, until the desired product is achieved. For example, a three-axis CNC milling machine has a cutting tool, an end mill, and allows for movement of the tool in three directions, X, Y, and Z. By moving the tool (or the part) and by spinning the end mill, material is removed from the block of material. The CNC machine has its own programming language which includes G and M codes.","In order to make programming a CNC machine more user friendly than writing many cryptic programming lines having G\/M codes, a computer aided manufacturing (CAM) front end software tool is typically used. The CAM software tool has a graphical user interface (GUI) and may use a higher level language, such as Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the industry standard macro and scripting language, for programming. The CAM software then automatically generates the appropriate program, including the G\/M codes, to run the CNC machine to manufacture the part. The CAM software tool is typically used by a manufacturing engineer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["110","112","114","116","120","124","130","132"]},"The manufacturing process of  has several problems. First, the process has a one-way flow of information, i.e., from design  to manufacture  to shop . For example, if the machinist on the shop floor needs to modify the CNC program to improve machining the part, this knowledge will normally not get back to either the manufacturing engineer or the design engineer. Similarly, any changes by the manufacturing engineer that could affect the design process are stored only in manufacturing DB . The design engineer typically has no access to DB , and even if the design engineer had access, the data representation of the CAD model in DB  is normally significantly different than the CAM model in DB . Thus lack of feedback information significantly impedes improvement of the overall machining process.","Another major problem is that if a feature or attribute in a part changes the manufacturing engineer needs to create another CNC program. VBA somewhat reduces this problem, by automating the programming of different versions of a standard part by using a macro. For example, a VBA macro can be written that characterizes a hole (a feature of a part), using attributes such as diameter, depth, XYZ location. The macro is complied and executed. The user is asked to enter values for the attributes or to make a selection among several predetermined choices. The macro takes these values, creates circles representing the holes, selects the cutting tools, automatically creates the drilling operations, and produces the G code program. The CNC machine inputs the G code program and machines the hole in the part. However, for example, if one feature is different in a similar part, e.g., a threaded hole rather than a counter bored hole, then a new VBA macro is typically written by the manufacturing engineer. Thus the conventional macro only increases program flexibility in a limited way by allowing different values for fixed attributes, but does not allow, for example, the addition\/removal of features and attributes or the selection of a different manufacturing process.","In addition as the programmer is human, two programs, each written by a different person, but machining the same part, are probably different. This \u201cpersonalized\u201d methodology prevents the standardization of the part manufacturing process.","Therefore there is need for an improved process of machining a part were the design section, manufacturing section, and shop floor can exchange knowledge and were the programming methodology is more flexible, efficient and standardized.","The present invention includes a system and method for centralizing knowledge and improving programming for manufacturing a part. An exemplary embodiment includes a first program that generates a second program based on one or more rules. The rules relate to one or more features and attributes of a part. The second program has the G code for the CNC machine. While the example of machining of a part using a CNC machine is used to describe some embodiments of the present invention, the scope of the invention is not so limited. The manufacture of any part using a computer controlled machine, for example, the forging of a part or assembly of a part, using one or more programmable computer controlled machines, is also within the scope of the present invention.","An embodiment of the present invention includes a method, using a computer system, for manufacturing a part. First, a model, e.g., a geometric model, of the part is received. Next, a predetermined rule is retrieved from a computer readable medium having a plurality of predetermined rules. A feature of the model is selected by evaluating the retrieved predetermined rule and a process is determined that is associated with the feature. Based on the process, computer code is generated to manufacture the part on a computer controlled machine.","Another embodiment of the present invention includes a method for manufacturing a part using a computer system. First, a model of the part is received. Next, a feature of the model is selected from a plurality of features by evaluating a first predetermined rule. An attribute is then selected from a plurality of attributes associated with the feature by evaluating a second predetermined rule. The attribute describes a physical characteristic of the feature, and the second predetermined rule includes a fragment of code stored in a computer readable medium.","A further embodiment of the present invention includes a system for manufacturing a part using a first program stored in a computer readable medium. The system includes: a database having a plurality of machining operations and a plurality of rules; and a second program stored in memory, where the second program is operably configured to select a set of machining operations from the plurality of machining operations by evaluating the plurality of rules. The set is used to create a portion of the first program.","An aspect of the present invention includes computer system for machining a feature of a part. The computer system includes a processor, a user input device coupled to the processor, and a display coupled to the processor. The computer system further includes a user interface element having instructions executed by the processor, where the user interface element is capable of accepting a comparison expression representing a rule associated with the feature of the part. The comparison expression is specified via the user input device and displayed on the display. The computer system further includes a database for storing the rule.","An embodiment of the present invention includes a system for manufacturing a part using a computer system. The system includes: a database having a plurality of rules and a plurality of machining cycles; a CNC program for manufacturing the part on a CNC machine; and a generating program stored in a computer readable medium for creating the CNC program. Further, the generating program includes: a rules evaluation module for selecting at least one machining cycle by evaluating at least one rule; and a CNC code generation module for generating a part of the CNC program using the machining cycle.","These and other embodiments, features, aspects and advantages of the invention will become better understood with regard to the following description, appended claims and accompanying drawings.","In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a more thorough description of the specific embodiments of the invention. It should be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the invention may be practiced without all the specific details given below. In other instances, well known details have not been described, so as not to obscure the invention.","A part that is manufactured from one or more materials is composed of one or more features, for example, holes, pockets, slots. Each feature has one or more attributes which describe physical characteristics of a feature. For example, for a hole the attributes include the location, diameter, and depth of the hole. In the case of machining a part from a block of material using a CNC machine, each feature is cut out of the block of material. For each feature, there is a corresponding cutting process that includes selecting which cutting tools to use and the tool operations to be performed. For the hole example, a cutting tool, e.g., a drill, and the tool operations, e.g., a tool path, are selected.","The features and corresponding attributes in certain limited cases may be automatically determined from the geometric model of the part using an image processing algorithm. Once the features and corresponding attributes are recognized a pre-selected process is used to machine the feature. Not all of the steps may be automatic, for example, the user may be asked to input values for the attributes. There are also some major disadvantages using this automated approach, such as inflexibility to change and non-reusability since the features, corresponding attributes, and associated processes are fixed, i.e., hard coded, in the manufacturing program.","One embodiment of the present invention has a goal of creating a uniform engineering environment for the manufacture of parts, not only for a specific company, but across companies. To achieve this goal one or both of the following are done: the databases used by design, manufacturing, and the shop for creating a part are centralized, which includes standardizing the data structures, and the CAM process is made visible and standard by the use of user defined rules. By having a uniform way of capturing and representing knowledge, the design engineer, manufacture engineer, the CNC programmer and CNC operator expertise can be captured and the system can improve by learning. In addition, beside intra-company exchange of knowledge, companies can exchange or sell\/buy knowledge.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["226","116","124","1","212","214","226","224","226","226","220","226","226","230","234","226","234","234","226","234","226"]},"In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the decision points on selection of features, attributes, and processes are explicitly given in the form of rules. A rule includes a code fragment or function that when executed returns a \u201cTrue\u201d or \u201cFalse\u201d Boolean value. The code fragments or functions are stored in the DB . Using the selected features, attributes, and processes, cutting tools and machining operations, e.g., the tools cutting feeds and rotational speeds and tool path, are determined and a CNC program is generated to machine the part on a CNC machine.","Since a part has one or more features, were each feature has one or more attributes, a first set of rules are assigned to the features and a second set of rules are assigned to the attributes. In addition since a process specifies how a feature is made and there may be multiple processes, i.e., ways, to make a feature, a third set of rules is assigned to decide which process should be used. If the third set of rules indicate multiple processes should be used then a human expert or a computerized expert system makes a selection on which process to use and the third set of rules are refined.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["242","216","2","244","242","244","246","244","248","246","244","246","250","250","246","244","252"]},"An example of part types associated with a solid geometric model of a part may include a prismatic milled part, mold component, and die component. If the user selects part type, i.e., die component, then the feature recognition rules  may look for features , e.g., holes, pockets, and profiles in the geometric model. If rule  evaluates to true for a hole feature , then there may be one or more feature types, e.g., counterbored hole, threaded hole, or tapped hole. The feature type  selected is dependent on rule  evaluating to true.","Each feature type  has associated with it one or more processes . To determine if the process is applicable to the feature type, the accompanying rule  is evaluated. Each process has one or more process steps . Each feature type  may also have one or more attributes (not shown), where an attribute describes a physical characteristic of a feature.

Each feature type thus has one or more key\/value pairs. The feature type along with a combination of one or more of its key\/value pairs is called a feature case. The feature case is used to search for the one or more processes that is to be used in manufacturing the feature in the part.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["510","512","510","514","516","8","516"]},"For the two examples of feature cases below, assume the following feature types and key\/values:\n\n","The first example of a feature case is:\n\n","The second example of a feature case is:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIGS. 4 and 5","FIG. 6"],"b":["612","614","617","616","618","614","620","621","622","620","623","625","624","626","621","628","630","622","632","634","621","622","640","641","614","640","620","625","621","628","622","632","641","621","628","622","632"]},"Each feature case has one or more processes, e.g., feature case  has processes  to , where each process has a rule, e.g.,  to , respectively. Feature case  has processes  to  with associated rules  to . If the process rule evaluates to true, then the associated each process has one or more process steps, e.g., process  has process steps  to .","The rules in  are logical expressions, which if true, select the associated feature, feature type, key\/value, or process. The rules prune the tree in , and the code associated with the selected processes are inserted in the manufacturing program to machine the part. A logical expression includes any fragment of code that evaluates to a logical \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d value. For example, let the symbol \u201cA\u201d be a comparison expression such as \u201cFeature.layer.name=\u201cThreadedHoles\u201d; let the symbol \u201cB\u201d be a comparison expression such as \u201cfeature.diameter<0.5\u201d; and let the symbol \u201cC\u201d be a comparison expression such as \u201cfeature.customproperties(\u201cPitch\u201d).value=14\u201d. A logical expression includes A, B, or C individually, as well as any logical combination of A, B, and C, e.g., (A OR B AND C), (A AND NOT B), NOT C, (B XOR C NOR A). The user may write the comparison, code fragments, and logical expressions using VB.","As an example of the use of , assume that there are the following items for the feature type, keys, values and processes for a part having a hole to be drilled in it.\n\n","In our example the feature  has feature type  \u201cThreaded Hole M\u201d. In this case there is no need for rule , as there is only one feature type. Feature type \u201cThreaded Hole M\u201d has two keys, Key and Key. Key  has three possible values, \u201cM8\u201d, \u201cM9\u201d, and \u201cM10\u201d. The rules associated with values \u201cM8\u201d and \u201cM9\u201d are false and the rule associated with \u201cM10\u201d is true. Hence the selected value for Key=\u201cSize\u201d is \u201cM10.\u201d In one embodiment the first rule that is evaluated to true is chosen. In an alternative embodiment, if there is more than one rule that evaluates to true the user is asked to select the value or an artificial intelligence (AI) expert system does the value selection. For the case of Key with selected value \u201cM10,\u201d there is only one process P that will be used to machine a hole of size \u201cM10\u201d. Key has possible values \u201cH1\u201d, \u201cH2\u201d, \u201cH3\u201d, and a default value of \u201cundefined\u201d. The default value is chosen, when the rules for \u201cH1\u201d, \u201cH2\u201d, and \u201cH3\u201d evaluate to false. For Key with \u201cundefined value\u201d, there are two processes, \u201cP\u201d and \u201cP\u201d. Process rule for P evaluates to true, so that process \u201cP\u201d is selected. Process \u201cP\u201d has one or more process steps which will drill a treaded hole with size \u201cM10\u201d and tolerance \u201cundefined\u201d (e.g., any tolerance or a predetermined user specified tolerance).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["710","740","710","712","714","740","710","740","710","740","720","710","720","721","722","724","726","720","710","740"]},"DB  also has a table  having parameter formulas for the machining parameters or conditions (there is also another table (not shown) for the cutting tools and associated parameters).

In one embodiment, the user is shown the choices and must select one of the choices. The user by setting a logical expression to automatically select his\/her choice, has incorporated his\/her decision rationale into the system, e.g., generating program . Thus the expert, i.e., user, is teaching the system, and the system is capturing the expert's knowledge. In another embodiment, a default-priority may be set.","In the preferred embodiment the CAM program has a GUI, e.g., , to define and display rules, feature types, keys, values, processes, and process steps. These definitions are stored in the DB. When the generating program  analyzes a geometric model of the part\/part type, the appropriate feature types, keys, values, and processes are selected automatically using the rules. For the selected processes, the code associated with each process step of each process is retrieved from DB  and used to create the CNC program . The CNC program  is then sent to program the CNC machine to produce the features of the part.","Although specific embodiments of the invention have been described, various modifications, alterations, alternative constructions, and equivalents are also encompassed within the scope of the invention. The described invention is not restricted to operation within certain specific data processing environments, but is free to operate within a plurality of data processing environments. Additionally, although the invention has been described using a particular series of transactions and steps, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the scope of the invention is not limited to the described series of transactions and steps.","Further, while the invention has been described using a particular combination of hardware and software, it should be recognized that other combinations of hardware and software are also within the scope of the invention. The invention may be implemented only in hardware or only in software or using combinations thereof.","The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.
