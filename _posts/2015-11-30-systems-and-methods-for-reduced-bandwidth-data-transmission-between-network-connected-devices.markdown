No. 13\/929,511, filed Jun. 27, 2013, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.","Various embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to data transmission between network connected devices. More specifically, exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure relate to systems and methods for reducing bandwidth during the transmission of data, such as according to HTTP, between devices over the Internet.","People are increasingly accessing Internet content, applications, and web-services over their mobile devices. Many experts have expressed their belief that mobile web traffic has now surpassed traditional, desktop-based traffic. The use of mobile applications now represents a staggering proportion of consumers' free time, and of online companies' revenue. Web developers, publishers, and e-commerce sites have gone to great lengths to accommodate the tremendous increase in mobile web browsing. For example, developers and sites have propagated mobile-specific versions of their sites, and mobile applications that simplify a user's interaction with content and services, in the context of the smaller displays and input mechanisms associated with mobile devices.","In the context of traditional HTTP communications over a network, especially in a bandwidth controlled network, the need to generate and transmit multiple, similar, fully-constructed requests may cause inefficiencies. For example, if a server, computer, or mobile device is interacting with another server, computer, or mobile device over a network, that device might make two or more requests to the opposing device. For example, a mobile phone might send a first request for content to a server and a second request for content to the server. Even though both requests are of the same structure, the mobile device must traditionally generate and transmit both entire requests, even though only a small input or parameter may be different between the first and second requests. In a bandwidth controlled network, and\/or in a relatively lower bandwidth mobile network, the generation and transmission of multiple similar HTTP requests may cause many disadvantages, including slow response time, user dissatisfaction, and lower revenue associated with such activities.","Accordingly, a need exists for systems and methods for improved data transmission between network connected devices. More specifically, a need exists for systems and methods for reducing bandwidth during the transmission of data, such as according to HTTP, between devices over the Internet.","According to certain embodiments, methods are disclosed for reducing bandwidth during the transmission of data between first and second devices over a network. One method includes receiving, from the first device over the network, a first data request; generating, and storing at the second device, a first request identifier associated with the first data request; transmitting, to the first device over the network, a response to the first data request and the first request identifier associated with the first data request; receiving, from the first device over the network, a partial second data request, the partial second data request including (i) the first request identifier associated with the first data request, and (ii) a differential between the first data request and the second data request; and constructing, at the second device, a full second data request, based on a comparison between the first data request, fetched using the first request identifier, and the received differential between the first data request and the second data request.","Embodiments of the disclosure relate to one or more of: generating, at the second device, a response to the full second data request; and transmitting, to the first device over the network, a differential between the response to the first data request and the response to the full second data request; and to generating, at the second device, a response to the full second data request; and transmitting, to the first device over the network, an identifier associated with the full second data request, and a differential between the response to the first data request and the response to the full second data request.","In certain embodiments, the first device constructs a full second response, based on a comparison between the first data response, fetched using the first request identifier, and the received differential between the first data response and the full second data response; or the first device constructs a full second response, based on a comparison between the first data response, fetched using the first request identifier, and the received differential between the first data response and the full second data response.","In certain embodiments, the response to the first data request and the first request identifier associated with the first data request are stored at the first device; the first request identifier associated with the first data request is stored within a cache of the second device; constructing, at the second device, the full second data request, is performed by merging the received differential between the first data request and the second data request into the first data request; constructing, at the second device, the full second data request, is performed by swapping a payload element in the first data request with a payload element in the received differential between the first data request and the second data request; the first device is a personal computer, tablet computer, or smartphone and the second device is a server executing a Web-based Simple Object Access Protocol (\u201cSOAP\u201d) service, Extensible Markup Language (\u201cXML\u201d) service, or Representational State Transfer (\u201cREST\u201d) service.","According to certain embodiments, systems are disclosed for reducing bandwidth during the transmission of data between first and second devices over a network. One system includes a data storage device storing instructions for reducing bandwidth during the transmission of data between first and second devices over a network; and a processor configured to execute the instructions to perform a method including: receiving, from the first device over the network, a first data request; generating, and storing at the second device, a first request identifier associated with the first data request; transmitting, to the first device over the network, a response to the first data request and the first request identifier associated with the first data request; receiving, from the first device over the network, a partial second data request, the partial second data request including (i) the first request identifier associated with the first data request, and (ii) a differential between the first data request and the second data request; and constructing, at the second device, a full second data request, based on a comparison between the first data request, fetched using the first request identifier, and the received differential between the first data request and the second data request.","According to certain embodiments, the processor is further configured for: generating, at the second device, a response to the full second data request; and transmitting, to the first device over the network, a differential between the response to the first data request and the response to the full second data request; or generating, at the second device, a response to the full second data request; and transmitting, to the first device over the network, an identifier associated with the full second data request, and a differential between the response to the first data request and the response to the full second data request.","According to certain embodiments, the first device constructs a full second response, based on a comparison between the first data response, fetched using the first request identifier, and the received differential between the first data response and the full second data response; or the first device constructs a full second response, based on a comparison between the first data response, fetched using the first request identifier, and the received differential between the first data response and the full second data response.","According to certain embodiments, the response to the first data request and the first request identifier associated with the first data request are stored at the first device; the first request identifier associated with the first data request is stored within a cache of the second device; constructing, at the second device, the full second data request, is performed by merging the received differential between the first data request and the second data request into the first data request; or constructing, at the second device, the full second data request, is performed by swapping a payload element in the first data request with a payload element in the received differential between the first data request and the second data request.","According to certain embodiments, a computer readable medium is disclose that stores instructions that, when executed by a computer, cause the computer to perform a method of reducing bandwidth during the transmission of data between first and second devices over a network, the method including: receiving, from the first device over the network, a first data request; generating, and storing at the second device, a first request identifier associated with the first data request; transmitting, to the first device over the network, a response to the first data request and the first request identifier associated with the first data request; receiving, from the first device over the network, a partial second data request, the partial second data request including (i) the first request identifier associated with the first data request, and (ii) a differential between the first data request and the second data request; and constructing, at the second device, a full second data request, based on a comparison between the first data request, fetched using the first request identifier, and the received differential between the first data request and the second data request.","Additional objects and advantages of the disclosed embodiments will be set forth in part in the description that follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the disclosed embodiments. The objects and advantages of the disclosed embodiments will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the disclosed embodiments, as claimed.","Reference will now be made in detail to the exemplary embodiments of the disclosure, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.","The present disclosure describes systems and methods for data transmission between network connected devices, and for reducing bandwidth used during the transmission of data, such as according to HTTP, between devices over the Internet. Specifically, when using a standard HTTP protocol to transmit data across a network, especially in a bandwidth controlled network, the need for generating and transmitting multiple, similar, fully-constructed, requests may be burdensome on the network and\/or cause slow performance in an HTTP device. Accordingly, the presently disclosed systems and methods include techniques for transmitting HTTP requests including the data that is different from a previous request, instead of transmitting an entire, fully-constructed request including the data that is different from the previous request.","In its most fundamental form, if a first HTTP request includes the following request string: \u201csend_me_datatype_123_of_element_i=A\u201d and the first request is stored as \u201cR1,\u201d a subsequent request for element \u201cB,\u201d instead of element \u201cA,\u201d may be constructed as \u201cR1_i=B\u201d instead of the longer and larger, fully-constructed request, \u201csend_me_datatype_123_of_element_i=B\u201d. Systems and methods according to the presently disclosed techniques may be especially useful when a client is querying a Simple Object Access Protocol (\u201cSOAP\u201d), Extensible Markup Language (\u201cXML\u201d), or Representational State Transfer (\u201cREST\u201d) service where the request has the same structure, and only small inputs are changed. By maintaining a copy of the initial request at the server, and returning to the client a unique identifier of such request, the client may be able to send back only the unique identifier and the needed difference to reconstruct a new request with much lesser payload.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["105","110","120","105","110","120","105","120","105","120","110","120"]},"As depicted in , first user devices  may include, for example, a mobile device or tablet , a laptop , and\/or a computer or server . Likewise, the second user devices  may include, for example, a mobile device or tablet , a laptop , and\/or computer or server .","In one embodiment, user devices ,  may be owned and used by one or more people, who may be viewers of web pages and\/or consumers of content over the Internet, either through an application, mobile browser, or web browser stored on respective user devices. User devices ,  may include any type of electronic device configured to send and receive data, such as websites, multimedia content, and electronic advertisements, over electronic network . For example, each of user devices ,  may include a mobile device, smartphone, and\/or personal digital assistant (\u201cPDA\u201d) disposed in communication with electronic network . In addition, each of user devices ,  may be a tablet computer or any other kind of touchscreen-enabled device, personal computer, laptop, and\/or server disposed in communication with electronic network . Each of user devices ,  may have a web browser and\/or mobile browser installed for receiving and displaying electronic content received from one or more web servers. Each of user devices ,  may have an operating system configured to execute a web or mobile browser, and any type of application, such as a mobile application. In one embodiment, user devices ,  may be configured to download applications and\/or application content from application servers. In one embodiment, user devices ,  may be configured to download one or more mobile applications from a mobile application server, and execute those one or more applications to receive and manipulate electronic content received from one or more of web servers and\/or content distribution servers.","The one or more server systems  may include any type of web server, service, or any other type of web resource that may be accessed by one or more of the first or second devices , . In one embodiment, the server systems  may include, for purposes of illustration, one or more Simple Object Access Protocol (\u201cSOAP\u201d) servers , one or more Extensible Markup Language (\u201cXML\u201d) servers , and\/or one or more (\u201cRepresentational State Transfer\u201d) REST servers . In one embodiment, one or more of servers  may be associated with an entity that makes and distributes mobile applications, or Web-based services.","Any or all of the devices and\/or servers , ,  may be disposed in communication with an electronic network , such as the Internet. Moreover, any pair of the devices and\/or servers , ,  may be configured to exchange data packets over the electronic network  according to any suitable predetermined protocol, such as hypertext transfer protocol (\u201cHTTP\u201d). Any or all of the devices and\/or servers , ,  may be configured to perform various techniques for exchanging requests for data, responses to requests for data, and data, in manners to reduce the bandwidth used in such exchanges.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["105","110","120","200","202","206","204","204","208","202","206","202","202","210","204","204","212","202","206"]},"Thus, even when a pair of devices (e.g., nodes A and B, or any first and second devices) are exchanging very similar structured requests and responses that differ only in certain values or inputs, those devices send entire, fully constructed requests and responses, as described with respect to . Such methods involve significant bandwidth, or at the least, they do not efficiently conserve bandwidth. This inefficiency is especially burdensome, both in terms of time and revenue, in low bandwidth networks, such as mobile networks, or in bandwidth-limited or pay-per-data networks.","Accordingly, as described above, the presently disclosed systems and methods are directed to solving the above disclosed disadvantages, such as by executing the exemplary methods of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304","105","110","120"]},"In one embodiment, method  may include the first system  (A) issuing a first data request (step ) (\u201cGetDataRequest1\u201d) to the second system  (B). First data request  may be any type of request that is structured according to some predetermined protocol, such as HTTP. Upon receiving the first data request , the second system  may store the request (step ), such as by storing the request in cache B (\u201cStoreRequest1\u201d). In one embodiment, cache B may return a first request ID (step ) to node B (\u201cReturnRequestID1\u201d), or alternatively node B may generate the first request ID (step ). The second system  may then prepare a response (step ) (\u201cPrepareResponseData1\u201d) to the first data request , and send the data response and the first request ID (step ) back to the first system  (\u201cGetDataResponse1+RequestID1\u201d).","Upon receiving the first data response (step ), the first system  may store the request and request ID (step ), such as by storing the request and request ID in cache A (step ) (\u201cStoreResponse1+RequestID1\u201d). Accordingly, the first system  may have received a response to its first request, as well as an ID associated with the first request and\/or the first response. As described above, at any given time in the future, the first system  may be instructed, either by a user or operating code, to issue a second request to the second system . In some cases, the second request may have a format or structure that is similar to or equivalent to the format or structure of the first request. For example, the first system  may be a client that is querying a SOAP\/XML\/REST service operating on the second system , where the second request has the same structure as the first request, and only small inputs or values are changed.","Accordingly, as shown in , at any time after receiving and storing the first response , , the first system  may prepare to send a second request to the second system  (step ). Instead of preparing and sending a fully constructed second request, the first system  may prepare and send to the second system  a request differential between the first and second requests, along with the first request ID (step ) (\u201cGetDataRequestDiff2+RequestID1\u201d). In other words, the first system  may send the second system  the ID for looking up the first request, and instructions or inputs for generating the second request based on one or more differences between the first and second requests. In some cases, the request differential with the first request ID may be considered a \u201cpartial second data request.\u201d Upon receiving the request differential between the first and second requests, along with the first request ID , the second system  may use the first request ID to fetch the first request (step ), e.g., from cache B (\u201cFetchRequest1\u201d). The second system  may receive a returned first request (step ) (\u201cReturnRequest1\u201d), e.g., from cache B. The second system  may then construct a full second request (step ) (\u201cConstructFullRequest2\u201d). For example, the second system  may construct a full second request (step ) based on both the first request (as identified by the first request ID) and second request differential received from the first system . In one embodiment, the second data request may be constructed by merging the received differential between the first data request and the second data request into the first data request. In one embodiment, the second data request may be constructed by swapping a payload element in the first data request with a payload element in the received differential between the first data request and the second data request. The second system  may then prepare response data (step ) (\u201cPrepareResponseData2\u201d).","The manner in which the second system  may prepare and transmit the response data (step ) to the first system  may depend on a number of factors, such as any desire to track multiple requests and request IDs, and a desired extent of bandwidth conservation. Specifically, among other embodiments, the second system  may, in response to receiving the first request ID and the request differential between the first and second requests, send back to the first system  either (i) a response differential between the first and second responses; (ii) the response differential between the first and second responses, along with a second response ID; or (iii) a fully constructed second response, as will be described in more detail with respect to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A"],"b":["304","302","402","302","404","406","302","408","302","302","304","302","304"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4B"],"b":["304","302","416","304","412","414","416","302","418","420","302","422","302","302","304","302","304"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 4C","b":["304","302","304","424","426"]},"In one embodiment, the first data request  may be a request for a stock price, such as the following exemplary structure request:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"POST \/InStock HTTP\/1.1"]},{"entry":[{},"Host: www.example.org"]},{"entry":[{},"Content-Type: application\/soap+xml; charset=utf-8"]},{"entry":[{},"Content-Length: nnn"]},{"entry":[{},"X-Diff: 1"]},{"entry":[{},"<?xml version=\u20331.0\u2033?>"]},{"entry":[{},"<soap:Envelope"]},{"entry":[{},"xmlns:soap=\u2033http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/12\/soap-envelope\u2033"]},{"entry":[{},"soap:encodingStyle=\u2033http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/12\/soap-encoding\u2033>"]},{"entry":[{},"<soap:Body xmlns:m=\u2033http:\/\/www.example.org\/stock\u2033>"]},{"entry":[{},"<m:GetStockPrice>"]},{"entry":[{},"<m:StockName>IBM<\/m:StockName>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/m:GetStockPrice>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/soap:Body>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/soap:Envelope>"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In this example, the first device is requesting a stock price for the company, \u201cIBM.\u201d The string, \u201cX-Diff: 1\u201d informs the recipient that the first device intends to invoke the bandwidth conserving techniques of the present disclosure.
