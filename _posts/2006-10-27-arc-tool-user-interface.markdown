{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates generally to machine vision inspection systems, and more particularly to video metrology tool modes and tools usable to define inspection operations for such systems.","Precision machine vision inspection systems (or \u201cvision systems\u201d for short) can be utilized to obtain precise dimensional measurements of inspected objects and to inspect various other object characteristics. Such systems may include a computer, a camera and optical system, and a precision stage that is movable in multiple directions so as to allow the camera to scan the features of a workpiece that is being inspected. One exemplary prior art system that is commercially available is the QUICK VISION\u00ae series of PC-based vision systems and QVPAK\u00ae software available from Mitutoyo America Corporation (MAC), located in Aurora, Ill. The features and operation of the QUICK VISION\u00ae series of vision systems and the QVPAK\u00ae software are generally described, for example, in the 3, published January 2003, and the 3, published September 1996, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. This product, as exemplified by the QV-302 Pro model, for example, is able to use a microscope-type optical system to provide images of a workpiece at various magnifications, and move the stage as necessary to traverse the workpiece surface beyond the limits of any single video image. A single video image typically encompasses only a portion of the workpiece being observed or inspected, given the desired magnification, measurement resolution, and physical size limitations of such systems.","Machine vision inspection systems generally utilize automated video inspection. U.S. Pat. No. 6,542,180 (the '180 patent) teaches various aspects of such automated video inspection and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As taught in the '180 patent, automated video inspection metrology instruments generally have a programming capability that allows an automatic inspection event sequence to be defined by the user for each particular workpiece configuration. This can be implemented by text-based programming, for example, or through a recording mode which progressively \u201clearns\u201d the inspection event sequence by storing a sequence of machine control instructions corresponding to a sequence of inspection operations performed by a user, or through a combination of both methods. Such a recording mode is often referred to as \u201clearn mode\u201d or \u201ctraining mode.\u201d Once the inspection event sequence is defined in \u201clearn mode,\u201d such a sequence can then be used to automatically acquire (and additionally analyze or inspect) images of a workpiece during \u201crun mode.\u201d","The machine control instructions including the specific inspection event sequence (i.e., how to acquire each image and how to analyze\/inspect each acquired image) are generally stored as a \u201cpart program\u201d or \u201cworkpiece program\u201d that is specific to the particular workpiece configuration. For example, a part program defines how to acquire each image, such as how to position the camera relative to the workpiece, at what lighting level, at what magnification level, etc. Further, the part program defines how to analyze\/inspect an acquired image, for example, by using one or more video tools such as edge\/boundary detection video tools.","Video tools (or \u201ctools\u201d for short) may be used manually to accomplish manual inspection and\/or machine control operations. Their set-up parameters and operation can also be recorded during learn mode, in order to create automatic inspection programs, or \u201cpart programs.\u201d Such tools may include, for example, edge\/boundary detection tools, autofocus tools, shape or pattern matching tools, dimension measuring tools, and the like. For example, such tools are routinely used in a variety of commercially available machine vision inspection systems, such as the QUICK VISION\u00ae series of vision systems and the associated QVPAK\u00ae software, discussed above.","The currently available features and graphical user interface (GUI) controls for video tools, and particularly dimensional metrology video tools, are limited. In particular, alternatives for setting up video tool regions of interest (ROIs) and operating parameters during learn mode, or manual mode, are limited. Existing alternatives may be difficult to adapt for efficient use with different applications or workpieces. Existing user interfaces may be difficult for users to understand intuitively, making user learning and retention difficult. Video tools that overcome these and other disadvantages, to allow more efficient, intuitive, and flexible use of precision machine vision inspection systems, would be desirable.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Currently, the users of precision machine vision inspection systems may spend a majority of their part-programming time setting up video tools and adjusting their parameters. Thus, even small improvements in their ease-of-use in comparison to their parameter customization capability, their GUI features, and other ergonomic factors, may be highly valued. One type of video tool, a so-called \u201carc tool\u201d for measuring the characteristics of arc-shaped features in images, may have more controllable parameters than a variety of other video tools. Arc tool customization has been inconvenient and non-intuitive, especially for large and small arc radii. Accordingly, the present invention is directed toward novel and efficient features for configuring an arc video tool in an easy-to-use and flexible manner.","A system and method are provided which allow users to define and\/or edit tool parameters for an arc tool ROI with a relatively reduced number of operations. In particular, a unique combination of arc tool user interface features and operations are provided for efficiently editing an arc tool ROI. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a plurality of distinct types of ROI parameter control features are provide in an arc tool GUI. In one embodiment, there may be at least four such distinct types of ROI control parameter features. The distinct types of ROI parameter control features may be distinguished by their locations relative to the ROI, and\/or each other, and\/or by distinct symbols, or the like.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, each distinct type of ROI parameter control feature may be associated with a distinct mode of operation that is specific to that type of ROI parameter control feature. In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, activating such a distinct mode of operation may be associated with displaying a corresponding unique mode symbol cursor. In one embodiment, each of the distinct modes of operation may be activated by an identical activation operation for each of the distinct types of ROI parameter control features. In one embodiment, the identical activation operation comprises hovering a default cursor over a distinct type of ROI parameter control feature until a unique mode symbol cursor is displayed, then activating the corresponding editing mode by depressing the left mouse button while the unique mode symbol cursor is displayed.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, one distinct mode of operation that is specific to a first type of ROI parameter control feature is a curvature-changing mode, wherein moving a curvature-changing mode symbol cursor along a radial direction causes the nominal radius of curvature of the inner and outer radii of the ROI to mutually decrease or mutually increase, depending on the direction of the radial movement of the curvature-changing mode symbol cursor. In various embodiments, the curvature-changing mode operates such that the end portions of the ROI, retain their original length and pivot about their midpoints, as the nominal radius of curvature changes. In various embodiments, when the difference between the start and stop angles of an ROI is approximately 180 degrees or more, the curvature-changing mode is disabled for that ROI. In various embodiments, the corresponding first type of ROI parameter control feature comprises an editing handle located approximately at the midpoint of at least one of the inner radius boundary of the ROI and the outer radius boundary of the ROI. In one embodiment, the curvature-changing mode symbol cursor may comprise two arc-shaped lines and at least one arrow oriented transverse to the arc-shaped lines.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, one distinct mode of operation that is specific to a second type of ROI parameter control feature is a symmetrical radial dimension changing mode, wherein moving a symmetrical radial dimension changing mode symbol cursor along a radial direction causes the nominal radius of curvature of the ROI outer radius to increase while the nominal radius of curvature of the ROI inner radius simultaneous decreases by the same amount, or vice versa, depending on the direction of the radial movement of the symmetrical radial dimension changing mode symbol cursor. In one embodiment, the symmetrical radial dimension changing mode operates such that the end portions of the ROI retain their original angles and midpoints, as the nominal radius of curvature changes.","In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, one or more of the distinct types of ROI parameter control features may be associated with at least two modes of operation. One of the two modes of operation may be shared with at least one other distinct type of ROI parameter control feature. In one embodiment, three distinct types of ROI parameter control features are located on each of the inner and outer radius boundaries of the ROI. Each of these distinct types of ROI parameter control features shares an in-place ROI rotation mode of operation. In one embodiment, the in-place ROI rotation mode made be activated by an identical activation operation for each of these distinct types of ROI parameter control features. In one embodiment, the identical activation operation comprises positioning a cursor on one of the distinct types of ROI parameter control features and depressing the right mouse button. In one embodiment, a distinct mode cursor may change to a cursor corresponding to the shared mode that has been activated as a result of depressing the right mouse button.","It should be appreciated the selection of concepts outlined above is exemplary only, and not limiting.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","14","14","16","18","22","24","26","16","10"]},"The vision measuring machine  includes a moveable workpiece stage  and an optical imaging system  which may include a zoom lens or interchangeable lenses. The zoom lens or interchangeable lenses generally provide various magnifications for the images provided by the optical imaging system .

The memory portion  further stores data usable to operate the machine vision inspection system  to perform various inspection and measurement operations on the acquired images, either manually or automatically, and to output the results through the input\/output interface . The memory portion  also contains data defining a graphical user interface operable through the input\/output interface .","The signal lines or busses , , and  of the stage light , the coaxial light , and the surface light , respectively, are all connected to the input\/output interface . The signal line  from the camera system  and the signal line  from the controllable motor  are connected to the input\/output interface .

In a fully automated system having a predefined part program (or workpiece program), the display devices  and\/or the input devices  may be omitted.","In various exemplary embodiments, when a user utilizes the machine vision inspection system  to create a workpiece image acquisition program for the workpiece , the user generates workpiece program instructions either by explicitly coding the instructions automatically, semi-automatically, or manually, using a workpiece programming language, or by generating the instructions by moving the machine vision inspection system  through an image acquisition training sequence, setting light levels and the like, such that the workpiece program instructions capture the training sequence. This process is repeated for multiple images in a set of images that are to be captured. These instructions, when executed, will cause the machine vision inspection system to manipulate the workpiece stage  and\/or the camera system  at certain speed(s) such that a particular portion of the workpiece  is within the field of view of the camera system  and at a desired focus state for each of a set of images to be acquired.","Once a set of workpiece image acquisition instructions are defined, the control system  executes the instructions and commands the camera system  to capture one or more images of the workpiece  according to the instructions.
