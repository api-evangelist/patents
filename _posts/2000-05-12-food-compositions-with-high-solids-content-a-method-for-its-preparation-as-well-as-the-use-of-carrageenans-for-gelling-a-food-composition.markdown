title: Food compositions with high solids content, a method for its preparation as well as the use of carrageenans for gelling a food composition
abstract: Food composition comprising soluble solids in the range of about 50% to about 90% by weight, at least 70% by weight thereof being a sweetening system comprising sucrose and non-sucrose sweeteners in a weight ratio of sucrose to non-sucrose sweeteners of 0:100 to 95:5, wherein the non-sucrose sweetener is of a DE (Dextrose Equivalent) of at least about 30, a carrageenan component in an amount sufficient to form a gel, and water to balance, and wherein the gelation temperature of the composition is <95° C. The food composition may be produced by a process comprising (a) dispersing carrageenan in a syrup of a non-sucrose sweetener at a temperature sufficient to disperse the carrageenan in the syrup while stirring, (b) adding water and heating the mixture to the boiling point thereof, (c) adjusting the soluble solids content to from about 50% to about 90% by weight, (d) depositing the mixture and (e) cooling the mixture to below the depositing temperature of the mixture. The food composition gels rapidly and forms a gel at temperatures of below 95° C. The food composition is especially confectionery products such as soft candies, marshmallows or glazings.

More particularly, this invention relates to confectionery products such as e.g. soft candies comprising as gelling agent one or more carrageenans, a method for the preparation thereof as well as the use of carrageenans for gelling a food composition.","Food compositions having high solids content, such as confectionery products, e.g. soft candies or wine gum, are conventionally gelled by the use of gelatine, a heterogenous mixture of water-soluble high molecular weight proteins. Gelatine is derived from collagen, usually by boiling anal hides or bones.","Despite its excellent gelling capability, gelatine suffers from a number of drawbacks which can be attributed to its animal origin. Thus, gelatine is unacceptable to those of Muslim and Jewish faith, as it is often prepared from swine skin. Further, recently the use of gelatine in foods has been questioned due to the possible link between consumption of foods containing gelatine of bovine origin and the occurrence of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Finally, the consumption of animals and animal-derived foods may be objectionable for some from an ethical point of view.","There is therefore a need for a vegetable alternative to gelatine.","One such alternative is carrageenan. Carrageenans extracted from seaweed are known to be useful as thickening, viscosifying and gelling agents. Carrageenans are polysaccharides consisting of alternating copolymers of \u03b2(1\u21923)-D-galactose and \u03b1(1\u21924)-3,6-anhydro-D-galactose units. Several members of the carrageenan family are known, differing in their amounts of sulfate ester and\/or other substituent groups, viz iota carrageenan, kappa carrageenan and lambda carrageenan, of which only iota and kappa carrageenans have gelling properties.","A general formula for carageenan is disclosed by Nijenhuis, K. in Advanced Polymer Science, 130, 203\u201318, (1997): \n\nIdealised AB repeating unit of iota and kappa carrageenan polymers based on 1,3-linked \u03b2-D-galactose residue (A) and 1,4-linked 3,6-anhydro-\u03b1-D-galactose residue (B). The sequence is broken occasionally by residues of the general type B\u2032.\n","Stortz, C. A. and Cerezo, A.

The disclosed confectionery does not include any sugar and is deposited at temperatures of about 130 to 140\u00b0 C.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,603,979 discloses a method for the preparation of a fat-free peanutbutter like product comprising 15\u201340% by weight of water, 0.5\u20131.5% by weight of natural gum, 5\u201320% by weight of peanut flour, 20\u201335% by weight of syrup and 5\u201313% by weight of humectant. Carrageenan may be used as gum component. The product obtained must be spreadable.","Thus, as can be seen, the prior use of carrageenan has either been in lower soluble solids systems or in non-gelled end-products. Alternatively, the application of high operating temperatures have been required. It has hitherto not been possible to disperse efficiently a carrageenan in a high solids system at a temperature of below 100\u00b0 C. at atmospheric pressure in order to form a gelled end-product, in which said carrageenan provides the main gel structure and texture.","The object of the present invention is thus to provide a gelled food composition having high soluble solids content wherein said composition has an adequate low viscosity during depositing in e.g. moulds, gels rapidly and can successfully be produced at temperatures not requiring special apparatuses or arrangements to be met.","In its first aspect, the present invention relates to a food composition comprising soluble solids in the range of 50% to 90% by weight, at least 70% by weight thereof being a sweetening system comprising sucrose and non-sucrose sweeteners in a weight ratio of sucrose to non-sucrose sweeteners of 0:100 to 95:5, wherein the non-sucrose sweetener is of a DE (Dextrose Equivalent) of at least about 30, a carrageenan component in an amount sufficient to form a gel, and water to balance, wherein the gelation temperature, determined as the intersection of the graphs of elastic modulus, G\u2032, and viscous modulus, G\u2033, of composition is <95\u00b0 C. measured on a HAAKE\u2122 Rheometer, RS 100 using the settings\u2014Gradient 1\u00b0 C.\/min, 0.4640 Hz, 95\u00b0 C.\u201365\u00b0 C., t=1800 s, 0.50 Pa, 65\u00b0 C.\u201335\u00b0 C., t=1800 s, 2.50 Pa-Stress sweep 35\u00b0 C. 0.10 Pa\u201320.00 Pa, 0.4640 Hz.","The elastic modulus, G\u2032, indicates the solid behaviour of a gel, and is a measure of the gel strength, while the viscous modulus, G\u2033, indicates the liquid behaviour of the gel, which correlates to the degree of bounciness and trembling of the gel.","In a second aspect, the present invention provides a process for producing a food composition as defined above comprising (a) dispersing carrageenan in a syrup of a non sucrose sweeetener at a temperature sufficient to disperse the carrageenan in said syrup while stirring, (b) adding water and heating the mixture to the boiling point thereof, (c) adjusting the soluble solids content to from about 50% to about 90% by weight, (d) depositing said mixture, and (e) cooling said mixture to below the depositing temperature of said mixture.","As used herein, the term \u201cdepositing temperature\u201d means the lowest temperature, at which depositing is possible, i.e. at which temperature the food composition is still flowable, such as through a \u201cMogul\u201d plant or depositor.","In a third aspect, the present invention provides the use of a carrageenan component for gelling a food composition of a soluble solids content of about 50 to about 90% by weight, at least 70% by weight thereof being a sweetening system comprising sucrose and non-sucrose sweeteners in a weight ratio of sucrose to non-sucrose sweeteners of 0:100 to 95:5, wherein the non-sucrose sweetener is of a DE of at least about 30 and wherein the gelation temperature of said composition determined as the intersection of the graphs of elastic modulus, G\u2032, and viscous modulus, G\u2033, measured on a HAAKE\u2122 Rheometer, RS 100 using the settings\u2014Gradient 1\u00b0 C.\/min, 0.4640 Hz, 95\u00b0 C.\u201365\u00b0 C., t=1800 s, 0.50 Pa, 65\u00b0 C.\u201335\u00b0 C., t=1800 s, 2.50 Pa-Stress sweep 35\u00b0 C. 0.10 Pa\u201320.00 Pa, 0.4640 Hz, is <95\u00b0 C.","Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.","The food composition according to the invention in a preferred embodiment comprises a sweetening system comprising sucrose and non sucrose sweeteners in a weight ratio of sucrose to non sucrose sweetener of 0:100 to 95:5, wherein the non sucrose sweetener is a hydrogenated-starch hydrolysate syrup of a DE of at least about 30, preferably a DE>30 fructose or glucose syrup.","In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, said non sucrose sweetener is a hydrogenated starch hydrolysate syrup with a DE of at least about 40, preferably a DE>40 fructose or glucose syrup.","As used herein, the term \u201cDE\u201d stands for \u201cDextrose Equivalent\u201d. DE indicates the degree to which a carbohydrate starting material has been decomposed to dextrose.","Thus, it has been found that at DE values below about 30, the carrageenan employed will swell excessively, leading to excessive gelling causing a gelation temperature well above 100\u00b0 C. However, gelation temperatures of above 100\u00b0 C. are undesirable from a practical point of view, necessitating special precautions and requirements in terms of e.g. apparatus.","By employing the above mentioned sweetening system, it has, however, surprisingly been shown that it is possible to dissolve a carrageenan component in a high solids system of about 50 to about 90% by weight of soluble solids using a minor amount of water. A particular advantage of the present invention is thus the fact that the amount of water added can be limited compared to a conventional process whereby less energy is needed for the subsequent evaporation thereof to obtain a final product of a desired soluble solids content. The present invention thus represents a substantially increased process efficiency.","In a preferred embodiment, the non sucrose sweetener is a hydrogenated starch hydrolysate syrup with a DE in the range of about 40 to about 100, particularly preferred about 50 to 90, especially about 60 to 70. A non sucrose sweetener with a maltose content \u226750% and a DE of about 50 to 60 is particularly preferred. Said embodiment provides the optimum characteristics in terms of sweetness level, texture and solubility of the gelled food composition.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the sucrose can be replaced wholly or partly by an aqueous solution of a sugar alcohol. Said sugar alcohol is preferably, but not exclusively, selected among sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, isomalt, lactitol, maltitol or a maltitol syrup.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the sweetening system comprises sucrose and non sucrose sweeteners in a weight ratio of sucrose to non sucrose sweetener of from about 10:90 to about 70:30, preferably from about 20:80 to about 30:70, particularly preferred about 1:2. Thus, it has been found that at the disclosed ratios, an acceptable sweetness level still providing a composition having a gelation temperature of <95\u00b0 C. is obtained.","Particularly preferred, the gelation temperature of said food composition is <85\u00b0 C., preferably <80\u00b0 C.","The present invention is highly suitable for preparing gelled food compositions having high soluble solids content. In a preferred embodiment, said soluble solids content is in the range of 70 to 85% by weight, particularly preferred about 75 to 80% by weight.","Advantageously, at least about 80%, preferably at least about 90% of the soluble solids are comprised by the above sweetening system. Thus, it has been shown that even at such high concentrations of sweetening system a gelled product having a satisfactory gelation temperature may be obtained.","As carrageenan component an iota carrageenan or a kappa carrageenan or mixtures thereof are employed, preferably in an amount of about 0.25 to 10.0% by weight, preferably about 0.75 to 5.0%, especially about 1 to 3% by weight of the food composition. Suitable carrageenans are commercially available as e.g. GENUTINE\u2122 type X-8300, X-8302, and X-9303 from Hercules Copenhagen, Denmark, or GENUGEL\u2122 type WR-713 or X-8605, likewise available from Hercules Copenhagen.","While the above carrageenans are the preferred ones, it must be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. Thus, any carrageenan component, which will provide the required gelling capability, may be employed in a food composition according to the present invention. More particularly, a carrageenan component in a non-purified form, such as in the form of seaweed, particularly red seaweeds, may also be employed.","Further, one or more additional hydrocolloids may be employed in combination with the above disclosed carrageenans to provide a particular gelling property, such as pectin, e.g. GENU\u2122 Pectin, available from Hercules Copenhagen, agar\u2014agar, e.g. GENU\u2122 Agar, available from Hercules Copenhagen, cellulose, such as AVICEL\u2122, cellulose extracts and derivatives such as carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC), e.g. Blanose cellulose gum, methyl cellulose, e.g. Benecel\u2122, hydroxy propyl cellulose, e.g. Klucel, hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose and mixtures thereof, starch, such as Avebe\u2122 Perfectagel MPT, Avebe\u2122Perfectagel 928 and Avebe\u2122Perfectamyl Gel MB, alginates, xanthans such as Keltrol or Kelgum from Kelco Biopolymers, curdlan, gelatine, guar, locust bean gum, tara gum, karaya gum, gellan gum such as Kelcogel from Kelco Biopolymers, furcellaran, tragacanth, and gum arabic, generally in an amount of up to about 10% by weight.","As further optional ingredients, conventional additives to obtain a desired, tasty food composition, may be added, such as conventional milk solids, vitamins, minerals, food grade acids and salts thereof, flavourings, colourings, artificial sweeteners, preservatives, bulking agents such as Simpless\u2122 from Kelco Biopolymers, isomaltose, trehalose, tagatose, erythritol and polydextrose.","Suitable food grade acids comprise inter alia citric acid, fumaric acid, acetic acid, adipic acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, sorbic acid and mixtures thereof.","As flavourings may be employed any food grade flavourings desired for the particular purpose, such as fruit flavours, e.g. strawberry, raspberry, orange or lemon, vanilla, peppermint, wintergreen, cinnamon, eucalyptus, coffee, tea, liquorice, etc. Further food grade colourings may be added to obtain a desired appearance of the food composition.","Optionally, one or more artificial sweeteners may be employed in order to obtain a particular sweetness level, such as saccharin and salts thereof, cyclamate salts, acesulfame K, aspartame, alitame, neohesperidin DC, sucralose, stevioside, and thaumatin.","As preservatives any approved preservative may be used, such as benzoic acid, sorbic acid and salts and esters thereof.","It has been found that the above disclosed food composition allows obtention of a lowering of the gelation temperature of the food composition in question to less than 95\u00b0 C. A lowering of the gelation temperature and, consequently, the depositing temperature represents a substantial improvement in the confectionery industry, since less complicated apparatuses and simpler and more cost effective production methods may be employed during manufacture.","The food composition according to the invention is in a preferred embodiment a high sugar confectionery, such as soft candies, also known as wine gums, gummy candies or chews. Thus, it has been shown that the present invention provides a food composition having a unique new texture resembling the chewiness conventionally obtained by means of gelatine as gelling agent.","The food composition in another embodiment of the invention is an aerated confectionery and further comprises a whipping agent. Aerated confectioneries, such as marshmallows, can thus successfully be prepared by the present invention.","Further, the food composition according to the invention can take the form of glazings.","It must be appreciated, however, that the present invention is not limited to the above disclosed specific embodiments. On the contrary, the present invention may be employed to produce a variety of other high sugar confectioneries, such as leathers, angel kisses, chocolate containing candies, fillings, reversible glazings, heat stable glazings, thixotrophic glazings, nappages, lollypops, liqourice products, candy bars, jelly beans and pastils etc.","The present invention also provides a process for producing the food composition according to the invention by (a) dispersing carrageenan in a syrup of a non sucrose sweetener at a temperature sufficient to disperse the carrageenan in said syrup while stirring, (b) adding water and heating the mixture to the boiling point thereof, (c) adjusting the soluble solids content to from about 50% to about 90% by weight, (d) depositing said mixture and (e) cooling said mixture to below the depositing temperature of said mixture. Any sucrose to be employed in order to obtain a desired sweetness level is added after heating the mixture to the boiling point thereof.","The food composition obtained through the above process is preferably deposited in moulds and left to stand for a few minutes up to about one hour. Thus, whereas prior art gelatine gelled confectioneries tend to adhere to moulds of plastics and metal and consequently have to be deposited in starch moulds and necessitates standing for up to a week in order to obtain a final texture, the food composition according to the invention gels instantaneously, can be deposited in any type of mould, such as metal and plastic moulds, and can be demoulded within minutes up to about one hour. The present invention thus allows a faster and more flexible production of gelled food compositions.","Any further ingredients of the food composition, such as food grade acids, flavourings, colourings, artificial sweeteners or preservatives are preferably added after adjustment of the soluble solids content in step (c). In the case of production of aerated confectioneries, a whipping agent is separately mixed with water and any icing or confectioner's sugar and beaten to a stiff foam before addition to the high solids composition.","While the above disclosed process is the preferred one, the present invention is not limited thereto. Thus, the food composition according to the invention may also be produced by a process, whereby carrageenan is dispersed in sucrose, if any, the dry mixture obtained is dissolved in water and heated, non sucrose sweetener and optionally any additional sucrose is added to the hot mixture, whereupon the soluble solids content is adjusted to the desired level. Finally, the product obtained is cooled to below the depositing temperature.

5\u00b0 C., Gel strength (in grams of force), at 5\u00b0 C. at a 2 mm, 4 mm, and 8 mm compression distance, and Distance to break (DT) at 5\u00b0 C., which parameters are measured with a Texture Analyzer on test samples deposited in Bloom glasses.","Bloom glasses: Pyrex\u2122 glass cylinders of a diameter of 700 mm and a height of 40 mm, available from Bibby Sterilin Ltd., Stone, Staffordshire, Great Britain.","Break Strength","The Break strength (BS) is determined as the force (in grams) required to compress the sample to break with a 0.5\u2033 (1.25 cm) diameter probe.","Gel Strength","The Gel strength is determined as the force (in grams) required to compress the gel 2, 4, and 8 mm, respectively, with a 0.5\u2033 (1.25 cm) diameter probe.","Distance to Break","The Distance to break (DT, Distance Travelled) is determined as the distance (in mm) it takes to break the gel.","In these experiments the probe speed is 1 mm\/sec.","Refractometer","Part of the gel from one of the Bloom glasses is used for measurement of soluble solids in a refractometer, available from Bellingham & Stanley Ltd., Great Britain, covering the range 40 to 80% SS or 75 to 93% SS.","Depositing Temperature","Said temperature is measured with a thermometer placed in the centre of a depository funnel. The depositing temperature is read as the temperature just before the material is non-flowable.","Gelation Temperature","The gelation temperature, T, is the temperature at which the gel-forming process initiates. It is determined as the intersection of the graphs of elastic modulus, G\u2032, and viscous modulus, G\u2033, respectively.","Rheological measurements: Rheological measurements to determine the elastic modulus, G\u2032, the viscous modulus, G\u2033, as well as the viscosity versus temperature were performed using a Haake Rheometer, RS100, Rheostress, Haake, Germany.","Measurements were performed using the following settings:\n\n","Springiness is a measure of the ability of the sample to regain its original shape after compression. The sample is placed under a cylinder probe, avoiding any irregular or non-representative areas. The probe then compresses the sample until it has compressed 20% of the product height. The probe holds this position for 60 seconds and then withdraws from the sample and returns to its starting position. The force on the probe after 60 seconds at the 20%-position is recorded (F 60). % springiness is calculated from the expression: \n\n\nwherein Fis the force measured after 0 seconds.\n","Test results
