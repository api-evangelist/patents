{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/220,087 filed Jun. 24, 2009, the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to margin calculations associated with computerized market places. In particular it relates to a computer system and method for calculating optimal margin requirements in clearing systems.","Computerized market places have in the last few years undergone major changes and a lot of money has been invested in research and development in order to improve the systems. However even though the current systems in use are very sophisticated there exist needs to even further improve computerized systems associated with computerized market places. The computer systems associated with computerized market places are for example the central exchange system where the actual matching of orders takes place, clearing and settlement systems for handling post trade activities and trading systems that are the systems that traders uses in order to send in orders to the central exchange system.","In order to trade different financial instruments such as stocks, options, futures, forwards and so forth the members connected to the market place must typically be associated with at least one clearing account in a clearing house that keeps collateral. The reason for this is that the clearinghouse works as an intermediary between the seller and the buyer and in order to avoid that any one of the parties of a trade defaults so that an agreed trade can not be executed the clearinghouse needs collateral stored in an account. Usually this collateral is stored in a margin account and can be divided into initial margin and variation margin. The initial margin shall cover heavy market movements of the positions and the variation margin is the positions' accumulated profit and loss, which is typically subject to a daily mark to market. The initial margin can be calculated using different positions in different financial instruments and by netting positions.","A problem that the clearing houses are facing is the issue of making sure that there is enough initial margin in order to cover heavy market movements for a desired number of lead days but also that the margin requirement is not over conservative since this will restrain the market.","Commercial available margin models such as SPAN, OMS II and TIMS calculate initial margin per contract. Correlations between these contracts are handled differently between these models but in general all are ill suited for markets that exhibit very strong correlation. Furthermore calculating initial margin per contract is not optimal for certain instruments such as FX forwards and interest swaps since the total risk can be closed out by a combination of several different contracts. Calculating initial margin per contract will therefore give over conservative margin requirements for these types of portfolios.","Hence there is a need for an improved method and system for providing margin requirements.","Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide a solution for an improved clearing house.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a solution that is able to handle multi currency products within the same margin system run.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a solution that is able to calculate an optimal margin requirement for instrument positions in an account.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a solution that is able to calculate an optimal margin requirement for an account associated with FX forwards.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a solution that is able to calculate an optimal margin requirement for an account associated with interest rate swaps.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a solution that is able to calculate an optimal margin requirement for an account associated with multiple instrument types.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a solution that is able to netting contracts in a new way.","At least one of the above objects is obtained by the present invention as set out in the appended claims.","According to a first aspect of the invention this is achieved by a computer system for calculating margin requirements, the computer system comprising\n\n","wherein the computer system is configured such that the processor divides the contracts in the memory into cash flows.","Letting the computer system break up the individual contracts into cash flows has the advantage that margin amounts can be lowered without being less conservative when managing the risk of e.g. a clearing house.","In one embodiment the computer system can be configured to netting the different cash flows of a contract against other cash flows of other contracts. This has the advantage that a more optimal margin requirement can be achieved.","Furthermore the computer system further can be configured to treat each cash flow separately. This has the advantage that a more flexible system can be obtained.","In another embodiment the computer system can further be configured to net currency exposures across future value dates for the cash flows of the contracts. This has the advantage that margin can be calculated on contracts and\/or positions having a risk exposure.","In one embodiment the computer system is configured to handle multi currency products within the same margin system run.","The computer system can be a computer system configured such that it can be used for a clearing house computer system.","In a further embodiment the contracts can be divided up into their relevant currencies.","In accordance with second aspect of the invention, the above object is obtained by a computerized method for calculating margin requirements implemented on a computer system, the computer system comprising a memory comprising contracts and a processor associated with the memory, the method comprising the steps of:\n\n","By letting the computerized method breaking up the individual contracts into cash flows has the advantage that margin amounts can be lowered without being less conservative when managing the risk of e.g. a clearing house.","In one embodiment the computerized method can comprise the steps of:\n\n","By concentrating the calculations on sub parts of the contracts the quite cumbersome set up of a correlation structure in the existing margin models can be avoided.

Secondly the margin model must consider the portfolio as a whole. This implies that the model shall net between several positions that combined closes the future payments in one currency.","Background and Formulas","FX Outright Forward","A FX Outright Forward is an agreement to, at the value date, exchange an amount of the fixed currency for an amount of the variable currency to a contracted exchange rate.

Further, with the prior art margin methods it is currently only technically possible to define a market with one currency. Hence, with the prior art margin method OMS II, one FX market would have to be defined per variable currency. All relevant currencies could later be defined as underlying instruments in each FX market as described by the example below.","Example: EUR\/SEK","The Spot FX currency pair EUR\/SEK would be defined as a spot contract of EUR in the SEK FX market.","OMS II would only be able to handle correlation within one currency. Hence, OMS II will give over conservative margin requirements for portfolios that have netted their future payments by buying and selling several positions with different variable currencies (for example bought USD\/JPY, bought EUR\/USD and sold EUR\/JPY).","The present invention solves this problem. The computer implemented margin calculation method (NOMX CFM) of the present invention preferably calculates the initial margin per currency. This procedure is to divided into the steps described below.","Variation Margin","A variation margin will be calculated per position and this will be equal to that position's PnL calculated according to Equation 2 and Equation 3. If desired, it will be possible to perform net present value calculations of the PnLs when calculating the variation margin.","The total variation margin for one account will be the sum of the PnLs for all positions in that account.

This risk is accounted for in NOMX CFM by simulating different shifts in the interest rate curves. NOMX CFM is flexible and each exchange may choose their own way to stress the yield curves. This text present three different methods to stress the yield curve. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention (NOMX CFM) the interest rate shifts will be performed by the \u201cRolling Value Method\u201d.","Historical Simulations","In this method a number of actual yield curve shifts between an appropriate numbers of days are stored in a database (let us say 500 days for the discussion). One way of doing this is to calculate the percentage shift for each day in the interest rate curves and store that number. When the NPV are to be calculated the interest rate curve of today is shifted in the 500 possible different ways and Equation (4) is used to calculate a NPV per currency. The interest rate curve that produces the lowest NPV would then be used and that would also be the NPV to use as the margin figure.","Pros:","The advantage is that the correlation pattern of the past 500 days is automatically included in the calculations,","Principal Component Analysis","In this method the movements of the interest rate curves are analyzed and the largest independent movements are identified. For most markets this is\n\n","Since these movement generally explain most of the movement of an interest rate curve these factors can be used to calculate margins with a reasonable amount of confidence. The different movements are independent of each other which mean that one can calculate margins by having parameters define each movement. When the NPV are to be calculated the interest rate curves of today are shifted according to their principal components and Equation (4) is used to calculate a NPV per currency. The interest rate curve that produces the lowest NPV would then be used and that would also be the NPV to use as the margin figure.","Pros:","The yield curves will always look reasonable (no spikes or saw tooth shapes). It will be possible to introduce correlation between yield curves in different currencies with this method.","Rolling Value Method","In this method the swap forward curve is shifted in a rolling fashion starting with the cash flow furthest away.","Definitions","CCis the value of all future cash flows in currency i later than date j discounted back to date j.","ris the risk free interest rate in currency i for the time period from date j to date j+1.","\u0394ris the interest rate shift risk parameter.

five year swap contract in the cash flow table. Between 2009-08-05 and 2011-05-05 the cash flows from the two year swap contract were also exposed to shifts in the swap forward curve and the positive sign of the fixed leg cash flows of the two year swap made the sign of CCchange on 2011-05-05. The forward curve was therefore stressed upward between 2010-02-05 and 2011-05-05. However, since the fixed leg of the five year swap contract had a higher traded yield then the fixed leg of the two year swap contract, CCgradually decreased and on 2009-11-05 the sign of CCwas changed and the forward curve as well as the zero curve were stressed downward.","Table 19 shows the swap portfolio's market value and the margin produced by the rolling value method as well as by parallel shifting the swap curves upwards and downward.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0313","num":"0359"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00019","num":"00019"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 19"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"The swap portfolio's market value and margin."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Margin","Margin","Margin"]},{"entry":[{},"Market","(Rolling","(Parallel Shift","(Parallel Shift"]},{"entry":[{},"Value","Value)","Upward)","Downward)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"SEK 85","SEK \u22125 494","SEK 5 540","SEK \u22125 451"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"In  some procedural steps of a computerized method for calculating margin requirements implemented on a computer system are illustrated.
