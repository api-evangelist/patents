Further, a technique is proposed which provides an extensible application by making use of the portability of a program provided in an application operating environment such as Java\u2122. Java\u2122 is a registered trademark of Oracle\u00ae and\/or its affiliates.","To improve the functions and usability of the image forming apparatus, an application that operates under an application operating environment, such as the Java\u2122 environment, is created and installed in the image forming apparatus, whereby it is possible to realize desired functions in the image forming apparatus.","As an application platform, there has been proposed an OSGi (Open Services Gateway initiative) Service Platform (hereinafter simply referred to as the \u201cOSGi\u201d), which is an application platform for built-in devices, operating under an application operating environment such as Java\u2122.","The OSGi defines a bundle as a management unit of a software module, and defines specifications for managing a life cycle of install, start, stop, update, and uninstall.","The bundle refers to a module, operating in an application operating environment such as Java\u2122. Further, the OSGi can provide the application with built-in functions, such as a copy function, a scan function, and a print function.","Further, the specifications of the OSGi include a host bundle and a fragment bundle. The fragment bundle is a bundle in a form which does not operate singly, but attaches the bundle itself to a class loader space of the host bundle.","To correct or extend the application, the function of the host bundle is corrected or extended using the fragment bundle, whereby it is possible to reduce the size of a file to be installed, which contributes to efficient module distribution.","Under the above-described technical background, many of image forming apparatuses are not provided with a wealth of system resources in view of cost reduction. For this reason, to install or start an application, there has been proposed a technique that checks whether or not system resources required for proper operation of the application can be secured to thereby prevent occurrence of a failure or an erroneous operation of the apparatus (see e.g. Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2011-243232).","However, in a case where a fragment bundle is installed, for example, amounts of resources required by an installed host bundle are sometimes increased. In this case, it is impossible for the amounts of the resources checked during installation or execution of the host bundle to guarantee the securing of the system resources required for proper operation of the application.","Further, some host bundles provided on the precondition of using a fragment bundle perform a function equipped in the fragment bundle instead of using a corresponding standard function of the host bundle.","In such a case, the required amounts of resources are sometimes reduced by the use of the fragment bundle. Therefore, uninstallation of the fragment bundle increases the amounts of resources required by the application, and hence, depending on the amounts of the resources, it is impossible to uninstall the fragment bundle alone.","As described above, in the conventional technique, when installing or uninstalling an application for extension, amounts of resources changed by installation or uninstallation of the application for extension are not taken into account.","The present invention provides an information processing apparatus that is capable of performing application installation control while taking into account amounts of resources to be changed by installation of an extension application for extending a function of an application associated therewith, a method of controlling the information processing apparatus, and a storage medium.","In a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an information processing apparatus that is capable of installing an extension application which operates using resources of the information processing apparatus and extends a function of an application installed in the information processing apparatus, comprising a calculation unit configured to calculate, in a case where the extension application is to be installed, respective total values of amounts of resources that are used by installed applications including an extension target application which is assumed to have been extended in function by the extension application, a determination unit configured to determine whether or not the total values calculated by the calculation unit are within allowable upper limit values allowed by the information processing apparatus, and an installation unit configured to install the extension application in a case where it is determined by the determination unit that the total values are within the allowable upper limit values.","In a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of controlling an information processing apparatus that is capable of installing an extension application which operates using resources of the information processing apparatus and extends a function of an application installed in the information processing apparatus, comprising calculating, in a case where the extension application is to be installed, respective total values of amounts of resources that are used by installed applications including an extension target application which is assumed to have been extended in function by the extension application, determining whether or not the total values calculated by said calculating are within allowable upper limit values allowed by the information processing apparatus, and installing the extension application in a case where it is determined by said determining that the total values are within the allowable upper limit values.","In a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing a computer-executable program for executing a method of controlling an information processing apparatus that is capable of installing an extension application which operates using resources of the information processing apparatus and extends a function of an application installed in the information processing apparatus, wherein the method comprises calculating, in a case where the extension application is to be installed, respective total values of amounts of resources that are used by installed applications including an extension target application which is assumed to have been extended in function by the extension application, determining whether or not the total values calculated by said calculating are within allowable upper limit values allowed by the information processing apparatus, and installing the extension application in a case where it is determined by said determining that the total values are within the allowable upper limit values.","According to the present invention, there are calculated respective total values of amounts of resources used by installed applications including the extension target application which is assumed to have been extended in function by the extension application, and in a case where the calculated total values are within the allowable upper limit values allowed by the information processing apparatus, the extension application is installed. Therefore, it is possible to perform application installation control while taking into account amounts of resources to be changed by installation of an extension application for extending a function of an application associated therewith.","Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments (with reference to the attached drawings).","The present invention will now be described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings showing embodiments thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"130"},"Referring to , the image forming apparatus  includes a controller . The controller  is comprised of a CPU , a ROM , a RAM , an HDD (Hard Disk Drive) , a console section interface , a network interface , a scanner interface , an image processor , a printer interface , a scanner section , a printer section , and a console section , which are connected to each other by a system bus .","The CPU  performs centralized control of access to various types of hardware connected to the system bus  based on a control program and the like stored in the ROM . Further, the CPU  also performs centralized control of various processes performed by the controller .","The ROM  is a read only nonvolatile storage device, and stores a boot program and the like for the image forming apparatus .","The RAM  serves as a system work memory for the operation of the CPU , and also serves as a memory for temporarily storing various programs and data. The RAM  is implemented by either of an FRAM (Ferroelectric Random Access Memory: registered trademark) and an SRAM (Static RAM) which are capable of storing data even after the image forming apparatus  is powered off, or a DRAM (Dynamic RAM) from which data is deleted when the image forming apparatus  is powered off.","The HDD  is a nonvolatile storage device, and stores various programs, such as a system application and various types of data. Applications installed in the present embodiment are stored in the HDD .","The console section interface  connects between the system bus  and the console section .","More specifically, the console section interface  receives data from the system bus , and displays the data on the console section . Further, the console section interface  outputs information input from the console section  to the system bus . The user provides instructions and information to the image forming apparatus  via the console section .","The network interface  is connected to a LAN (Local Area Network)  and a WAN (Wide Area Network) , and transmits and receives information to and from external apparatuses. The scanner interface  outputs image data received from the scanner section  to the system bus .","The image processor  performs turning, compression, expansion, and so forth, on image data. The printer interface  receives image data sent from the image processor , and output the image data to the printer section . The printer section  prints image data output from the printer interface  on a recording medium, such as a sheet.","As described above, similar to a general information processing apparatus, the image forming apparatus  is comprised of a computing device, volatile storage devices, nonvolatile storage devices, and so forth.","Although a PC for communicating with the image forming apparatus  configured as above is a general personal computer capable of executing a web browser, the PC may be replaced by a smart phone or a tablet terminal which is capable of executing a web browser.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","130"]},"Software shown in  is stored in the ROM  or the HDD , and is executed by the CPU . Further, various information used during execution of the software is stored in the RAM  or the HDD , and is exchanged between the functions of the software.","The software includes an OS (Operating System) platform . A software platform  is built on the OS platform .","The software platform  is formed as a run-time environment of a JVM  (Java\u2122 Virtual Machine), which operates under JAVA\u2122 application operating environment, and includes the JVM  as an interpreter, a library , and a frame work group .","The library  includes a standard API (Application Programming Interface) library. Further, the frame work group  includes an OSGi (Open Services Gateway initiative)  and an OSGi extension section .","The OSGi  causes a plurality of applications to operate on the JVM  which is single. Further, the OSGi  provides functions for life cycle management of applications, and communication between the applications. Furthermore, a plurality of system services are preinstalled on the OSGi . The OSGi extension section  is capable of extending the functions of the OSGi , on an as-needed basis.","Further, when the image forming apparatus  is started up, the OSGi  starts the services of an installation controller , an application management section , a host bundle , and a fragment bundle  attached to the host bundle , according to a service start order list stored in the HDD .","Out of the above components, the host bundle  is an application body, and is a bundle to which the fragment bundle  is attached. Further, the fragment bundle  is an extension application, and is a bundle which does not operate singly but attaches itself to the class loader space of the host bundle .","Here, the term \u201cclass loader\u201d refers to an object which is in charge of loading classes and searching resources. All the classes are loaded into the JVM  by the class loader, and become usable from the application. That is, after installation of the fragment bundle , all the classes become usable as part of the host bundle . Therefore, when the fragment bundle  is installed to attach itself to the host bundle  or uninstalled, in general, the amounts of resources used by the host bundle  are changed.","The extension application includes e.g. a class of Java\u2122, which is an application operating environment, which provides an extension for resource data, such as image data and language data.","Further, the host bundle  provides to the user various processes performed by the image forming apparatus  singly or together with the fragment bundle , under the control of the application management section . Examples of the various processes include processes by applications for manipulating and compressing images and processes by an application for performing department management, such as restrictions on printing, and like other applications. The above-described host bundle  corresponds to an extension target application, and the fragment bundle  corresponds to an extension application for extending the function of the application to be extended. Further, the host bundle  and the fragment bundle  operate using resources of the image forming apparatus . Further, as described above, the image forming apparatus  is configured to be capable of installing a fragment bundle for extending the function of a host bundle installed on the image forming apparatus .","The application management section  manages a plurality of application groups, and performs installation and uninstallation of applications, and so forth, using the installation controller .","Further, the application management section  stores application information and license information including versions of the host bundle  and the fragment bundle , which are installed under the control thereof.","Furthermore, in response to an uninstallation instruction to an application in the image forming apparatus , the application management section  removes the host bundle  or the fragment bundle  from objects to be managed, via the installation controller .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","130"]},"Note that in the example of the present embodiment, the application mentioned in  is intended to mean the host bundle  or the fragment bundle .","Referring to , the PC  displays an application installation UI (user interface) , formed by a web page displayed on an installation screen, described hereinafter, on a web browser (not shown). When the user designates an application that the user desires to install, from the install UI , the PC  installs the application.","Upon receipt of an application file designated from the install UI , the application management section  passes the application file to the installation controller . Upon receipt of the application file, the installation controller  requests the OSGi  to install the application file, and the OSGi  installs the application file. The installed application is managed by the application management section .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIGS. 4B to 4D"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["210","209"]},"Note that attaching of the fragment bundle to the host bundle is sometimes referred to as installation.","As shown in , Bundle-ManifestVersion of a manifest  of the host bundle is specified as 2.
