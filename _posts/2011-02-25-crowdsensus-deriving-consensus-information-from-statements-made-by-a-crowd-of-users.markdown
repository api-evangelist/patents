Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to ascertaining a consensus value for facts from values proposed provided by users.","2. Description of the Background","Online information sources are now frequently updated and corrected by users of the information. All kinds of information on-line is editable by any user, such as business directories, maps, community pages, FAQs, and many other types of information. However that creates the problem of determining the accuracy of user-provided information. Users may be incorrect either on purpose or because the user is mistaken. For example, in the case of a phone number for a business, a user may wish to direct callers to a competing business and provide the competing business' phone number. Alternatively, the user may, as a prank, provide a completely unrelated phone number. Such intentionally incorrect information is unreliable and is also referred to as \u201cspam.\u201d","Unreliable information is becoming more and more of a problem. Malicious users can intentionally mislead others using computer programs that repeatedly change the value of a map attribute to an unreliable value, even as other users correct the unreliable value.","In some approaches to assessing accuracy of user-provided information, expert reviewers assess the information. This however is laborious and time consuming. In extreme cases, it would require a reviewer to physically go somewhere to verify information. Under this approach, it may take days or weeks for incorrect or out-of-date information to be updated.","Errors from incorrect and outdated information lead to very frustrating experiences for users. For example, a user may obtain the phone number for a business from an on-line business directory. If that phone number is wrong, the user will not be able to contact the business. If the number is intentionally incorrect, for example the listed phone number is the phone number of a competing business, the user may even be mislead into contacting a business with whom they did not intend to do business.","In one embodiment, a system and method for updating information about features on maps provided by an online map hosting system allows users to update or correct information about attributes of map features that appear on maps. Users propose values for an attribute from a client device such as a personal computer or a mobile client device such as a smartphone, PDA, laptop, or the like. From the proposed values provided by users, the system determines a consensus value for the attribute of the map feature taking into account the accuracy of users providing the proposed values and the likelihood that the proposed value is unreliable. The consensus value is optionally provided to an online map hosting system that then displays the consensus value when that attribute of the map feature is requested by users of the online map hosting system. The system further determines a likelihood that any individual user provides unreliable information.","A geographic information system comprises a network interface configured to receive proposed values for attributes of map features from client devices. The geographic information system further comprises engines to determine the accuracy of users, the reliability of proposed values as well as users and a consensus value from the proposed values. The geographic information further comprises a user profile database to store profiles for users of the geographic information system and an attribute database to store proposed values for attributes.","The geographic information system optionally provides the determined consensus value for an attribute to an online map hosting system.","In another embodiment, the system and method can also be used to determine a consensus value from values proposed by users for various types of facts. Facts are extrinsically verifiable information.","The features and advantages described in this summary and the following detailed description are not all-inclusive. Many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims hereof.","Introduction","An online map is one example of an online information source that makes information about specific facts available to user. An online map includes a plurality of map features, each of which has multiple attributes. A feature and its attributes correspond to a fact which is extrinsically verifiable. A map feature is anything that might appear on a map that would be of interest to those using a map. Map features include, but are not limited to, natural features such as bodies of water, mountains, forests, rivers, and so forth; man-made features, such as cities, addresses, streets, businesses, airports, train stations, stadiums, ports, buildings; and points of interest (POI) such as historic sites, and landmarks. Attributes of map features are characteristics of the map feature that identify, locate, or describe the feature, and include, for example, the latitude and longitude of the map feature, and the name of the feature. Additional attributes are appropriate depending on the type of map feature. Street address is an attribute of many types of map features. Attributes of map features that are businesses include phone numbers, fax numbers, website address, email address and opening times. Generally, attributes are any pieces of information about a map feature that are useful to users of maps, and can describe the physical, contextual, or semantic aspects of a map feature.","Users communicate to a geographic information system proposed values for attributes of map features, for example when they are missing, out-of-date or incorrect. From the received proposed values for the attribute, the system determines a consensus value. In determining the consensus value, the system determines a number of factors (also called \u201cscores\u201d): the probability that a proposed value is accurate, the probability that the user proposing the value provides accurate information, the probability that the user who provided the value provides unreliable information and the probability that the proposed value is unreliable. The determination of a consensus values is an iterative process where the scores are determined multiple times until each of the scores converges. Then the consensus value is determined.","Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","155","130","105","150"]},"The GI server  comprises a consensus engine , an accuracy engine , a reliability engine , a user profile database  and an attribute database . For simplicity, only one GI server , consensus engine , accuracy engine , reliability engine , user profile database  and attribute database  are shown but in practice many of each of these components may be in operation.","The GI server  is implemented as on one or more server-class computers comprising a CPU, memory, network interface, peripheral interfaces, and other well known components, and executing under the control of one or more server programs. The computers themselves preferably run an open-source operating system such as LINUX, have generally high performance CPUs, with 1G or more of memory, and 100G or more of disk storage. Of course, other types of computers can be used, and it is expected that as more powerful computers are developed in the future, they can be configured in accordance with the teachings here. The functionality implemented by any of the elements can be provided from computer program products that are stored in tangible, non-transitory computer accessible storage mediums (e.g., RAM, hard disk, or optical\/magnetic media), or by equivalent implementations in hardware and\/or firmware.","The network  is typically the Internet, but may also be any network, including but not limited to a LAN, a MAN, a WAN, a mobile, wired or wireless network, telecommunication network, a private network, or a virtual private network, and any combination thereof.","The client  is any type of device that is adapted to access the GI server  over the network  and that allows user to input information which the client  in turn transmits to the GI server . Examples include, but are not limited to, personal computing devices including handheld and mobile devices. Users can access online maps from the online map hosting system  (described below), and propose values for attributes of the map features via the client . The proposed attribute values are received at the GI server  via the network interface . The GI server  determines consensus values from the proposed values, and provides the consensus values to the online map hosting system . For simplicity only three clients  are shown; in practice there will be numerous clients  communicating with GI server .","The online map hosting system  is any web-based application known in the art that provides online maps and information about map features, such as business listings, to users. An exemplary online map hosting system  is GOOGLE\u2122 Maps. Upon receiving a consensus value for an attribute for a map feature from the GI server , the online map hosting system  can incorporate the consensus value as the value for an attribute for the map feature in maps provided by the online map hosting system .","Referring to  in addition to , a description of the components of the GI server  and an overview of the values determined by the engines is provided. The determination of each value described in greater detail after this overview. The accuracy engine  and reliability engine  each provide input to the consensus engine  which in turn determines the consensus value  for the attribute. The accuracy engine  determines a score (\u201cuser accuracy \u201d) indicative of how often the values proposed by a given user are accurate for the attribute for which they are proposed. A user has a high user accuracy score  when the values the user proposes have high probabilities of being the correct value.","The reliability engine  determines a score (\u201cvalue unreliability \u201d) indicative of the likelihood a proposed value is unreliable, which is based on the value probability . The higher the score, the more likely the proposed value is unreliable, or spam. The value unreliability  takes into account all instances of a particular value being proposed regardless of the feature for which the value is being proposed. For example, the value unreliability  of the phone number 312-555-1212 is determined regardless of whether that phone number is being proposed for a pizza parlor, a library or a movie time information line.","Additionally, the reliability engine  determines a score (\u201cuser unreliability \u201d) indicative of the likelihood that each user having proposed a value provides unreliable information. The higher the user unreliability score, the more likely that the user is unreliable or a spammer.","The consensus engine  determines the value probability  which is the probability that a given value is the correct value for the attribute for which it is proposed. The value probability  is based on the user accuracy  of the user proposing the value and optionally on the value unreliability  as well. The value probabilities  for the values proposed for an attribute are analyzed by the consensus engine  to determine the consensus value  for the attribute. The operation of each of these engines is discussed in further detail below.","The user unreliability , value unreliability , user accuracy , value probability , and consensus value  are determined regularly in an iterative process. As the iterative process proceeds until the determined scores individually stabilize or converge. The process may perform a fixed number of iterations, or it may perform as many iterations as needed, until the difference between the quantities computed in two successive iteration steps is below a pre-defined threshold.","The user profile database  stores profiles for users of the GI server  including for each user, a user ID, the user accuracy , user unreliability  and reference to the values proposed by the user and the value probability  for the proposed values stored in the attribute database .","The attribute database  stores the proposed values proposed by users for attributes of the map features as well as the value unreliability  and value probability  for the proposed values.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["225","155","110","305","100","140","100","100"]},"The consensus engine  determines  the value probabilities  for the proposed values for an attribute. In order to determine  value probabilities  for the proposed values for an attribute, the consensus engine  retrieves  a subset of proposed values for the attribute as well as the value unreliability  for each from the attribute database . The consensus engine  also retrieves  the user accuracy  for the user providing each proposed value from the user profile database .
