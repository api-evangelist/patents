The source of proanthocyanidins may be a botanical extract and the source of arginine may be from arginine aspartate.","When a male is in his early twenties, it's easy to take peak sexual performance for granted. Yet as time passes, the male body's biological system changes, and he may notice that his sexual stamina, performance and even pleasure begin to decrease. Getting \u201cin the mood\u201d may start to take a little effort.","Many women have problems with sex when they reach menopause and their ovaries produce smaller amounts of sex hormones. Lower levels of estrogen can make the vaginal tissue dry, and less androgen leads to less sexual desire and arousal.","One important difference affecting sexual desire is that men have levels of testosterone that are 20 to 30 times what women have. Men's testosterone levels gradually decline over time but they do not experience a drop-off as women do at menopause. In men and women, testosterone and other androgens work to increase desire.","Androgen gels and patches for women are being considered for women with sexual dysfunction. Another possibility to overcome the female androgen deficiency syndrome is to supply women with 50 mg dehydroepiandrosterone per day, which facilitates the enhanced production of testosterone, dehydrotestosterone, androstenedione and androstenediol. That improved female androgenic profile causes intense sexual thoughts and a general enhancement in mental and physical sexual arousal (Spark, R. F., 2002; Hackbert, L. and Heiman J. R., 2002).","To increase blood flow in the female genital tissue is also useful to improve sexual wellness. The New York Times on Mar. 25, 2003 published an article entitled \u201cEffort to Make Sex Drug for Women Challenges Experts\u201d. According to the article, researchers found that women's sex organs are not as readily affected as men's by sildenafil, which is the active ingredient of a drug sold under the trademark VIAGRA\u00ae. Blocking the same enzyme in women that normally inhibits blood flow does not increase circulation to genital tissue so drastically as in men for causing engorgement of erectile tissue. Studies suggest that sildenafil alone does not fix female arousal problems. However, when taken together with supplemental hormones, at least one study showed that 57 percent of 202 postmenopausal women involved in a study reported improved genital sensations, compared with 43 percent of a placebo group. Forty-one percent of the sildenafil group members reported greater satisfaction with sex, compared with 27 percent in the placebo group. Although the differences between the two groups were modest, the study suggests that sildenafil could help women with healthy hormone levels and in happy relationships. Nevertheless sildenafil is a medicament that needs a strict prescription since the side effects are numerous.","One may surmise that female sexual function is accomplished physiologically in a similar manner like in man in a way that cGMP triggers lubrication and engorgement of the clitoral tissue. The studies mentioned in the previously mentioned article suggest the possibility that when women have a healthy hormone level, such dietary supplements may help improve sexual function in women to some extent. Another way to increase the blood flow into the female or male sexual organs is to increase the production of nitric oxide, which in turn triggers the release of cGMP. Whereas sildenafil and related substances lead to a sustained increase of blood content of the male or female sexual organs by blocking the enzymatic destruction of the vasodilating cGMP, nitric oxide produces the same increased blood volume by enhancing the production of cGMP. As a physiological source for nitric oxide production, the aminoacid L-arginine is used.","The enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase produces nitric oxide from L-arginine. To provide an enhanced and sustained blood flow to the sexual organs, it is first of all necessary to supplement the organism with the substrate L-arginine in sufficient quantities. However, the presence of high concentrations of L-arginine alone does not lead to a substantial higher blood flow to the sexual organs. It is necessary to stimulate additionally the endothelial nitric oxide synthase, so that nitric oxide production from L-arginine is catalyzed by the active enzyme. A potent stimulator of endothelial nitric oxide synthase is a proanthocyanidins-containing extract.","Proanthocyanidins represent a group of plant polyphenols found in roots, barks and fruits with an astringent taste. Proanthocyanidins include the subgroups of procyanidins and prodelphinidins. Proanthocyanidins are biopolymers composed of flavan subunits. Procyanidins are composed of catechin and epicatechin units, also called monomeric procyanidins.","Proanthocyanidins are extracted from plant material by conventional methods using solvents like water, ethanol or acetone or fluid carbon dioxide. The extracts are purified by solvent\/solvent extraction, ultra filtration or chromatographic procedures. The purified extracts are concentrated by solvent evaporation, freeze drying or spray drying.","A proanthocyanidin-rich extract from the bark of French maritime pine is distributed under the tradename Pycnogenol\u00ae by Horphag Research, Switzerland. The extract contains 70-75% by weight procyanidins and other flavanols such as catechin, epicatechin and taxifolin. Other proanthocyanidins rich extracts can be obtained from grape seeds, cones from cypress trees, cocoa beans or other plant materials. Pycnogenol\u00ae pine bark extract has been shown to stimulate endothelial nitric oxide synthase and to induce vasodilation (Fitzpatrick, D. F., Bing, B., Rohdewald, P., 1998).","US 2004137081 A1 (Rohdewald P. et al.) discloses that sexual wellness or sexual fitness is enhanced over time by administrating on a daily basis a source of proanthocyanidins and a source of arginine. Both sources may be blended into a composition or taken separately from a kit. The source of arginine may be a salt or peptide of L-arginine and aspartic acid such as arginine aspartate. The proanthocyanidins stimulate an endothelial NO-synthase enzyme, which serves as a catalyst for synthesis of the nitric oxide from a substration that is the source of the arginine. A sufficient amount of the nitric oxide is released over time to enhance sexual wellness or sexual fitness. In case of low levels of androgenic hormones in both sexes, the combination may contain as a further ingredient a sex hormone or a sex hormone precursor or a sex hormone stimulant or a sex hormone bioavailability enhancer.","WO 2008\/115583 A1 (Mini John) uses the principles of traditional Chinese medicine in systematic and non-traditional ways to arrive at balanced formulas that bring about the goals desired in Chinese Medicine without hindering the digestibility of the formulations or taxing the user's organs. For example, the disclosed formulations utilize a number of adaptogenic herbs, traditional medicinal herbs and highly nutritious food substances, which allow the body to assimilate these substances and bring them to where they can best be used to treat the conditions or reduce various the side effects disclosed.","WO 01\/91589 A1 (SIGMA TAU HEALTHSCIENCE SPA) discloses a health food\/dietary supplement with antioxidant activity, comprising as its characterising components an alkanoyl carnitine and a combination of polyphenols extracted from trees or shrubs.","US 2008305096 A1 (UNICITY INTERNATIONAL INC) discloses a method of providing controlled release of a biologically active substance within a subject's digestive system. The biologically active substance is administered concurrently with one or more soluble fibers in an oral dosage unit. The soluble fibers interact with the biologically active substance within the subject's digestive system to moderate and control the release of the biologically active substances in the subject's bloodstream. This provides more constant blood concentrations of the biologically active substances. The amount of soluble fibers in the oral dosage unit is greater than 40% by weight, and in some cases greater than 50% by weight of the oral dosage unit. The oral dosage unit typically contains from about 1 to 15 g of soluble fiber, and in some cases from about 3 to 5 g of soluble fiber. The biologically active substance may contain phytonutrients that promote the subject's cardiovascular system, immune system, or weight management.","JP 2004269487 A (Efuekuto K K et al.) provides a method in which a high purity proanthocyanidin can be produced by a simple means. This method for producing proanthocyanidin is characterized by extracting it from peanut seeds as it is with water, a water-miscible organic solvent or a mixture thereof. Further this document relates to proanthocyanidin obtained by the method, that having specified physicochemical properties, an extract from peanut seeds having specified physicochemical properties, and a medicinal composition, cosmetic or foodstuffs containing proanthocyanidin or the extract from peanut seeds.","RU 2388811 C2 (OOO TJUMEN) discloses a composition of components for production of medicinal balsam containing, per 1000 dhal of balsam, water pepper (root part)\u20145 kg.

The balsam alcohol proof (vol) is 43%, total extract is 16.8 g\/100 cm3, the balsam has a specific taste, colour and aroma. The composition is used for the improvement of the balsam medicinal properties as a remedy against sexual weakness of men and women that enhances vigour and vitality.","Sexual dysfunction (SD), particularly in postmenopausal, healthy (>55) women, is currently insufficiently understood, partially because of the great difficulty most women have to openly discuss these problems. Sexual dysfunction is suggested to be more common in women (43%) than in men (31%). The incidence and perception of sexual dysfunction are very different considering population type, age, social class, income, education and women's priorities.","The incidence of SD in women increases with age and with the presence of chronic diseases (i.e., diabetes).","Treatment with drugs, such as those used for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, may have negative effects on sexual function and interest. Vaginal dryness is progressively more frequent with age, and vaginal infections are more common with increasing age and in diabetic women. They may cause SD, loss of interest, and difficult or painful intercourse that can be associated with anxiety and fear, contributing to a lack of motivation. In diabetic women, microangiopathy, neuropathy and edema, in association with frequent subclinical or clinical infections, cause mucosal alterations, altered responses to sexual stimulations, and eventually chronic vaginal dryness, which may become a key element in altering sexual life and may lead to sexual dysfunction.","However, these problems may also occur in apparently healthy women. Recent studies have evaluated these problems and possible solutions. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) has been established and utilized in several studies to assess sexual function.","There is still a need for an effective and safe composition for improving sexual fitness or wellness of both sexes, the man sexual enhancement, the treatment of sexual dysfunction.","One aspect of the invention resides in a product that, when administered, offers both sexes a safe, natural way to preserve and maintain sexual responsiveness, endurance and enjoyment. It includes a blend or preparation of ingredients, namely, a source of proanthocyanidines, a substrate that is a source of arginine, preferably a salt or dipeptide of L-arginine and aspartic acid, such as arginine aspartate or citrulline or ornithine or any arginine precursors or derivatives, rose hip extracts and\/or extracts or a mixture thereof. When the blend is administered, the endothelial NO-synthase is stimulated by the proanthocyanidins. Nitric oxide is released from the substrate in response to the stimulated endothelial NO-synthase enzyme, which acts as a catalyst for synthesis of the nitric oxide from the substrate. The source of arginine and proanthocyanidins are in therapeutically effective amounts to cause a sufficient amount of the nitric oxide to be released from the synthesis so that when fresh supplies are taken on a daily basis over a period of time, sexual fitness or sexual wellness improves by the end of the period of time.","In one aspect of the present invention there is provided a preparation consisting in the combination of a source of arginine and a source of proanthocyanidins as well as Rose hip and\/or extracts thereof or and\/or extracts thereof or a mixture of Rose hip and ","In another aspect, the present invention provides for a dietary or food supplement, a food preparation, a beverage, a medicament and a topical preparation comprising the preparation of the present invention.","In a further aspect, the preparation of the present invention is provided for improving sexual fitness or wellness of both sexes, the man sexual enhancement, the treatment of sexual dysfunction and the health of the sexual vascular system of both sexes.","Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, suitable methods and materials are described below.

A person who is sexually fit is efficient in their capacity to think, feel, and behave in a sexual manner without shame, embarrassment, or hidden agendas of falsely boosting their ego or self-esteem. People who reach and practice this style of fitness are more likely to function efficiently in all aspects of their perceptual world. These fortunate individuals are more confident, physically ill less often, and manage stressful events more successfully. Sexual fitness is an achieved state of being allowing people to perform better in every action they engage in. Having this capability affords person to feel confident in all situations whether a partner is involved or not.","\u201cSexual wellness\u201d of both sexes is the active participation of the individual in his or her life by addressing the numerous issues within sexual health. The process defined as sexual wellness is to improved sexual health. \u201cSexual health\u201d is a state of physical, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality. It requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence (definition WHO 2002). In particular, Sexual health is the integration of the somatic, emotional, intellectual, and social aspects of sexual being, in ways that are positively enriching and that enhance personality, communication, and love. Fundamental to this concept are the right to sexual information and the right to pleasure (definition of WHO 1975). Sexual health is inextricably bound to both physical and mental health.","\u201cMale sexual enhancement\u201d may be defined as the increase of the hardness of erection; the improvement of self-confidence; the improvement of sperm quality, count and motility (spontaneous motion) and fertility; the increase of libido and sex drive; the boosting of the sexual energy level and vitality; the improvement of sexual performance problems i.e. those due to aging as well as the increase of energy and the greater sexual satisfaction with a partner. Men's sexual function is scored using the established \u201cInternational Index of Erectile Function\u201d (IIEF) questionnaire [Rosen et al., 1997], see i.e. example 4. www.seekwellness.com\/mensexuality\/questionnaire.htm","\u201cFemale sexual enhancement\u201d is defined as anything that enhances a woman's sexuality; this includes in particular the increase of libido or sex drive. Low libido or sex drive in women can be caused by a number of factors that vary from one woman to another; fatigue, mild depression, and the multiple roles that women play in daily life can cause psychological issues, which can have an affect on a woman's sexual appetite. Antidepressants, birth control, tranquilizers and mood stabilizers also impact sexual activity and other conditions like diabetes, heart disease and a poor diet can also reduce a woman's sex drive. Woman's sexuality level may be determined by the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) which are defined and detailed in example 2.","\u201cSexual dysfunction\u201d or sexual malfunction in both sexes refers to a difficulty experienced by an individual or a couple during any stage of a normal sexual activity, including desire, arousal or orgasm. Sexual desire disorders or decreased libido are characterized by a lack or absence for some period of time of sexual desire or libido for sexual activity or of sexual fantasies. Sexual arousal disorders were previously known as frigidity in women and impotence in men, though these have now been replaced with less judgmental terms. Impotence is now known as erectile dysfunction, and frigidity has been replaced with a number of terms describing specific problems with, for example, desire or arousal. For both men and women, these conditions can manifest themselves as an aversion to, and avoidance of, sexual contact with a partner. In men, there may be partial or complete failure to attain or maintain an erection, or a lack of sexual excitement and pleasure in sexual activity.","Erectile dysfunction or impotence is a sexual dysfunction characterized by the inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis. The causes of erectile dysfunction may be psychological or physical.","Orgasm disorders are persistent delays or absence of orgasm following a normal sexual excitement phase. The disorder can have physical, psychological, or pharmacological origins.","Sexual pain disorders affect women almost exclusively and are known as dyspareunia (painful intercourse) or vaginismus (an involuntary spasm of the muscles of the vaginal wall that interferes with intercourse).","Proanthocyanidins designates a group of flavonoids that includes the subgroups procyanidins, prodelphinidins and propelargonidins. Proanthocyanidins are homogeneous or heterogeneous polymers consisting of the monomer units catechin or epicatechin, which are connected either by 4-8 or 4-6 linkages, to the effect that a great number of isomer proanthocyanidins exist. Typically, the proanthocyanidins oligomers have a chain length of 2-12 monomer units. Proanthocyanidins may be synthesized or extracted from a plant material. Non-limiting examples of plant material sources of proanthocyanidins include grape seeds, grape skin, pine barks, ginkgo leaves, peanuts, cocoa beans, tamarind, raspberries, currants (black), peanut, almond, apple, cranberry, blueberry, tea leaves. Preferably the source of proanthocyanidin consisting of a plant extract is selected among a pine bark extract, a grape seed extract or an extract of apples, peanut skin, walnuts, pomegranates, raspberries, currants (black), blueberries, almonds, tea, hawthorn or cocoa or combination thereof. Those plant extracts are also referred as \u201cproanthocyanidin rich extracts\u201d.","A well-known product containing proanthocyanidins, which is available in trade as a preparation of a food supplement under the name Pycnogenol\u00ae, is an extract of the French maritime pine bark (), see also U.S. Pat.

Only LH and progesterone levels remained unchanged. Climacteric symptoms were additionally evaluated by the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ). During the observation period (visit 2 and 3) absolutely all WHQ symptoms were downgraded more notably in arm A compared to arm B. Prelox\u00aeLady had a significant effect on improving concentration, anxiety\/fears and somatic symptoms but failed to prevent depression. One of the symptoms less reduced in the placebo group was also the depressed mood. Interestingly, the symptom most influenced by the administration of placebo, was the self-perceived attraction. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) was used to assess sexual function in women. One interesting phenomenon came into focus-pain was the domain less relieved by the real medication and most influenced by the administration of placebo. Treatment in arm A had the most possitive impact on the parameters orgasm and satisfaction, whereas desire and pain were influenced the least.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Prelox Lady\u00ae for improving\/controlling sexual dysfunction (SD) in post-menopausal women with a healthy circulation.","Methods: The Prelox Lady\u00ae and control groups were comparable at inclusion with regard to the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score with 36 women (50.1\u00b13.1 years) and 39 women (51.2\u00b12.3 years), respectively.","Results: After four weeks treatment there was a significant (P<0.05) improvement in the treatment group, which sustained until completion of the eight-week trial period. Minor, no significant changes were observed in controls. The median FSFI score at inclusion was 44.6 and significantly increased to 70.9 after four weeks and remained at this level after eight weeks (71.7; P<0.05 versus baseline). In the control group the total FSFI was 44.1 at inclusion, and reached 45.0 after four weeks and 47.4 after eight weeks, respectively. The treatment with Prelox Lady\u00ae was comparatively more effective than placebo (P=0.022).","Conclusion: This study opens an interesting perspective for women suffering from sexual function problems and suggests a promising new treatment option. Larger studies are required which should also investigate premenopausal and perimenopausal women.","Prelox Lady\u00ae, a registered trademark of Horphag Research, has been developed to improve women's quality of life and sexual function. This proprietary formulation consists of Pycnogenol, L-arginine, L-citrulline, and rose hip extract. Preliminary reports of exploratory investigations studies on L-arginine indicate a specific activity of Prelox Lady\u00ae in improving sensory effects in normal and diabetic subjects both by improving microangiopathy and neuropathy and by an important action of peripheral edema. L-arginine, as a precursor of nitric oxide (NO), has been used alone and in combination with several compounds to improve sexual function.","NO is the key mediator for the up-regulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) that mediates circulation related to sexual function. The conversion of L-arginine to NO is mediated by NOsynthase (NOS). Increasing local L-arginine levels increases NO and Cgmp. L-arginine restores endothelial-derived NO production in conditions associated with reduced NO production, i.e., in aging women, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. Circulatory health improvement with Pycnogenol is understood to be associated with improved endothelial function and enhanced NO synthesis in diverse pathologies.","The first phase of sexual response in females is neurotransmitter-mediated, vascular smooth muscle relaxation, resulting in vaginal increase in flow, activation of mucosal glands, vaginal wall engorgement, vaginal luminal diameter expansion and increased clitoral perfusion.","Different types of microangiopathy, atherosclerosis, smoking, diabetes, and other cardiovascular diseases and drug treatments all interfere with these functions, reducing vaginal engorgement and mucosal activation and causing a reduction in clitoral perfusional and erectile alterations. NO is involved in all these responses. Also, in many post-menopausal women, vaginal atrophy, a decrease in sexual interest and function, may be NO-dependent. Estrogen level reduction or withdrawal may also play an important role in the regulation of vaginal NO functions (in nerves, smooth muscle, vascular endothelium and vaginal mucosa). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Prelox Lady\u00ae administered for improving\/controlling SD in healthy postmenopausal women with normal circulation.","Materials and Methods","The study included healthy, post-menopausal women in the age range of 45 to 55 years. In accordance with a recent protocol, the evaluation method used was the FSFI, a validated questionnaire (Table 16) with multidimensional scales for assessment of female sexual function. Normal women with SD were assessed with a defined screening program for healthy women previously screened for cardiovascular problems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0170","num":"0171"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00016","num":"00016"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 16"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Scoring for the FSFI"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},"Minimum",{}]},{"entry":["Domain","Item Number ","Score Range","Score Score","Maximum"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Desire","1, 2","1-5","2","10"]},{"entry":["Arousal","3, 4, 5, 6","0-5","0","20"]},{"entry":["Lubrication ","7, 8, 9, 10","0-5","0","20"]},{"entry":["Orgasm","11, 12, 13","0-5","0","15"]},{"entry":["Satisfaction ","14, 15, 16","0 (or 1)-5*","2","15"]},{"entry":["Pain","17, 14, 19","0-5","0","15"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"*Range for item 14 = 0-5; range for items 15 and 16 = 1-5"}]}}]}},"br":{}},"Their main endocrinological functions (including thyroid functional values and other metabolic parameters) were within normal values. These women had not been included in previous studies. No clinically significant cardiovascular disease was present at the moment of inclusion. Their inclusion body-mass index (BMI) was <24. A satisfactory educational and cultural-social status was considered important for inclusion and for a full understanding and adherence to the study protocol. Sexual dysfunction and defined previous menopause, and full consent (after careful information about the study) were important inclusion criteria. The included women had no surgery or hormonal treatment within the past twelve months before inclusion or during the evaluation period. Prelox Lady\u00ae tablets contain a proprietary combination of 20 mg Pycnogenol\u00ae, 200 mg L-arginine, 200 mg L-citrulline and 50 mg rose hip extract. In this study the daily dosage was four tablets (two tablets\/twice daily) for a total of eight weeks. The FSFI score was used to estimate the efficacy of Prelox Lady\u00ae on specific aspects and on the global sexual activity of women. Results were recorded at baseline, and after four and eight weeks of treatment.","A comparable group of women served as the control group and took similar tablets that did not include active substances in the same manner as the treatment group in single-blinded fashion. No medications or other supplements were used during the trial period, while daily vitamins and minerals were permitted.","Statistical Analysis","The aim of the registry was to analyze data from a group of 80 women, half of whom used active Prelox Lady\u00ae for at least eight weeks. The results were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA with the Bonferroni correction) and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test.","It was concluded that at least 20 subjects completing the study\/observation period in each group were necessary to obtain statistically meaningful information. This predefined number was chosen to overcome spontaneous or intra-individual variations and to overcome inter-individual variability in the FSFI score. As non-clinical condition SD in women may have peaking periods of important signs and symptoms followed by other periods of a lower level of signs and symptoms. Variations may be due to several unpredictable factors that include individual situations (i.e., stress levels), environmental and social factors, as well as habitual and occupational changes.","The FSFI Questionnaire: Factor Analysis and Scoring","In the original evaluation of the FSFI score system, a main component analysis (using varimax rotation) was performed to investigate the factor structure of the questionnaire. FSFI items had been selected on the basis of statistical criteria for item inclusion, among those high\/moderate loading on one factor, low crossfactor loading, high\/moderate test-retest reliability, and good discrimination between the FSAD and the control sample. In Rosen's original report, which was the basis of the present study, items were generally clustered in the predicted fashion and had relatively high factor loadings, supporting the global factoral validity of the final questionnaire. The items are balanced and could be used in different social settings. However, regional cultural variations and population factors may still have an unpredictable value.","Results:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0176","num":"0177"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00017","num":"00017"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 17"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"results of the FSFI questionnaire."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"INCLUSION","4 WEEKS","8 WEEKS"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"245pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["\u20021.","SEXUAL DESIRE OR INTEREST"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"TREATMENT","2.33; 1.2\u2002","3.6; 1.1","3.78; 1.4\u2002"]},{"entry":[{},"CONTROLS","2.3; 1.1","2.2; 1\u2002\u2009","2.8; 1.1"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"245pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["\u20022.

There were 39 comparable controls (aged 51.2\u00b12.3 years; range 46-55 years) who completed the eight-week follow-up out of an initial 43 women. These drop-outs resulted from non-medical reasons, due to failure to attend the check-ups or irregularities in completing the FSFI forms.","Results of the analysis of the 19-item questionnaire are shown in Table 17. The scores for the single items and standard deviations values are indicated: after four weeks there was a significant (P<0.05) improvement in the treatment group. The significant increase was sustained until the end of the eight-week observational period, Minor, insignificant changes were observed in the control group. The total median FSFI score in the Prelox Lady\u00ae treated group at inclusion was 44.6, which increased to 70.9 (P<0.05) after four weeks and remained at a comparable value after eight weeks (71.7; P<0.05 in comparison with the initial value).","In the control group the total FSFI score was 44.1 at inclusion (no significant difference to the treatment group), which marginally increased to 45.0 after four weeks and 47.4 after eight weeks. The changes were statistically insignificant. The total FSFI score increase in the treatment group was significantly higher after completion of the eight week observational period as compared to the control group (P=0.022). No side effects or intolerance problems were observed. Compliance was optimal as 97% of the active supplements and 97.3% of the non-active tablets were correctly used.","Discussion","The FSFI questionnaire has been developed as a multidimensional self-report instrument for assessing the key dimensions of sexual function in women. The questionnaire is considered psychometrically correct; it is simple to complete and has shown to be of value for clinical and nonclinical populations with SD. The questionnaire has been validated for the assessment of female sexual function and quality of life in several clinical trials or epidemiological studies. In post-menopausal women, alterations in vaginal perfusion and in the production of cervical and vaginal mucous may be an important factor in sexual dysfunction. This is more evident in diabetic women who often complain of vaginal dryness. In the treatment group of this study mucosal dryness improved, possibly leading to a facilitation of natural intercourse.","Mucous glycol-proteins (mucins) from human cervical\/vaginal mucus include several macromolecules (i.e., serine, threonine, proline, sugars such as N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, sialic acid and fructose). This composition may be severely altered in postmenopausal and particularly in diabetic women. The response to stimulation with mucous production may be altered or delayed, which could result in a dryer mucosal surface. This may cause more difficulty during intercourse and also exposes women to subclinical infections. Microcirculation alterations in diabetic women have been described and quantified. It is possible that these important alterations, including an alteration in vasomotor responses, may have a strong association with sexual dysfunction in women. However, even in non-diabetic women the combined effects of mucosal aging and reduced hormonal levels may produce comparable lower level signs and symptoms.","Sexual dysfunction is a common problem for women, but it is seldom reported and discussed. Several physiological actions are involved, and there are very important psychological components.","Pharmaceutical treatments for female SD are not available at the moment. An attempt to treat SD with sildenafil in postmenopausal women was not effective. Also, hormonal treatment may cause important side effects. This study indicates a significant improvement in dryness, with resulting decrease in discomfort and pain can be obtained with Prelox Lady\u00ae. This in turn may relate to an increase in frequency of intercourse and a more satisfactory relationship. These observations are likely to be confirmed in larger studies with Prelox Lady\u00ae currently in progress with premenopausal and menopausal women.","A comparison of our study with the studies performed by Ito and co-workers shows better results in our study group. This may be due to a tighter defined age range, as the study of Ito et al. included women at ages ranging from 20 to more than 77 years.","Furthermore, Ito recruited women with different socio-cultural backgrounds. This study offers an interesting perspective in women's sexual function enhancement that calls for further clinical investigation.","The FSFI Questionnaire (Rosen's Female Sexual Function Index)","Sexual Desire or Interest is a Feeling that Includes Wanting to have a Sexual Experience, Feeling Receptive to a Partner's Sexual Initiation, and Thinking or Fantasizing about Having Sex.","1.
