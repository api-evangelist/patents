title: Capacity-efficient flow control mechanism
abstract: Techniques to control data transmissions to efficiently utilize the available air-link resources. In accordance with a method for controlling a data transmission between a transmission source (e.g., a base station) and a receiving device (e.g., a remote terminal), a current transmission at a current data rate for a current transmission interval is received. An average throughput for the data transmission is then updated to reflect the current transmission at the current data rate. The updated average throughput is compared against a threshold throughput (which has been previously characterized) supported by the receiving device. If the average throughput exceeds the threshold throughput, the transmission source is signaled to (temporarily) stop the data transmission. Subsequently, after the average throughput has dropped below the threshold throughput, the transmission source can be signaled to resume the data transmission.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to data communication. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel and improved techniques to control transmissions in a variable rate communication system.","II. Description of the Related Art","A modern day communication system is required to support a variety of applications. One such communication system is a code division multiple access (CDMA) system that supports voice and data communication between users over a terrestrial link. The use of CDMA techniques in a multiple access communication system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307, entitled \u201cSPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS,\u201d and U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,459, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM.\u201d Another specific CDMA system is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/963,386, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HIGH RATE PACKET DATA TRANSMISSION,\u201d filed Nov. 3, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,574,211, issued Jun. 3, 2003 (the HDR system). These patents are assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference.","CDMA systems are typically designed to conform to one or more standards. Such standards include the \u201cTIA\/EIA\/IS-95-B Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System\u201d (the IS-95 standard), the \u201cTIA\/EIA\/IS-98 Recommended Minimum Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular Mobile Station\u201d (the IS-98 standard), the standard offered by a consortium named \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project\u201d (3GPP) and embodied in a set of documents including Document Nos. 3G TS 25.211, 3G TS 25.212, 3G TS 25.213, and 3G TS 25.214 (the W-CDMA standard), and the \u201cTR-45.5 Physical Layer Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems\u201d (the cdma2000 standard). The HDR system can be designed to conform to the specifications defined in a document entitled \u201cHDR Air Interface (HAI) Specification\u201d (the HAI specification), which has been provided to the 3GPP2\/TSG-C standard body and is the basis for development of a final standard. These adopted and proposed standards are incorporated herein by reference.","Newer generation CDMA systems are typically capable of supporting a number of data rates that typically include a high maximum data rate. For example, the HDR system can be operated to transmit data at rates ranging from 38.4 Kbps up to 2467.6 Kbps. This wide range of data rates is especially effective for data communication, which is typically characterized by long periods of silence punctuated by large bursts of traffic.","In some CDMA systems such as the HDR system, a large portion of the available system resources can be used to transmit to a single remote terminal for a particular time period to support a high peak data rate. However, possibly for costs and other considerations, many remote terminals may be designed to support a particular average data rate, which is typically only a fraction of the peak data rate. For these remote terminals, sustained transmission at a data rate higher than the supported average data rate may result in the transmitted packets being dropped or received in error. When this occurs, valuable system resources are wasted by transmitting to remote terminals not capable of processing the transmission.","As can be seen, techniques to control transmissions in a variable data rate communication system based on the capability of the remote terminals and such that the available system resources are efficiently utilized are highly desirable.","The invention provides techniques to control data transmissions to efficiently utilize the available air-link resources. In accordance with an aspect of the invention, an average data rate (i.e., average throughput) for a data transmission is monitored and data is transmitted if the average throughput is less than or equal to a maximum supported average data rate (i.e., threshold throughput). This design relieves the remote terminal from having to support a sustained transmission at a high data rate, which is typically not needed in light of the bursty nature of data transmission. This design further allows for efficient utilization of the valuable air-link resources since data is not transmitted to a remote terminal incapable of processing the transmission.","An embodiment of the invention provides a method for controlling a data transmission between a transmission source (e.g., a base station) and a receiving device (e.g., a remote terminal). In accordance with the method (which is typically performed at the remote terminal), a current transmission at a current data rate for a current transmission interval is received. An average throughput for the data transmission is then updated to reflect the current transmission at the current data rate. The average throughput can be obtained by averaging a value indicative of a throughput (e.g., the current data rate) for the current transmission with other values indicative of throughput for one or more prior transmissions in one or more prior transmission intervals. The average throughput is then compared against a threshold throughput (which has been previously characterized) supported by the receiving device. If the detected average throughput exceeds the threshold throughput, the transmission source is signaled to (temporarily) stop the data transmission. Subsequently, after the average throughput has dropped below the threshold throughput, the transmission source can be signaled to resume the data transmission.","The invention further provides other methods, remote terminals, base stations, and other elements that implement various aspects, embodiments, and features of the invention, as described in further detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","102","102","102","104","106"],"i":["a ","g"]},"Each remote terminal  may communicate with zero, one, or more base stations  on the downlink and uplink at any given moment, depending on the particular design of the system and whether the remote terminal is receiving a data transmission. The forward link (downlink) refers to transmission from the base station to the remote terminal, and the reverse link (uplink) refers to transmission from the remote terminal to the base station. In , a solid line with an arrow indicates a data transmission from the base station to the remote terminal, and a broken line with an arrow indicates a pilot and\/or signaling transmission. The uplink communication is not shown in  for simplicity.","As shown in , base station transmits data to remote terminal on the downlink; base station transmits data to remote terminal ; base station transmits data to remote terminal , and so on. In the example shown in , remote terminal receives a data transmission from base station and pilots from base stations and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","110","104","110","112","114","110","104","112","114"]},"In the specific design shown in , BSC  includes a call control processor  and a number of selector elements  (only one selector element is shown in  for simplicity). Call control processor  controls the processing of a call for each remote terminal (e.g., directs the base station to transmit a channel assignment message to the remote terminal on the forward link). One selector element  is assigned to control the communication between each remote terminal and one or more base stations.","In the design shown in , base station  includes a number of channel elements  (only one channel element is shown in  for simplicity), a data queue , and a scheduler . One channel element  is assigned to process the communication with each remote terminal. Each channel element  assigned to a particular remote terminal couples to an associated selector element  of BSC  also assigned to the same remote terminal. Data queue  couples to channel elements  and receives and stores data to be transmitted on the forward link to the remote terminals. Scheduler  couples to all channel elements  and data queue , and schedules transmissions for data users.","Each assigned channel element  receives scheduling information (e.g., the data rate, transmit power, and transmit time period) from scheduler  and further receives data from data queue  and\/or the associated selector element . Each assigned channel element  then encodes and modulates data for the remote terminal based on the received scheduling information. The modulated signal is upconverted and conditioned by an RF unit  and transmitted via an antenna  over the forward link.","At the recipient remote terminal , the forward link signal is received by an antenna , routed through a duplexer , and provided to a receiver unit (RCVR) . Receiver unit  filters, amplifies, downconverts, and digitizes the received signal. The digitized samples are then demodulated by a demodulator (DEMOD) , decoded by a decoder , and provided to a data sink . The demodulation and decoding are performed in a complementary manner to the modulation and encoding performed at the base station. A controller  may direct the processing of the received forward link signal.","Data transmission on the reverse link occurs in a similar manner. Data is provided from a data source  within remote terminal , and encoded by an encoder . Signaling may also be provided by controller , combined with the encoded data, and appropriately modulated by a modulator (MOD)  to provide a modulated signal. The modulated signal is then upconverted and conditioned by a transmitter unit (TMTR) , routed through duplexer , and transmitted via antenna  over the reverse link.","At base station , the reverse link signal is received by antenna  and provided to RF unit . RF unit  filters, amplifies, downconverts, and digitizes the reverse link signal, and further provides the digitized samples to the channel element  assigned to the remote terminal. The assigned channel element  then demodulates and decodes the samples in a manner complementary to the modulation and encoding performed at the transmitting remote station. The decoded data may be provided to the associated selector element , which may forward the data to another base station , PSTN , or PDSN .","The system design, as described above, supports transmission for both data and voice services. The encoding and modulation for the forward and reverse links are defined by the particular CDMA standard or design being implemented (e.g., IS-95A, W-CDMA, cdma2000, or HDR) and are not described in detail herein.","The functions described above can also be achieved by other designs. The location of scheduler  is dependent on whether a centralized or distributed scheduling of data transmissions is desired. For example, as shown in , scheduler  can be included within each base station to allow the base station to perform its own scheduling, which may reduce the processing delays. Alternatively, scheduler  can be included within the BSC and designed to schedule data transmissions for all base stations in the system. This centralized processing may result in a more efficient use of the system resources. Other designs can also be contemplated and are within the scope of the invention.","As shown in , the remote terminals are dispersed throughout the system. Scheduler  is tasked with scheduling the data transmissions to the data users within the coverage area such that a set of goals is optimized. These goals may include (1) improved utilization of the forward link capacity by transmitting as much data as can be supported by the available system resources and link conditions, (2) reduced transmission delays, and (3) fair allocation of the forward link capacity to all data users based on a set of priorities. The goals are optimized by balancing a list of factors. Forward link scheduling is described in further detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/798,951, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR FORWARD LINK RATE SCHEDULING,\u201d filed Mar. 17, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,335,922, issued Jan. 1, 2002, and Ser. No. 09\/528,235, entitled \u201cFORWARD-LINK SCHEDULING IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM,\u201d now U.S. Pat. No. 6,850,506, issued Feb. 1, 2005, both assigned to the assignee of the invention and incorporated herein by reference.","To support the burgeoning demands for data service (e.g., the Internet), many newer generation communication systems are capable of transmitting data at variable (and high) data rates. One such system is the HDR system, which is capable of transmitting data at a number of data rates ranging from 38.4 Kbps up to 2467.6 Kbps. The high peak rate (relative to the Kbps rates supported by the first generation IS-95 CDMA system) is supported by allocating a large portion (or all) of the available system resources (i.e., the transmit power) to a single remote terminal for a particular duration of time. A number of data users can be served by selecting the highest priority data user(s), transmitting to the selected data user(s) for a particular duration of time, and selecting another group of data users for transmission.","Data communication is typically bursty in nature and may be characterized by long periods of silence punctuated by large bursts of traffic. The variable data rates are very effective for data communication, and allow the system to transmit data at a high data rate to a particular remote terminal when a data transmission is requested, and if, the link conditions permit. The high data rate can reduce transmission delays and enhance user satisfaction.","In some CDMA systems, such as the HDR system, the remote terminal measures the quality of the forward link signal and sends a message back to the base station to report the measured link conditions. The message may indicate the maximum data rate supported by the link, as measured at the remote terminal. Alternatively, the message may indicate the carrier-to-total-noise (C\/I) measurement for the link, again as measured at the remote terminal. The base station can then transmit data to the remote terminal, if at all, at the indicated data rate or at a data rate supported by the measured C\/I.","Because of the bursty nature of data communication and further due to costs and other considerations, it may not be practical (or necessary) to design a remote terminal capable of supporting a sustained transmission at a high data rate. Instead, it may be more economical and\/or feasible to design the remote terminal to support a particular expected average data rate, which may only be a fraction of the highest data rate supported by the system. The maximum average data rate supported by the remote terminal is also referred to herein as the maximum sustainable throughput, or simply the threshold throughput. For example, if the remote terminal can support four transmissions at a peak data rate of 2.4 Mbps over six transmission intervals, then the threshold throughput can be computed as (4\/6)\u25cf2.4 Mbps, or 1.6 Mbps.","Transmitting data at a high data rate for a sustained period of time, such that the threshold throughput is exceeded, can result in performance degradation and inefficient utilization of the available system resources. When the remote terminal's threshold throughput is exceeded, the transmitted packets may be dropped or received in error by the remote terminal. This may then require retransmission of the bad packets, which would consume additional valuable system resources. Also, the dropped and\/or error packets at the radio link protocol (RLP) layer may cause error in a packet at a higher signaling layer (e.g., the TCP layer). An error packet at the higher signaling layer is typically more catastrophic since a larger amount of data may need to be retransmitted.","In accordance with an aspect of the invention, the average data rate (or average throughput) for a data transmission is monitored and data is transmitted if the average throughput is less than or equal to the maximum supported average data rate (or threshold throughput). This feature relieves the remote terminal from having to support a sustained transmission at a high data rate, which is typically not needed. This feature further allows for efficient utilization of the valuable air-link resources since data is not transmitted to a remote terminal incapable of processing the transmission.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"In the example shown in , after a period of silence, data is transmitted to the remote terminal at the highest (peak) data rate at time slot , and the average throughput increases correspondingly. Similarly, data is also transmitted at the peak data rate at time slots , , and , and the average throughput reaches the threshold throughput in time slot . Transmitting data at time slot  would cause the average throughput to exceed the threshold throughput, and may result the remote terminal dropping or incorrectly receiving the packet. Thus, transmission to the remote terminal is temporarily stopped (i.e., stalled) during time slot , which causes the average throughput to drop. Data transmission then resumes at the peak data rate for time slots  and , until the average throughput again reaches the threshold throughput. The data transmission is again stalled at time slot , and thereafter resumes at time slot  after the average throughput has dropped below the threshold throughput.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","412"]},"Thereafter, during a particular data transmission, the actual average throughput is determined, at step .

For some variable data rate systems (e.g., the HDR system), each packet covers a particular (fixed) time period. Thus, the number of bits transmitted in each packet is variable and determined by the data rate used for the packet. For these systems, a bit count (instead of the packet count) is more indicative of the data rate used for the transmission interval and is provided to filter . Filter  then computes the average throughput for the received count value based on a particular averaging scheme.","In the embodiment shown in , filter  can be implemented as either a finite impulse response (FIR) filter or an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter.","For the IIR implementation, the (bit or packet) count value is provided to a summer  that also receives the output from a summer . Summer  sums the two received values and provides the result to a set of delay elements (D) . Each delay element provides one transmission interval of delay (e.g., one time slot for the HDR system). The outputs from delay elements  are provided to respective scaling elements . Each scaling element  scales the received value with a respective coefficient as and provides the scaled value to summer . Summer  sums the scaled values from all scaling elements . For the IIR implementation, the output from summer  comprises the average throughput from the filter (shown as a dashed line) and is provided to comparator .","For the FIR implementation, summer  is not needed and the (bit or packet) count value is provided directly to the set of delay elements . Also, for the FIR implementation, the output from summer  comprises the average throughput from the filter and is provided to comparator .","The particular weighting scheme to be used to determine the average throughput is dictated by the coefficients afor scaling elements . The coefficients can be selected to (1) weigh the received count values uniformly over the average time period (i.e., for linear averaging), (2) weigh more recent count values more heavily (i.e., for exponential averaging), or weigh the count values based on some other weighting scheme. A sliding window (linear) averaging can provide an average throughput that more closely match the data buffer used at the remote terminal, and may also be simpler to implement.","The time period over which the averaging is performed can be selected based on various factors such as, for example, the size of the data buffer at the remote terminal, the decoder speed, and so on. The averaging time period is limited by the number of delay elements .","Comparator  receives the average throughput from filter  and the threshold throughput, compares the average and threshold throughputs, and provides an OVERFLOW signal in response to the comparison. In an embodiment, the OVERFLOW signal is logic high if the threshold throughput is exceeded, and logic low otherwise.","Detector  can be implemented in hardware or software, or a combination thereof. Unlike the physical layer which typically needs to operate at the peak burst rate, detector  updates the average throughput at a lower rate (e.g., the slot rate) and does not need to be designed to operate at a high rate. Detector  can be implemented as part of a modem firmware (e.g., DSP code) designed to execute on a processor (e.g., controller  in ).","The signaling between the remote terminal and the base station can also be achieved in various manners, and is also dependent on the particular CDMA system or standard being implemented. For a better understanding of the invention, the signaling is now specifically described for the HDR system.","The HDR system defines a Data Rate Control (DRC) channel on the reverse link that is used by the remote terminal to send messages specifically to a particular base station from which a data transmission is desired. The messages also indicate the data rate supported by the communications link to the selected base station. The selected base station and supported data rate are sent by the remote terminal for each transmission interval during a data transmission and are used by the selected base station to schedule and transmit data.

Each base station in the active set of the remote terminal is assigned to one of eight possible (3-bit, 8-chip) Walsh sequences. One Walsh sequence is designated as a NULL cover, which is used to cover the DRC value if the remote terminal does not desire to receive a data transmission from any base station. The covering allows the remote terminal to direct the DRC message specifically to the base station having the best signal quality, and for the selected base station to identify and receive the DRC message designated for it.","For the HDR system, the signaling to (temporarily) stop the data transmission from the selected base station if the threshold throughput is exceeded can be achieved by either sending the NULL rate to the selected base station or covering the DRC value (which has been computed in the normal manner) with the NULL cover.","In the HDR system, the DRC value transmitted by the remote terminal is also used for power control by the selected base station. Thus, although transmitting the NULL rate has the desired effect to stop the data transmission, the transmit power may also be erroneously adjusted by the power control loop based on the NULL rate. This erroneous adjustment of the transmit power may not (noticeably) degrade the performance of the system if the data transmission is stopped for only a small number of slots using the NULL rate.","As defined by the HDR system, the NULL cover can be used to indicate that the remote terminal does not desire any data transmission from the system. Covering the DRC value with the NULL cover has the desired effect to stop the data transmission, but also does not result in an erroneous adjustment of the transmit power. Also, by using the NULL cover, the scheduler can be designed and operated to maintain the remote terminal's priority during the time the data transmission was temporarily stopped such that the same base station can serve the remote terminal when it desires to resume the data transmission. Moreover, no change in handoff is performed when the NULL cover is used.","As noted above and shown in , a signaling delay exists between the transmission of the DRC message by the remote terminal and the corresponding data transmission by the base station. During slot n (based on the time reference of the base station), the remote terminal processes the transmission for the previous slot n\u22121 and updates the average throughput. If the threshold throughput is exceeded, the remote terminal sends an appropriate DRC message starting in slot n to request the base station to stop the data transmission. This DRC message is received and processed by the base station in the next slot n+1. If requested, the data transmission is stopped for the following slot n+2. As can be seen, a two-slot delay exists between the transmission in slot n\u22121 that causes the average throughput to exceed the threshold throughput and the stoppage of the data transmission in slot n+2. Because of the signaling delay, the base station may still be transmitting (e.g., at the peak data rate) during slots n and n+1.","In an embodiment, the threshold throughput is decreased to account for the signaling delay. For the specific design shown in , the threshold throughput can be reduced by an amount that assumes a worse case scenario in which transmissions are received at the peak data rate for up to two slots after the remote terminal sends a request to stop the data transmission. The signaling to request the selected base station to resume the data transmission can also be achieved in a manner to account for the signaling delay.","Various aspects, embodiments, and elements of the invention can be implement in hardware or software, or a combination thereof. The processes shown in , A, and B, the elements within the base station and remote terminal (e.g., detector ), and other elements and processes can be implemented using one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), digital signal processors (DSPs), micro-controllers, microprocessors, other electronic circuits designed to perform the functions described herein, or a combination thereof. Also, some of the processes, functions (e.g., averaging and detecting), and elements (e.g., detector ) described herein can be implemented with a general-purpose processor or a specially designed processor (e.g., controller ) operated to execute instruction codes designed to achieve the functions described herein.","The invention can be advantageously used for variable rate modems capable of supporting a particular peak-to-average rate, and is especially advantageous for a high peak-to-average rate. The variable data rates allow the system to transmit to the remote terminals based on the (actual) operating conditions and other factors, and the high peak rate can be shared among the remote terminals to reduce transmission delays. The remote terminals may only need to support a particular expected average throughput. In this case, it may be costly if the higher layers (e.g., the decoder) are required to support the high peak rate for a sustained period of time. Also, such capability would be excessive if it is only used for a portion of the time.","For clarity, various aspects and implementations of the invention have been specifically described for the HDR system. However, the invention can also be applied to other CDMA systems such as those that conform to the W-CDMA, cdma2000, and other standards. The invention can also be applied to various types of terminal including, for example, handsets, modems, smart phones, and others.","The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention. Various modifications to these embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments without the use of the inventive faculty. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown herein but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features disclosed herein."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The features, nature, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the detailed description set forth below when taken in conjunction with the drawings in which like reference characters identify correspondingly throughout and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
