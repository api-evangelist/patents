title: Mortgage-backed security hedging systems and methods
abstract: A computer assisted method of developing a hedge position for a mortgage-backed security. The method includes calculating a duration of the security based on price histories of the security and changes in yield of a benchmark security and expressing periodic changes in price of the security. The method also includes calculating a relative coupon of the security and calculating a current coupon yield of the mortgage sector. The method further includes calculating an empirical duration of the security, calculating a hedge ratio for the security, and outputting a hedge position for the security based on the hedge ratio.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Various financial service entities and investors buy and sell securities, such as mortgage passthrus, at all times of the trading day and in large quantities and often accumulate large positions in these instruments, either long or short. To counteract adverse price movements, it is often desirable to hedge the positions effectively by the simultaneous purchase or sale of other instruments, for example Treasury bills. An element in formulating a hedging strategy is to determine how much the price of each instrument changes as the yield curve changes. This is referred to herein as the \u201cduration.\u201d Knowing the duration of both the mortgage passthru and the Treasury bill, a trader can determine how much Treasuries to buy or sell to offset the risk of the mortgage position up to the first order. Therefore, a proper estimation of mortgage duration in real-time is often desirable to market-making activity.","However, in the case of mortgage passthrus, determination of duration is not only complicated by the fact that it depends on the inherent optionality of the passthru\u2014mortgage holders have the option to prepay their mortgage at any time\u2014and the degree to which the option is in or out of the money, but also that this optionality changes dynamically as mortgage rates change during the day, sometimes dramatically so. A mortgage passthru is said to be \u201cin-the-money\u201d if its coupon exceeds the prevailing mortgage rate and vice versa. The prevailing mortgage rate is determined in the secondary mortgage market based on the real-time prices of mortgage passthrus across different coupons. This is referred to as the current (or par) coupon rate. The more in-the-money a mortgage passthru is, the shorter its duration and the more out-of-the-money it is, the longer its duration. Because the current coupon changes dynamically, so does the optionality of the passthru and thus its duration.","Several methods exist to determine the duration of a mortgage. Most are model based, where market participants typically derive statistical models of mortgage prepayment behavior and thus determine price changes as rates change. However, despite the care and effort that goes into modeling these, there is wide variability in the outputs of these models, and because their overall consensus is likely reflected in the traded prices, there is a need for deriving the mortgage duration empirically from actual prices and observed rate changes. There is also a need for determination of empirical durations of mortgage passthrus in real-time for the dynamic hedging of large and heterogeneous mortgage passthru positions.","In various embodiments, the present invention is directed to a computer assisted method of developing a hedge position for a mortgage-backed security. The method includes calculating a duration of the security based on price histories of the security and changes in yield of a benchmark security and expressing periodic changes in price of the security. The method also includes calculating a relative coupon of the security and calculating a current coupon yield of the mortgage sector. The method further includes calculating an empirical duration of the security, calculating a hedge ratio for the security, and outputting a hedge position for the security based on the hedge ratio.","In various embodiments, the present invention is directed to a system for developing a hedge position for a mortgage-backed security. The system includes a data network and a theoretical price engine in communication with the data network. The system also includes a market data price server in communication with the data network for computing a bid\/ask broker price from at least one broker price feed and a hedge ratio server in communication with the data network for computing a hedge ratio and for outputting a hedge position based on the hedge ratio to at least one application.","In various embodiments, the present invention is directed to an apparatus. The apparatus includes means for calculating a duration of a mortgage-backed security based on price histories of the security and changes in yield of a benchmark security and means for expressing periodic changes in price of the security. The apparatus also includes means for calculating a relative coupon of the security and means for calculating a current coupon yield of the mortgage sector. The apparatus further includes means for calculating an empirical duration of the security, means for calculating a hedge ratio for the security, and means for outputting a hedge position for the security based on the hedge ratio.","In various embodiments, the present invention is directed to a computer readable medium having stored thereon instructions which, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to:","calculate a duration of a mortgage-backed security based on price histories of the security and changes in yield of a benchmark security;","express periodic changes in price of the security;","calculate a relative coupon of the security;","calculate a current coupon yield of the mortgage sector;","calculate an empirical duration of the security;","calculate a hedge ratio for the security; and","output a hedge position for the security based on the hedge ratio.","Various embodiments of the present invention may be employed to compute, for example in real time, an equivalent hedge position for a complex portfolio of, for example, mortgage backed securities (e.g., mortgage passthrus).

Then the 5.0 coupon mortgage has a relative coupon of \u221230 basis points (bp). Similarly, the 4.5 coupon mortgage has a relative coupon of \u221280 bp. Linear interpolation can be done across yield and the 45-day price of a mortgage passthru that has a relative coupon of \u221250, or one that is 50-bp out of the money can be computed. Conversely, the price of each coupon can be expressed as a weighted average of the synthetic fixed relative-coupon mortgages, those at intervals of 50 bps. Thus, the 45-day price of the 5.0 coupon mortgage is expressed as a linear combination of the prices (by \u201cprices\u201d it is meant 45-day prices hereinafter) of the synthetic \u221250 bp passthru and the current coupon passthru. Because the durations of these constant relative-coupon passthrus are assumed as being constant, their change in price can be expressed as duration times the change in the yield curve. Here the duration is expressed as dp\/dy or dollar duration and the change in yield curve \u0394y is expressed in terms of the change in yield of a single benchmark treasury or swap. For the entire coupon stack, then, the following applies:\n\n\u0394()=\u0394()*[]()*\n\nwhere \u0394(t) is the n-dimensional vector of changes in 45-day prices across the coupon stack, \u0394y(t) is the scalar change in the benchmark rate, [W] is the n\u00d7m matrix of relative coupon weights, and  is the m-dimensional vector of constant relative coupon durations.

The final prices (bid, ask, and mid) are derived from two sources: a set of live broker price feeds  delivered across the data network , and a theoretical price engine  that computes the theoretically implied prices of mortgages based on the movements in the yield curve and a knowledge of durations, either model-based or derived empirically. In various embodiments, the market data price server  incorporates numerous controls that allow users (e.g., traders) close control over the entire derivation process, thus helping them step around pathological market conditions where a price picture is not readily available.","In various embodiments, the theoretical price engine  uses computed overnight partial durations of individual passthrus, their closing prices , and using live feeds of treasury, swap and agency curves delivered over the data network , computes the implied prices.

Once these are available, using the relative coupon empirical durations  estimated overnight, the real-time dollar durations and thus the real-time hedge ratios are computed using the methods described hereinabove. The hedge ratios are then published via the data network  to downstream applications  that manage the trading book.","Embodiments of the systems and methods described herein can be used for real-time hedging of large, heterogeneous mortgage passthru positions.
