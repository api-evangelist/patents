title: Folded foil and metal fiber braid electrical current collector brush
abstract: A brush assembly is formed from a single metallic foil positioned within a base portion. The foil is folded or rolled up into a plurality of closely spaced foil layers soldered to the base portion of the brush assembly. Attachment of the folded foil to the brush base portion involves use of barrier tape and/or adhesive on the folded side of the foil layers and soldering of one layer edge to the base portion which is received within a holder to position the folded foil in brushing contact along the other layer edges with a running surface under a spring bias pressure. The brush may be constructed by metal fiber braids placed on or between metal skins to form a hybrid structure. The brush assembly may be applicable to slip ring current collectors or other electric contact applications, including cleansing brush applications involving other types of brushes.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The present invention relates to the transfer of electrical current across a moving surface in an electric current collecting device.","Currently many slip-ring brushes are made from solid carbon. Metal fiber brushes are generally known for providing a much larger number of electrical contact points on the rotor running surface thereby providing a much lower contact voltage drop. However such metal fiber brushes, supported by holders to which they are attached by soldering, are readily deformed by high external forces, which may arise in electrical motor types of environments because of transport current and magnetic field interaction induced forces, which results in excessive brush spreading distortion sometimes called splay. Brushes could be made stronger by using larger fibers, but this would result in fewer contact points and poor following of any imperfections in the rotor surface. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide a foil type electrical current collector brush in the aforementioned type of running surface environments to avoid the latter referred to disadvantages associated therewith.","Pursuant to the present invention, a single foil sheet is folded into closely spaced layers bonded together and soldered within a base portion of a brush assembly positioned within a holder in spaced relation to a running surface of an electrical current collector type of device, so that one of the folded foil sheet edges on the spaced layers thereof extending from the holder is held under pressure in sliding contact with the running surface. The brush may be fabricated by use of a single piece of folded metal foil, folded in such a way as to keep the free ends near the center, thereby providing the desired mechanical strength and avoiding the requirement for assembling a plurality of stacked foils heretofore associated with prior foil concepts. Other embodiments of the invention involve use of metal fiber braids between each set of adjacent foil folds, thereby providing an increased number of contact points and improved electrical performance similar to that of a fiber brush. The foil and braids are soldered together at the base thereby providing a low resistance path to the brush holder. The folded foil brush may also be well suited for rotor slip ring cleansing when used with other brush types.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrates a brush assembly  in sliding contact with a running slip ring surface  of an electric current collecting type of device , as generally known in the art, with which a fixed support  is associated in spaced relation to the slip-ring surface . Pursuant to the present invention, the brush assembly  is positioned on the support  by a holder  to establish sliding contact thereof with the running surface  of the device .","As shown in ,  and , the brush assembly  has a base portion  that is cross-sectionally rectangular shaped. A folded metal foil  is positioned within the base portion  and projects therefrom into said sliding contact with the surface . As shown in , the foil  is a single sheet having opposite parallel spaced edge  and  that are folded into parallel spaced relation to each other when the foil  is fully folded for installation into the brush assembly  as shown in . When completely folded and installed within an optional container formed within the portion , the brush foil  sometimes referred to as a sock, forms a plurality of closely spaced rectangular layers  as shown in . The folded edge  of the foil  is then in contact with the surface  as shown in , while the other folded foil edge  is soldered throughout to the brush base portion  as shown in . As to the sides of the folded foil layers  extending between the opposite foil edges  and , a small portion thereof has a barrier tape  or adhesive coating thereon as shown in  for attachment of the foil  to the base portion  as shown in . Such attachment is effected before soldering of the foil edges  to the base  so as to prevent wicking after installation of the brush assembly  within the electric current collecting device .","As shown in , the brush holder  is formed by a housing  within which the brush base portion  is received and soldered thereto. The holder  has an arcuate flange  for axial slip ring application as shown in ,  and , extending from the housing  for releasable attachment by bolts  to the support . A coil spring  within the holder housing , as shown in , exerts brush contact pressure on the brush assembly  through the base portion . Such contact pressure is applied to the running surface  along parallel spaced sections of the folded contact edge  on the foil layers . As shown in  the folded foil layers  of the brush assembly  may be made of an electrically conductive metal, such as brass shim stock for example or another suitable metal such as copper, silver or palladium.","According to another embodiment as shown in , a foil \u2032 is folded into foil layers \u2032 of a hybrid structure type, having braids  positioned between two outer skins  of each of the layers \u2032 to form a container shell or sock. According to yet another embodiment a hybrid foil \u2033 may be folded to form a closed structure, as shown in , without an outer container shell or sock by attachment of the braids  to a single folded skin . A still further embodiment is cross-sectionally illustrated in , wherein a hybrid foil \u2032\u2033 is shown in a double jellyroll structural arrangement, having outer skins \u2032 with an inner braid \u2032 retained therebetween.","In regard to the outer shape of the flange  as hereinbefore described with respect to ,  and , it would be cylindrical for the brush assembly  in a radial installation relative to the slip ring surface . The shape of the foil contact edges  may be curved as shown in , to a degree dependent on the curvature of the slip ring surface .","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A","FIG. 2"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1"],"b":["2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
