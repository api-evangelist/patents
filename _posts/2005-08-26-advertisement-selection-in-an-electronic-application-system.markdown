{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO OTHER APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation in part of co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/134,250 entitled HOSTED APPLICATION SERVER filed May 19, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.","Various web applications utilize some form of targeted advertising. For example, a search engine application might deliver advertisements based on the text entered in a search query. A user searching for \u201cHawaii\u201d might be presented with advertisements for vacation packages to Hawaii, for example. An email application could deliver advertisements based on the content of the email message. However, such methods are limited by how well the interests of the user correlate with the text in a search query or in an email message. For example, an employee might receive many email messages about a work related issue, but have no interest in buying products related to his work. The employee might be much more interested in food, but it would be difficult to determine this from the email he receives. Improved methods of selecting and delivering targeted content are needed.","The invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a process, an apparatus, a system, a composition of matter, a computer readable medium such as a computer readable storage medium or a computer network wherein program instructions are sent over optical or electronic communication links. In this specification, these implementations, or any other form that the invention may take, may be referred to as techniques. A component such as a processor or a memory described as being configured to perform a task includes both a general component that is temporarily configured to perform the task at a given time or a specific component that is manufactured to perform the task. In general, the order of the steps of disclosed processes may be altered within the scope of the invention.","A detailed description of one or more embodiments of the invention is provided below along with accompanying figures that illustrate the principles of the invention. The invention is described in connection with such embodiments, but the invention is not limited to any embodiment. The scope of the invention is limited only by the claims and the invention encompasses numerous alternatives, modifications and equivalents. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the invention may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For the purpose of clarity, technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the invention has not been described in detail so that the invention is not unnecessarily obscured.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["102","112","102","112","102","104","107","102","112"]},"Objects - could include, for example, photos, blogs, reviews, classified advertisements, profiles, images, bookmarks, jobs, books, and\/or movies, etc. For example, objects - could include a set of photos. In another example, object  could be a photo of a teacher, object  could be a profile of the teacher, and object  could be a review of that teacher.","In this example, application  allows users to view and tag objects. Tagging refers to assigning a string (e.g., one or more words) to an object. The string is referred to as a tag, tag word, or tag phrase. An object can be tagged with any tag phrase desired. Thus, tag phrases can be personal, such as \u201cJohn Doe's tag phrase\u201d. Objects that can be tagged include content objects, users, profiles, and\/or applications. In some embodiments, an application and\/or a user can assign a tag.","In some embodiments, application  includes an interface for searching for objects associated with a tag phrase. For example, a photo sharing application could allow a user to upload and tag photos. A first user could tag all his Hawaii vacation photos \u201cHawaii\u201d. A second user wishing to see photos of Hawaii could use the search interface to search for all photos tagged \u201cHawaii\u201d and photos tagged Hawaii would be returned, including the first user's photos.","In some embodiments, application  is an application running on a hosted application server system that could include multiple applications, multiple user contributed objects and multiple user defined object types, as more fully described below. For example, object  could comprise a sidebar that could display system information and\/or targeted content, such as advertising.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["102","109","109"]},"In various embodiments, list  could indicate which tag phrases are the most popular, most frequently, and\/or most recently assigned. The list could include tags assigned by other users (e.g., friends), or by all users. Selecting (e.g., using a mouse to click on) one of the tag phrases might cause objects or a list of objects associated with the tag phrase to be displayed.","For example, list  could be displayed by a bookmarking application that allows a user to store and tag various bookmarks (i.e., URLs). A user could bookmark a webpage by tagging its URL. For example, the user could tag URLs of various food related webpages with the tag \u201cfood\u201d. The user could select \u201cfood\u201d in list  and a list of the pages tagged \u201cfood\u201d would be returned. The list could include pages tagged food by the user and\/or other users.","The tag phrases in list  could be used to determine information about the user. For example, list  indicates that the most frequently used tag four tag phrases are \u201cFood\u201d, \u201cSan Francisco\u201d, \u201cRestaurant\u201d, and \u201cRetirement\u201d. The tag phrase \u201cFood\u201d was used 81 times, the tag phrase \u201cSan Francisco\u201d was used 39 times, the tag phrase \u201cRestaurant\u201d was used 27 times, and the tag phrase \u201cRetirement\u201d was used 42 times. Thus, it may be determined that the user would be interested in food or restaurant related products, and especially those located in San Francisco. In addition, it may be determined that the user is retired and would be interested in retirement related products. This could also be determined from the fact that the user has tagged \u201cVintage Cars\u201d, \u201cBuick\u201d, \u201cAARP\u201d, and \u201cClassical\u201d a moderate number of times. The user has tagged \u201cHawaii\u201d 12 times and \u201cHawaii\u201d one time. \u201cHawaii\u201d could have been a typographical error entered by the user in this example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 1C","b":"130"},"At , a tag phrase is selected. The tag phrase can include a string. In some embodiments, the tag phrase is a keyword or descriptive label selected by the user to associate with the object. Examples of tag phrases include \u201cfamily\u201d, \u201cXML\u201d, \u201chumor\u201d, \u201cto read\u201d, \u201creference\u201d, \u201cwork\u201d, \u201cBob Johnson's personal tag phrase\u201d, \u201ce@$#*&(]jj\u201d, etc. In some embodiments, the tag phrase can be selected from a pull down or other menu of commonly used (e.g., by the user or other users) tag phrases, where the menu might be provided as a convenience to the user.","At  the object is tagged. The tag phrase is associated with the object. In some embodiments, this information is stored in a database. In various embodiments, a user could tag an object because it is interesting to the user and\/or the user wants to have some way of finding the object again. In some embodiments, users can view other users' tags. The user may tag an object because the user wants to be known to have tagged that object and\/or wants to be characterized by having tagged that object. Tags can be viewed as a way for a user to personally express himself.","In some embodiments, a tag strength is also selected and associated with the tag. For example, the user could select a score (e.g., 1-5) indicating the strength or importance of the tag to the user. For example, if the object is a photo, the user might select a tag strength of 1 for a bad representation of a bridge (e.g., a photo that cuts off half of a one lane bridge) and 5 for a good representation of a bridge (e.g., a panoramic photo of the Golden Gate Bridge). The tag strength can be optional\u2014a user can assign a tag strength to some tags, and not to others.","The meaning of a tag strength can be defined in various ways by various users. For example, a first user might use tag strength to indicate how well the tag describes the object being tagged, as in the bridge example above. A second user might use tag strength to indicate the quality of photos the user tags. For example, a blurry photo might be given a tag strength of 1. A third user might use tag strength to indicate the importance of bookmarks the user tags. For example, webpages with a tag strength of 5 could indicate that those webpages contain information that is most useful or most entertaining to the user. Alternatively, webpages with a tag strength of 1 could indicate that those webpages are first in priority, e.g., for the user to read next.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["241","244","242","248"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Region in FIG. 2A","Relationship(s)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["252","tag on object"]},{"entry":["254","tag on user"]},{"entry":["256","user of application or user who owns"]},{"entry":[{},"application"]},{"entry":["258","object in application"]},{"entry":["262","tag on application by user or tag on user by"]},{"entry":[{},"application"]},{"entry":["264","tag on object in application by user or tag"]},{"entry":[{},"on object by application"]},{"entry":["270","tag on object in application by user"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":"274"},"For example, a user profile could include applications contributed to or tagged by the user, tags contributed by the user, content types contributed or tagged by the user, a location associated with the user, and users tagged by the user, etc.","An application profile could include, for example, the current user, the user who contributed the application, tags assigned to objects in (e.g., owned by) the application, content types used in the application, and a description of the application, etc.","A tag profile could include, for example, related tags (e.g., tag phrase \u201ccyan\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d might be related if an object has been tagged \u201ccyan\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d by the same or different users), users who contributed the tag, the application used to contribute the tag, the user, application, or object that is tagged, etc.","An object profile could include, for example, tag(s) assigned to the object, user(s) who tagged the object, the user who contributed the object, the application that owns the object, the content type of the object, and various attributes of the object.","At , content is selected based on relationship(s) between two or more of the tag(s), user(s), application(s), and\/or object(s). For example, information in profiles includes relationships between other tag(s), user(s), application(s), and\/or object(s).

For example, if a user is viewing an application, the description of the application, the descriptor of the current user, the type of objects in the application, and the tags (by the current user and\/or other users) on the application are analyzed. Content is selected based on this analysis. In various embodiments, each of these drivers is weighted so that, for example, tags  have a greater influence on content selection than say, description .","For example, suppose a user is viewing a photo sharing application. The application has the description \u201ctravel photos\u201d. The descriptor of the user indicates that the user is a 35 year old female living in San Francisco. The objects in the application are of type photo and the most popular (e.g., the top 3 tags) are \u201citalian\u201d, \u201crestaurant\u201d, and \u201cfood\u201d. The content selected might then be an advertisement for an Italian restaurant in San Francisco, or a travel article on the history of North Beach in San Francisco. If, for example, the application description is weighted less, then the travel article may not be selected. Instead, an article of the best Italian food in San Francisco could be selected, for example.","Other drivers could include any of the other items shown, such as tags  assigned to the application, or the descriptor  of the owner of the application. In the above example, if the top tags assigned to the application include \u201ccheap\u201d and \u201cfast\u201d, then the content selected might be an advertisement for a pizzeria in San Francisco.","In various embodiments, the tree can be extended to include other relationships. For example, contributor  could be another user or current user . In the case of another user, a descriptor of that other user could also be analyzed to select content. For example, a block representing that descriptor could connect to contributor block . In another example, objects contributed by the current user could be analyzed. For example, a block representing those objects could connect to current user block  or to descriptor block .","In another example, a block representing a related user (e.g., through a social network) could connect to current user block  or owner block . Information associated with the related user could be analyzed.","In this way, tree  is part of a network of relationships. In this example, the network of relationships is shown to form around an application. A network can be formed around a user, a tag, or an object. The networks can interconnect. For example, a network of relationships can be formed around current user  based on the user profile of current user . Any of this information can be used to select content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 2D","b":["200","202","209"]},"In some embodiments, information about a user can be captured and maintained in a user profile. For example, the user profile could include the tag phrases the user has selected or contributed and the number of times each tag phrase is used. From the profile, information about the user could be derived. The information could include the user's interests, habits, affiliations, or any other information. For example, \u201cfood\u201d has been used three times and \u201ctravel\u201d has been listed twice. In addition, \u201crestaurant\u201d has been used once, and it could be determined that \u201crestaurant\u201d is a term that is related to \u201cfood\u201d. Thus, this user might be someone who has a very strong interest in food and somewhat of an interest in travel.","In some embodiments, vectors - are added in chronological order. Thus, the most recent tags would be shown on the right hand side. The oldest tags would be shown on the left hand side. Thus, additional information about the user could be determined. For example, if there were a large number of \u201cHawaii\u201d tags to the left of vector , and no \u201cHawaii\u201d tags in the later vectors (e.g., from  to  and past ), then it could be determined that perhaps there used to be an interest in Hawaii, but the user is no longer interested in Hawaii. For example, the user was planning a trip to Hawaii, but has now already completed the trip.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"382"},"At , the objects to be displayed are analyzed. For example, if the user is viewing a page of a photo sharing application, the objects in that page are analyzed. In some embodiments, object profiles of one or more of those objects are analyzed. All the objects on the page could be analyzed, or one or more selected objects could be analyzed. For example, if the page focuses on one or more particular objects, those objects could be analyzed. Analyzing the object could include identifying the tag phrases that the user and\/or others have assigned to that object and the number of times each of those tag phrases has been used by the user and\/or others.","At , content is selected. For example, the content could be selected based on the analysis of the user profile and\/or one or more of the object(s) that are being displayed. As such,  or  could be optional. The content could be selected independently of the content that is being displayed to the user. The content could be selected independently of the user.","Examples of content selected include advertising content, targeted content, or any other type of content. The content could include text, images, or any form of media. A content provider could specify the criteria for selecting the provider's content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["402","404","406","408"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"500"},"In this example, the user has tagged three objects. Two of those objects are photos and one is a URL. For example, object ID 324432 is a photo that the user has tagged \u201crestaurant\u201d, \u201csan francisco\u201d, \u201cyum\u201d, and \u201cbargain\u201d with tag strengths , no tag strength assigned, 4, and 1, respectively. The user has used tag phrase \u201crestaurant\u201d 34 times, tag phrase \u201csan francisco\u201d 91 times, \u201cyum\u201d 21 times, and \u201cbob\u201d one time.","In some embodiments, an advertiser can specify that advertisements be displayed to users who have profiles matching a certain criteria. For example, an advertiser could determine which profiles correlate with interest in the advertiser's product. For example, a San Francisco restaurant owner could decide that a user who uses tag phrases \u201crestaurant\u201d and\/or \u201cSan Francisco\u201d could be interested in his restaurant. The owner could specify that the advertisement be displayed when the user has used the tags \u201crestaurant\u201d and\/or \u201cSan Francisco\u201d a specified number of times.","In some embodiments, an advertiser can specify that advertisements be displayed to users when viewing objects or content associated with certain tag phrases. For example, an advertisement for a restaurant in San Francisco could be displayed when the user is viewing an object tagged \u201crestaurant\u201d and\/or \u201cSan Francisco\u201d a specified number of times by the user and\/or other users.","In some embodiments, advertising content is selected based on the user profile and the object(s) being viewed. For example, if the profile indicates that the user lives in San Francisco, the San Francisco restaurant advertisement could be displayed when the user is viewing an item tagged \u201crestaurant\u201d by the user a specified number of times or tagged \u201cmovie\u201d by other users a specified number of times.","Tag phrases with greater tag strengths may be weighted more strongly. For example, a tag phrase with a high tag strength could count for greater than one tag.","In some embodiments, content is selected based on the number of times a user uses a tag phrase relative to other tag phrases. For example, an advertiser could specify that the advertiser's content be displayed when a specified percentage of that user's tags are or relate to a particular tag phrase. For example, a restaurant advertisement is displayed to a user when over 5% of the user's tag phrases are \u201crestaurant\u201d.","In some embodiments, there is a thesaurus and\/or spell checker for identifying related tag phrases. Related tag phrases could add to the tag count. For example, if an object is tagged \u201cHawaii\u201d 10 times, \u201cHawaii\u201d once, and \u201cHawaiian Islands\u201d three times, this could be equivalent to the object having been tagged \u201cHawaii\u201d 14 times. In some embodiments, the related tag phrases are weighted less.","Object information could be used to select content. For example, if there are N or more objects in the user profile of type photo, a photography advertisement could be displayed. If there are N or more objects of type classified ad, a shopping advertisement could be displayed. If the objects are of type car_classified_ad, a car advertisement could be displayed.","Tag information and object information can be combined to select content. For example, if there are N objects of type classified advertisement tagged, and M objects tagged \u201cbike\u201d, then a bike advertisement could be displayed.","In some embodiments, information in the user profile can be associated with demographic or other information of interest, e.g., to advertisers, including, for example, gender, age (or age group), race, interests, hobbies, occupation, income, etc. In some embodiments, advertisements are selected based on such information. For example, an advertiser can specify that its advertisements be displayed to users whose user profiles match criteria that are associated with a certain demographic.","Various methods can be used to determine such information about a user profile. For example, tag phrases can be used to identify interests. For example, since one of the tag phrases used is \u201cbargain\u201d, it can be determined that the user might be interested in inexpensive products. Information can be determined from multiple tag phrases and combined. For example, since another tag phrase is \u201crestaurant\u201d, it can be determined that the user is interested in inexpensive restaurants. Tag phrases that have been used a greater number of times may be weighted more strongly. For example, because \u201csan francisco\u201d has been used by the user 91 times, it could be determined that the user resides in or has a strong interest in San Francisco, or products related to San Francisco, such as shopping or services in San Francisco.","Tag phrases with greater tag strengths may also be weighted more strongly. In some embodiments, a metric can be used to determine how well a tag phrase can be associated with or correlated with a user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"500"},"For example, the photo object with ID 324432 has been tagged \u201cpizza\u201d by 231 users. When this photo is displayed to the user, one or more pizza advertisements could be displayed. The user has not necessarily tagged this photo \u201cpizza\u201d. The user has not necessarily tagged this photo at all.","In various embodiments, such information is included in an object profile. For example, in an object profile of object ID 324432 could include the object type, what users have tagged this object, and number of times users have used each tag phrase on the object.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["502","504","506","508","510"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 8A"},"For example, if a user is viewing the photo with object ID 324432, then it is determined that \u201cyum\u201d is a tag phrase. Other objects the user has tagged \u201cyum\u201d include restaurants. Thus, the user might be interested in restaurants or food. Other objects that others have tagged using \u201cyum\u201d include recipes. Thus, the user might be interested in recipes or cooking, even though the user may not have directly tagged any recipe \u201cyum\u201d. Thus, content can be selected based on other tag phrases or object types associated with object(s) tagged by the user. For example, if an advertiser specifies \u201cyum\u201d and \u201crecipes\u201d as the tag phrases that would cause the advertiser's content to be displayed, then in this case, the advertiser's content would be displayed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 8B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 8C"},"In this example, the types of objects that have been contributed by this user are listed, as well as the number of objects of each type that have been contributed.

For example, the object type \u201ccar_blog\u201d has been defined by the user, but an object of type \u201ccar_blog\u201d has not yet been contributed by the user.","In some embodiments, because the object type \u201cgarden_photo\u201d was contributed by the user 87 times, it can be determined that the user is interested in gardens. Similarly, it could be determined that the user is interested in cars because the object type \u201ccar_blog\u201d was defined by the user, even if no objects of that type have yet been contributed by the user or others.

In some embodiments, core  includes a data access layer for accessing data in shared data model .","Runtime environment  can run any number of independently written applications. An application can be written in any language that generates HTML, such as PHP, Python, ASP, C#, Java, Javascript, Ruby or .NET or any language that can be used to view information provided over a network (e.g., the Internet, an intranet, a mobile network, or any other type of network). The applications do not all need to be written in the same language. An application includes calls to APIs  to access shared services .","Any type of application can be developed, any one of which can utilize the set of services and APIs provided by core . Examples of applications that could be created include auctions, product reviews, jobs, social networks, alumni networks, etc. Various tools can be provided for application development. For example, wizards, widgets, and example applications can be provided. Widgets could include, for example, listings, user registration, listings, photos, discussions, blogs, reviews, calendars, maps, rankings, ratings, recommendations, reputation, transactions, tagging, etc. Templates could be provided. For example, a marketplace or dating service template could be provided and multiple applications could be independently created based on that template. Tools could be provided for developers of all skill levels. For example, a wizard or a GUI could be provided for beginning computer users, and example applications (e.g., showing calls to various APIs and making use of various services) could be provided to amateur developers. APIs for mobile platforms could be provided, including photo, email, and\/or SMS upload\/download, GPS tracking, and alerts. Documentation, discussion boards, books, evangelism, and support could also be provided to help users create and maintain applications.","Core  maintains security between browser  and core , and between core  and runtime environment , as more fully described below. Core  can be viewed as a proxy between browser  and an application running in runtime environment . Core  authenticates users so that applications running in runtime environment  do not need to handle user authentication. Applications can trust users authenticated by core , and users can trust applications that are served by server system .","Postprocessor  postprocesses responses from applications running in runtime environment . For example, post processor  assembles output from an application with data from shared data model . In some embodiments, a web page is assembled and sent to browser , where it is displayed. In some embodiments, the output from the application includes instructions written in HTML. The instructions could include XML tags that refer to certain content object IDs and specify how they should be displayed.

The view file can be included in the response at . In some embodiments, the view file is written in HTML and\/or XML. An object can be associated with multiple view files contributed by multiple developers. For example, a developer might create for a particular object a view file to display the object in a small or large area. For example, a developer could create an object of type restaurant review with attributes \u201cname\u201d, \u201cimage\u201d, \u201creview\u201d, and \u201curl\u201d. The view file could specify that that the image of the restaurant be displayed on a first line, the restaurant name be displayed on a second line, and the review be displayed on a third line. The view file could specify that selecting (e.g., using a mouse to click on) the name of the restaurant would lead to the website of the restaurant. In some embodiments, a view file is retrieved from the application that owns the object to be displayed. In some embodiments, a view file is retrieved from a registry of publicly available view files. Developers can contribute view files to the registry. In some embodiments, if there is no description (e.g., a view file) specified, the objects are displayed according to a default description (e.g., a default view file).","In some embodiments, only content objects that are public, or private but available to the particular user and\/or application (as determined by the identifier included in the response), are retrieved. For example, if a content object having object ID  is specified, and object ID  is private and owned by an application other than the one responding, core  will not provide that object to the requesting application. Similarly, if that object is private and owned by another user, that object will not be provided. At , the page is sent to the user. As such, the core can be configured to enforce security of content based on the user or the application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0108"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["912","1202","1106","408"]},"At , depending on the application instructions, a request (or query) is sent to the core. For example, a request to retrieve all photos tagged \u201ccat\u201d is sent to the core. In some embodiments, the request includes the identifier received at . In some embodiments, the request is delivered using a network API, such as SOAP. For example, a binding can be provided that interprets a PHP request from the application and forwards the request to the core using SOAP. At , a response is received from the core. For example, all photos tagged \u201ccat\u201d are received. The data received from the core is optionally processed. For example, the photos tagged \u201ccat\u201d could be pruned to include only the photos that are also tagged by the user's friends (assuming a list of friends is associated with the user) and\/or were added within the last 24 hours. At , if another request is made, the process returns to . Otherwise, at , a response is sent to the core. In some embodiments, the response includes the identifier received at .

A request is sent to core  including username joe and a password. Core  receives the request, authenticates Joe, and associates an identifier ID with the request. Core  sends the request, ID, and optionally the username and role to application . Application  receives the request and can determine that the user is joe. Application  sends a query to core  for photos of Hawaii and comments on those photos. The query includes the identifier ID) so that core  can authenticate the request. Core  receives the request, checks the identifier, and retrieves all content objects of type photo that are tagged Hawaii and all content objects of type comment made by Bob and his friends. Core  only retrieves objects that are public or owned by Bob and his friends. These objects are sent to application . Application  receives the objects.","In this example, the structure of the comment object includes the object ID of the photo being commented on. As such, application  can identify the photos that were commented on by Bob and his friends, and then select a few other photos (e.g., the two photos of Hawaii with the most tags) to display on the page for Joe. Application  sends a response to core . The response includes identifier ID so that the server can authenticate the response. The response includes the object IDs of the five photos, the object ID's of the comments, and a description of how they all should be displayed (e.g., view files). Core  receives the response, assembles the page of photos and comments according to the response, and sends the page to browser . Joe then sees in the page the photos commented on by Bob and his friends, and the two photos of Hawaii with the most tags.","Joe views the page of photos and comments, and decides to add a comment of his own. Joe enters a comment, and hits a submit button. A request is sent to core . Core  authenticates Joe and associates a new identifier, ID, with the request. The request is forwarded along with ID to application . Application  receives the request and identifies the user as \u201cjoe\u201d. Application  tags the comment as private and sends a request to core  to put the comment in shared data model . The request includes ID. Core  receives the request, checks the identifier, and puts the data in shared data model . An object ID is associated with the object. In some embodiments, a response is sent to application  indicating the object ID of the comment. Application  sends a response to core  including the object IDs of the five photos, the object ID's of the old comments, and the object ID of the new comment. Text can be included, such as \u201cYour comment has been accepted and is only viewable by you and your friends.\u201d Core  assembles the page of photos and comments according to the response, and sends it to browser  for display. Joe then sees in the page the photos commented on by Bob and his friends, the two photos of Hawaii with the most tags, Joe's newly added comment, and the text \u201cYour comment has been accepted and is only viewable by you and your friends.\u201d","In this example, the comment submitted by Joe is private. If it were instead public, then it would then become available to other applications and users for accessing and viewing. In this way, the shared data model can receive data from multiple applications and share data with multiple applications.","Numerous other applications can be written that retrieve and display the same data objects in various ways. For example, multiple users can write multiple applications that store photo objects in different ways. For example, each photo object could include metadata indicating where the photo was taken. The application could retrieve all photos of Hawaii, determine their locations, and display them on a map of Hawaii at the location at which they were taken. Another application written by another independent user could display the same photos in order of where they lie on the RGB spectrum.","Any type of content object could be used by any application. An application could include content contributed by other applications. For example, Bob could create an application that displays restaurant reviews contributed by his friends using his application. In addition, Bob might include other restaurant reviews contributed by other applications in his restaurant review application. Bob might also include classified ads on a portion of his restaurant reviews page because there might be an incentive provided to include them.","Although the foregoing embodiments have been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding, the invention is not limited to the details provided.
