title: Independent information network
abstract: A localized collaboration of wireless communication enabled devices can be provided for sharing of information that is independent of external communications. A local hub can communicate with a remote hub and end users using one or more wireless communication points, and provide for uploading and downloading of collaborative information from the local hub by an end user device. The local hub wirelessly broadcasts a message that has contact information that allows a remote hub to wirelessly retrieve collaborative information from the local hub. The local hub can synchronize collaborative information with a remote hub, if present, by retrieving a remote version of collaborative information using the remote hub's broadcast contact information; comparing the remote version with a locally stored version, if present; updating the local version with differences between the remote version if the remote version is a desired; and creating a local version if one is not present.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Often, after natural disasters (and possibly man-made disasters) local infrastructure is impaired. For example, electrical power, telecommunications land-lines, and even mobile communications towers are damaged and unusable in some areas affected by the disaster. However, communications typically remains desirable for those that remain in the area by choice or happenstance. Emergency responders, families and friends may wish to find out who is still around after the disaster. Further, individuals that remain in a neighborhood may be able to mitigate problems if they organize and band together to support each other. Additionally, availability of desirable supplies and information may need to be communicated to those in the area. For at least these reasons, a reliable way to collaborate information may be desirable in an area that lacks sufficient local infrastructure.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","A hurricane can wipe out electrical power, and virtually all other forms of communications in a large area. However, people often remain behind in their neighborhood for a variety of reasons. In order for those remaining individuals to communicate with each other, to organize, find people, and communicate vital information, a reliable collaboration network can be established. Because most people currently have wireless enabled computing devices, such as laptops, handheld devices, mobile smart phones, etc., a mesh-type network may be desirable to facilitate information collaboration in an area lacking proper infrastructure.","Currently, some solutions exist that allow for a local area network (LAN) to be created using radio nodes. These current systems rely on a central set of software and network services to provide some sort of federation. Further, while these nodes can be physically arranged in a type of mesh network in an area, they do not provide for ad-hoc type configuration and synchronization of collaborative information, instead needing to be physically booted and connected to respective nodes in a pre-arranged configuration and network setup.","As provided herein, techniques and systems that enable end user devices that are wirelessly enabled to communicate with each other in an area that lacks outside communication and power, by linking to independent hubs, and having the hubs synchronize user collaborated information with each other. For example, end users can connect to a local hub and upload (or download) information feeds (e.g. RSS or atom web-feeds). If a remote hub is within wireless communications range, the local hub can synchronize the feeds to the remote hub, whereby end users connected to the remote hub can download the feeds.","In one embodiment, a local independent information hub (hub) can communicate with one or more remote hubs and one or more end user devices using one or more local wireless communication points (e.g., WEP, WiMAX), for example, contained within the hub device. The local hub can provide for uploading and downloading of collaborative information from the local hub by an end user device, for example, using a web-server. Further, the local hub can wirelessly broadcasting a message that has contact information for the local hub (e.g., an IP address), and that allows a remote hub to wirelessly retrieve collaborative information (e.g., feeds) from the local hub. Additionally, the local hub can synchronize collaborative information with a remote hub, if present, by: wirelessly retrieving a remote version of feeds from the remote hub using the remote hub's broadcast contact information; comparing the remote version of the feed with a locally stored version, if present; updating the local version with differences between the remote version and the local version if the remote version is a desired version (e.g., preferred based on updates); and creating a local version if one is not present.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","A method may be devised whereby local wireless devices can link to a hub device, and hub devices can further be linked together to create a localized information network for users of local wireless devices. For example, where communications infrastructure is lacking in a particular area (e.g., after a hurricane) self-powered collaborative information hubs, provided with wireless communications capability, can be spread throughout the area. In this example, end users having wireless communications enabled devices (e.g., WiFi enabled laptops, portable digital assistants, and phones) can link to a hub within range. A hub can also link with another hub in range, thereby creating a localized network for communications between end users, for example.  is a flow chart diagram illustrating an exemplary method  for providing a localized collaboration of wireless communication enabled devices, for sharing information.","The exemplary method  begins at  and involves a local independent information hub (hub) using one or more wireless communication points to communicate with one or more remote hubs, and to communicate with one or more end users, at . In one embodiment, as shown in the exemplary environment  of , a local hub  may comprise two wireless communications points  and . In this embodiment, a first local wireless communications point  may be used by the local hub  to communicate with a remote hub . Further, a second local wireless communications point  may be used by the local hub  to communicate with one or more end user devices .","In another embodiment, the local hub may comprise a local wireless communications point that can be used to communicate with both a remote hub and end user devices. Further, in another embodiment, a local hub may use a plurality of wireless communication points to communicate with a plurality of devices and\/or remote hubs using different wireless technologies. For example, a local hub may communicate with end user devices using Wi-Fi radio wave transmissions in accordance with the IEEE 802.11 standard (e.g., 802.11g). Additionally, the local hub may communicate using Bluetooth radio wave technology, thereby using a second wireless communications point. Also, the local hub may utilize Wi-Fi, WiMAX, or some other longer-range wireless communications, to communicate between the local and a remote hub.","It will be noted that the techniques and systems described herein are not limited to any particular form of wireless communications. It is anticipated that those skilled in the art may devise alternate techniques and systems for wireless communications. For example, a long-range radio transmission (e.g., short-wave radio) signal may be used to communicate with a plurality of hubs simultaneously in order to provide them with updated information.","At , in the exemplary method , the local hub provides for uploading and downloading of collaborative information by end user devices. For example, a series of hub devices can be deployed in an area after a natural disaster, where typical infrastructure availability is limited (e.g., electrical power, land-line phones, mobile phones, and Internet are lost). In one embodiment, as illustrated in the exemplary environment  of , respective hubs  and  can be activated to communicate wirelessly with end user devices . In another embodiment, an end user may plug a device into the local hub to access the uploading and downloading of information.","Respective hubs  and  can provide a service, for example, using a computing device  and  that allows an end user to upload their status to the hub  and  (e.g., that they are alive and located at their house with their family). Further, the end user can use their device to download information about other end users linked to the hub  and , and\/or services that may be available in their area (e.g., water is going to be dropped off at a certain time and location). In this example, a localized network can be created in the area lacking infrastructure, connecting end user devices to a local hub.","At  the local hub wirelessly broadcasts a message, which comprises contact information for the local hub, so that a remote hub may contact the local hub to wirelessly retrieve collaborative information. In one embodiment, as illustrated in the exemplary embodiment  of , a local hub  may broadcast  contact information that comprises a protocol address for the local hub , such as an IP address, which a remote hub  can use to contact  the local hub . Further, in one embodiment, the local hub  can broadcast locator information, such as a uniform source locator (URL) for collaborative information feed, where the locator comprises an entry point for retrieving  the feed from the local hub . As an example, local hub may broadcast a message with their IP address and a list of URLs for respective information feeds stored on the hub, such as those that may be accessed through a web-server on the local hub. In this example, a remote hub in range of the broadcast may save the contact information (e.g., in a remote hub cache) and use it to retrieve collaborative information feed updates from the local hub.","At , in the exemplary method , collaborative information, such as information feeds, is synchronized between the local and remote hub. For example, a local hub may have broadcast contact information that was received by one or more remote hubs. In one embodiment, a synchronization timer may initiate synchronization of the collaborative information between the local and remote hubs. In another embodiment, a user or some other event may initiate the synchronization between the hubs.","At , synchronizing the collaborative information between the local and remote hub comprises having the local hub wirelessly retrieve a remote version of collaborative information (e.g., an information feed identified by its URL) from the remote hub, using contact information broadcast by the remote hub. For example, end users connected to a remote hub may create or update a collaborative information feed on the hub with new information, such as an updated neighborhood watch schedule that includes newly added people and areas. The local hub can begin synchronization of the feeds, in this example, by retrieving the newly updated feed from the remote hub using the remote hub's contact information.","At , synchronizing the collaborative information between the local and remote hub comprises having the local hub compare the remote version of the collaborative information with a locally stored version, if a local version is present. In one embodiment, a collaborative information feed that has been retrieved from a remote hub, such as one that comprises updated information about people that are still in a neighborhood after a natural disaster, may have a type of file marker that identifies when the feed was last changed and what was changed or added to the feed, for example. In this embodiment, the local hub can compare the marker from the remote feed with a local version of the feed stored on the local hub, if a local version is available, to determine if the remote feed is different (e.g., has been updated) from the local feed.","At , synchronizing of the collaborative information between the local and remote hub further comprises the local hub updating the local version of the collaborative information with differences between the remote version and the local version if it is determined that the remote version is a desired version (e.g., preferred over the local version due to more recent updates to the feed). In one embodiment, the local and remote versions of a feed are compared to determine which is the preferred version. For example, where a local version of a feed may comprise more recently updated information, the local version can be the preferred version. However, in this example, if the remote version comprises more recent information, it can be the preferred version. Where a conflict arises, for example, where both version have been recently updated, a desired version determination may be made based on an amount, type, and time of the updated information in the feed versions.","In another embodiment, a label or tag may be assigned to a version of a feed, which may allow it to be the desired version. For example, a new information update may be added by a user in an area and uploaded to a local hub, where the user wishes to ensure that other users of the wireless collaboration receive the updated information, such as a water delivery time and location. The user can tag the update so that it becomes a desired version and is thereby copied to other remote hubs. In these embodiments, the local hub can determine which version is the desired version and copy it to local storage (or keep its version if it is desired).","At , synchronizing of the collaborative information between the local and remote hub further comprises creating a local version of the remote collaborative information if a local version is not present. For example, if the local hub retrieves feeds from the remote hub using the contact information broadcast by the remote hub, and the local hub does not have a version of one or more of the remote feeds, the local hub can copy the one or more remote feeds to its local storage. In one embodiment, a user of an end user device, such as illustrated by  in , , is connected to a remote hub , and the user creates a new collaborative information feed.","As an example, in this embodiment, the end user may wish to start a neighborhood watch schedule, so they begin a feed that allows other end users to fill in times when they can participate. The end user can user their device  to connect to the remote hub , and create the feed on the hub's web-server located on a computing device  in hub . During synchronization, the local hub  can retrieve the newly created remote feed  using the contact information broadcast by the remote hub . The local hub  can store the new feed on local storage located on a local computing device . End users connected to the local hub  can retrieve the new feed from the local hub , allowing them to review the neighborhood watch schedule and upload changes to the schedule, which in-turn can be sent back to the remote hub  to be viewed by end users connected to that hub .","In one aspect, as an example, a series of hubs can be deployed in an area that has lost local infrastructure, such as electrical power, land-line phones, cell-phone communications, and Internet access. In this aspect, in one embodiment, a plurality of hubs can be may be allocated to an area (e.g., by a state or local disaster relief agency), and dropped off for set up by people still located in the area after a natural disaster.","In one embodiment, the hubs may be self contained units comprising an internal power source (e.g., rechargeable batteries) that merely need to be placed in an appropriate location and switched on. As an example, a plurality of hubs can be distributed throughout the area, connect with each other, thereby allowing end users in the area to connect with one another to share information locally and organize a neighborhood after a natural disaster.  is a flow diagram illustrating one embodiment  of an exemplary portion of a method whereby hubs may be initiated.","The exemplary embodiment  begins at  and involves initiating the hub, for example, by switching it on. In another embodiment, hubs may not comprise internal power sources or their batteries may be depleted; therefore the hubs may need to be connected to an external power source, such as a car battery, in order to be initiated. Once initiated, a hub can proceed through an start-up procedure that may merely proceed at initiation and will not be repeated unless the hub needs to be restarted for some reason.","At , information feeds that are stored locally on the hub are enumerated. In one embodiment, a hub that is deployed for a first time may comprise one or more pre-loaded information feeds to supply end-users with particular information. For example, the hub may comprise a feed that gives end users instructions on how to utilize the collaborative information network set up by the hubs. In this example, a pre-loaded end-user identification feed can be used by people in the area to identify who is still present in the neighborhood. Another pre-loaded feed may comprise a neighborhood watch setup schedule that end users can use to begin organizing a watch. A number of pre-loaded files may be used to help a neighborhood organize and communicate after an infrastructure failure, such as after a natural disaster.","At , a broadcast message can be constructed by the hub. As described above, a broadcast message can comprise the hub's contact information, such as an IP address, for remote hubs that have been deployed in the area to contact the local hub. Further, the broadcast message can comprise a list of locators, such as URLs, for local feeds that were enumerated for the hub. Therefore, as an example, the broadcast message may comprise an IP address of the hub and a list of URLs for the feeds (e.g., RSS or atom) concatenated at the end.","At , the message can be broadcast to other hubs that may have been deployed in the area. As an example, hubs may have been placed at locations in an area whereby respective hubs are within wireless communications range of at least one other hub. In this way, in this example, a string of hubs can be placed in an area that allow for desired coverage using a minimal number of hubs, so that respective hubs can pass information from one end of the string to the other. Therefore, when a plurality of hubs are deployed in area and initiated, for example, the respective hubs can broadcast a message that comprise their contact information and locators for feeds on the hubs.","At , a local feed information cache can be populated from persistent storage. In one embodiment, the local hub can comprise a local feed information cache, which stores information about collaborative information feeds stored in persistent storage on the local hub. For example, the local feed information cache may store merely a title and description for a local feed, such as a UUID and a string that describes what is contained in the feed. In this way, in this embodiment, the cache can comprise merely small amounts of information about local feeds in a format that can be standardized for respective hubs. Respective hubs can then merely store small amount of information about feeds that may be utilized in a collaborative network.","At , a synchronization timer can be started. In one embodiment, a synchronization timer may be used by a hub to determine when a next synchronization of information feeds between the local hub and a remote hub may be initiated. Therefore, for example, when the synchronization timer initiates a next synchronization the hub may again broadcast a message comprising feed information. After starting the synchronization timer the exemplary method ends at .","In another aspect, a local hub may detect a wireless broadcast from a remote hub. For example, when a remote hub is initialized, as described above, it puts together a message comprising contact information and locators for feeds located on the remote hub. In this aspect, the local hub can then save the information broadcast by the remote hub to a local external feed information cache. In one embodiment, this cache can then be stored in persistent memory on the local hub.  is a flow diagram illustrating one embodiment  of a portion of an exemplary method where remote information is stored on a local hub.","At , in the exemplary embodiment , a broadcast is received from a remote hub, such as when the remote hub is initiated. At , the local hub can review the message broadcast by the remote hub to determine whether it contains feed information. For example, if the remote hub does not have any information feeds stored thereon the message broadcast by the remote hub may merely comprise an IP address for the remote hub. If there is no feed information in the remote message the exemplary embodiment of the method ends at .","However, if the remote message comprises locator information for one or more collaborative information feeds concatenated with an address for the remote hub, at , the exemplary embodiment  of the method looks at the respective remote feeds, at . The local hub can review the remote feed information and compare it to information stored in a local feed information cache, at . For example, when an information feed is created a title and description can be created for the feed. A title may be some short descriptor for the feed, such as an ID, UUID, a string name, or other short string that can be used to identify the feed. Further, the title may be a string that is used in a URL for the feed, for example.","In one embodiment, titles of respective information feeds found on a local hub may be stored in a local feed information cache for the local hub. In this way, for example, the local hub can merely check a title of the remote feed against titles of feeds stored in the local feed information cache to determine whether a local version is present. At , if the local feed information cache comprises a matching entry for the remote feed, the next remote feed can be reviewed, if one is present, at .","However, if a matching entry for the remote feed is not found in the local feed information cache, at , a matching entry for the remote feed is created and added to the local feed information cache, at . After creating a local entry for the remote feed information for a next remote feed can be reviewed, at . In this embodiment , the  to  loop can be repeated for the respective remote feeds identified in the remote broadcast.","At , the information broadcast by the remote hub and received by the local hub is saved to an external feed info cache in the local hub. In one embodiment, the external feed info cache can be used by a local hub to store contact information for remote hubs within wireless range of the local hub, along with feed locators for information feeds located on the remote hubs. In one embodiment, the cached remote broadcast information can be saved to persistent storage, such as a hard drive disk, on the local hub. Having saved the remote feed information, the exemplary embodiment  of the method ends at .","In another aspect, hubs deployed in an area can synchronize collaborative information feeds located on the respective hubs. In one embodiment, collaborative information in the form of an RSS feed can be created by an end user connected to a local hub by the end user's device that is wirelessly enabled. The collaborative information feed may be, for example, a list of food stores that the end user has available for neighbors in need, created with an intent for other neighbors linked to the collaborative network to update the feed with a list of additional supplies available, thereby collaborating to create and update the information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["400","402","200"]},"At , the local hub enumerates local feeds and creates a local feed information cache, as described in , . In this embodiment, for example, end users connected to the local hub may have created or updated information feeds and uploaded them to the local hub. In this example, the newly created feeds can be enumerated and the information that identifies the feeds can saved to the local information feed cache.","At , a broadcast message is constructed for the local feed, which can comprise contact information for the local hub, along with locator information for the local feeds. The message is broadcast from the local hub, at , and if a remote hub is within wireless communications range of the local hub's broadcast it can receive the broadcast. In this embodiment , respective remote hubs can also broadcast messages that comprise contact information and feed locators, which may be received by the local hub if it is within wireless range.","At , the respective feeds identified in the remote hubs' broadcasts are reviewed. The local hub determines whether its local feed information cache has a matching entry for the remote feed, at , as described above. If there is no matching information in the cache a new entry is created in the local cache, at . On the other hand, if the local cache already has the information for the remote feed, the local feed version information is retrieved from the local hubs storage, at .","At , the remote feed can be retrieved from the remote hub, for example, using the remote broadcast information stored in the external information feed hub, and is compared with the local feed. If there are changes to the remote feed that are not found in the local version of the feed those changes can be incorporated into the local feed version, at . For example, an end user connected to the remote feed can add information to the collaborative information feed in question and uploaded it to the remote hub. In this example, this updated information can be synchronized to the local feed version, thereby providing updated feeds to the end users connected to the local hub.","At , the remote feed can be updated to indicate that the changes found in the remote feed have been incorporated into the local feed. In one embodiment, a place marker can be used in the file that comprises the feed indicating that the changes have been incorporated. In this embodiment, for example, future synchronization may be facilitated as hubs can merely look for this place marker to indicate whether additional changes have been made, and\/or if they have already been incorporated.","At , the remote feed is placed at an end of a processing queue for the synchronization. In this way, for example, the respective feeds identified during synchronization can be addressed. Further, for example, if information retrieval or processing for a particular feed times out due to some processing or retrieval error, the processing queue can move to a next feed instead of stalling at a frozen feed.","The information broadcast by the remote hub is saved to the remote feed information cache, such as contact information and feed locators, by the local hub, at . At , a next information feed for the particular remote hub broadcast is reviewed. In this embodiment , after the respective feeds are processed for the respective remote hubs that broadcast for the synchronization, a synchronization timer can be restarted if utilized. In this way, for example, if a synchronization timer is utilized, a next synchronization can be initiated when the timer reaches the desired time duration between synchronizations.","Having started the timer, the exemplary embodiment  of the method ends at .","A system may be devised for providing a localized collaboration of wireless communication enabled devices, independent of external communications, for sharing of information.  is a component block diagram illustrating an exemplary system  for creating and managing a mesh network configured to share collaborative information with end users. Using the exemplary system , end users may connect  to a local hub to upload, download, and collaborate on information, which in turn can be connected to remote hubs  to collaborate with other end users connected to remote hubs.","The exemplary system  comprises one or more wireless communications points  and  that are operably coupled to a local independent information hub (hub). The one or more wireless communications points  and  can be respectively configured to provide end user devices with wireless access to the local hub , and\/or provide for wireless communications between the local hub and a remote hub . In one embodiment, a first wireless communications point , such as a wireless access point (WEP), can be used to connect end user devices that are wirelessly enabled to the local hub. In this embodiment, a second wireless communications point , such as a wireless node point (e.g., a WiMAX connection point), can be used to connect the local hub to a remote hub .","The exemplary system  further comprises a web-server component  that is operably coupled to the local hub. Further, the web-server component  is configured to run web applications that provide access to collaborative information feeds  from the local hub. In one embodiment, the collaborative information feeds  may comprise web-feeds (e.g., RSS or atom feeds) that are configured to provide end users with updated information content from a local hub. In this embodiment, for example, the updated information may be information uploaded to the hub by end users connected wirelessly to the hub, or connected to a remote hub.","The exemplary system  further comprises one or more local database components , which are operably coupled to the local hub, and are configured to provide for local hub storage of collaborative information feeds  and metadata for the collaborative information feeds . In one embodiment, a database  may utilize persistent storage  on the local hub to store web-feeds uploaded to the local hub by end users , and\/or copied from remote hubs . The database  can also be used to organize and store a cache comprising information about local and remote feeds (e.g., contact and locator info for remote feeds).","The exemplary system  further comprises a synchronization component  that is operably coupled to the local hub, and is configured to synchronize collaborative information feeds  between the local hub and the remote hub . In one embodiment, a local hub can detect a remote hub's broadcast, which may comprise remote hub contact information and locators for feeds located on the remote hub. In this embodiment, for example, the synchronization component  can synchronize the remote hub's version of a feed with the local hub's version of the feed, thereby providing for updated collaborative information between hubs in a mesh network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","700","604","712","652","652","604","714","652"]},"For example, an end user connected to the hub, using the wireless communication point  can access the web server .

The feed retrieval component  is further configured to retrieve the remote collaboration information feed from the remote hub. In this way, for example, remote information feeds can be retrieved from the remote hubs during synchronization between a local and remote hub.","The synchronization component  further comprises a feed comparison component  that is configured to compare a local version of the collaboration information feed  with the remote version of the collaboration information feed to identify differences between the versions. The feed comparison component  is further configured to determine which version of the collaboration information feed is a desired version. In one embodiment, where differences are identified between the local and remote version of a feed, the feed comparison component  can determine which version is desired, for example, based on an amount and type of changes, age of changes, and\/or whether a place marker indicates a more preferred version.","Based on the determination by the feed comparison component , a feed merging component  in the synchronization component  can merge the local version of the collaboration information feed  with the remote version, if differences are identified and the remote version is the desired version. Therefore, if the local version of the feed  is desired it can remain unchanged, for example, whereas the remote version can be merged into the local version if the remote version is desired.","In the exemplary embodiment , the system further comprises an external feed information cache  that is configured to store a remote hub address, remote hub locator, and a feed descriptor for respective remote collaborative information feeds identified by the local hub. Therefore when a remote hub broadcasts contact information (e.g., a remote hub IP address) and locators (e.g., URLs on a remote web-server) for remote information feeds, the local hub can store this broadcast information in the external feed information cache , for example. In one embodiment, the cached remote information can be saved to persistent storage  using the local hub's database .","The exemplary embodiment  of the system further comprises a local feed info cache  that is configured to store a local feed locator and a local feed descriptor for respective local collaborative information feeds stored by the local hub. Therefore the local hub can retrieve the information stored in the local feed info cache  to construct a broadcast message sent out to remote hubs that may be within wireless communications range, for example.

Further the local hub can be configured to display a signal that identifies when the remote hub is within wireless communications range. For example, a plurality of hub devices may be dropped off in a neighborhood that has experienced loss of power and communications. Potential end users of the hubs may then place the hubs throughout the neighborhood in strategic locations to create a mesh communications network for the area. In this example, the local hub may display a green light that indicates the hub is within wireless communications range of another hub. When the hub is moved out of range the light can switch to red.
