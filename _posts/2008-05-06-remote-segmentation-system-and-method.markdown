title: Remote segmentation system and method
abstract: Remote segmentation is a process by which segmentation data is collected from a third party and applied to an existing database. In a preferred embodiment of remote segmentation, a definition is added that makes the local system aware of all the possible segmentation dimensions in a way that is presentable to the user as well as transmittable to a third party (in house or other company) which processes the segment and returns the result.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/916,685 filed 8 May 2007, entitled \u201cRemote Segmentation,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates generally to relational database management systems and applications using such systems. In particular, it relates to a software system that collects segmentation data.","The ability to market a product or service to individuals who are accessible on the Internet is becoming increasingly important. Email systems exist today for sending email to a target set of email addresses for purposes such as marketing, information acquisition, and otherwise. A system for sending email to a number of email targets for such purposes is called an email campaign.","In addition, the Internet provides the capability to provide services to customers without requiring them to install additional software on their local computers. Specifically, by exploiting the customer's web browser, all functional logic and all data can reside at a remote server rather than at the customer's local computer (i.e., the client). As such, the customer, via instructions submitted through web pages that are displayed in the web browser, can remotely invoke the functional logic to view, create, update, delete or otherwise modify the data residing on the remote server.","Furthermore, computer databases or similar constructions are powerful tools for storage, organization, retrieval and other handling of various types of information. However, there are different database models, or formats, for data access that are incompatible with each other, and may also be incompatible with, or remarkably different from, an object programming application. In this respect, complex relationships between objects present in the object programming application may be entirely absent in a relational or object database being accessed or updated. Nonetheless, many of these database types have achieved a high level of popularity and proliferation.","A distributed database is a database in which portions of the database are stored on multiple computers within a network. Users have access to the portion of the database at their location so that they can access the data relevant to their tasks without interfering with the work of others. A centralized distributed database management system (DDBMS) manages the database as if it were all stored on the same computer. The DDBMS synchronizes all the data periodically and, in cases where multiple users must access the same data, ensures that updates and deletes performed on the data at one location will be automatically reflected in the data stored elsewhere.","Collections of data such as in a database can be distributed across multiple physical locations. A distributed database is distributed into separate partitions and fragments. Each partition and fragment of a distributed database may be replicated. Besides distributed database replication and fragmentation, there are many other distributed database design technologies. For example, there are local autonomy, synchronous and asynchronous distributed database technologies. These technologies' implementation depends on the needs of the business and the sensitivity and confidentiality of the data to be stored in the database, and hence the price the business is willing to spend on ensuring data security, consistency and integrity. Also, a database server is the software managing a database, and a client is an application that requests information from a server. Each computer in a system is a node. A node in a distributed database system acts as a client, a server, or both, depending on the situation.","Furthermore, there are advantages of distributed databases. This is reflected in organizational structure. Database fragments are located in the departments they relate to. A department can control the data about them, giving them local autonomy. There is improved availability; a fault in one database system will only affect one fragment, instead of the entire database. Additionally, there is improved performance because data is located near the site of greatest demand and the database systems themselves are parallelized, allowing load on the databases to be balanced among servers. A high load on one module of the database will not affect other modules of the database in a distributed database.","From an economic standpoint, it costs less to create a network of smaller computers with the power of a single large computer. Also, systems can be modified, added and removed from the distributed database without affecting other modules (systems). However, increased complexity and a more extensive infrastructure means extra labor costs. Furthermore, remote database fragments must be secured, and they are not centralized so the remote sites must be secured as well. The infrastructure must also be secured (e.g., by encrypting the network links between remote sites).","Email service providers face problems. The solution is to have database administrators and application developers retain control over their data warehouse and marketers have the flexibility to change variables in their segmentation without making an additional request to the information technology (IT) staff. Businesses often struggle to maintain a working relationship between transactional and marketing data. Often, the data required to make decisions lives in a custom data warehouse which can only be queried via custom requirements in an on-demand fashion. Making transaction level data available directly to a marketer can be cause for concern for IT staff and often requires some knowledge about relational databases and how to interact with them.","Accordingly, there is a strong need for more efficient and flexible data collection from a third party to be applied to an existing database. There is a need for an internal system to make segmentation calls to other non-email service provider data sources and those sources, combined with client requirements. The present invention provides a solution to these needs and other problems, and offers other advantages over the prior art.","The present invention is related to a software system that solves the above-mentioned problems. Some sort of behavior information about an individual may be located in a database in various areas. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that these areas may be disjointed or separated. The behavior information can include profiles of subscribers. The customer profiles have data such as demographics, preferences, and behaviors, but are not limited to this list.","Customers can also subscribe to an email list. Subscriber list profiles can be located in various e-commerce platforms. Furthermore, the database may be owned by a third party, including clients and vendors. In one embodiment of remote segmentation system and method, a request is sent to an owner of a database for a subset of information. The response includes a list of people that match the request. In a very simple example, the request asks for all people who did not purchase a Movado 24-carat gold plated watch. The response will then segment the database to contain all customers who purchased items excluding the specified watch, without saving the segment and overloading the current system. A user, marketer, or client can then send a message to the customers in the segment.","Also, in a preferred embodiment, remote segmentation provides the ability for a cast or bid party to define a user interface in an application that exposes or limits parameters to access the data (such as customer behavior). This allows a user to make categories, items, parameters, etc. available in the flexible user interface based on definitions entered by the third party customer.","In another embodiment, a user may receive fresh or updated data requests through the user interface for data segments. For example, the user may request \u201cfreshness\u201d values for a data expiration window without making multiple requests for the entire data stores, thereby reducing strain on the third party. Also, in a further functional embodiment the format of the response and requests may be in extensible markup language (XML) or text format. Additionally, while utilizing remote segmentation as a whole, a user has the ability to approve peripheral actions such as email campaign functionality. Finally, in another preferred embodiment, the user has the ability to request a count or number of the specified data instead of the actual data itself.","Additional advantages and features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part, will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned by practice of the invention.","Remote segmentation is a process by which segmentation data is collected from a third party and applied to an existing database. In a preferred embodiment of remote segmentation, a definition is added that makes the local system aware of all the possible segmentation dimensions in a way that is presentable to the user as well as transmittable to a third party (in house or other company) which processes the segment and returns the result.","Some e-commerce companies offer the ability to send a request for a segment and get a result, but it is up to the user to wrap a user interface around that. In a preferred embodiment, remote segmentation is a system that can consume the types of data a segmentation engine can crunch and giving the user an interface that changes based on the different types of data the third party holds.","For example, a user wishes to create an email campaign for an airline company that has a promotion for discounted tickets to Greece. Database A, located in a remote location from the company, contains a list of one hundred email addresses. The user logs into a system that has a user interface and specifies a list of parameters. The parameters create a query for people who speak the Greek language. A remote segmentation engine sends the query to database A with a request for how many people speak Greek. The database A sends back a reply with Bob Smith's name and email (or any other requested information) as a person who speaks Greek. The remote segmentation engine then utilizes Bob Smith in a segment. The user then can send a message to the segmented population with details about discounted tickets. Thus, the remote segmentation system does not store the segment or any information about the segment. Instead, the system sends requests to remote databases and matches the request to create an intersection of information. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the remote database could be any external source of information. It will also be understood that a segment can also be an external group.","The customer profiles have data such as demographics, preferences, and behaviors, but are not limited to this list. Customers can also subscribe to an email list. Subscriber list profiles can be located in various e-commerce platforms. Furthermore, the database may be owned by a third party, including clients and vendors.","Definitions in Table 1 are intended to clarify terms and concepts used within this document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Commonly Used Terms"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"210pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Term","Definition"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["ISP","Internet Service Provider at which a subscriber's email address resides."]},{"entry":["Subscriber","A contact within an e-commerce system which has an email"]},{"entry":[{},"address."]},{"entry":["Deliverability","A word used to describe the success of an email message's"]},{"entry":[{},"effectiveness.

Remote segmentation has a remote control functionality that allows users to populate groups in the system from an external data source without logging into the system. A data source can be any file transfer protocol (FTP) site where customers post files of email addresses. The system has a checking mechanism in a message sending process that identifies when a message contains an external group and when it does not contain an external group. Furthermore, the system includes an end tag convention that customers use with external group files to ensure file retrieval.","In a preferred embodiment of remote segmentation system and method, the user interface allows the creation of external groups. Furthermore, it allows the user to define an external data source for the group and to include the definition of the path to the external group FTP location. The user can change the number of fields in the external group file in the remote location. Remote segmentation system also has approval process screens that include an approval process for the first few times the external group is utilized. The screen allows the user to view the message and have buttons that allow the user to approve the message for sending or send it back to drafts database. Failure state screens in the user interface identify failure messages when a file does not exist at the location specified for the external group. Additionally, in client accounts and subaccounts the remote segmentation feature may be activated or deactivated.","In another embodiment, a user may receive fresh or updated data requests through the user interface for data segments. For example, the user may request \u201cfreshness\u201d values for a data expiration window without making multiple requests for the entire data stores, thereby reducing strain on the third party. The user can define the following properties for an external group: type of file, number of fields, define field names, order of fields, and minimum refresh time. Minimum refresh time defines whether the contents of the external group are to be updated each time a message is sent using the external group. This would be defined by a time parameter. For example: if update time=now (0) then the external group would be populated with data from the external source each time the group is used in a message send. If the update time=once per week (7) then the external group would update the contents of the group from the external source once per week. Also, the user has the ability to request a count or number of the specified data instead of the actual data itself.","It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the user interface is variable and defined as a part of remote segmentation. The resulting user interface changes based on what is required of the remote segmentation engine.

Furthermore, remote segment system makes use of some industry standard encryption, authentication and filtering methods to maintain a high level of security when transmitting and receiving customer data. Using a combination of these technologies, customer data is secure and cannot be stolen while in transit between the client and email service provider. Some of the technologies employed by remote segments are Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Secure FTP (FTP over SSL), HTTP Authentication and IP Filtering.","Moreover, an email service provider's remote segment functionality is comprised of three components which, when used together, create the usable remote segment. The first component is a remote segment type. The remote segment type template provides a set of parameters for the remote segment and at the very basic level gives the remote segment type a name and set of configuration options that can be manipulated by the user. The second component is the saved remote segment. The saved remote segment marries the defined remote segment type with the user defined parameters to create a logical request to the third component, a remote system. The remote system is a client implemented and maintained interface used by email service provider's remote segment functionality to request segment data from the client. The interface returns any modifications to the remote segment definition so the email service provider system knows where to locate the segment data.","Understanding an email service provider's interpretation of each user interaction with the XML configuration and how it affects the outcome of each remote segment is critical to successful implementation because it allows staff to define a flexible set of parameters a marketer can use to retrieve segmentation information, yet defines a box that allows the staff to protect its internal infrastructure from impossible queries.","The XML configuration cascades across the three different components of a remote segment and allows modification of previous definitions at each stage. The staff's role is to create an XML configuration for the remote segment type that defines a set of parameters the marketer can use to segment, (e.g., birth date, last purchase date, purchase categories). The request is made to the client's remote segment interface which responds with any changes to the original configuration.","In a preferred embodiment of remote segmentation system and method, the remote segment type defines a set of configuration options used by an email service provider to access the remote segmentation information as well as the options available to the marketer when defining which segment they want to mail.
