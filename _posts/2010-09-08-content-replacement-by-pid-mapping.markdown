title: Content replacement by PID mapping
abstract: A method of content substitution involves receiving an ordered stream of packets containing content marked by a first packet identifier (PID) and one or more substitute content portions marked by one or more secondary PIDs, where the number and placement of packets marked by secondary PIDs ahead of packets marked by the first PID in the stream is retained during transmission of the ordered stream of packets; the ordered stream of packets have an odd or even number of packets with the PIDs after a packet with a first PID; initiating processing for display or storage of content contained in packets having the first PID; initiating processing for display or storage of content contained in packets having a selected secondary PID that meets a substitution criterion; and either deleting or processing the content having the first PID depending upon a number of received intervening packets having secondary PIDs that reside between the packets having the first PID and the packets having the selected secondary PID that meets the substitution criterion, where deleting or processing is determined by whether the number of packets is an odd or an even number. This abstract is not to be considered limiting, since other embodiments may deviate from the features described in this abstract.

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","This invention relates generally to the field of video on digital video. More particularly, this invention relates to a method and apparatus for providing selective replacement of digital video content.","Conventional digital video content, such as MPEG video, can take the form of a single program, movie or other content with no opportunity for a service provider or a user to modify the viewing experience by selecting alternative content. Various mechanisms have been proposed for providing interactive content, but usually such proposals have been expensive to implement, can take up large amounts of bandwidth, and may require expensive specialized equipment including servers and\/or other support equipment. Therefore, although there is a demand for \u201cinteractive\u201d applications which allow an end viewer of video content to tailor what they watch and manipulate the content, no commercially viable system has yet appeared in the marketplace.","While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail specific embodiments, with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an example of the principles of the invention and not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments shown and described. In the description below, like reference numerals are used to describe the same, similar or corresponding parts in the several views of the drawings.","The terms \u201cscramble\u201d and \u201cencrypt\u201d and variations thereof are used synonymously herein. The term \u201cvideo\u201d may be used herein to embrace not only true visual information, but also in the conversational sense (e.g., \u201cvideo tape recorder\u201d) to embrace not only video signals but also associated audio and data. The present document generally uses the example of a \u201cdual selective encryption\u201d embodiment, but those skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention can be utilized to realize multiple partial encryption without departing from the invention. The terms \u201cpartial encryption\u201d and \u201cselective encryption\u201d are used synonymously herein. Also, the terms \u201cprogram\u201d and \u201ctelevision program\u201d and similar terms can be interpreted in the normal conversational sense, as well as a meaning wherein the term means any segment of A\/V content that can be displayed on a television set or similar monitor device. The term \u201clegacy\u201d as used herein refers to existing technology used for existing cable and satellite systems. The exemplary embodiments disclosed herein are decoded by a television Set-Top Box (STB), but it is contemplated that such technology will soon be incorporated within television receivers of all types whether housed in a separate enclosure alone or in conjunction with recording and\/or playback equipment or Conditional Access (CA) decryption module or within a television set itself. The present document generally uses the example of a \u201cdual partial encryption\u201d embodiment, but those skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention can be utilized to realize multiple partial encryption without departing from the invention. The term \u201cpackage medium\u201d and similar terms as used herein are intended to embrace a recording medium such as a Digital Versatile Disc (DVD), Compact Disc (CD) or other magnetic, optical or other recorded medium that is generally merchandised as a package that contains the electronic storage medium and is sold as a retail commodity, as contrasted to an electronically downloadable data stream.","The above-referenced commonly owned patent applications describe inventions relating to various aspects of methods generally referred to herein as partial encryption or selective encryption. More particularly, systems are described wherein selected portions of a particular selection of digital content are encrypted using two (or more) encryption techniques while other portions of the content are left unencrypted. The encrypted portions are identified and distinguished from one another by use of multiple packet identifiers. By properly selecting the portions to be encrypted, the content can effectively be encrypted for use under multiple decryption systems without the necessity of encryption of the entire selection of content. In some embodiments, only a few percent of data overhead is needed to effectively encrypt the content using multiple encryption systems. This results in a cable or satellite system being able to utilize Set-top boxes or other implementations of conditional access (CA) receivers from multiple manufacturers in a single system\u2014thus freeing the cable or satellite company to competitively shop for providers of Set-top boxes.","The partial encryption processes described in the above patent applications utilize any suitable encryption method. However, these encryption techniques are selectively applied to the data stream, rather than encrypting the entire data stream, using techniques described in the above-referenced patent applications. In general, but without the intent to be limiting, the selective encryption process utilizes intelligent selection of information to encrypt so that the entire program does not have to undergo dual encryption. By appropriate selection of data to encrypt, the program material can be effectively scrambled and hidden from those who desire to hack into the system and illegally recover commercial content without paying. MPEG (or similar format) data that are used to represent the audio and video data does so using a high degree of reliance on the redundancy of information from frame to frame. Certain data can be transmitted as \u201canchor\u201d data representing chrominance and luminance data. That data is then often simply moved about the screen to generate subsequent frames by sending motion vectors that describe the movement of the block. Changes in the chrominance and luminance data are also encoded as changes rather than a recoding of absolute anchor data. Thus, encryption of this anchor data, for example, or other key data can effectively render the video un-viewable.","In accordance with certain embodiments consistent with the above inventions, the selected video data to be encrypted may be any individual one or combination of the following (described in greater detail in the above applications): video slice headers appearing in an active region of a video frame, data representing an active region of a video frame, data in a star pattern within the video frame, data representing scene changes, I Frame packets, packets containing motion vectors in a first P frame following an I Frame, packets having an intra_slice_flag indicator set, packets having an intra_slice indicator set, packets containing an intra_coded macroblock, data for a slice containing an intra_coded macroblock, data from a first macroblock following the video slice header, packets containing video slice headers, anchor data, and P Frame data for progressively refreshed video data, data arranged in vertical and or horizontal moat patterns on the video frame, and any other selected data that renders the video and\/or audio difficult to utilize. Several such techniques as well as others are disclosed in the above-referenced patent applications, any of which (or other techniques) can be utilized with the present invention to encrypt only a portion of the content.","In order to distinguish between the two or more digital television signals encrypted using the multiple encryption algorithms in accordance with the above inventions, multiple packet identifiers (PIDs) are utilized. Normally a single set of packet identifiers is used to identify a particular television program. When a television signal is encrypted under the multiple selective encryption arrangement described in the above-referenced applications, the clear content is assigned a first set of PIDs, and each set of encrypted content is assigned another set of PIDs (one set of encrypted content may share the same PID with the unencrypted content in certain embodiments). The receiving STB then remaps all of the appropriate content to a single PID for playback. This process is described in detail in the above patent applications.","The present invention utilizes multiple PIDs associated with a single item of content as a mechanism to provide content substitution. Content substitution can be used to provide an enhanced level of customization of television programming in any number of ways. For example, content substitution can be used to provide targeted advertising to an audience by substitution of one advertisement for another. Content substitution can also be used to provide multiple endings, plots or other segments for a program, or to provide multiple views in a sportscast or other program. Other applications for the content substitution of the present invention will be discussed during the course of this discussion. Each of these applications, as well as others, can be facilitated using the present invention without need for dramatic increases in bandwidth and at reasonable cost for the hardware.","Referring now to , an overall content substitution process  consistent with certain embodiments of the present invention is shown starting at . The content is received at  having portions identified by multiple PIDs (e.g., PID A and PID B in this example), which represent multiple possibilities for the content (e.g., multiple advertisements, logos, plots, endings, characters, etc.). This content could be received as a stream of content (as in a cable or satellite television transmission) or could be present in packaged media or a downloaded file. In any case, at  a processing operation (such as playback or transmission of the content) is initiated, generally using a main portion of the content designated with a particular packet identifier (e.g., PID A). At , the content is examined to determine if a prescribed substitution criterion has been met. Such criterion might be, for example, presence of a national advertisement, watermark or logo that a local content distributor wishes to replace with a local or regional advertisement, watermark or logo; or such criterion might entail selection by an end user of a particular plot, character or ending.","If the criterion is not met at , the processing of the main content (PID A) continues at . If the criterion is met at , a content substitution is carried out at  (e.g., by substitution of content with PID B for content with PID A, or by carrying out any of the other content substitution operations described herein including, but not limited to one-for-one substitution, one-for-one insertion or multiple-for-one insertion\/deletion). Such substitution may entail a remapping of the PID values so that a decoder or other processor merely continues processing content with the same PID. Alternately, a decoder can be programmed to select the substituted content, when present, in preference to the main content. From  or , control passes to  where the content is examined to determine if the end has been reached. If not, control returns to processing content at . If the end is reached, the process stops at .","Thus, a method of content substitution consistent with certain embodiments of the present invention involve receiving data representing content, the data having at least first and second packet identifiers (PIDs) associated with first and second portions of content; playing content having the first PID; determining that a substitution criterion has been met; and substituting content having the second PID for content having the first PID.","In accordance with this process, for example, a local cable operator can receive a program that contains multiple sets of advertisements (commercials). Depending on the geographic location of the local operator, the main content can be retransmitted along with an appropriate one of several regional advertisements that are more appropriate to the geographic location or marketplace of the local cable operator. In another example, a movie with multiple selectable endings can be broadcast from a cable operator to its subscribers. The subscriber can then decide, before or during the viewing of the movie, which ending is preferred and make a selection. The subscriber sends a command to the STB which selects the alternative ending desired by the subscriber by selecting the ending associated with a particular PID and remapping that PID to the main program's PID. Numerous other examples will occur to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the present teachings.","Referring now to , an exemplary cable system is depicted as . In this system, a satellite antenna  receives a multiplexed stream of content from a satellite transmission such as a HITS\u2122 (Headend In The Sky) feed. The received stream of content is received, demodulated and decrypted at a satellite receiver  and the content that is to have substitutable information is passed along to a PID mapper and flag inserter , the function of which will become clear in view of discussions to follow. Additional content may be retrieved from a local content database  or other sources of content. Alternatively, the content with multiple PID encoded substitutable portions may be directly received from the satellite system. The PID mapper and flag inserter maps the incoming content from whatever source to a set of main PIDs for the main content and a set of secondary or shadow PIDs for the substitutable content at  in one embodiment. In another embodiment where the incoming data already has multiple PID encoded content, the PID mapper may be instructed to remap the PIDs to select only the desired content. Flags may be inserted into the content at  to identify a location where a substitution of content is to start and end.","The content then passes to a PSI\/PMT inserter  that inserts Program Specific Information (PSI) and Program Map Tables (PMT) into the stream of content for use by the decoding side in decoding the programming. If the content is to be encrypted, it may be passed through an encrypter  prior to modulation at a modulator (such as a QAM modulator) . The modulated stream of content is then transmitted via the cable plant  to the end users with decoder boxes such as Set-top boxes  and . The operation of the cable head end, including but not limited to the PID mapping for content substitution, is carried out under control of a control computer .","Such a system can be used to form a content substitution encoder consistent with certain embodiments of the invention in which input data is received representing main content and representing substitution content. A packet identifier (PID) mapper assigns a primary PID to the main content and assigns a secondary PID to the substitution content. A private data generator generates user private data that identifies the main content by the primary PID and substitution content by the secondary PID. The private data, the main content mapped to the primary PID and the substitution content mapped to the secondary PID are then assembled into a data stream.","The process  of  can be carried out on any suitable programmed general-purpose computer operating as control computer  of . Computer  has one or more central processor units (CPU)  with one or more associated buses  used to connect the central processor unit  to Random Access Memory  and Non-Volatile Memory  in a known manner. Output devices , such as a display and printer, are provided in order to display and\/or print output for the use of the MSO (multiple service operator) as well as to provide a user interface such as a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Similarly, input devices such as keyboard, mouse and removable media readers , may be provided for the input of information by the operator. Computer  also incorporates internal and\/or external attached disc or other mass storage  (e.g., disc and\/or optical storage) for storing large amounts of information including, but not limited to, the operating system, and the content substitution process program as well as content (which is most likely stored on massive attached storage such as local content database ). The Computer system  also has an interface  for connection to the controlled devices in the cable system head end. While depicted as a single computer, the digital content provider may utilize multiple linked computers to carry out the functions described herein.","The description above largely assumes that the substitutable content is to be inserted at the cable system head end, but those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present content substitution concept can be implemented in many ways to permit content substitution at multiple levels to serve multiple purposes. For example, if the cable customer is viewing an interactive television show, the customer's selections (e.g., from a remote controller) can be used to establish the criterion for selection of a particular substitution (e.g., ending selection). However, the cable head end can also implement a content substitution in accord with certain embodiments consistent with the present invention, for example, by substitution of a local advertisement for a national advertisement or substitution of (or addition of) a local channel logo for a national logo.","Consider now an exemplary embodiment consistent with the present invention in which a content provider wishes to provide alternative advertisements to several groups of customers, for example in a cable television system. In this example, assume that the cable television customers can be divided into three categories based upon, for example, a customer profile stored at the cable system's head end. Now, with reference to , an exemplary television program  with three separate advertisements ,  and  associated therewith is depicted. In order to segregate the three advertisements, three separate sets of PIDs are utilized (for simplicity, assume that there is one PID per advertisement). In the case of the main advertisement  directed to one viewing audience, the advertisement  can share the same PID (e.g., ) with the program content.","The first alternative advertisement  is identified by an alternative PID (e.g., PID ), and the second alternative advertisement is identified by another alternative PID (e.g., PID ). Thus, in order to present the main advertisement, no special instructions need to be conveyed to the decoder (e.g., the television STB) since it is shared with the program content and will be shown by default. For decoders that are to decode the alternative advertisement , an instruction is sent from the cable system head end to the decoders instructing them to substitute content with PID  whenever this PID is encountered for PID . Similarly, for decoders that are to decode the alternative advertisement , an instruction is sent from the cable system head end to the decoders instructing them to substitute content with PID  whenever this PID is encountered in place of PID . In one embodiment, each packed of video data having PID  has a corresponding packet with PID  and PID . In other embodiments, a one for one correlation is not required. In any event, packet counts should be maintained in a manner that permits the proper ordered processing of packets at the decoder.","In this example, the content is displayed side by side to illustrate the direct substitution that is the nature of the process. However, as depicted in , the content may be arranged as a sequence of packets which systematically present the main content followed by the first alternative content and then the second alternative content and then the sequence repeats. In various embodiments, corresponding packets with primary and secondary PIDs may appear in order of primary followed by secondary or secondary followed by primary. Alternation of the packets avoids unnecessary delays in packet receipt and helps preserve the order of packets. Where a one for one correlation between primary and secondary packets exists, each of the primary and secondary packets may retain a packet number that is used to establish the order of presentation. Such numbering may be altered by the decoding process to retain order in the received content. Other embodiments are also possible without deviating from the present invention.","In addition to providing targeted advertisement for sets of customers by the cable system MSO, a similar technique can be implemented to provide networks with the ability to provide regional advertisement by embedding, for example, multiple regional advertisements into a single data stream and using a remapping of the PIDs at the local networks or cable operators to select the appropriate advertisement for a given region. Thus, the three advertisements depicted in  could equally well represent three regional advertisements such as one for the East coast of the U.S., one for the central portion of the U.S. and one for the West coast of the U.S., or any other suitable regional segregation with more or less alternative advertisements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["360","110","362","110","364","110","368","111","372","376","112","380","111","100","112","100"]},"With reference to , a program  using a particular PID, e.g., PID , contains a blank section  having PID  with an alternative portion of information serving as a marker PID .","The content substitution using alternative PIDs as described above can be utilized for any number of purposes.  depicts replacement of advertising banners and supplementation of logos or watermarks using the content substitution technique of the present invention. In this embodiment, a segment of main content is depicted as a television screen  divided into horizontal slices as such information would be encoded using MPEG digital coding. A first advertisement, e.g., a national advertisement,  is depicted as appearing in several sequential slices of the image near the upper left of the screen. A logo or watermark  appears in one slice near the bottom right of the image . Using content substitution, a new screen can be created. Packets containing the advertisement  can be replaced by packets containing a local or other alternative advertisement banner . Similarly, the watermark  could be replaced or supplemented by use of content substitution for certain packets within a slice of the video image. In this example, a network logo  might be supplemented by another logo (such as a local channel or other logo)  by substitution of packets bearing the supplemental logo.","These are but a few examples of the types of content manipulation that can be facilitated using the PID mapping techniques of the present invention.

Secondary PID packets may be inserted into the stream without replacement of a primary PID packet. This mode is called \u201cInsertion Mode.\u201d In fact, the decoder may be used in a mode wherein both operations are active at the same time. This is called \u201cInsertion and Deletion Mode\u201d. All three discrete decoder modes are mutually exclusive and follow a series of state transitions that are specific to each mode. The active mode is signaled through the decoder specific variable mode. If the value of mode is set to zero, decoding is not enabled and the transport decoder state machine is bypassed. If the value of mode is invalid (not a specifically defined state, then the same actions are taken as if mode was set to zero, i.e. the transport decoder state machine is bypassed. The definition of the state transitions for each mode is detailed as followed.","The algorithm for decoding an encoded transport stream is embodied in the state machine of . The Petri net showing the states and the state equations\/actions can be derived from  in combination with the above state table. The algorithm has four operating states, with the system predominantly remaining is state . State  is entered only when a packet containing a shadow PID (not the main PID) has been encountered. Depending upon the system mode, as established through messaging in the PSI from the headend, different paths to two entirely different second states can be taken.","The state machine can be implemented in either hardware or software, depending upon the IC manufacturer's device architecture. A software implementation on a programmed processor can generally be expected to provide more flexibility in the design.","One error case identified (illegal state transition). This error is a unique error that is in addition to MPEG transport layer errors like continuity count, transport error, etc. Error_IRQn is the detection of two adjacent shadow packets without an intervening legacy packet, with n representing the number of the specific decoder. Depending upon the setting of the decoder specific variable queue_on_error, two different operations can occur. If the variable is set to true, the decoder will process the second shadow packet (PID=B) as in the non-error case. If the variable is set to false, the second shadow packet is discarded.","Whenever packets are inserted or deleted, the continuity count (CC) of the primary stream (PID=A), will be preserved by adjusting the CC as appropriate. The decode_RSTn variable is a non-latching bit that can be set through a configuration register or accessed by other functions to force the decoder state machine n to a known state.","One mode of operation of the decoder transport processing algorithm is referred to as the Substitution Mode. This mode is illustrated in  wherein packets having PID B such as ,  and  are inserted into the transport stream by replacement of PID B with PID A to produce packets ,  and  for an MPEG compliant transport stream with the desired content packets containing a PID field matching A, where A is a 13 bit value previously defined in a configuration register of the decoder. A \u201cno operation\u201d is carried out for PID A packets. In the \u201chome\u201d state, state , A packets such as  become packets such as  are sent to the transport filter output queue for further processing, such as A\/V decompression and display. In mode , the decoder state machine transitions from state  to state A upon reception of a MPEG packet with the PID field matching B, after receipt of a substitution flag . B is a 13 bit value previously defined in a configuration register of the decoder. B represents the secondary or \u201cshadow\u201d packet to be substituted for the next occurring legacy packet with PID matching A. The PID value of the B packet is changed to A before insertion into the stream. The substitution occurs because upon transition to state A, the B packet content is sent to the transport filter output queue.","The return to state  occurs when the next A PID is received. In this case, it is not queued and is converted to the NULL (0x1fff) PID value, effectively erasing it from the stream without altering the overall stream timing as would have occurred if it were physically removed. The return to state  can also be signaled by receipt of another substitution flag  indicating termination of the substitute mode.","Another mode of operation of the decoder transport processing algorithm is referred to as the Insertion Mode, which is depicted in , for an MPEG compliant transport stream with the desired content packets containing a PID field matching A, where A is a 13 bit value previously defined in a configuration register of the decoder. In the \u201chome\u201d state, state , A packets are sent to the transport filter output queue for further processing, such as A\/V decompression and display. In mode , the decoder state machine never transitions from state . Upon reception of a MPEG packet with the PID field matching B, where B is a 13 bit value previously defined in a configuration register of the decoder, B represents the secondary or \u201cshadow\u201d packet to be inserted into the stream with the PID value changed to A. In this mode, transition from state  to state B can occur due to receipt of an insertion flag . PID B packets such as  and  are inserted into the transport stream as PID A packets such as  and . The insertion mode can terminate by receipt of the next insertion flag .","The decoder transport processing algorithm for the Insertion\/Deletion Mode for a MPEG compliant transport stream with the desired content packets containing a PID field matching A, where A is a 13 bit value previously defined in a configuration register of the decoder is depicted in . In the \u201chome\u201d state, state , A packets such as  are sent to the transport filter output queue for further processing, such as A\/V decompression and display and become packets . In mode , the decoder state machine transitions from state  to state B upon reception of a MPEG packet with the PID field matching B, where B is a 13 bit value previously defined in a configuration register of the decoder, B represents the secondary or \u201cshadow\u201d packet to be inserted with PID changed to match A. Any packet received while in state B with the PID value matching A will result in a transition to state  and the packet PID changed to NULL, effectively removing it from the transport stream. All subsequent packets received with PID matching A while in state  will result in their PID value also being changed to NULL such as packets , ,  and  which become NULL as , ,  and . Transition to and from state  can be initiated and terminated by an insertion\/deletion flag  and  respectively. While in state , packets such as  and  with PID B are converted to packets with PID such as  and .","The return to state B occurs when the next packet with a B PID value is received and it is queued and converted to the A PID value. Likewise, return to the return to state  from state B occurs when the next packet with a B PID value is received accordingly, it is also queued and converted to the A PID value.","The method according to claim , wherein the substituting comprises using private signaling to select a unit of content with the second PID and discarding a unit of content with the first PID.","In methods consistent with the present invention, private signaling can be used to select a unit of content on the secondary PID while receiving content with the primary PID. Alternatively, private signaling can be used to select multiple units of content with the secondary PID while discarding units of content with the primary PID. Similarly, private signaling can be used to select multiple units of content with a secondary PID while receiving units of content with the primary PID. Also, private signaling can be used to switch from a mode of selecting multiple units of content with the secondary PID while discarding units of content with the primary PID to a mode of selecting multiple units of content with the secondary PID while receiving content with the primary PID. Private signaling can also be used to switch from a mode of selecting multiple units of content with the secondary PID and receiving multiple units of content with the primary PID to a mode of selecting multiple units of content with the secondary PID while discarding units of content with the primary PID.","A unit of content with the secondary PID is sent before or after a corresponding unit of content with the primary PID. Substitution operations can be initiated and terminated by private signaling forming part of an adaptation layer of packets in a data stream. The adaptation layer can be in a packet with the secondary PID, the primary PID or another PID.","For reference, the following two tables are provided which call out the syntax used for an MPEG transport packet and an MPEG transport stream adaptation field respectively:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"TRANSPORT PACKET"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Syntax","No. of bits","Mnemonic"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["transport_packet( ){",{},{}]},{"entry":["\u2003sync_byte","8","bslbf"]},{"entry":["\u2003transport_error_indicator","1","bslbf"]},{"entry":["\u2003payload_unit_start_indicator","1","bslbf"]},{"entry":["\u2003transport_priority","1","bslbf"]},{"entry":["\u2003PID","13","uimsbf"]},{"entry":["\u2003transport_scrambling_control","2","bslbf"]},{"entry":["\u2003adaptation_field_control","2","bslbf"]},{"entry":["\u2003continuity_counter","4","uimsbf"]},{"entry":"\u2003if(adaptation_field_control == \u201810\u2019 ||"},{"entry":"adaptation_field_control == \u201811\u2019){"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003adaptation_field( )"},{"entry":"\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003if(adaptation_field_control == \u201801\u2019 ||"},{"entry":"adaptation_field_control == \u201811\u2019) {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003for (i = 0;

This error is a unique error and is in addition to MPEG transport layer errors like continuity count, transport error, etc. Error_IRQn is the detection of two adjacent shadow packets without an intervening legacy packet, with n representing the number of the specific decoder. Depending upon the setting of the decoder specific variable queue_on_error, two different operations can occur. If the variable is set to true, the decoder will process the second shadow packet (PID=B) as in the non-error case. If the variable is set to false, the second shadow packet is discarded.","In some instances, content that is to be replaced is placed on packet boundaries. Since some information may not fit neatly within the boundaries of a packet, some additional content, which is not specifically the content of interest may need to be duplicated to fill up the packet. In other cases, the packet can simply be filled with null bytes (e.g., all zeros). A typical video slice contains approximately 3 to 8 packets depending upon how much intra-coded data is present. It is noted that some decoders may have difficulty with multiple slices on a single video line even though the MPEG2 specification allows for this.","It is also noted that there may be ending problems encountered if the substituted content is referenced from future frames. However, this can be resolved by establishing a rule that says that the substituted content cannot be referenced by past frames. This is due to the possibility that the content may be different depending upon the choice made by a customer or the set top box. Reference to future frames might be allowed if the reference is all contained within the substitute content. Also, since the encoder uses a specified set of quantization tables, substitute content should be processed using the same quantization table so that correct decoding can take place.","The present content substitution can be carried out either on line or off line depending upon the application, without limitation.","A decoder such as the above can be incorporated within a television STB or other television receiver and can be used to provide the end user with content substitution capabilities controlled either by the user or by the MSO. Referring now to , an exemplary system configuration for a digital television Set-top box  is illustrated. Many configurations for such a STB are possible and the STB illustrated should only be considered as exemplary of such a STB configuration. In this exemplary set-top box, the transmission medium , such as a coaxial cable, is coupled by a suitable interface to a tuner . Tuner  may, for example, include a broadcast in-band tuner for receiving video content. A separate tuner (not shown) may be provided to receive conventional RF broadcast television channels. Modulated information formatted, for example, as MPEG-2 information is then demodulated at a demodulator . The demodulated information at the output of demodulator  is provided to a PID decoder\/demultiplexer\/descrambler circuit  where the information is separated into discrete channels of programming. The programming is divided into packets, each packet having a PID that identifies the packet as containing a particular type of data (e.g., audio, video, data) relating to a particular program. The PID decoder\/demodulator\/descrambler circuit  also decrypts encrypted information in accordance with a decryption algorithm to prevent unauthorized access to programming content, for example. The PID decoder portion of  can operate in a manner similar to that of the decoder described by the stated diagram of  under program control to select content having a particular PID as will be described later.","Audio packets from the demultiplexer  (those identified with an audio PID) are decrypted and forwarded to an audio decoder  where they may be converted to analog audio to drive a speaker system (e.g., stereo or home theater multiple channel audio systems) or other audio system  (e.g., stereo or home theater multiple channel amplifier and speaker systems) or may simply provide decoded audio out at . Video packets from the demultiplexer  (those identified with a video PID) are decrypted and forwarded to a video decoder . In a similar manner, data packets from the demultiplexer  (those identified with a data PID) are decrypted and forwarded to a data decoder .","Decoded data packets from data decoder  are sent to the set-top box's computer system via the system bus . A control computer  can thus access the decoded data from data decoder  via the system bus  as well as programs and data in memory . Video data decoded by video decoder  is passed to a graphics processor , which is a computer optimized to processes graphics information rapidly. Graphics processor  is particularly useful in processing graphics intensive data associated with Internet browsing, gaming and multimedia applications such as those associated with MHEG (Multimedia and Hypermedia information coding Experts Group) set-top box applications. It should be noted, however, that the function of graphics processor  may be unnecessary in some set-top box designs having lower capabilities, and the function of the graphics processor  may be handled by the control computer  in some applications where the decoded video is passed directly from the demultiplexer  to a video encoder. Graphics processor  is also coupled to the system bus  and operates under the control of control computer .","Many set-top boxes such as STB  may incorporate a smart card reader  for communicating with a so called \u201csmart card,\u201d often serving as a Conditional Access Module (CAM). The CAM typically includes a central processor unit of its own along with associated RAM and ROM memory. Such smart card based CAMs are conventionally utilized for authentication of the user and authentication of transactions carried out by the user as well as authorization of services and storage of authorized cryptography keys. For example, the CAM can be used to provide the key for decoding incoming cryptographic data for content that the CAM determines the user is authorized to receive.","STB  can operate in a bidirectional communication mode so that data and other information can be transmitted not only from the system's head end to the end user, or from a service provider to the end user of the STB , but also, from the end user upstream using an out-of-band channel. In one embodiment, such data passes through the system bus  to a modulator  through a diplexer forming part of tuner  and out through the transmission medium . This capability is used to provide a mechanism for the STB  and\/or its user to send information to the head end (e.g., service requests or changes, registration information, etc.) as well as to provide fast outbound communication with the Internet or other services provided at the head end to the end user.","Set-top box  may include any of a plurality of I\/O (Input\/Output) interfaces represented by I\/O interfaces  that permit interconnection of I\/O devices to the set-top box . By way of example, and not limitation, a serial RS-232 port can be provided to enable interconnection to any suitable serial device supported by the STB 's internal software. Similarly, communication with appropriately compatible devices can be provided via an Ethernet port, a USB (Universal Serial Bus) port, an IEEE 1394 (so-called Firewire\u2122 or i-link\u2122) or IEEE 1394 wide port, or S-video port. An infrared interface  provides communication with a remote controller . Such interfaces can be utilized to interconnect the STB  with any of a variety of accessory devices such as storage devices, audio\/visual devices, gaming devices (not shown), Internet Appliances , etc.","I\/O interfaces  can also include a modem (be it dial-up, cable, DSL or other technology modem) having a modem port to facilitate high speed or alternative access to the Internet or other data communication functions. In one preferred embodiment, modem port  is that of a DOCSIS (Data Over Cable System Interface Specification) cable modem to facilitate high speed network access over a cable system, and port is appropriately coupled to the transmission medium  embodied as a coaxial cable. Thus, the STB  can carry out bidirectional communication via the DOCSIS cable modem with the STB  being identified by a unique IP address. The DOCSIS specification is publicly available.","A PS\/2 or other keyboard\/mouse\/joystick interface can be provided to permit ease of data entry to the STB . Such inputs provide the user with the ability to easily enter data and\/or navigate using pointing devices. Pointing devices such as a mouse or joystick may be used in gaming applications.","Of course, STB  also may incorporate basic video outputs that can be used for direct connection to a television set instead of (or in addition to) an IEEE 1394 connection. In one embodiment, the video output can provide composite video formatted as NTSC (National Television System Committee) video. In some embodiments, the video output can be provided by a direct connection to the graphics processor  or the demultiplexer\/descrambler  rather than passing through the system bus  as illustrated in the exemplary block diagram. S-Video signals can be similarly provided without passing through the system bus  if desired in other embodiments.","The infrared interface  receives commands from an infrared remote control , infrared keyboard or other infrared control device. Although not explicitly shown, front panel controls may be used in some embodiments to directly control the operation of the STB  through a front panel control interface as one of the provided interfaces. Selected interfaces such as those described above and others can be provided in STB  in various combinations as required or desired.","In one illustrative embodiment consistent with the present invention, the STB  can be utilized to control multiple content as in, for example, selection from multiple endings. In one such scenario, the main program content having a designated set of PIDS is played out in a normal manner until near the end of the program. At this point, the viewer is presented with a menu selection on screen from which one of a plurality of endings is presented. As a simple example, there may be three possible endings associated with three sets of PIDs as follows: 1) PID A\u2014Boy gets girl, good guys win, 2) PID B\u2014Girl dies, good guys win, and 3) PID C\u2014Girl dies, bad guys win.","Using the remote controller  or any other suitable input mechanism, the viewer selects from the possible endings. A limited time may be provided to make this selection prior to a default ending being shown (e.g., a two minute pause in content to allow the selection of the ending). In response to the user's selection, control computer  programs PID decoder  to select the ending chosen by the user. After this pause, is completed, the programming continues with the PID decoder  making the appropriate PID remapping to cause the audio, data and video for the selected ending to be played. Thus, if the program is normally associated with PID A and the user selects ending three, packets bearing PID C will be remapped to PID A for playback. Thus, in this embodiment, the user can make selections for playback of a particular segment of content that is substituted for the normal content.","Accordingly, a decoder consistent with certain embodiments of the present invention has a receiver receiving data that represents content, the data having at least first and second packet identifiers (PIDs) associated with first and second portions of content. A content decoder is configured to play content having the first PID. A controller determines that a substitution criterion has been met, and a PID mapper maps content having the second PID to the first PID so that the content originally having the second PID is played.","Thus, a method and apparatus for content substitution, consistent with certain embodiments of the present invention involves receiving data representing content, the data having at least first and second packet identifiers (PIDs) associated with first and second portions of content. The content having the first PID is placed into a data stream. An initiation flag is received indicating initiation of a PID mapping operation. The content having the second PID is then mapped to the first PID and the mapped content is placed into the data stream. A termination flag is received indicating termination of the PID mapping operation at which point the process returns to placing content having the first PID into the data stream. The content substitution process can be used to replace advertisements, provide multiple plots, multiple endings, multiple views as well as other applications.","In certain implementations, a method of content substitution involves receiving an ordered stream of packets containing content marked by a first packet identifier (PID) and one or more substitute content portions marked by one or more secondary PIDs, where the number and placement of packets marked by secondary PIDs ahead of packets marked by the first PID in the stream is retained during transmission of the ordered stream of packets; initiating processing for display or storage of content contained in packets having the first PID; initiating processing for display or storage of content contained in packets having a selected secondary PID that meets a substitution criterion; and either deleting or processing the content having the first PID depending upon a number of received intervening packets having secondary PIDs that reside between the packets having the first PID and the packets having the selected secondary PID that meets the substitution criterion.","In certain embodiments, the content comprises one of streamed data, a data file and a packaged medium containing a data file. In certain embodiments, the method is carried out in a decoder forming a part of a television Set-top box. In certain embodiments, the method is carried out in at least one of a hardware state machine and a programmed processor. In certain embodiments, the substitution criterion is met as a result of an interactive operator input from an operator viewing said content. In certain embodiments, the content comprises at least one of audio and video content. In certain embodiments, the substitution criterion is met as a result of at least one of an operator input, signaling in a program map table (PMT), and signaling in an MPEG adaptation layer. In certain embodiments, the content is substituted on a packet for packet basis. In certain embodiments, multiple packets of content are substituted for a single packet. In certain embodiments, the processing comprises playing the content. In certain embodiments, the substituting comprises selecting a unit of content with the second PID and discarding a unit of content with the first PID. In certain embodiments, the substituting comprises selecting a unit of content on the second PID while receiving content with the first PID. In certain embodiments, the substituting comprises selecting multiple units of content with the second PID while discarding units of content with the first PID. In certain embodiments, the substituting comprises selecting multiple units of content with a second PID while receiving units of content with the first PID. In certain embodiments, the substituting comprises switching from a mode of selecting multiple units of content with the second PID while discarding units of content with the first PID to a mode of selecting multiple units of content with the second PID while receiving content with the first PID. In certain embodiments, the substituting comprises switching from a mode of selecting multiple units of content with the second PID and receiving multiple units of content with the first PID to a mode of selecting multiple units of content with the second PID while discarding units of content with the first PID. In certain embodiments, a unit of content with the second PID is sent before a corresponding unit of content with the first PID. In certain embodiments, a unit of content with the second PID is sent after a corresponding unit of content with the first PID. In certain embodiments, substitution is initiated and terminated by private signaling forming part of an adaptation layer of packets in a data stream. In certain embodiments, the adaptation layer is in a packet with the second PID. In certain embodiments, the adaptation layer is in a packet with the first PID. In certain embodiments, the adaptation layer is in a packet that is neither the second nor the first PID. In certain embodiments, the processing comprises playing back the content. A computer readable medium can be used for storing instructions which, when executed on a programmed processor, carry out any of the above content substitution methods.","Another method of triggering content substitution involves receiving an ordered stream of packets containing content marked by a first packet identifier (PID) and substitute content marked by a secondary PID, and where the number and placement of packets marked by secondary PIDs ahead of packets marked by the first PID in the stream is retained during transmission of the ordered stream of packets; determining if a number of intervening packets having secondary PIDs that reside between the packets having the first PID and the packets having a selected secondary PID is an odd number or an even number; if the number is a first of either an odd number or an even number of intervening packets having secondary PIDs that reside between the packets having the first PID and the packets having the selected secondary PID is received, interpreting receipt of said number of intervening packets as an instruction that triggers ignoring subsequent packets marked with a primary PID, and mapping the portions of the content having the secondary PIDs to the primary PID and placing the mapped content into the data stream as a substitute for the first portion of the content; if the number is the other of either an even number or an odd number of intervening packets having secondary PIDs that reside between the packets having the first PID and the packets having the selected secondary PID is received, interpreting receipt of said number of intervening packets as an instruction that triggers processing subsequent packets marked with the primary PID.","In certain embodiments, the method can be carried out in a decoder forming a part of a television set-top box. In certain embodiments, the method can be carried out in at least one of a hardware state machine and a programmed processor. In certain embodiments, receipt of the initiation flag is indicative of meeting a substitution criterion, such substitution criteria being met as a result of an interactive operator input from an operator viewing said content. In certain embodiments, receipt of the initiation flag is indicative of meeting a substitution criterion. In certain embodiments, the substitution criterion is met as a result of an operator input. In certain embodiments, the content is substituted on a packet for packet basis. In certain embodiments, multiple packets of content are substituted for a single packet. In certain embodiments, the substituting comprises using private signaling to select a unit of content with the secondary PID and discarding a unit of content with the primary PID. In certain embodiments, a unit of content with the second PID is sent before a corresponding unit of content with the first PID. In certain embodiments, a unit of content with the second PID is sent after a corresponding unit of content with the first PID. In certain embodiments, substitution is initiated and terminated by private signaling forming part of the adaptation layer of packets in a data stream. In certain embodiments, the adaptation layer is in a packet with the one of the primary PID and the secondary PID. In certain embodiments, the adaptation layer is in a packet that has neither the secondary nor the primary PID. A computer readable medium storing instructions which, when executed on a programmed processor can carry out any of the content substitution methods above.","A content multiplexer which creates an ordered stream of packets with primary and substitute content has a circuit for receiving input data representing main content. Input data representing substitution content are received, such substitution content being for replacement of at least a portion of the main content. A packet identifier (PID) mapper assigns a primary PID to the main content and assigns a secondary PID to the substitution content. A multiplexer multiplexes an even or odd number of packets with the secondary PID ahead of packets with the primary PID depending on whether the primary packets are to be ignored or processed by a receiving device. The content multiplexer can be implemented using a programmed computer.","A decoder consistent with certain embodiments has a receiver receiving an ordered stream of data that represents content ordered in a first and a second substitutable portion, the data encoded using at least first and second packet identifiers (PIDs) associated with first and second substitutable portions of content. The receiver receives an odd or even number of packets with the PIDs after a packet with a primary PID, wherein starting or stopping content substitution is determined by whether the number of packets is an odd or an even number. A content decoder is configured to play content having the first PID. A controller determines that a substitution criterion has been met by virtue of receipt of the content having the secondary PID. A PID mapper maps content from the received data content having the second PID to the received data content having the first PID so that the received data content originally having the second PID is played.","In certain embodiments, the decoder resides in a television set-top box. In certain embodiments, the substitution criterion comprises an interactive user selection to play the second portion. In certain embodiments, the second portion of content represents one of an alternative advertisement, an alternative view, an alternative ending and an alternative plot.","Those skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention has been described in terms of exemplary embodiments based upon use of a programmed processor (e.g., computer ).
