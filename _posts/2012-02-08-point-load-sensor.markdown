title: Point load sensor
abstract: A point load sensor measures compressive forces exerted on the outside of a ring in diametric compression irrespective of the direction of application of the force. The sensor consists of a ring with strain gauges placed in a configuration to measure the circumferential strain at two positions on the ring ninety degrees apart resulting from bending of the ring as the ring is loaded in diametric compression. The two measurements are corrected and combined to recover the compressive force on the ring. A method for calibrating and resolving the compressive force does not require the angle of loading or sensor orientation as an input, thus allowing resolution irrespective of the direction of the compressive force.

As an example, thin line sonar arrays that are towed behind submarines.","As the arrays are deployed from and retrieved, the array passes through various parts of the handling system. Any problems with the towed array handling system may result in the application of unacceptable forces to the array that can damage the array.","When using the known Guide To Measurement Module (GTMM), squeeze forces on towed arrays are measured. Specifically, the measurement module contains a sensor in the form of a ring instrumented with strain gauges. The placement of the gauges within the ring provides two outputs proportionate to the applied force. These outputs are combined using a vector sum approach.","However, the design of this sensor does not take into consideration the variation of strain inside a ring under diametric compression. Without this consideration, the placement and wiring of the strain gauges, as well as the means of combining the outputs, can result in orientation errors greater than thirty percent.","What are therefore needed is a system and method of use for measuring compressive forces exerted on tubular material during handling. The system needs to account for the mechanics of strain inside a ring under diametric compression.","It is therefore a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a sensor for measuring compressive forces exerted on tubular material during handling.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a system and method of use that incorporates the mechanics of strain within the sensor when determining such compressive forces.","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a system and method of use for reducing sensor orientation errors.","To attain the above and other objects described above, a sensor is provided, which measures compressive forces exerted on the outside of a ring in diametric compression irrespective of the direction of application of the force. The sensor comprises a ring with strain gauges placed in a configuration to measure the circumferential strain at two positions on the ring at ninety degrees apart (resulting from bending of the ring as the ring is loaded in diametric compression).","The two strain measurements are corrected and combined to recover the compressive force on the ring. The sensor employs a method for calibrating and resolving the compressive force that does not require the angle of loading or sensor orientation as an input; thereby, allowing resolution irrespective of the direction of the compression. Accordingly, the method results in the reduction of sensor orientation errors.","In one embodiment, a method for calibrating a sensor ring measuring an unknown diametric compressive force, P, includes applying a known load, P, at a plurality of orientations about the sensor ring. A set of first and second output voltages (Vand V) are measured across respective first and second output connections from respective first and second strain gauges of pairs of biaxial strain gauges circumferentially spaced apart on the ring.","Values for slopes (mand m) and for offsets (band b) are initialized with the slopes being assumed as \u201c1\u201d and the offsets as \u201c0\u201d and a corresponding set of parameters (Vand V) are calculated based on the relationships V=mVband V=mV+b.

The offset voltages have a tendency to drift over the life of the sensor, requiring periodic corrections. In addition, the sensitivities of the bridge circuits  are not identical due to small misalignments of the strain gauges  and differences in their bonding.","The above effects can be compensated for by correcting the voltages as in the following equations:\n\n;\u2003\u2003[18]\n\n.\u2003\u2003[19]\n\nBy choosing proper values for correction slopes (mand m) and offsets (band b); the results can be used in Equation [17] to recover the point load directly:\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0081"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00018","num":"00018"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"UP","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"V","mn":"1"},{"mi":"V","mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"}}},"mi":"\u03c0"}}},"mo":"+","msqrt":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mfrac":{"mn":"16","msup":{"mi":"\u03c0","mn":"2"}},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"V","mn":"1"},{"mi":"V","mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"}},"mn":"2"}},{"mn":"4","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mn":"8","mo":"-","msup":{"mi":"\u03c0","mn":"2"}},"msup":{"mi":"\u03c0","mn":"2"}}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msubsup":[{"mi":"V","mn":["1","2"]},{"mi":"V","mn":["2","2"]}],"mo":"+"}}]}],"mo":"-"}}},{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mn":"8","mo":"-","msup":{"mi":"\u03c0","mn":"2"}},"msup":{"mi":"\u03c0","mn":"2"}}}}]}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mn":"20"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"For orientation calibration, a known point load, P, can be applied to the sensor ring  and the output voltages Vand Vcan be measured. Load Pcan be applied at many different orientations to obtain a set of paired values for Vand V. For example, applying load Pto the sensor ring  every fifteen degrees yields twenty-four paired values for Vand V.","Initial values for correction slopes, m=m=1, and correction offsets, b=b=0, are chosen such that V=Vand V=V. The paired values are plugged into Equation [20] to produce a corresponding set of values for UP. The standard deviation of the set of values for UP can be determined, which is a measure of the sensor ring  error due to varying orientation of the sensor ring when loaded. The standard deviation is minimized by iteratively varying the calibration coefficients, m, m, band b.","By minimizing the standard deviation, the resulting set of values for UP contains minimal error. However, the resulting values are not necessarily equal to the point load, P. To obtain the point load, P; the calibration coefficients can be scaled by a common factor with no effect on the orientation error.","Given the previously determined coefficients, m, m, band b, the sensor ring  can be loaded with various point loads, P, and a plot of UP versus P can be obtained. Ideally, the resultant curve will be linear and a straight line could be drawn through all points. A linearity error can be minimized by applying a best fit curve to the data and correcting UP using these results. As an example, but not for limitation, a linear correction can be applied, resulting in the following:\n\n\u2003\u2003[21]\n\nwith coefficients M and Y determined from the best fit linear curve.\n","In many applications, the sensor ring  is exposed to harsh environments and abrasive handling. To protect the sensor ring  and the gauges , a layer of hard epoxy or similar material can be applied over strain gauges  (as shown in phantom by coating  in ). While the protective coating  allows sensor ring  to remain operational during extreme conditions, the coating causes the orientation error of the sensor ring to increase.","As described previously herein, Equation [20] is derived from strain equations for thin rings, wherein the strain is measured inside the ring. The coating  over the strain gauges  results in an effectively thicker sensor ring . In addition, with the strain gauges  embedded in the coating , strain is no longer being measured on the inside surface . Both these factors contribute to the increased orientation error.","However, the general form of Equation [20] can still apply. As can be seen from examination of Equation [20], there are a large number of constants. As such, Equation [20] can be rewritten as follows:\n\n()+\u221a{right arrow over (()())}{right arrow over (()())},\u2003\u2003[21]\n","Using Equation [22], calibration now can be accomplished by using the previously described initial values for correction slopes, m=m=1, and correction offsets, b=b=0 and by using initial values for the coefficients A, B, and C of A=\u2212(4\/\u03c0), B=(4\/\u03c0)and C=4(1\u22128\/\u03c0). The calibration technique is unchanged except that the coefficients, A, B, and C, must now also be determined using standard iteration tools. Accordingly, Equations [18], [19], [22] and [11] are the basis for the design and calibration of the sensor ring .","Referring now to , there is shown a block diagram of method  for designing and calibrating the sensor ring . With the sensor ring  fabricated in accordance with the design described hereinbefore with respect to , a known load, P, is applied to the sensor ring , as shown at block .","At block , values for Vand Vare obtained from the outputs of the two pairs of the strain gauges . The obtained values are added to a set of values (block ). If the set is not full, as determined at block , the orientation of load Pis changed at block  and, returning to block , load P(at the new orientation) is applied to the sensor ring .","As described previously, a full set of values would include load Papplied at a plurality of orientations, so as to provide values for Vand Vrepresentative of a full range of orientations about the sensor ring . The specific number of orientations and their distribution about the sensor ring  can vary depending on user preference.","If block  determines that the set of values is full, then initial values for slopes (mand m), offsets (band b) and coefficients (A, B, and C) are chosen at block . Values for V, Vand UP are obtained at block  from Equations 16, 17 and 20, respectively, for each pair of outputs (Vand V). Once values for V, Vand UP are obtained for each pair of values for Vand V, as determined at blocks  and , the standard deviation of UP is obtained at block .","Values for slopes (mand m), offsets (band b) and coefficients (A, B, and C) are iteratively varied and new values for V, Vand UP are obtained until the standard deviation is minimized, as shown at blocks  and . Once the standard deviation of UP is minimized, a correction for linearity can be obtained by plotting UP versus P.","If a plot has not been populated, as determined at block , load Pis varied (block ) and this new load Pis applied to the sensor ring  (returning to block ). This process is repeated until a plot of UP versus Pis populated sufficiently to determine a best fit curve at block , e.g., Equation [21].","Referring now to , there is shown a block diagram of method  for using the sensor ring  to measure forces exerted on the sensor ring. Once calibrated, as described with respect to , an unknown force, P, applied to sensor ring  (block ), results in strain gauges  of sensor ring  providing outputs Vand V(block ). Using the slope, offset and coefficient values determined from the method , values for V, Vand UP are obtained from Equations [18], [19] and [22], respectively (block ). The best fit curve, as determined from the method , is used to obtain the value of force P from the value determined for UP (block ).","What have thus been described are systems and methods for the design and calibration of a sensor ring for measuring compressive forces exerted on tubular material during handling of the material. Pairs of strain gauges are placed in the ring in a configuration to measure the circumferential strain at two positions on the ring ninety degrees apart (resulting from bending of the ring as it is loaded in diametric compression). The strain measurements are corrected and combined to recover the compressive force on the ring.","A method for calibrating and resolving the compressive force is independent of the angle of loading or sensor orientation as an input. Accordingly, resolution of the force from the strain gauge readings is possible\u2014irrespective of the direction of the compressive force. The method further results in the reduction of sensor orientation errors.","As described previously herein, current sensor designs suffer from large orientation errors, typically greater than thirty degrees (one standard deviation). The above described design and calibration reduce the orientation error to less than ten percent\u2014two standard deviations. The reduction in error can be ascribed to a number of factors, including configuring the strain gauges to measure circumferential strain at the ring at points ninety degrees apart from one another. Additionally, the equations derived and refined herein that combine the measured strains to recover the point load, as well as the method of calibration used to determine the optimum coefficients for use in the equations, lead to further error reductions.","It will be understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention may become apparent in light of the above considerations. For example, and as previously noted, many possible configurations and types of strain gauges can effectively measure strain inside a ring at two points. Any of these configurations can also be used for this sensor. Further, strain can be measured at two points on the outside of the ring, or even at points throughout the thickness of the ring.","Also, the ring comprising the sensor may be any size or thickness. Although strain is measured at two points ninety degrees apart; strain may also be measured at additional points to reduce error. For example, a sensor can measure strain every forty-five degrees and have multiple outputs. One pair of gauges can be calibrated separately from the other pair of gauges, but the point loads determined from each can be averaged to improve results and reduce error. The sensor is also equally applicable to tensile versus compressive loads on the ring.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
