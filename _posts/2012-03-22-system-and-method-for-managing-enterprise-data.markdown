As a result, many situations exist in which data that is stored for one purpose is accessed for another purpose. For example, a company that manufactures and sells products might store manufacturing data related to the products that are produced by the company. The manufacturing data may be used by a sales unit of the enterprise while selling the products. The sales unit may further generate sales data, which may be associated with the manufacturing data. An entity buying the products may also generate buying data associated with the manufacturing data and selling data, thereby generating more and more data. Managing such large quantity of data may be a cumbersome and tedious process.","This summary is provided to introduce concepts related to systems and methods for managing data of an enterprise and the concepts are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended for use in determining or limiting the scope of the claimed subject matter.","In one implementation, a system for managing enterprise data is provided.

In one implementation, the modules  may include a definition module , a triggering module , and other modules . The other modules  may include programs or coded instructions that supplement applications and functions of the system .","The data , amongst other things, serves as a repository for storing data processed, received, and generated by one or more of the modules . The data  may also include other data . The other data  may include data generated as a result of the execution of one or more modules in the other module .","In one embodiment, the system  managing data of an enterprise is provided. Examples of the enterprise may include an IT organization, a product manufacturing organization, a telecommunication organization, or other conglomerates. In one implementation, the system  may build and use a Data Management Architecture (DMA) for managing data of the enterprise. The data of the enterprise may be defined as a collection of qualitative description of entities and quantitative measures generated by interaction of one or more entities that enables and executes processes and applications for both internal consumption and external communication. Examples of data may include payroll data, employee data, employee competency data, billing data, manufacturing data, and the like.","In one implementation, the DMA may be stored in a database  that is connected to the system . Although, in the present embodiment the database  is shown to be outside the system , in another embodiment, the database  may be a part of the system .","In the present implementation, the definition module  may be configured to define a DMA  as shown in . The DMA  is based on a principle of \u2018loosely coupled, tightly integrated\u2019 which is described below. The DMA  may include a stakeholder layer , a service layer , and a data source layer . The stakeholder layer  comprises an enterprise portal . The enterprise portal  may be understood as a gateway to manage the data of the enterprise.

In one example, the actors may include stakeholders, the set of services to be performed by the stakeholders, and the data sources . The infrastructure, on the other hand, includes the enterprise model , the enterprise services , the enterprise metadata , the master data , and the adapters . The infrastructure may also include policies, procedure, hardware, and software to support the actors.","As evident, an enterprise may have many stakeholders. Examples of stakeholders may include consumers, administrators, users, and architects. Each of the stakeholders has a role to perform in a data life cycle. For example, the consumer may consume the data for information, decision making or research. The administrators may define data, control data, manage data definitions and usage, and manage the data life cycle. The users may create, process, and store the data as per guidelines defined. The architects may model and design architectures and interfaces to effectively manage the data. Table 1, as shown below, classifies the stakeholders succinctly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Stakeholder classification"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Consumers","Administrators","Users","Architects"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Internal-Business ","Data","Data Entry ","Data "]},{"entry":["users","Administrators\/","operators","Architects"]},{"entry":[{},"Custodians",{},{}]},{"entry":["Executives including ","Process","Application ","Data "]},{"entry":["CXOs","Administrators","users","Modelers"]},{"entry":["External agencies- ","Data Owners","Developers","Interface "]},{"entry":["Partners, vendors",{},{},"Architects"]},{"entry":["Regulatory bodies","Data Stewards","Information ","Process "]},{"entry":[{},{},"processers","Architects"]},{"entry":["Knowledge workers","Security ","Knowledge ","Designers"]},{"entry":[{},"officers","officers"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Each of the stakeholders mentioned in Table 1 has a varied degree of privilege to use the set of service tools to perform the set of services. For example, the data analytics and the report service is permitted to be used by a) all consumers shown in Table 1, b) data administrators and custodians, c) developers and information processers, and d) all architects shown in Table 1.","Referring now to the other actor, i.e., the set of services as shown in , in accordance with an embodiment of the present subject matter. Each service performs one or more functions. The set of services is available to the stakeholders in a packaged manner. The set of services are loosely coupled but tightly integrated using enterprise model . In one implementation, the stakeholders are provided access to one or more services of the set of services based on the privileges assigned to the stakeholders. In other words, based upon the privileges assigned, the stakeholders may have restricted access to certain services of the set of services. The set of services may include a report service, a configure service, a define service, an administrative service, an analytics and collaborate service, and a master data service.","The report service is primarily used by the consumers. The consumers have access to all reporting services of the DMA  along with access to the service layer . The configure service allows the stakeholders to create one or more new services based upon a requirement. The define service facilitates the stakeholders with functions of add, modify, and delete metadata. The administrative service has complete control on the DMA . The administrative service is governed by certain privileges and allows certain stakeholders i.e., the administrators to perform any required legitimate function in the DMA . The administrative service also allows the stakeholders to create, modify, execute, delete, archive, and backup data in DMA . The analytics and collaborate service provides insight of the data and enables search and analysis functions. Primary stakeholders of interest for the analytics and collaborate service are knowledge workers and analysts. Further, the analytics and collaborate service exposes workflows and emails, and trigger services to enable stakeholder to stakeholder and stakeholder to service collaboration. The master data service gathers data from data sources  and segregates master data  based upon configured libraries and engines. The master data  stores a set of standard data models along with certain processing models needed to generate the set of metrics .","In one example, for analytics as a service, the report service shall be used to view the data. Reports pertaining to the enterprise metadata, processes, and data quality are made available to the stakeholders. In another example, to perform an analysis on the data, the analytics and collaborate service shall render services of search and triggering workflows for any communication required. In yet another example, the configure service is used to expose each of the other services of set of services of data processing and preparation for the stakeholders to define custom built analytics space. Hence, services can be configured by the stakeholders based on a need.","In one implementation, each service of the set of services is associated with certain rules of execution. To attain an optimized state of the system, each service of the set of services is measured against a set of characteristics. The set of characteristics may include functionality characteristic, performance characteristic, integration characteristic, interoperability characteristic, security characteristic, collaboration characteristic, and adaptability characteristic. The functionality characteristic requires that each service of the set of services provides all features it has been designed for. For example, the master data service may seamlessly communicate with the data sources  and may interpret responses from the data sources . In case of deviations, the master data service handles all kind of exceptions effectively without user intervention. Further, the functionality characteristic requires that defined rules for a service are robust enough to perform tasks without any vulnerable\/missed functions. The performance characteristic requires that a service provides responses or results to a stakeholder within a defined stipulated time. Further, components of each of the services are designed effectively considering functional, non functional, and technical factors to attain an optimum performance level.","The integration characteristic requires that each service integrates in any given architecture seamlessly. Further, components of each service should have a capability to enable plug and play concept. The interoperability characteristic requires that each service works in cohesion with other services in the set of services. Further, the interoperability characteristic also requires an extensive collaboration between the components of the set of services, and between other services and external sources\/services. The set of services is made technology agnostic by providing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for collaboration with other services in an ecosystem of the enterprise. Further, the security characteristic requires that each service adheres to security policies defined in the enterprise and provides features of masking, encryption, and secured access. The collaboration characteristic requires that each service supports seamless and complete collaboration between the stakeholders and the set of services. The collaboration is supported by workflows, instant messaging, and through interaction devices. The adaptable characteristic requires that each service is componentized to a lowest possible level. Further, in creation of a workflow, each service can be configured only for the components required to suit a job requirement.","In one example, for analysis service, the DMA  supports the stakeholder defined processes by integrating one or many services. The stakeholders define rules of collaboration and integration. Further, the defined processes often contain complex rules for selective utilization of services. To generate a report, the services extract the data from various data sources , i.e., the functionality characteristic, process the data adhering to the security guidelines i.e., the security characteristic and collaborate with the stakeholders and other services i.e., the collaboration characteristic when the task is complete. The completed task triggers the report service i.e., integration characteristic, which is rule based i.e., interoperability characteristic. The task is completed in stipulated time period as desired by the stakeholders i.e., performance characteristic. Hence, all service characteristics of the service are harnessed.","In one implementation, each of the service characteristics is measured against a set of parameters. The service characteristics are measured to allow the stakeholders to understand a performance or maturity level of a service and to define further requirements or improvements of the service. For the functionality characteristic, the set of parameters includes completeness, communication, interpretation of exceptions, exception handling, and service to stakeholder interaction. For integration characteristic, the set of the parameters includes data sources  supported for integration, APIs provided, third party tools, and stakeholder defined rules for integration. Further, for the interoperability characteristic, the set of parameters includes protocols for communications, data sources  supported for interaction, number of data definitions interpreted (text, HTML and the like), and number of adapters  available. Further, for the security characteristic, the set of parameters includes secured access to data, masking of sensitive information, secured retrieval, processing, and display of the data, and encryption of the data. Further for the collaboration characteristic, the set of parameters includes stakeholder to service interaction, service to service interaction, service to stakeholder interaction. Furthermore, for the performance characteristic, the set of parameters include concurrency, parallelism, availability, data volume, number of data sources , data structures, Service Level Agreement (SLA) adherence, processing speed, disk space, system Input\/Output, process flow, and queuing.","The set of parameters defined above for each of the service characteristics is assessed under three levels, i.e., low, optimum, and complete for measuring effectiveness. In an example, the three levels are represented by numeric scores of 1, 2 and 3 respectively. In one implementation, a Service Effectiveness Index (SEI) is also calculated for each of the service characteristics. SEI is equal to an average of individual scores for each service characteristic. Table 2 shows an example illustrating the above formula of SEI:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

data sources . Data sources are used to feed in data to the set of service tools to perform the set of services. Example of data sources  may include database, textual data, audio\/video content and libraries. Data from different data sources  tend to be defined in native technology formats. Hence, the data extracts are converted into understandable format by means of adapters \/converters. The data is retrieved and written back to a storage area by the set of service tools. The collaboration between the set of service tools and the data sources  is seamless to indicate a status back to the end user\/related service. The data sources  are categorized into structured data, unstructured data, audio video data, internal data, and external data. The structured data is gathered by the set of service tools interfacing with the end users or defined by the APIs. The structured data typically conform to the business processes and have a well defined storage model. DB tables, XML, CVS are some forms of structured data. The unstructured data is textual data which is collated through channels of chat, emails, websites, policies, guidelines, standards, and the like. The audio\/video data requires converters\/adapters  to interpret the data. The interpretation is analyzed to derive the data\/intelligence. The internal data is internal to the enterprise. The internal data is generated by the defined processes and\/or by interactions of entities within an enterprise. The formats of internal data could be anything. The external data is gathered from external sources, which are not part of the enterprise processes. In one implementation, the data sources  are measured against availability, performance, integration, and scalability.","As mentioned above, apart from the actors, the DMA  may also include infrastructure to support the actors. The infrastructure may include several components, which enable the actors to perform the set of services in the DMA . The components of the infrastructure may include the enterprise model , the enterprise services , the enterprise metadata , the master data , and the adapters . The enterprise portal  provides a single interface for the entire DMA  to define, configure, administer, collaborate, search, and report data as mentioned above. Further, the enterprise portal  manages the stakeholder privileges and provides access to the services as per definitions. The enterprise portal  may include a set of service tools, such as a define tool, a configure tool, a report tool, an analytics and collaborate tool, a job monitor tool, and an administrative tool. The set of service tools is configured to perform the set of services defined above. In one implementation, the set of service tools are triggered by the triggering module . For example, when a user request is received, the triggering module , based on the request, may trigger the corresponding service.","In one implementation, the define tool hosts and provides access to the define service. The define tool may include metadata management unit and an enterprise architecture unit. The metadata management unit provides capability to the stakeholders to view, modify and\/or insert the enterprise metadata  pertaining to into the database . The enterprise architecture unit enables the use of the service layer  including the enterprise model . Further, the enterprise architecture invokes respective tools of the set of service tools to avail one or more services of the set of services using the triggering module . Furthermore, the enterprise architecture allows the stakeholders to define business processes, data flow diagrams, data models, tasks and its supporting entities and attributes.","The configure tool hosts and provides access to the configure service. The configure tool may provide all the loosely coupled set of services for the stakeholders to choose and define customized job specifications. The configure tool is guided by rules inbuilt in the DMA  to ensure adherence to logical grouping. Logical grouping may refer to the inbuilt rules to ensure that the set of services used in conjunction can be supported by the system . In case of configuration of the set of services without a logical sequence or without considering a dependency, the configuration may be denied by the system . Further, the configure tool may enable the defined rules or dependency definitions to ensure guided processing of the set of services. The defined rules refer to preconfigured rules which are to be provided with, during the configuration. Further, the dependency definitions include validation criteria which the set of service need to adhere with before processing a request. Furthermore, the guided processing refers to the defined rules and dependency definitions, which provide guidance to achieve a specified job in a manner requested.","The report tool invokes the report service. The report tool provides detailed analysis of the set of metrics . A view of complete data lineage at any abstract layer is provided by the report service. The report tool facilitates business reporting when the DMA  is integrated with the data. The analytics and collaborate tool enables search of any component\/element within the DMA  and also provides for collaboration (like email, workflow and triggers) for the stakeholders to interact with the one another in the ecosystem. Further, the job monitor tool displays jobs' status by connecting to a service metadata in the enterprise metadata . The enterprise metadata collaborates with service and process metadata on a predefined frequency\/real time to gather and store statuses of the processes. The service metadata, the enterprise metadata, and the process metadata are explained below.","The administrative tool provides access to all components of DMA  to perform specific administration functions. The administrative tool enables the functions of configuring data, modifying\/deleting data, managing adapters , ensuring data security, and enabling change management in the DMA . Change management may be understood with reference to description of .","Referring now to a second component of the enterprise model  as shown in , in accordance with an embodiment of the present subject matter. The enterprise model , by means of semi-automatic mechanism, captures the enterprise processes and creates an integrated metadata. The enterprise model  forms a part of the define service and provides the stakeholders a flexibility to create the enterprise model . Further, the enterprise model  also provides facility to interlink modeling components such as a business process flow diagram, a data flow diagram, conceptual enterprise model, logical data model, physical data model, application and infrastructure model, and existing enterprise models.","Referring now to a third component of the infrastructure, i.e., the enterprise metadata  as shown in , in accordance with an embodiment of the present subject matter. The enterprise metadata  is one single platform which captures any type of enterprise metadata  like business, technical, model, governance, and component consisting service and process metadata to give an integrated view of the enterprise. The enterprise metadata provides a central repository for DMA  and is stored in the database . The enterprise metadata is classified enterprise metadata  into four types of metadata, such as model metadata, service metadata, governance metadata, and DMA metadata. The model metadata may include business process, data flow, data models, and application model. The service metadata may include operational metadata of the set of services. The governance metadata may include metadata related to roles, responsibilities, policies, guidelines, standards, and SLA's. The DMA metadata may include definitions of the set of service tools, the set of services, data stores, stakeholders, users, access privileges, and the like. The enterprise metadata  may reside in multiple forms of storage techniques like flat files, DB storage, and the like.","Referring now to a fourth component of the infrastructure, i.e., the adapters  as shown in , in accordance with an embodiment of the present subject matter. The adapters  specialize in enabling communication and interpretation of messages from all data sources  contributing to the DMA . The communication and interpretations are facilitated by API for collaboration with other services. Further, the adapters  communicate with the data sources  to extract one of the data and metadata . The adapters  are accessed by the service layer  though the configure tool of the enterprise portal . Example of adapters  may include connectors, extractors, interpreter, and APIs. The connectors connect the applications and the data sources . The extractor extracts the data from the data sources  for processing based on defined functionality. The interpreter converts data specific to a data source into an understandable format. The interpreter comprises a translator, which applies rules for conversion of extracted data into defined format. For example, the metadata  extracted from a reporting tool, predefined rules are referenced by the translator to bring the metadata into a format defined by the enterprise metadata . Further, the APIs are used by the enterprise portal  to configure DMA  specific jobs.","Referring now to a fifth component of the infrastructure, i.e., the enterprise services  as shown in , in accordance with an embodiment of the present subject matter. The enterprise services  may include standard services, such as data profiling, cleansing, matching, transformation, loading, collaboration, security monitoring, auditing, backup and recovery. In one implementation, the enterprise model  may include the set of services defined above. The enterprise model  is available as configurable services in the service layer . The service layer  is based on an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). In one example, functions of the ESB may be to collaborate between the set of services as per definition and to monitor a progress of the set of services. In one implementation, the service layer  may be a three tiered service layer . The three tiers in the service layer  are rendered component wise to the stakeholders. The three tiers are adapter tier, service tier, and report tier. The adapter tier may include services which are directly linked to data sources  and perform a certain predefined function. The service tier may include predefined services like engines for data matching, data cleansing, and reconciliation. The report tier may include certain predefined reports with templates to support. The report tier is supported by one or more services and adapters . Formulae used in derivation of reports are embedded in the service tier.","Each service of the set of services has a predefined master workflow. This master workflow integrates the services based on applicable logic. The service is rendered to stakeholders based on access privileges and service availability. Hence, in a predefined user service module, service rendered is a function of services that are committed to be delivered for a given user service module and the access privilege based on the user role profile.\n\ni.e. () and ()=(),\n\nwhere Srepresents a rendered service, S(U) represents the rendering of user service Sto a user category Uand f represents a dependency map. Further, the according to the formula shown above, Sx is a function of the data source D to which Sis associated with. For a user U with specific privileges y accessing the service Sx, the access provided shall be a combination of the data source D configured to the service and the privileges that the user has on the service.\n","Table 3 shown below maps the set of services with the set of service tools.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"357pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["The set of","The set of services"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"10"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["service tools","Data Quality","Metadata","Modeling","Life cycle","Security","Governance","Collaboration","Data services","EDM Metrics"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Report tool",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},"X"]},{"entry":["Configure tool","X","X","X","X","X",{},"X","X","X"]},{"entry":["Define tool",{},"X","X",{},{},"X",{},"X"]},{"entry":["Administer","X","X","X","X","X","X","X","X","X"]},{"entry":"tool"},{"entry":["Analyze tool",{},"X",{},{},{},{},{},{},"X"]},{"entry":["Master data","X",{},{},{},"X",{},{},"X"]},{"entry":"tool"},{"entry":["Collaboration",{},{},{},{},{},{},"X"]},{"entry":"tool"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"As mentioned above, the set of services are rendered to the stakeholders based upon the access privileges assigned to the stakeholders. The stakeholders may have varied purpose with the data and their interests are vested in certain portions or segments of the data. On the other hand, there would be some areas where there is a common interest of one or more stakeholders. For example, a business user with access to create his own metric using the report tool would not be required by a security officer, while the view of a report could be required by both. Similarly a view of a data point captured in an enterprise process could be viewed by all stakeholders.","The varied interests and certain level of overlap between various stakeholders indicate that the services required by each of these stakeholders would be different with or without overlap. The services, though independent as a component, are rendered in a role\/privilege based manner.

The partial service category enables a stakeholder to access only certain services of the set of services.","No service (S=0 when U=No access). The no service category does not allow a stakeholder to access a service.","In one example, in the analytics service, a stakeholder performing a role of a consumer requires read only access to the report service. However, the same role could require access to metadata information. Hence, the stakeholder spans across the report service to analytics service. The stakeholder would be able to view both the services but may not have access to collaboration services. In the same case, the stakeholder may never define any metadata due to limitation of privileges assigned to the stakeholder.","Referring now to Table 4 which shows mapping between stakeholders and the

This includes referring to data from master data to gather key words for functional relevance and from a predefined list of words for word and synonym search. Subsequently, search parameters are defined with inputs from the above step. Then, ratings for each block are specified by the user. The source data parsing is carried out by the computer processor.

Word matching is segregated into two types, namely, position based search and word type based search. In position based search, if a word is found in body of text, \u20181\u2019 is assigned, if the word is found in header, then \u20182\u2019 is assigned and if the word is found in special font, then \u20183\u2019 is assigned. In word type based search, if the word is \u2018not found\u2019, then \u20180\u2019 is assigned.
