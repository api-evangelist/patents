{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.","The present invention relates generally to Group IV semiconductor devices and, more particularly, to an electrically pumped silicon-based semiconductor micro-ring laser.","As is known, the semiconductor industry has been trying to develop semiconductor lasers using conventional silicon and\/or other Group IV semiconductor manufacturing processes. There has also been significant interest in developing the so-called system on a chip (e.g., SOC), which may include analog and digital circuitry, as well as optical networks, which may all contained in a single package on a single silicon chip. In order to realize an active optical-network-on-a-chip, it has become necessary to provide ultracompact silicon lasers. To make SOCs and other optical semiconductor devices truly practical, it is desirable to have room temperature operation as well as electrical pumping of the silicon laser diodes, which are necessarily contained on the SOCs and\/or other optical semiconductor devices.","The search for electrically pumped silicon-based lasers that emit light near 1.3 and 1.55 \u03bcm telecomm wavelengths has been underway for years, with a diversity of approaches tried including doping silicon with Erbium ions, or using silicon nano-crystals; however, these as well as other approaches have not provided definitive lasing. The approach closest to success has been the forward-biased silicon PN-junction rib-waveguide device of M. J. Chen et al (\u201cStimulated emission in a nano-structured silicon pn junction diode using current injection,\u201d Applied Physics Letters, vol. 84, pp. 2163-2166, 22 Mar. 2004). This device exhibited stimulated emission at 1.21 \u03bcm, however, no resonator was present, the vertical confinement of light was weak, and the ridge was wide.","It would, therefore, be desirable to overcome the aforesaid and other disadvantages.","An electrically pumped semiconductor laser is set forth. The electrically pumped semiconductor laser includes a strip waveguide structure disposed on a silicon substrate. An optical coupling layer may be disposed on the substrate and the strip waveguide structure, which is followed by the disposal of a resonator layer on the optical coupling layer. The resonator layer may include a lateral superlattice having a plurality of substantially cylindrical pores extending downwardly into the resonator layer. An insulating cap layer may be disposed on the resonator layer, which is operative to seal the superlattice.","The laser may further include a first plug-filled via formed on a central region of the cap layer. The first plug-filled via extends downwardly to permit a bottom portion of the first plug to communicate with a first impurity-doped unguided wing region of the superlattice. A second plug filled via may be formed on an edge region of the cap layer. The second plug-filled via may extend downwardly to permit a bottom portion of the second plug to communicate with a second impurity-doped unguided wing region of the superlattice. In this arrangement, electrical current conducted between the first and second plug-filled vias is operative to excite predetermined elements of the superlattice defined on the resonator layer for generating light in the resonator layer, which light is redirected to the waveguide structure, via the optical coupling layer.","The present invention provides an electrically pumped silicon-based semiconductor micro-ring laser. The electrically pumped semiconductor micro-ring laser is constructed and arranged to provide a light beam at an optical output of the laser having a wavelength ranging from approximately 1200 nm to approximately 2000 nm, which is particularly useful in telecommunication applications, optical interconnects, optical signaling and\/or a number of other computing or signaling applications.","Referring now to , shown is a cross-sectional view of one embodiment of the electrically pumped semiconductor micro-ring laser  in accordance with principles of the present invention. In the illustrative embodiment, the electrically pumped semiconductor micro-ring laser  includes a substrate , which in the exemplary embodiment may include a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer having a top layer formed of crystal silicon and a bottom buried layer formed of an insulating or dielectric material, such as oxide or silicon dioxide. Typically, the silicon substrate  is integral to SOI and offers a sturdy and rigid support.","The silicon layer of the SOI wafer  can be selectively etched using and one of number of well known photolithographic semiconductor wafer process for selectively removing portions of the silicon for forming an elongated strip or rib bus waveguide  (e.g., light pipe), which will be described in further detail below. After forming the bus waveguide , an insulating or filler layer  of silicon dioxide may be disposed on adjacent sides of the bus waveguide  for providing a substantially planar surface to uniformly support disposal of subsequent layers. The insulator filler layer  is adapted to provide a relatively strong lateral confinement of light in the bus waveguide for providing a high-index-contrast waveguide that can have tight-radius bends, as desired, in regions away from the ring.","An optical coupling layer  is disposed on the filler layer  and the bus waveguide , which in the exemplary embodiment may include silicon dioxide. In the exemplary embodiment, the optical coupling layer  may include an optically conductive material or composition of materials, typically glassy silicon dioxide, or silicon oxynitride. The thickness or height \u201ch\u201d of the optical coupling layer  should be carefully controlled to provide a predetermined optical coupling between the bus waveguide  and a resonator layer , as will be described further below.","The resonator layer  is disposed on the optical coupling layer  and includes a very-short-period lateral superlattice  having a plurality of substantially cylindrical pores  extending downwardly into the resonator layer  penetrating that layer completely. As shown, the superlattice  defined on the resonator  includes a ridge portion and a wing portion . The rib or ridge waveguide portion of the superlattice  includes a central disk-shaped p-type doped semiconductor material region which may be disposed to be in substantial alignment with a bottom portion of a first conductive plug filled via . Similarly, the wing portion  of the semiconductor superlattice  includes an annual ring-shaped n-type doped semiconductor material region, surrounding the intrinsic (I-type) ridge. The n-region , as depicted in the cross-sectional view of , may be disposed to be in substantial alignment with the bottom portion of a second conductive plug filled via . It should be understood that the p and n doped regions , may be reversed. Further, the superlattice pores  may be made to extend into the doped regions , ","An insulating cap layer  may be disposed on the resonator layer  which serves to seal the ring resonator and doped injector regions . As generally mentioned above, the first conductive plug filled hole or \u201cvia\u201d  may be formed on a central region of the cap layer  and may extend downwardly through a portion of the resonator layer  to permit the bottom portion of the first conductive plug filled via  to electrically communicate with the p-region . Similarly and as also generally mentioned above, the second conductive plug filled \u201cvia\u201d  may be formed on an adjacent region of the cap layer  and may also extend downwardly through a portion of the resonator layer  to permit the bottom portion of the second conductive plug  to electrically communicate with the annual n-region  . In addition, first and second contact electrodes , may be respectively disposed on the top surfaces , of the respective first and second conductive plug filled vias ,  to provide an electrical interface to a power source  for electrically pumping or driving the laser  of the present invention.","Referring to , shown is a top view of the electrically pumped semiconductor micro-ring laser , as illustrated of . In , pores associated with the photonic crystal lattice are formed in the p-type and n-type semiconductor material doped regions , (), as well as on the ridge and wings portions , of the laser .  further shows a top view of the first and second contact electrodes , , which are formed on respective first and second conductive plug filled vias ,  () for providing an electrical interface to the laser .  also shows a top view of the vertically coupled bus waveguide  that transports the output light from the ring laser  and allows that light to be transmitted to other photonic components on the chip (not shown) by means of monolithic interconnection to those components. In one example, the first and second conductive plugs ,  may have lateral dimensions ranging from approximately 100 nm to approximately 200 nm. The first and second contact electrodes , respectively disposed on the first and second conductive plugs ,  may include suitably larger dimensions to permit practical interconnections to respective first and second signal traces or \u201ccontact pads\u201d , , as shown in . The first and second \u201cmacroscopic\u201d pads ,  are employed to interconnect the respective first and second contact electrodes , to a power source . The laser  of the present invention provides a relatively low power output, for example, 50 microwatts (cw or internally modulated), which can be amplified to milliwatt levels using a straight, waveguided optical amplifier (not shown), essentially an inline non-resonated version of the present PIN superlattice.","The following provides materials, structures and operational theories for numerous variations of the electrically pumped semiconductor micro-ring laser  of the present invention. In one embodiment, the electrically pumped PIN-diode semiconductor micro-ring laser  is provided as having an electrically injected resonator  made out of crystalline or dense nanocrystalline group IV material: an alloy or elemental semiconductor material, such as SiGe or Si or Ge. The laser's  photon energy may be slightly less than the indirect bandgap energy of the SiGe(0\u2266x\u22661), the energy difference being the exciton binding energy. Thus, the laser's  output wavelength may be tunable from 1.2 to 2.0 micrometers by the choice of composition x. Because the optical gain of crystal silicon when injected with electrons and holes is less than the free carrier absorption (See M. J. Chen and C. S. Tsai, \u201c-,\u201d paper P2, Second IEEE International Conference on Group IV Photonics, Antwerp, Belgium, 21 Sep. 2005, the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated by reference), it is desirable to find ways to enhance the gain to overcome this self absorption.","Accordingly, the gain of the laser  may be enhanced in three ways: (1) adopting the resonator  to include a high-Q micro-ring rib-waveguide with very small volume, such as 3 to 5-nm in diameter and approximately 100 nm in height, which may be employed to increase the stimulated emission rate, via the Purcell-effect Q\/V enhancement, (2) adapting the resonator  to include a lateral superlattice consisting of a hexagonal close packed array of 60-nm-diameter holes or pores (which is much smaller than the diameter in a photonic crystal lattice). This embodiment of the resonator may be fabricated in a thin layer, about 100 nm thick, of active semiconductor material in order to attain a large surface-to-volume ratio in the anti-dot lattice; thereby enhancing the concentration of excitons bound to the surface for promoting lasing since the laser transition is the radiative decay of these excitons. (3) The wings or platform of the rib waveguide may be made as nano-structures with the same periodic array of pores as the ring so that the P and N doped regions on the ring will give nano-structured electrical injection of electrons and holes into the ring from the lateral PIN diode, which will localize the electron and hole current paths on a nanoscale, thereby spreading the exciton wavefunctions in k-space and for enhancing the radiative emission rate by making the laser emission process mostly direct in k-space, at zone center.","Using double SOI, SGOI, GeOI, (silicon on insulator, silicon-germanium on insulator, germanium on insulator) the electrically pumped semiconductor micro-ring laser  of the present invention may employ vertical 3D integration as follows: (1) laser output via weak coupling of the laser cavity through a 100-nm-thick SiOlayer to a continuous, straight bus-channel waveguide, which preserves the high Q and also gives a uniform-gap coupling of bus to ring, (2) annual and disk P and N electrodes surround the ring over 360 degrees for radially uniform e-h injection, (3) vertical contact to the P and N regions is made by means of metal-filled openings or vias 100 to 200 nm in diameter in an SiOcapping layer on top of the ring, (4) metal contact pads with micrometer dimensions are deposited on top of the capping layer, (5) vertical optoelectronic integration with SOI CMOS is created with a third SOI region if desired.","The electrically pumped semiconductor micro-ring laser  of the present invention uses three techniques to enhance the optical gain of bulk crystal Si or SiGe because the simulation results (see M. J. Chen and C. S. Tsai, \u201c-,\u201d paper P2, Second IEEE International Conference on Group IV Photonics, Antwerp, Belgium, 21 Sep. 2005, the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety) show that the gain will always be less than the free-electron and free-hole absorption coefficients of the active layer when the layer is strongly injected with electron-hole pairs. The gain enhancers are: (1) the large Q\/V Purcell factor of the ultracompact resonator, (2) the 60-nm-diameter pores  () of the superlattice  (), together with a semiconductor layer height of 50 to 200 nm, produce a large surface-to-volume ratio with a high concentration of excitons or zone-center defect states to form and be bound at the surfaces, (3) the nano-structured P and N regions which constrict the injected current into narrow channels that nano-localize the electron-hole pairs, thereby enhancing the radiative recombination rate. The lasing transition is between the exciton or defect level (just below the conduction band edge) and the top of the valence band.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"sup":["\u22121","17 ","\u22123 ","\u22121"],"sub":"d"},"The self-assembled superlattice formed in silicon has been experimentally demonstrated by Liang et al (\u201c-,\u201d IEEE J. of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics, vol. 8, pp 998-1008, September\/October 2002, the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated by reference) who used a highly ordered anodized aluminum-oxide porous membrane as a base template on the silicon. A similar fabrication procedure may be employed to provide the photonic crystal lattice  incorporated on the laser  of the present invention.","In S. G. Cloutier and J. M. Xu (\u201c--,\u201d submitted for publication 2005; see also S. G. Cloutier and J. M. Xu: \u201cIndirect-bandgap Semiconductor Laser and Method to Fabricate Same,\u201d Harrington & Smith, PCT\/US2004\/017225 International Patent Application, 2004, the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated by reference) optically pumped laser action in a superlattice silicon was proven at cryogenic temperatures. The observed 1278 nm narrow-line luminescence is believed to persist at room temperature, albeit at lower intensity, for the laser of present invention since kT of 26 meV at 300K is less than the exciton binding energy.","The laser  of the present invention is based upon a multiple, vertically stacked silicon-on-insulator (or SiGeOI or GeOI) approach. Vertically stacked waveguiding has been experimentally demonstrated in double SIMOX SOI (R. A. Soref, F. Namavar and E. Cortesi, \u201c--\u201d, IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, Vol. 3, January 1991). FIG. 14 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,789,642 by J. P. Lorenzo and R. A. Soref, \u201cMethod for Fabricating Low Loss Crystalline Silicon Waveguides by Dielectric Implantation,\u201d 6 Dec. 1988, the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated by reference), which shows how an active silicon waveguide can cross over each other vertically in a double SOI. There are several ways to fabricate SiGeOI and GeOI and recent literature describes some of the most practical methods: (See Z. Chen, F. Zhang, J. Chen, B. Jin, Y. Wang, C. Zhag, Z. Zhang and X. Wang, \u201c----,\u201d Semiconductor Science and Technology, UK, vol. 20 pp 770-774 (2005); see also S. J. Koester, G. Dehlinger, J. D. Schaub, J. O. Chu, Q. C. Ouyang, and A. Grill, \u201cGermanium-on-insulator photodetectors,\u201d paper FBI, Second IEEE International Conference on Group IV Photonics, Antwerp, 21 Sep. 2005, the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated by reference).","In addition, if dense nanocrystalline Si (or nc-SiGe) is employed rather than the crystalline form, then the required double-SOI can be built up in a straightforward way by deposition of the nc-film upon oxide-covered Si, followed by silicon dioxide \u201cgrowth\u201d, followed by another nc-deposition and an oxide capping layer. The waveguide losses of nc-Si are not much larger than those of c-Si and thus may be suitable for high-Q resonator  (), as set forth in the laser  of the present invention.","A detailed fabrication procedure for 3D vertical integration in SIMOX SOI is presented in the papers of the Jalali group at UCLA (B. Jalali, P. Koonath, and T. Indukuri, \u201c-3-,\u201d SPIE Photonics West, Optoelectronic Integrated Circuits IV, Vol. 5729-18\/6, San Jose, Calif., January 2005; P. Koonath, T. Indukuri, and B. Jalali, \u201c--,\u201d Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 86, Article 091102, March 2005, the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated by reference). In an embodiment, the fabrication procedure of the Jalali group at UCLA, as described above, may be employed for fabricating the electrically pumped semiconductor micro-ring laser  of the present invention. The bus waveguide (or network of bus waveguides associated with an array of lasers) is fashioned first by photolithography. Later, the laser, or array of lasers is \u201csculpted\u201d in accordance with the Jalali method, for example, with photomasks for etching that are aligned to the bus waveguides below. The weak optical coupling between the bus waveguide  () and an appropriate segment of the resonator  () is obtained by evanescent waves that go through a uniform SiOgap located between the bus waveguide  and resonator  (e.g., optical coupling layer ), which is typically 80 to 200 nm thick.","The lateral PIN electrode geometry for injecting large concentrations of electrons and holes into a micro-ring resonator has already been proven experimentally for rings whose diameter are 10 micrometers or more (Q. Xu, B. Schmidt, S. Pradham and M. Lipson, \u201c--,\u201d Nature, vol. 453, no. 19, pp 325-327, 19 May 2005, see also L. Zhou and A. W. Poon, \u201cSilicon-on-insulator electro-optically tunable waveguide-coupled microdisk resonators with selectively integrated p-i-n diodes,\u201d paper WC5, Second IEEE International Conference on Group IV Photonics, Antwerp, Belgium, 21 Sep. 2005, the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated by reference) although the electrodes did not encompass the entire circumference as they do beneficially in the laser  of the present invention.","The PIN diode defined in the laser  of the present invention is forward-biased to allow e-h carrier densities as high as the P and N impurity concentrations to be injected into the ridge; namely 10pairs per cmfor a ridge background doping of 10cm(the so-called intrinsic carrier concentration) The background cannot be much more than 10cmin order to avoid ring mode loss from free carrier absorption. The fringing E-fields from the slab electrodes overlap well with the guided-mode's optical field in the ridge-plus-slab. Although the TE-like fundamental mode offers better waveguide confinement than the fundamental TM-like mode, the TM mode is proposed here for the laser because of empirical evidence from J. Xu that the TM-polarized light emission from the lateral superlattice is stronger than that of TE. The waveguide losses for TM are expected to be somewhat larger than those for TE. The etching depth of the rib is chosen to be around 70% as in the Q. Xu reference. The single-mode condition for such ribs is discussed in G. T. Reed et al, \u201c,\u201d paper FC5, Second IEEE International Conference on Group IV Photonics, Antwerp, Belgium, 21 Sep. 2005, the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated by reference). The presence of a cylindrical-hole-filled superlattice within the rib will lead to scattering loss in the near infrared; however, because the pore diameter is less than 5% of the infrared wavelength, the SL-induced loss will be relatively small.","One skilled in the art will appreciate further features and advantages of the invention based on the above-described embodiments. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited by what has been particularly shown and described, except as indicated by the appended claims.
