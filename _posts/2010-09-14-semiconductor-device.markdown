The internal clock is synchronized with the external clock when it is initially applied to the memory device, but the internal clock is delayed while passing through elements within the memory device. Thus, the data is outputted to the outside of the memory device in such a state that it may not be synchronized with the external clock.","In order to stably transfer data outputted from the memory device, the internal clock, delayed while passing through the elements within the memory device, must exactly match the edge or center of the external clock applied from the memory controller. To this end, the internal clock may be synchronized with the external clock by reversely compensating time for loading the data on a bus.","Examples of a clock synchronization circuit for playing such a role include a phase locked loop (PLL) circuit and a delay locked loop (DLL) circuit.","When frequencies of the external clock and the internal clock are different from each other, a PLL circuit is used because a frequency multiplication function is needed. On the other hand, when frequencies of the external clock and the internal clock are equal to each other, a DLL circuit is used because it is not greatly influenced by noise and can be implemented in a relatively small area, as compared to the PLL circuit.","Accordingly, since semiconductor memory devices commonly use the same frequency for both the external clock and the internal clock, the DLL circuit is widely used as the clock synchronization circuit.","In particular, a register controlled DLL circuit is widely used in semiconductor memory devices. The register controlled DLL circuit includes a register which may store a locking delay value. When the power is interrupted, the locking delay value is stored in the register. Then, when the power is again supplied, the locking delay value stored in the register is loaded and used to lock the internal clock. Thus, in the initial operation of the semiconductor memory device, a clock synchronization operation may be performed at a timing at which a phase difference between the internal clock and the external clock is relatively small. After the initial operation of the semiconductor memory device, time taken to synchronize the internal clock with the external clock may be reduced by adjusting the variation range of the delay value of the register according to the phase difference between the internal clock and the external clock.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Referring to , the known register controlled DLL circuit includes a clock buffering unit , a divider , a phase comparison unit , a clock delay unit , and a delay replica model unit .

The delay replica model unit  is configured to output the feedback clock FEEDBACK_CLK by reflecting an actual delay condition of the source clocks CLK and CLKB into an output clock REFCLK_DIV_DELAY of the clock delay unit  corresponding to the inputted division reference clock REFCLK_DIV.","The clock buffering unit  includes a positive clock buffer , a negative clock buffer , and a dummy clock buffer .

The clock mixer  is configured to generate a mixing clock MIX_CLK by mixing a first driving clock DRV_DU_CLK_ and a second driving clock DRV_DU_CLK_. The first driving clock DRV_DU_CLK_ is generated by driving the clock DU_CLK_ outputted from the first delay line  according to the plurality of positive mixing control signals MIX_CON<>, MIX_CON<>, MIX_CON<>, . . . , MIX_CON<N>.

The clock combiner  is configured to output the mixing clock MIX_CLK by combining the first driving clock DRV_DU_CLK_ and the second driving clock DRV_DU_CLK_.","The operation of the known phase mixer  will be described by example below.","Here, it is assumed that each of the delay units DU to DU delay their respective inputs by a same delay unit amount. Referring to , the phase of the clock DU_CLK_ outputted from the first delay line  is in a state such that it is delayed by a delay amount of \u00bd\u00d7delay unit amount corresponding to the position \u201c\u201d, and the phase of the clock DU_CLK_ outputted from the second delay line  is in a state such that it is delayed by a delay amount of (1+\u00bd)\u00d7delay unit amount corresponding to the position \u201c\u201d. If the ratio corresponding to the delay control signal DELAY_CON drives the clock DU_CLK_ outputted from the first delay line  at 75% to generate the first driving clock DRV_DU_CLK_, and drives the clock DU_CLK_ outputted from the second delay line  at 25% to generate the second driving clock DRV_DU_CLK_, the mixing clock MIX_CLK outputted from the clock combiner  included in the phase mixer  is delayed by a delay amount of \u00be\u00d7delay unit amount corresponding to a \u00bc\u00d7delay unit amount shift from position \u201c\u201d in the direction of position \u201c\u201d (see position \u201c\u201d in ).","On the other hand, if the ratio corresponding to the delay control signal DELAY_CON drives the clock DU_CLK_ outputted from the first delay line  at 25% to generate the first driving clock DRV_DU_CLK_, and drives the clock DU_CLK_ outputted from the second delay line  at 75% to generate the second driving clock DRV_DU_CLK_, the mixing clock MIX_CLK outputted from the clock combiner  included in the phase mixer  is delayed by a delay amount of (1+\u00bc)\u00d7delay unit amount corresponding to a \u00be\u00d7delay unit amount shift from position \u201c\u201d in the direction of position \u201c\u201d (see position \u201c\u201d in ).","As described above, the phase mixer  may select a delay amount smaller than that of the delay unit and delay the clock. At this time, the phase mixer  can select the value of the delay amount and delay the clock by the selected delay amount according to the number of the first drivers <>, <>, <>, . . . , <N> and the number of the second drivers <>, <>, <>, . . . , <N>.","Meanwhile, when the frequencies of the positive source clock CLK and the negative source clock CLKB inputted from the outside are relatively high, it is advantageous when the delay amount selectable by the phase mixer  is relatively small.","On the other hand, when the frequencies of the positive source clock CLK and the negative source clock CLKB inputted from the outside are relatively low, it is advantageous when the delay amount selectable by the phase mixer  is relatively large.","However, in the known phase mixer , once the number of the first drivers <>, <>, <>, . . . , <N> and the number of the second drivers <>, <>, <>, . . . , <N> are determined, they cannot be changed.","Therefore, in case where the positive source clock CLK and the negative source clock CLKB having frequencies higher or lower than the frequencies determined when designed are applied to the semiconductor device, the performance of the DLL circuit may not be fully exhibited as expected at the time when it is designed.","For example, when the positive source clock CLK and the negative source clock CLKB having frequencies higher than the frequencies determined when designed are applied to the DLL circuit of the semiconductor device, considerable jitters may occur between the positive and negative source clocks CLK and CLKB applied from the outside and the positive and negative output clocks RCLK_DELAY and FCLK_DELAY of the clock delay unit , even though the operation of the DLL circuit is completed.","On the other hand, when the positive source clock CLK and the negative source clock CLKB having frequencies lower than the frequencies determined when designed are applied to the DLL circuit of the semiconductor device, much more time is taken to complete the operation of the DLL circuit than expected. Consequently, the operation of the DLL circuit may not be completed.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are directed to a semiconductor device which is capable of delaying source clocks (CLK and CLKB) by adjusting the delay amount variation range within the delay range narrower than the delay unit, when the frequencies of the source clocks (CLK and CLKB) applied to the semiconductor device are changed to be higher or lower than the frequencies determined when designed.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are further directed to a DLL circuit which is capable of performing a DLL operation at the maximum performance, without any problem, even when the frequencies of the source clocks (CLK and CLKB) are changed to be higher or lower than the frequencies determined when designed.","In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a semiconductor device includes a reset signal generator configured to change the number of activated signals among a plurality of reset signals according to a frequency of an external clock, a plurality of mixing control signal generation units configured to generate a plurality of first and second mixing control signals, wherein M number of the first and second mixing control signals corresponding to the activated signals among the plurality of reset signals have opposite levels, and R number of the first and second mixing control signals corresponding to deactivated signals among the plurality of reset signals have the same level, and a clock mixer configured to generate a mixing clock by mixing a first driving clock and a second driving clock, wherein the first driving clock is generated by driving a positive clock of the external clock according to the plurality of first mixing control signals, and the second driving clock is generated by driving a negative clock of the external clock according to the plurality of second mixing control signals.","In accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a semiconductor device includes a plurality of first clock driving units configured to output a first driving clock by driving and combining a positive clock of an external clock, the first clock driving units being turned on\/off according to a frequency of the external clock and having different driving powers, a plurality of second clock driving units configured to output a second driving clock by driving and combining a negative clock of the external clock, the second clock driving units being turned on\/off according to the frequency of the external clock and having different driving powers, and a clock combiner configured to generate a mixing clock by combining the first driving clock and the second driving clock.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described below in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.
