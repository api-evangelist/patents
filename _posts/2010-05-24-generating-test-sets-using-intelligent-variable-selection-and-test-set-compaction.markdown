{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS","SAMPLE CODE 1","SAMPLE CODE 2"],"p":["This disclosure generally relates to testing and validating software modules.","A software application may include any number of modules, and each module may be tested or validated individually. A software module may be tested or validated manually or automatically. In the former case, a person (e.g., a software testing engineer) may manually design test cases for the software module based on the design specification of the module, execute the module under the test cases, and check for module behavior or output that does not agree with the test cases. In the later case, a software testing tool, implemented as computer software or hardware, may automatically generate test cases for a software module under test, execute the module under test while simulating the test cases, and check for module behavior or output that does not agree with the test cases.","This disclosure is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of this disclosure. However, this disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps and\/or structures have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure this disclosure. In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the disclosure to the described embodiments. To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.","To test or validate a software module, typically, test cases are generated for the module based on, for example, the design specification or other types of requirements (e.g., functional, behavioral, or performance requirements) of the module. Thereafter, the software module is executed under the test cases and the module's behavior or output is validated against the test cases. In particular embodiments, a test case may include a set of input values and information describing the specific test to be performed on the software module in connection with the input values. In particular embodiments, the input values may be assigned to the input variables of the software module when the module is being tested. Each input value may be selected to cause the module to respond in some specific manner (e.g., providing a specific output value). The test information may describe what specific features of the software module are tested, how and under what circumstance the input values are to be applied to the input variables of the software module, what is the correct behavior or output value the software module should provide in response to the input values, and so on.","Test cases may be generated for a software module either manually (e.g., by humans) or automatically (e.g., by a test-case generating tool implemented as computer hardware or software). Often, manually generated test cases have relatively poor coverage on different portions of the source code of the software module under test, and the actual process of manually generating the test cases is time consuming and costing. On the other hand, automatically generated test cases provide better test coverage and requires less time and human effort.","In particular embodiments, the input values of the test cases may be obtained by performing symbolic execution on the software module under test. However, this method may have some drawbacks. Since symbolic execution is very expensive in terms of CPU time and other types of computer resources, it is typically performed on the software module by making only one input variable of the software module symbolic at a time. If a software module has more than one input variables, then symbolic execution needs to be performed on the software module multiple times. Furthermore, depending on which one of the input variables is symbolically executed first and which one is symbolically executed second, the input values obtained from symbolic execution may differ and may provide different test coverage. Second, if a software module has a relatively large number of input variables, the number of input variables obtained from symbolic execution, and thus the number of test cases generated, may be very large, resulting in a test-case explosion, which may lead to large regression testing times when the test cases are integrated into, for example, test suits.","To overcome these drawbacks, when performing symbolic execution on a software module that has multiple input variables, particular embodiments may intelligently determine the order for symbolically executing the input variables based on the branching depths the input variables affect. In addition, once the test cases are generated as a result of symbolic execution, particular embodiments may eliminate those test cases that provide duplicate or superfluous test coverage to reduce the number of test cases eventually used to test the software module.","In the field of computer science, symbolic execution refers to the analysis of software programs by tracking symbolic rather than actual values, as a case of abstract interpretation. It is a non-explicit state model-checking technique that treats input to software modules as symbol variables. It creates complex mathematical equations or expressions by executing all finite paths in a software module with symbolic variables and then solves the complex equations with a solver (typically known as a decision procedure) to obtain error scenarios, if any. In contrast to explicit state model checking, symbolic execution is able to work out all possible input values and all possible use cases of all input variables in the software module under analysis.","To further explain symbolic execution, consider an example software module named \u201cfoo\u201d:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"\u20021","foo (a, b) {"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u20022","string a, b, c, d;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20023","c = a.concat (b) ;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20024","if !

In particular embodiments, an intermediate variable of a software module is a variable local to the software module and exists only in the context of the software module. It may also be referred to as a local variable because it only has a local scope and is accessible only from within the software module in which it is declared. The value of an intermediate variable may depend, directly or indirectly, on the value of one or more input variables of the software module. For example, with module \u201cfoo\u201d, the value of intermediate variable \u201cc\u201d depends directly on the values of input variables \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d, as indicated by line 3 of the code; and the value of intermediate variable \u201cd\u201d depends indirectly on the values of input variables \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d, through intermediate variable \u201cc\u201d, as indicated by line 5 of the code. In addition, module \u201cfoo\u201d contains a conditional branching point at line 4 of the code, caused by the \u201cif-else\u201d statement. The conditional branching point at line 4 is associated with a branching condition \u201c!(c.equals (\u201cqrs\u201d))\u201d. Depending on whether this branching condition is satisfied or holds true\u2014that is, whether intermediate variable \u201cc\u201d equals \u201cqrs\u201d\u2014module \u201cfoo\u201d proceeds down different execution paths and different portions of the code of module \u201cfoo\u201d is actually executed. More specifically, if intermediate variable \u201cc\u201d does not equal \u201cqrs\u201d, then the value of intermediate variable \u201cd\u201d is computed and returned, as indicated by lines 5 and 6 of the code. On the other hand, if intermediate variable \u201cc\u201d does equal \u201cqrs\u201d, then the value of intermediate variable \u201cc\u201d is returned, as indicated by line 8 of the code.","When symbolic execution is performed on module \u201cfoo\u201d, its input and intermediate variables are each assigned a symbolic value instead of an actual value.  illustrates an example execution flow  representing the steps of performing symbolic execution on module \u201cfoo\u201d. In this example, input variable \u201ca\u201d is assigned symbolic value \u201cx\u201d; input variable \u201cb\u201d is assigned symbolic value \u201cy\u201d; intermediate variable \u201cc\u201d is assigned symbolic value \u201cz\u201d; and intermediate variable \u201cd\u201d is assigned symbolic value \u201cw\u201d. Since variables \u201ca\u201d, \u201cb\u201d, \u201cc\u201d, and \u201cd\u201d are of type \u201cstring\u201d, symbolic values \u201cx\u201d, \u201cy\u201d, \u201cz\u201d, and \u201cw\u201d each represent an arbitrary string.","In addition, \u201c\u03a6\u201d is the symbolic expression that represents the result of the symbolic execution at various points along the execution paths. More specifically, at , which corresponds to line 2 of the code, variables \u201ca\u201d, \u201cb\u201d, \u201cc\u201d, and \u201cd\u201d are assigned their respective symbolic values \u201cx\u201d, \u201cy\u201d, \u201cz\u201d, and \u201cw\u201d, and \u201c\u03a6\u201d initially has an empty or null expression. As the execution proceeds further, expressions are added to \u201c\u03a6\u201d depending on what code has been executed. At , which corresponds to line 3 of the code, \u201c\u03a6\u201d has the expression \u201cz=concat (x,y)\u201d because line 3 of the code is \u201cc=a.concat (b)\u201d and \u201cx\u201d, \u201cy\u201d, and \u201cz\u201d are the symbolic value assigned to variable \u201ca\u201d, \u201cb\u201d, and \u201cc\u201d, respectively. Next, line 4 of the code is a conditional branching point and there are two possible execution paths down which the execution may proceed. Thus, the symbolic execution may also proceed down two different paths from : the first path, path , includes  and  corresponding to lines 5 and 6 of the code; and the second path, path , includes  corresponding to line 8 of the code.","In order to proceed down path , variable \u201cc\u201d does not equal \u201cqrs\u201d, which means symbolic value \u201cz\u201d does not equal \u201cqrs\u201d. Therefore, the expression \u201cz!=\u201cqrs\u201d\u201d is added to \u201c\u03a6\u201d at . Conversely, in order to proceed down path , variable \u201cc\u201d does equal \u201cqrs\u201d, which means symbolic value \u201cz\u201d equals \u201cqrs\u201d. Therefore, the expression \u201cz=\u201cqrs\u201d\u201d is added to \u201c\u03a6\u201d at . Along path , the value of variable \u201cd\u201d is determined at line 5 of the code, which corresponds to . Therefore, the expression \u201cw=concat (z, \u201ct\u201d)\u201d is added to \u201c\u03a6\u201d at 108. Note that because \u201cz=concat (x,y)\u201d, the expression for \u201cw\u201d may be rewritten as \u201cw=concat (concat (x,y), \u201ct\u201d)\u201d.  is the end of path , and thus, the expression of \u201c\u03a6\u201d at  represents the conditions, in symbolic form, that need to be satisfied in order to reach the end of path . Similarly,  is the end of path , and thus, expression of \u201c\u03a6\u201d at  represents the conditions, in symbolic form, that need to be satisfied in order to reach the end of path .","In particular embodiments, solving for the expression of \u201c\u03a6\u201d at  may provide the actual values for input variables \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d that cause module \u201cfoo\u201d to reach the end of path ; and solving for the expression of \u201c\u03a6\u201d at  may provide the actual values for input variables \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d that cause module \u201cfoo\u201d to reach the end of path . In particular embodiments, these actual values may then be used as test values that may be assigned to input variables \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d when testing module \u201cfoo\u201d. Since the test values include actual values for input variables \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d that cause module \u201cfoo\u201d to reach both the end of path  and the end of path , it may be assured that all possible execution paths of module \u201cfoo\u201d are tested if these test values are applied.","As mentioned before, since symbolic execution is expensive, usually, only one input variable is made symbolic at a time and executed symbolically. If a software module has multiple input variables, symbolic execution needs to be performed iteratively over all input variables one at a time. The order in which the input variables are chosen to be made symbolic may have a huge impact on the quality of the automatically generated test set in terms of final coverage. For example, consider the following code segment:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"\u20021","if (a > 5) {"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u20022","..."]},{"entry":[{},"\u20023","if (b > 2) {"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"\u20024","..."]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"\u20025","} else {"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"\u20026","..."]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"\u20027","}"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"\u20028","} else {"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"\u20029","..."]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"10","}"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Suppose \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d are input variables. If input variable \u201ca\u201d is made symbolic first, then performing symbolic execution may result in, for example, two concrete (i.e., actual) values for variable \u201ca\u201d, 6 and 4, which correspond to the clause \u201c(a>5)\u201d at line 1. With the concrete values of \u201ca\u201d being 6 and 4, if \u201cb\u201d is made symbolic second, then two more concrete values for \u201cb\u201d, 1, and 3, may result from performing symbolic execution. The input value pairs for (a, b)={(6, 1), (6, 3), (4, 1), (4,3)} are guaranteed to cover all possible execution paths through the above code segment.","On the other hand, instead of input variable \u201ca\u201d being made symbolic first, suppose input variable \u201cb\u201d is selected first to be made symbolic. Since, during symbolic execution, some concrete value needs to be assumed for input variable \u201ca\u201d, \u201ca\u201d may be assigned a random value. If the value of \u201ca\u201d is assumed to be less than 5, then symbolic execution will miss the \u201cif\u201d block at lines 3 and 4 entirely. As result, it will not be able to generate any meaningful value for variable \u201cb\u201d. The final resulting test set will only have the two values of \u201ca\u201d, which are subsequently calculated with some random value generated for input variable \u201cb\u201d. The resulting test set may look something like (a, b)={(6, 7), (4, 7)}, where 7 is the random value assigned to input variable \u201cb\u201d. This second test set will result in test input values that provide much worse code coverage than those resulted from the first test set. Consequently, the order at which input variables are made symbolic for the purpose of symbolic execution may have huge impact on the level of the final code coverage obtained by the automatically generated test set.","To address this possible problem, particular embodiments may intelligently determine the order for symbolically executing the input variables of a software module.  illustrates an example method for determining the order for symbolically executing the input variables of a software module, and  illustrates an example system  for determining the order for symbolically executing the input variables of a software module.  are described in connection with each other.","In particular embodiments, a software module may have any number of input variables and any number of intermediate variables. In particular embodiments, the value of each intermediate variable may depend, directly or indirectly, on the value of at least one input variable. That is, a change to the value of an input variable results in a change to the value of an intermediate variable that directly or indirectly depends on the input variable. Of course, an intermediate variable may depend on multiple input variables, and multiple intermediate variables may depend on the same input variable. Particular embodiments may determine which intermediate variable depends, directly or indirectly, on which input variable of a software module by performing relevancy analysis on the input variables, as illustrated in step  of . In particular embodiments, step  may be performed by component  of system  illustrated in , which takes a software module  as input and performs relevancy analysis on the input variables of software module .","In particular embodiments, relevancy analysis may compute a set of variables of a software module that is relevant to a set of symbolic variables. Particular embodiments may consider a variable as relevant if it may store a symbolic value given a set of symbolic inputs, which is based on the insight that software analysis may be regarded as model checking of abstract interpretation. As a result, software analysis enjoys the soundness guarantee from abstract interpretation and the automation advantages from model checking. In particular embodiments, the relevancy analysis performed on software module  may be based on weighted pushdown model checking techniques. Relevancy analysis is described in more details in U.S. Patent Publication 2010-0223599 A1, filed on 27 Feb., 2009, entitled \u201cEfficient Symbolic Execution of Software Using Static Analysis\u201d, and U.S. Patent Publication 2010-0242029 A1, filed on 19 Mar., 2009, entitled \u201cEnvironment Data Refinement Based on Static Analysis and Symbolic Execution\u201d.","Once it has been determined which variable depends on which input variable of the software module, particular embodiments may construct a variable set for each input variable, as illustrated in step  of . The variable set includes the input variable itself and all the intermediate variables that directly or indirectly depend on the input variable, according to the result of the relevancy analysis. The number of variable sets thus constructed equals the number of input variables the software module has. Note that an intermediate variable may belong to multiple variable sets since the intermediate variable may depend on multiple input variables.","For each variable set, particular embodiments may compute an average branching depth reached by the input and intermediate variables from the set, as illustrated in step  of .

Then, particular embodiments may average the branching depths computed for all the individual input and intermediate variables to determine the average branching depth for the variable set. To compute the branching depth reached by one of the variables from the variable set, particular embodiments may examine each of the conditional branching points in the software module, starting from the outmost conditional branching point and gradually proceeding toward the inner, nested conditional branching points. If the variable affects the branching condition associated with a conditional branching point, then particular embodiments may increment the branching depth of the variable by 1. In the above example code segment, the branching condition associated with the conditional branching point at line 1 is affected by variables \u201cm\u201d, \u201cn\u201d, and \u201ck\u201d, because all three variables are involved with the sub conditions that together form the branching condition.

In particular embodiments, step  may be performed by component  of system  illustrated in , which provides as output a set of test cases . As described above in connection with , particular embodiments may assign a symbolic value to the input variable from the selected variable set, perform symbolic execution on the software module, solve for the symbolic expressions (e.g., \u201c\u03a6\u201d) obtained at the end of the different execution paths to obtain actual values for the input variable from the selected variable set, which may then be used as test values to be applied to the input variable when the software module is tested. These actual values for the input variable may be used to generate test cases for the software module. Particular embodiments may repeat this process multiple times, each time selecting another variable set. For example, during the second iteration, the variable set that has the second smallest average branching depth may be selected, and symbolic execution may be performed on the software module with the input variable from this second variable set having a symbolic value. The actual values may be determined for this input variable based on the result of the symbolic execution.

During the third iteration, the variable set that has the third smallest average branching depth may be selected, and symbolic execution may be performed on the software module with the input variable from this third variable set having a symbolic value.

In particular embodiments, for a given input variable, all the conditional branching points that have branching conditions that are either affected by the input variable itself or by any intermediate variable that directly or indirectly depends on the input variable is considered to be affected by the input variable. For example, suppose intermediate variable \u201cj\u201d depends on input variable \u201ci\u201d. Further suppose that one conditional branching point has a branching condition that is affected by input variable \u201ci\u201d, and another conditional branching point has a branching condition that is affected by intermediate variable \u201cj\u201d. In this case, both conditional branching points are considered to be affected by input variable \u201ci\u201d because intermediate variable \u201cj\u201d depends on input variable \u201ci\u201d.","In particular embodiments, for the set of test cases, each test case from the set may include a combination of actual values that may be applied to the input variables of the software module as test input values during the testing of the software module.

That is, different actual values assigned to an input variable as testing values may cause the software module to proceed down different execution paths leading from a conditional branching point affected by the input variable. In the above example, suppose input variable \u201ca\u201d affects a conditional branching point \u201ccbp1\u201d. From conditional branching point \u201ccbp1\u201d, the software module may proceed down two different execution paths.

Each edge in graph  represents an input variable, and each node in graph  represents a possible test value for an input variable from the twelve test cases illustrated above. Traversing along different paths of graph  eventually leads to different test cases. In particular embodiments, such a graph may help identify which test case covers which execution path of the software module. In particular embodiments, if there are multiple test cases that cover the same execution path, then all but one of the redundant test cases may be removed from the set of test cases, as illustrated in step  of , because the additional test cases do not really provide any additional test coverage for the software module. This may reduce the size of the set of test cases. For example, in , at nodes  and , it may be determined that the subsequent branches of graph  from nodes  and  do not provide new test coverage on the execution paths of the software module that are not covered by the test cases at nodes , , and . Therefore, all the test cases below nodes  and  may be removed from the set of test cases.","Using a graph, such as graph  illustrated in , may not be able to remove all the redundant test cases from the set of test cases. Particular embodiments may further reduce the size of the set of test cases (e.g., further perform test set compaction) based on a bipartite graph, an example of which is illustrated in . In particular embodiments, a bipartite graph, such as the one illustrated in , may be constructed for the test cases and the conditional branches of the software module by component  of system  illustrated in . In particular embodiments, a bipartite graph (e.g., bipartite graph ) may include two parts. One part (e.g., ) represents the remaining test cases from the test-case set, with each node representing one of the remaining test cases. Another part (e.g., ) represents all the possible conditional branches of the software module, with each node representing one of the conditional branches. If a test case covers a conditional branch, then a directed edge links the node in part  representing the test case to the node in part  representing the conditional branch. It is possible that a conditional branch is not covered by any available test case (e.g., node ), by only one test case (e.g., node ), or by multiple test cases (e.g., node ).","Once a bipartite graph (e.g., bipartite graph ) has thus been constructed, particular embodiments may iteratively select the test cases using a greedy algorithm, as illustrated in steps  and  of . In particular embodiments, steps  and  may be performed by component  of system  illustrated in , which provides as output a subset of test cases  selected from test-case set . Particular embodiments may first select all the essential test cases in the bipartite graph that uniquely cover at least one of the conditional branches, as illustrated in step  of . That is, each of the essential test cases selected is the only test case that covers a particular conditional branch. For example, in , node  represents an essential test case because this test case is the only test case that covers conditional branches represented by nodes  and . Similarly, node  also represents an essential test case. These test cases are selected first. However, node  does not represent an essential test case because it does not uniquely cover any conditional branch; therefore, this test case is not selected at this point.","Once all the essential test cases are selected, they may be removed from the bipartite graph. Also the conditional branches that the essential test cases cover may be removed from the bipartite graph. Next, from the remaining test cases in the bipartite graph, particular embodiments may iteratively select the test case that covers the most number of conditional branches one at a time, and then remove that selected test case from the bipartite graph, until all the conditional branches covered by the available test cases are covered by the selected test cases, as illustrated in step  of .
