No. 09\/565,132, entitled \u201cNAVIGATING AN INDEX TO ACCESS A SUBJECT MULTI-DIMENSIONAL DATABASE,\u201d filed on same date herewith, by William E. Malloy, et al., which is incorporated by reference herein.","This invention relates in general to database management systems performed by computers, and in particular, to using an index to access a subject multi-dimensional database.","On-line analytical processing (OLAP) refers to consolidating, viewing, and analyzing data in the manner of \u201cmulti-dimensional data analysis.\u201d In OLAP systems, data can be aggregated, summarized, consolidated, summed, viewed, and analyzed. OLAP generally comprises numerous, speculative \u201cwhat-if\u201d and\/or \u201cwhy\u201d data model scenarios executed by a computer. Within these scenarios, the values of key variables or parameters are changed, often repeatedly, to reflect potential variances in measured data. Additional data is then synthesized through animation of the data model. This often includes the consolidation of projected and actual data according to more than one consolidation path or dimension.","Data consolidation is the process of synthesizing data into essential knowledge. The highest level in a data consolidation path is referred to as that data's dimension. A given data dimension represents a specific perspective of the data included in its associated consolidation path. There are typically a number of different dimensions from which a given pool of data can be analyzed. This plural perspective, or Multi-Dimensional Conceptual View, appears to be the way most business persons naturally view their enterprise. Each of these perspectives is considered to be a complementary data dimension. Simultaneous analysis of multiple data dimensions is referred to as multi-dimensional data analysis.","OLAP functionality is characterized by dynamic multi-dimensional analysis of consolidated data supporting end user analytical and navigational activities including:\n\n","OLAP is often implemented in a multi-user client\/server mode and attempts to offer consistently rapid response to database access, regardless of database size and complexity.","Multi-dimensional databases provide a means for business analysts to easily view summary data and other derived data in a multi-dimensional model of a business. Such a model can be used to test whether a particular hypothesis about the operation of the business is true or not. However, such models can be very large and so it can be difficult to \u201csee\u201d where the most interesting \u201cfeatures\u201d are in a vast numeric landscape comprising millions, or even billions of values. That is, a multi-dimensional OLAP system has multiple dimensions and members within the dimensions. It is typically difficult and time-consuming to locate particular data within the multi-dimensional OLAP system.","One conventional system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,359,724 (hereinafter the '724 patent), issued on Oct. 25, 1994 to Robert J. Earle, and entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Storing and Retrieving Multi-Dimensional Data in Computer Memory\u201d. Multi-dimensional data is organized as sparse and dense dimensions in a two level structure. In particular, the dense dimensions form a block of data having cells, with each cell holding a value for a combination of sparse dimensions. This technique requires a user to specify a combination of sparse dimensions to access the multi-dimensional data. This places a burden on the user to know the sparse dimensions and the combination required to access a value in a cell. It also is time consuming for a user to use this technique to access data in many cells.","Sunita Sarawagi in \u201cIndexing OLAP Data\u201d, Bulletin of the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Data Engineering, 1996, prototyped a system for coloring cells in a Microsoft\u00ae Excel pivot table and devised a scheme to lead an analyst from high-level cells to lower-level cells of interest, however, no mechanism for integrating this technology with multi-dimensional databases was devised. Furthermore, the navigation process described was tedious, particularly in large cubes, and required the user to navigate to each cell and view the feature subjectively.","There is a need in the art for an improved technique for accessing data in a multi-dimensional database.","To overcome the limitations in the prior art described above, and to overcome other limitations that will become apparent upon reading and understanding the present specification, the present invention discloses a method, apparatus, and article of manufacture for using an index to access a subject multi-dimensional database.","According to an embodiment of the invention, a subject multi-dimensional database stored on a data store connected to the computer is accessed. Initially, an index is created for the subject multi-dimensional database, wherein the index comprises another multi-dimensional database. Then, the subject multi-dimensional database is accessed using the index.","In the following description of an embodiment, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration a specific embodiment in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and functional changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","An embodiment of the invention builds an index for accessing a multi-dimensional database. The index is itself a multi-dimensional database. To more easily distinguish between the databases, the multi-dimensional database to be accessed will be referred to as a subject multi-dimensional database, and the index will be referred to as an index or an index multi-dimensional database. The techniques of the invention are applicable to all multi-dimensional databases with the following characteristics: (1) the ability to store data and associated non-numeric values; and (2) the ability to link from a database of one dimensionality to a database of another dimensionality. Additionally, if a multi-dimensional database did not have an ability to store data and associated non-numeric values and\/or an ability to link from a database of one dimensionality to a database of another dimensionality, the techniques of the invention may still be applied in alternative embodiments in which these functions are added as part of as an application, instead of as part of a multi-dimensional database system.","The invention provides a user interface to set up definitions for the subject multi-dimensional database to be mined, dimensions to be mined, measures to be mined, mining technique (i.e., feature identification) parameters, and the number of results to be stored. The user interface is able to directly drive a mining run. Additionally, the Invention supports traversal of the multi-dimensional database, execution of the mining technique, and generation of result data. The mining can be carried out following incremental data load and calculation when the invention runs in batch mode. In one embodiment, the mining technique scans the subject multi-dimensional database only once. The result data is used to create an index. Management of the index requires operations for creating and deleting the index, for outline definition, for data population, for cell note creation (i.e., linked reporting object creation), and linked partition definition. The invention provides capabilities for exploration and visualization of the result data against the subject multi-dimensional database.","In particular, the invention provides integration between OLAP and data mining by providing a deviation detection feature that explores OLAP data and guides an analyst to deviant values. OLAP usually involves a person exploring the data, formulating questions and finding answers. The invention extends OLAP to perform automated exploration of the data.","The invention uses an index (i.e., a second multi-dimensional database) to access a first or subject multi-dimensional database. The invention automatically builds the index, along with links to the subject multi-dimensional database. The invention also stores the index data in a spreadsheet data file, so that a spreadsheet user could view a list of deviations in one spreadsheet and link to the cells in the subject multi-dimensional database using a linked partition mechanism. Moreover, this invention supports use of linked reporting objects (LROs) and provides a report that can be loaded into a spreadsheet.","There are many advantages to the invention. For example, the invention has a straightforward implementation. Also, the invention does not require any additional functions or support from the developers of the subject multi-dimensional database, does not modify the existing subject multi-dimensional database, and does not store extra data in the subject multi-dimensional database. Moreover, the invention can store extra explanations as cell notes on the index. Additionally, the invention provides visualization and navigation of multi-dimensional data. Furthermore, the invention can be managed easily and can be applied with any data mining technique that can identify points of interests in a multi-dimensional database (i.e., a feature identification technique). In addition, the infrastructure of the invention supports plug-in techniques the can extend the solution beyond deviation detection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In particular, an Administration Client , an Analyst Client , and a Server  are connected to each other via a network , such as a LAN, WAN, or the Internet. Initially, an administrator or other user at an administration client  locates an Indexing Parameters Collection GUI  using a Network File System . Then, the administrator runs (i.e., invokes or executes) the Indexing Parameters Collection GUI (i.e., graphical user interface) . The Indexing Parameters Collection GUI  collects parameters to be used to create an Index Multi-Dimensional Database (i.e., index)  to access a Subject Multi-Dimensional Database . During the process of collecting parameters, the Indexing Parameters Collection GUI  uses the OLAP Client Network Interface  to interface with the OLAP Server Network Interface , which in turn interfaces with the OLAP Database System  in order to access the Subject Multi-Dimensional Database  and return data to the Indexing Parameters Collection GUI  via the OLAP Server Network Interface  and the OLAP Client Network Interface . The Indexing Parameters Collection GUI  creates an Indexing Parameters file .","Next, the Index System  is invoked by the Indexing Parameters Collection GUI . Then, the Index System  invokes Feature Identification Software  and passes the Indexing Parameters file  to the Feature Identification Software . The Feature Identification Software  performs data mining to obtain a specified number of deviations for one or more members of the Subject Multi-Dimensional Database . In particular, the Feature Identification Software  retrieves data from the Subject Multi-Dimensional Database . The Feature Identification Software  accesses the Subject Multi-Dimensional Database  via an OLAP Client Network Interface  to interface with the OLAP Server Network Interface , which in turn interfaces with the OLAP Database System  in order to access the Subject Multi-Dimensional Database  and return data to the Feature Identification Software  via the OLAP Server Network Interface  and the OLAP Client Network Interface .","The Feature Identification Software  returns data to the Index System , which uses the returned data to create an Index Multi-Dimensional Database . Using the Index Multi-Dimensional Database , the Index System  creates the Deviations Spreadsheet .","Once the Deviations Spreadsheet  has been built, the Index System  provides capabilities for using the Deviations Spreadsheet  to access the Subject Multi-Dimensional Database . In particular, an analyst or user at the Analyst Client  uses the Network File System  to locate and select the Deviations Spreadsheet . Selection of the Deviations Spreadsheet  may be done, for example, by pointing at the Deviations Spreadsheet  with a mouse and double-clicking a left mouse button. Selection of the Deviations Spreadsheet  invokes the Spreadsheet Software , which in turn invokes the OLAP Spreadsheet Add-In .","Then, the Spreadsheet Software  and OLAP Spreadsheet Add-In  access the Subject Multi-Dimensional Database  via an OLAP Client Network Interface  to interface with the OLAP Server Network Interface , which in turn interfaces with the OLAP Database System  in order to access the Subject Multi-Dimensional Database  and return data to the Index System  via the OLAP Server Network Interface  and the OLAP Client Network Interface .","In the hardware environment, the Administration Client , Analyst Client , and Server  may each include, inter alia, a processor, memory, keyboard, or display, and may be connected locally or remotely to fixed and\/or removable data storage devices and\/or data communications devices. The Administration Client , Analyst Client , and Server  also could be connected to other computer systems via the data communications devices. Those skilled in the art will recognize that any combination of the above components, or any number of different components, peripherals, and other devices, may be used with the Administration Client , Analyst Client , and Server . Those skilled in the art will also recognize that the present invention may be implemented on a single computer, rather than multiple computers networked together.","The present invention is typically implemented using one or more computer programs, each of which executes under the control of an operating system and causes the Administration Client , Analyst Client , and Server  to perform the desired functions as described herein. Thus, using the present specification, the invention may be implemented as a machine, process, or article of manufacture by using standard programming and\/or engineering techniques to produce software, firmware, hardware or any combination thereof.","Generally, the computer programs and\/or operating system are all tangibly embodied in a computer-readable device or media, such as memory, data storage devices, and\/or data communications devices, thereby making a computer program product or article of manufacture according to the invention. As such, the terms \u201carticle of manufacture\u201d and \u201ccomputer program product\u201d as used herein are intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer readable device or media.","Moreover, the computer programs and operating system are comprised of instructions which, when read and executed by the Administration Client , Analyst Client , and Server , cause the Administration Client , Analyst Client , and Server  to perform the steps at necessary to implement and\/or use the present invention. Under control of the operating system, the computer programs may be loaded from the memory, data storage devices, and\/or data communications devices into the memories of the Administration Client , Analyst Client , and Server  for use during actual operations. Those skilled in the art will recognize many modifications may be made to this configuration without departing from the scope of the present invention.","The present invention comprises an OLAP system that is designed for a wide-range of multi-dimensional reporting and analysis applications. In one embodiment, the OLAP system is based on Hyperion\u00ae Software's Essbase\u00ae OLAP software. The present invention utilizes a number of components from the Essbase\u00ae OLAP system, including components that provide data access, navigation, application design and management and data calculation. However, the present invention comprises new elements that allow access to a multi-dimensional database via an index.","Those skilled in the art will recognize that the hardware environment illustrated in  is not intended to limit the present invention. Indeed, those skilled in the art will recognize that other alternative hardware environments may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","214","222","204","1","206","2","208","3","210","4","212","202","202","214","222","200"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300"]},"A dimension acts as an index for identifying values within the Cube. If one member of the dimension is selected, then the remaining dimensions in which a range of members (or all members) are selected defines a sub-cube in which the number of dimensions is reduced by one. If all but two dimensions have a single member selected, the remaining two dimensions define a spreadsheet (or a \u201cslice\u201d or a \u201cpage\u201d). If all dimensions have a single member selected, then a single cell is defined. Dimensions offer a very concise, intuitive way of organizing and selecting data for retrieval, exploration and analysis.","A single data point or cell occurs at the intersection defined by selecting one member from each dimension in a cube. In the example cube shown in , the dimensions are Time, Product, and Measures. The cube is three dimensional, with each dimension (i.e., Time, Product, and Measures) represented by an axis of the cube. The intersection of the dimension members (i.e., Time , 1997 , Q, Q, Q, Q, Product , A , B , C  Measures , Sales , Costs , and Profits ) are represented by cells in the multi-dimensional database that specify a precise intersection along all dimensions that uniquely identifies a single data point. For example, the intersection of Q, Product  and Costs  contains the value, , representing the costs of all products in the second quarter of 1997.","Cubes generally have hierarchies or formula-based relationships of data within each dimension. Consolidation involves computing all of these data relationships for one or more dimensions. An example of consolidation is adding up all sales in the first quarter. While such relationships are normally summations, any type of computational relationship or formula might be defined.","Members of a dimension are included in a calculation to produce a consolidated total for a parent member. Children may themselves be consolidated levels, which requires that they have children. A member may be a child for more than one parent, and a child's multiple parents may not necessarily be at the same hierarchical level, thereby allowing complex, multiple hierarchical aggregations within any dimension.","Drilling down or up is a specific analytical technique whereby the user navigates among levels of data ranging from the most summarized (up) to the most detailed (down). The drilling paths may be defined by the hierarchies within dimensions or other relationships that may be dynamic within or between dimensions. For example, when viewing data for Sales  for the year 1997  in , a drill-down operation in the Time dimension  would then display members Q, Q, Q, and Q.","In particular, U.S. Pat. No. 5,359,724 (hereinafter the '724 patent), issued on Oct. 25, 1994 to Robert J. Earle, and entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Storing and Retrieving Multi-Dimensional Data in Computer Memory\u201d describes a technique for accessing data via a combination of members of the multi-dimensional database. The '724 patent addresses sparsity for large arrays with many dimensions. The dimensions are split into two groups: sparse dimensions from the outer array and dense dimensions form the inner array. Each cell in the outer (sparse) array contains a dense array. A user chooses dimension types so that sparsity occurs in the outer array.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","404","400","400","404","3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","500","502"]},"The '724 patent allows efficient access to a multi-dimensional database via member names, but not based on cell values. On the other hand, the invention described in this embodiment is advantageous in that it enables access to a database having characteristics similar to the database of the '724 patent based on cell values.","Note that the cells of the multi-dimensional database of the '724 patent only hold numeric values. A linked reporting object (IRO) enables non-numeric data to be associated with a cell. The linked reporting object is not stored in the main database. Additionally, the linked reporting object has a different indexing technique.","In order to create the index, the Index System  passes the indexing parameters  to feature identification software  for use in finding \u201cfeatures\u201d in the subject multi-dimensional database . Then, the Index System finds the \u201cfeatures\u201d with the feature identification software . Next, the Index System builds the index  using the features as points for indexing into the subject multi-dimensional database . Then, the Index System  provides navigation capabilities for navigating the index  to access the subject multi-dimensional database . The following discussion will use examples to better illustrate the concepts of the invention. Although the following examples discuss using one index to access one subject multi-dimensional database, one or more indexes may be created and used to access one or more subject multi-dimensional databases.","Initially, a subject multi-dimensional database exists or is created. The subject multi-dimensional database has an outline that defines the members and hierarchies that form its dimensions. The subject multi-dimensional database stores values in the cells of the multi-dimensional structure defined by the outline.  is a diagram that illustrates a conceptual structure (i.e., an outline)  of a subject multi-dimensional database. The outline  has the following dimensions: Year , Product , Measures , Market , and Scenario . The Measures  and Scenario  dimensions have associated text indicating that they are only labels. That is, there is no data associated with just the Measures  and Scenario  dimensions, but these dimension labels are used to categorize other data, which is associated with the members of these dimensions. For dimensions, such as Product  and Market , it is possible to drill down to members or to drill up to the dimension to obtain a summary or calculation of collective data from the members.","The Index System provides a user interface to gather parameters for the feature identification phase. In one embodiment, parameters collected include the following:\n\n","The Subject Multi-Dimensional Database parameters are used to collect information on the location and identification of the subject multi-dimensional database. Additionally, a username (i.e., user identification) and password are requested for use in accessing a secure subject multi-dimensional database. The Index parameters are used to collect information on the location and identification of the index. A username (i.e., user identification) and password are requested for use in securing the index. The Scope parameter is used to collect information about which member or members of each dimension (i.e., member sets for each dimension) are to be used for a deviation search when performing feature identification. Additionally, the Member(s) parameter is used to collect information on which feature or features are to be mined. The Member(s) parameter is a special part of the Scope parameter. The Feature Identification Technique parameter is used to collect information on which particular feature identification technique is to be used and additional parameter information for that technique. Note that there are many feature identification techniques known in the art. The Limit parameter is used to collect a limit on the number of features to locate using the feature identification technique. For the selected number of features, the invention stores deviation values, dimensional intersection identifiers, and explanation information. Typically, an analyst looking at deviations will look at a relatively small number of deviations. Because a limit on the amount of data that is expected from the feature identification software is provided, the feature identification software typically can accumulate its results in memory, without a need for writing the results to disk.","Once parameter information is collected, the Index System launches feature identification software, which connects to the subject multi-dimensional database, extracts the data specified by the scope, and passes it on to the feature identification software.","In the following example, the object will be to obtain the three most prominent features. Therefore, the Limit parameter is set to three. In this example, the Scope parameter contains the following values:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0082"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Dimension","Members"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Measures","Sales"]},{"entry":[{},"Year","All Members"]},{"entry":[{},"Product","All Members"]},{"entry":[{},"Market","All Members"]},{"entry":[{},"Scenario","Actual"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"For the Measures dimension , the scope is the Sales member. For the Year dimension , the scope is all members. For the Product dimension , the scope is all members. For the Market dimension , the scope is all members. For the Scenario dimension , the scope is the Actual member. The Index System obtains these parameters and forwards the parameters to feature identification software, which retrieves the data for the members specified by the scope. This data is passed on to the feature identification software.","In this example, the Member(s) parameter is Measures, and the feature identification software will determine Sales deviation. For the selected Measures member, the feature identification software, calculates the three most prominent features. The feature identification software may use any technique that can identify specific points or regions of interest in a multi-dimensional database. The result is an ordered list of multi-dimensional points. Some feature identification techniques may have additional information about features, such as the dimension along which the feature is most apparent. This additional information can be attached to the value data for the points in linked report objects (LROs). In this example, the Feature Identification Technique parameter will identify the deviation detection technique as described by Sunita Sarawagi, Rakesh Agrawal, and Nimrod Megiddo in \u201cDiscover-driven Exploration of OLAP Data Cubes\u201d, Research Report, IBM Research Division, which is incorporated by reference herein.","For the parameters specified above, the following table illustrates data that is returned by the feature identification technique.

In the index, the Measures dimension  has members \u201cMeasures\u201d and \u201cDeviation\u201d. \u201cDeviation\u201d is a member of the Measures dimension  because the deviation detection technique calculated a Sales deviation in this example. That is, the Measures dimension  has a member, which is the member specified as the measured item (i.e., Sales) in the input.","These are flat dimensions, and it is not necessary to include the hierarchical structure of the subject multi-dimensional database in the index. The index is extremely sparse, with only N cells containing data. In the definition of the storage arrangement for the index, all dimensions should be sparse.","The Index System uses standard application programming interfaces (APIs) provided with a multi-dimensional database system (e.g., system software such as Essbase\u00ae software) to connect to an instance of the multi-dimensional database system and construct the index. Initially, the Index System uses the feature report (i.e., the ordered list of points) to load the feature values into the cells of the index. If the feature identification technique provides descriptive information, it is loaded as Linked Reporting Objects (LROs) associated with corresponding feature-value cells. The input parameters of the feature identification operation that generated the index are stored as an LRO at the top-level cell (Year, Measures, Product, Market, Scenario, Rank) of the index.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","800","800","9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 9A","b":["900","902","903","904","910","114","900"]},"In particular, the Index System loads the N feature cell-values into the index. For example, in an embodiment using an Essbase\u00ae multi-dimensional database, a load-rule file is used to load index data from the spreadsheet data file shown above into the index data cells. A load-rule file is a file that describes the format of input that is to be loaded into an Essbase\u00ae multi-dimensional database. In an alternative embodiment, deviation values are formatted in a way that does not require use of a load-rule file, and, in fact, the deviation values may be stored in memory.","A query of the index in order of the Rank dimension members is generated in the form of a spreadsheet , which is illustrated in FIG. A. This is a standard form of multi-dimensional query. Spreadsheets such as Lotus\u00ae 1-2-3 spreadsheets and Microsoft\u00ae Excel spreadsheets could be generated, which may be useful particularly for formatting. In one embodiment, a comma separated values file is used as a spreadsheet data file, as shown above, because it is a simple text file that is understood by virtually all spreadsheet and database programs.","The first time a cell (e.g., cell F3) is selected in the spreadsheet , the invention displays a login prompt , as illustrated in FIG. B. In the login prompt , the analyst selects the index multi-dimensional database from, for example, a selection list, selects a server, and provides a username and password (i.e., these were Index parameters when building the index). This results in a connection to the index.","At this time, an index has been built and loaded with values. Next, the Index System automatically links the index to the subject multi-dimensional database. Again, the Index System uses standard APIs provided with the multi-dimensional database system (e.g., system software such as Essbase\u00ae software) to specify the linkage.  illustrate graphical user interfaces to clarify the concepts of the process performed by the Index System. However, in one embodiment, these graphical user interfaces are not provided for a user, because the Index System performs the linking. In other embodiments, the graphical user interfaces are provided to enable a user to perform the linking.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0102"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1000","1002","1004","1006","1008","1010"]},"The linked Partition definition is very simple because the Index System maps each dimension in the subject multi-dimensional database to a dimension in the index. In particular, the Index System uses the partition definition to map the Deviation member in the index to the measure for which deviations were calculated, which is the Sales member in this case. Additionally, the Index System uses the partition definition to map out the Rank dimension because it is not a dimension of the subject multi-dimensional database.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0104"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":"1100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0105"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1200","1202","1204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0106"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["1300","1302","1304","1306","1308","1310","1312"]},"Once features are identified, the invention provides a navigation mechanism for accessing the subject multi-dimensional database using the index. The navigation mechanism has the following benefits:\n\n","OLAP spreadsheet add-ins are used as a navigation tool for the subject multi-dimensional database. Add-ins refer to software programs that expand the capabilities of the spreadsheet, for example allowing zooming into or out of cells (i.e., which corresponds to drilling down and drilling up in a multi dimensional database). For example, if the multi-dimensional spreadsheet is a Microsoft\u00ae Excel spreadsheet, the menu bar will include a new menu for the OLAP spreadsheet add-ins, which support navigating the index. This is advantageous in that it results in a simple, well-integrated interface designed for multi-dimensional analysts. The following process describes the elements required to navigate from a desktop (e.g., running on a Microsoft Windows NT\u00ae operating system) to a cell of interest in the index.","Initially, an analyst launches the spreadsheet containing the ranking query on the index. The loaded spreadsheet contains the ranked features, as shown in FIG. A. To navigate the subject multi-dimensional database, the analyst double-clicks on a feature-value cell of interest. The view presented in the spreadsheet  of  is a valid multi-dimensional report, so a user can connect to the index and view the linked reporting objects. The index is linked to the subject multi-dimensional database, which the deviation detection was run against, using a linked partition. The linked partition enables a user to navigate from the index view to an identified point in the subject multi-dimensional database by, for example, using a mouse and double-clicking a left mouse button while pointing at one of the deviation values.","As discussed above, the first time a cell is selected, the invention displays a login prompt. For example, double clicking on the Rank 1 deviation value (cell F3 in ) displays a login prompt , as shown in FIG. B. In the login prompt , the analyst selects the index multi-dimensional database from, for example, a selection list, selects a server, and provides a username and password (i.e., these were Index parameters when building the index). This results in a connection to the index.","Next, selecting the cell again (e.g., double clicking on the Rank1 deviation value (cell F3 in FIG. A), displays a link dialog window.  is a link dialog window  that shows a link to a subject multi-dimensional database. When the connection to the index is established, the invention displays the dialog window  that shows a link to the subject multi-dimensional database. If additional information was provided in an LRO, the dialog window will show that, too. For example, a Linked Partition  can be selected to link to a subject multi-dimensional database or a Cell Note  can be selected to access an Explanation of the Deviation. If the Cell Note  is selected, a View Cell Note dialog window is displayed.  illustrates a View Cell Note dialog window  that enables a user to view an Explanation of the Deviation. The dialog window  displays a Member Combination  and a Cell Note .","If the analyst selects the link to the subject multi-dimensional database (e.g., by selecting the Linked Partition  and selecting a View\/Launch button), the invention opens a new spreadsheet with a query showing the point in the subject multi-dimensional database at which the feature was found.  is a spreadsheet  that illustrates a point in a subject multi-dimensional database. In particular, the value of 210 for the Actual member of the Scenario dimension  is shown for January sales of product \u201c100-10\u201d in Florida.","Next, the analyst uses the OLAP spreadsheet add-ins (e.g., zoom and pivot functions) to see the feature in a meaningful context. To see the deviation in context, the analyst can drill up and then drill down in one or more dimensions in order to view the deviation in a larger context.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0117"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["1700","1702","1704","1706","1708","1710"]},"This concludes the description of one embodiment of the invention. The following describes some alternative embodiments for accomplishing the present invention. For example, any type of computer, such as a mainframe, minicomputer, or personal computer, or computer configuration, such as a timesharing mainframe, local area network, or standalone personal computer, could be used with the present invention.","One alternative embodiment is to extend the subject multi-dimensional database with an extra dimension or extra measures to carry the results of the deviation detection. This embodiment would provide additional calculation functions and modification of the existing subject multi-dimensional database. Additionally, the embodiment would provide spreadsheet add-ins to support navigation and visualization of the results in the subject multi-dimensional database.","Yet another alternative embodiment is to write the results of the deviation detection as a report. This would not require modifications of an existing subject multi-dimensional database or additional functions.","A further embodiment uses linked reporting objects to flag cells of interest. This does not require modifications of an existing subject multi-dimensional database or additional functions. The linked reporting objects could store explanations, and the linked reporting objects on the top level member of the multi-dimensional database could store summary information for the deviation detection run, the parameters, and the results. The linked reporting objects would be dropped if an outline change took place. Additionally, the linked reporting objects would not use a rank ordering system.","The foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description.
