title: MEMS capacitive cantilever strain sensor, devices, and formation methods
abstract: An embodiment of the invention provides a MEMS cantilever strain sensor. Capacitor plates in a MEMS device of the invention are carried on cantilevered opposing micro-scale plates separated by a micro-scale gap under an unstrained condition. At least one of the micro-scale plates may be attached to a substrate or forms a substrate, which may be part of a monitored system. When a load is applied to the substrate, distal ends of the opposing cantilevered micro-scale plates become further separated, resulting in a change of capacitance. The change of capacitance is proportional to a load and therefore is an indication of the strain. Electrodes may be integrated into the strain sensor to provide a connection to measurement circuitry, for example. Sensors of the invention also provide for telemetric communication using radio frequency (RF) energy and can be interrogated without a power supply to the sensor.

The government has certain rights in this invention.","A field of the invention is sensing. Another field of the invention is MEMS (micro electro mechanical systems).","Sensors play an important role in a wide variety of devices as sensors can provide critical information concerning the status, operational conditions, performance, wear, safety, and countless other conditions. Strain sensors provide information about a load. Strain sensing can be useful as feedback in complex control systems, for example, in vehicles, roads, buildings, tools, and electronic systems, as only a few examples. Strain sensors also have a wide variety of applications in the safety systems. Load distributions provide information about the forces within a mechanical structure, including bending and twisting, that can be communicated to a monitoring device and provide warnings or historical performance information concerning the safety of a mechanical component to which a strain sensor is attached. Additionally, a strain sensor may be incorporated into an electronic control system that limits some form of operation or applies a corrective load when dangerous conditions are detected by a strain sensor. Limitations of conventional strain sensors include the power consumption needs of the strain sensors, the manner in which the strain sensors may be connected into other systems, and the size of the strain sensors.","An embodiment of the invention provides a MEMS cantilever strain sensor. Capacitor plates in a MEMS device of the invention are carried on cantilevered opposing micro-scale plates separated by a micro-scale gap under an unstrained condition. At least one of the micro-scale plates may be attached to a substrate or forms a substrate, which may be part of a monitored system. When a load is applied to the substrate, distal ends of the opposing cantilevered micro-scale plates become further separated, resulting in a change of capacitance. The change of capacitance is proportional to a load and therefore is an indication of the strain. Electrodes may be integrated into the strain sensor to provide a connection to measurement circuitry, for example. Sensors of the invention also provide for telemetric communication using radio frequency (RF) energy and can be interrogated without a power supply to the sensor. In other embodiments, power is supplied directly to a strain sensor of the invention and control circuitry, such as through a battery. Strain sensors of the invention may be packaged in any number of physical packages, such as glass, plastic, and including biologically compatible packages. Sensors of the invention provide highly compact, MEMS scale, and very low power strain sensor devices. A particular exemplary device including a strain sensor of the invention is a spinal fusion system including a strain sensor. The invention also includes fabrication methods for production of strain sensors of the invention.","The invention provides a MEMS capacitive cantilever strain sensor. A sensor of the invention may monitor the mechanical strain of a member to which the sensor is attached, or a member to be monitored can comprise the substrate of a sensor of the invention. The value of capacitance between the opposing cantilever micro-scale plates of the invention varies under load conditions. A variable capacitor is thus produced whose capacitance depends on the load supplied. Devices of the invention may be formed from a variety of materials, including semi-conductor materials, glass, and plastics. Any dielectric material or a material that can be treated to have dielectric qualities and that can be fabricated by MEMS processing techniques can be used as the basis for the cantilever structure in a MEMS strain sensor of the invention, so long as a conductive material can be formed on the opposing surfaces of the dielectric opposing cantilever micro-scale plates.","Exemplary MEMS cantilever strain sensors of the invention interface with circuits through an electrode connection, which might also form part of the inner connection pattern for a circuit into which the MEMS cantilever strain sensor of the invention is incorporated. MEMS strain sensors in exemplary embodiments of the invention can provide high gauge factors, for example, between 250 and 1000, far exceeding the gauge factors of conventional metal foil and piezoresistive strain sensors. Also, because capacitance is relied upon for sensing an amount of strain, devices of the invention are particularly well-suited for low power applications, including those using battery power sources. In addition, devices of the invention may be interrogated via RF energy, and devices of the invention are implantable in both inanimate and biologic hosts. Artisans will appreciate an even wider variety of application for MEMS cantilever strain sensors of the invention, as the above provides mere outline of some particular preferred example applications.","Artisans will appreciate additional features and applications of the invention from reading the following description of some preferred embodiments with reference to the attached drawings. The attached drawings are not to scale, and no proportions may be assumed in the attached drawings. Features may be exaggerated for purpose of illustration, and the schematic views presented in the drawings will be understood by artisans as such views are commonly used in the art. Micro-scale, as used herein, refers general to the dimensions achieved by microfabrication processes well-known to artisans in the MEMS community.","Referring now to , an exemplary embodiment MEMS cantilever strain sensor  is shown. The strain sensor  includes opposing cantilever micro-scale plates , . The cantilevered micro-scale plates ,  are bonded together or formed from a common unitary structure connected at a cantilever end  and are separated by a gap  at a distal end .

Leads ,  connect the conductive material on the opposing surfaces ,  to electrodes , .","In , the MEMS cantilever strain sensor  is under a condition of no loading, i.e., loads Lthrough Lare equal to zero. Under zero load, the gap  creates a separation Dbetween the distal end  of the opposing micro-scale plates , . When loading is applied as shown in , the gap  at the distal end  increases to a distance D+D(x). At the distal end  there is a mechanical amplification effect of the bending strain applied uniformly across the plate . The plate  may be fixed to a member that provides the load forces Lthrough Lunder particular conditions or the plate  may be part of a member that undergoes load forces Lthrough Lunder particular conditions. The capacitance is a function of the distance D+D(x), and the surface area determined by the length and the width Wof the conductive material formed on the opposing surfaces , .","As is known in the MEMS industry, MEMS devices may be integrated on a substrate along with electronics.  shows an exemplary schematic wherein a sensor  is connected to interrogation electronics  through a direct electrical connection, which may be a circuit interconnect pattern, electrodes, wire bond pads, etc. Additionally, because of the capacitive nature of the sensing, with integrated RF telemetry circuitry , in a suitable package, electronics with RF capability  may interrogate the sensor  in a battery-free inquiry similar to the manner in which radio frequency identification (RFID) inquires are made to RFID devices.","An example fabrication method is shown in . In , an exemplary fabrication process will be described wherein the separate opposing micro-scale plates of an example MEMS cantilever strain sensor are formed from different materials such as might be used in a packaging of the MEMS cantilever strain sensor. It is possible, of course, to form the opposing micro-scale plates from the same material. It is also possible, to form a generally unitary structure by multiple deposit steps and the formation and release of a sacrificial layer in the gap of the sensor.  show a substrate .  is a side view and  is a top view.

The deposition of metal may be, for example, sputter deposition.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIGS. 2E and 2F","FIGS. 2G and 2H","FIG. 2G"],"b":["56","56","58"]},"A material removal process, e.g., etching, forms a patterned plane  below the level of a mesa  on the second substrate . The different level of the mesa  and the plane  will provide the capacitive gap between micro-scale plates of the MEMS strain sensor. The shape of the plane  is best seen in the top view of , while the depth of the plane  is represented in . The depth of the plane  leaves sufficient dielectric  to provide electrical insulation from a second capacitor plate  that is formed by a metal deposit as shown in . The metal deposit also results in a lead  and contact pad , the contact pad  extending onto the mesa  above the level of the plane  so that the contact pad  may make contact with the lead  that is formed on the substrate  as a result of the bonding depicted in .","While a single structure is described as being formed, in practice the steps will be carried out on a large scale using two substrates having the above processes carried out on different areas of the substrates.

These procedures also have significant expense associated with them. The strain sensor  and circuit  provide an alternate approach for monitoring the spinal fusion process. After implantation into a patient's body, the load on the rod  is gradually transferred to the bone as the bone graft heals, resulting in a decrease of the load on the rod  over time. The capacitance of the sensor  will therefore change as the gap narrows between opposing capacitor micro-scale plates. The circuit  may comprise sensing circuitry, telemetry circuitry, and an antenna, and the amount of strain therefore may be interrogated using an inductively coupled battery-free method similar to radio frequency identification. Exemplary gaps in the approximate range of 3 to approximately 10 micrometers have been modeled to provide sensitivity to a 1,000 micro strain, which can be interrogated by a low power capacitance to frequency converter in the circuit  that may be interrogated by a powered reader that subjects the circuit  to RF frequencies. Successful results have been achieved in cadaver testing.","While various embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it should be understood that other modifications, substitutions and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.
