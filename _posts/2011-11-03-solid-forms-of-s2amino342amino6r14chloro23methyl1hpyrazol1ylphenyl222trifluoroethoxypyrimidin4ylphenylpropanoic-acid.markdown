{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application No. 61\/410,421, filed Nov. 5, 2010, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention relates to solid forms of (S)-2-amino-3-(4-(2-amino-6-((R)-1-(4-chloro-2-(3-methyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)phenyl)-2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)pyrimidin-4-yl)phenyl)propanoic acid and salts thereof, compositions comprising them, and methods of their use.","Different solid forms of the same compound can have substantially different properties. For example, the amorphous form of a drug may exhibit different dissolution characteristics and different bioavailability patterns than its crystalline form(s), properties which can affect how the drug must be administered to achieve optimal effect. Amorphous and crystalline forms of a drug may also have different handling properties (e.g., flowability, compressibility), dissolution rates, solubilities and stabilities, all of which can affect the manufacture of dosage forms. Consequently, access to multiple forms of a drug is desirable for a variety of reasons. Moreover, regulatory authorities (e.g., the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) may require the identification of all solid forms of a new drug substance before approving products containing it. A. Goho, 166(8):122-123 (2004).","Compounds may exist in one or more crystalline forms, but the existence and characteristics of those forms cannot be predicted with any certainty. And even after one polymorph has been identified, the existence and characteristics of other forms can only be determined by additional experimentation.

Methods of Treatment","This invention encompasses a method of inhibiting tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), which comprises contacting TPH with a compound of the invention (i.e., a compound disclosed herein).","This invention encompasses methods of treating, preventing, and managing various diseases and disorders mediated by peripheral serotonin, which comprise inhibiting TPH (e.g., the TPH1 isoform) activity in a patient in need of such treatment, prevention or management.","Particular diseases and disorders include carcinoid syndrome and gastrointestinal diseases and disorders. Examples of specific diseases and disorders include abdominal pain (e.g., associated with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid), anxiety, carcinoid syndrome, celiac disease, constipation (e.g., constipation having an iatrogenic cause, and idiopathic constipation), depression, diabetes, diarrhea (e.g., bile acid diarrhea, enterotoxin-induced secretory diarrhea, diarrhea having an iatrogenic cause, idiopathic diarrhea (e.g., idiopathic secretory diarrhea), and traveler's diarrhea), emesis, functional abdominal pain, functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel disease (IBD, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), lactose intolerance, MEN types I and II, Ogilvie's syndrome, Pancreatic Cholera Syndrome, pancreatic insufficiency, pheochromacytoma, scleroderma, somatization disorder, and Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome.","Other diseases and disorders include cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases and disorders, such as acute and chronic hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary embolism (e.g., bronchoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension following pulmonary embolism), pulmonary hypertension (e.g., pulmonary hypertension associated with portal hypertension), and radiation pneumonitis (including that giving rise to or contributing to pulmonary hypertension).

Still others include functional anorectal disorders, functional bloating, and functional gallbladder and sphincter of Oddi disorders.","5.4. Pharmaceutical Compositions","This invention encompasses pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising solid form of the invention. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of this invention may optionally contain one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients. Certain pharmaceutical compositions are single unit dosage forms suitable for oral, topical, mucosal (e.g., nasal, pulmonary, sublingual, vaginal, buccal, or rectal), parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intravenous, bolus injection, intramuscular, or intraarterial), or transdermal administration to a patient. Examples of dosage forms include, but are not limited to: tablets; caplets; capsules, such as soft elastic gelatin capsules; cachets; troches; lozenges; dispersions; suppositories; ointments; cataplasms (poultices); pastes; powders; dressings; creams; plasters; solutions; patches; aerosols (e.g., nasal sprays or inhalers); gels; liquid dosage forms suitable for oral or mucosal administration to a patient, including suspensions (e.g., aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspensions, oil-in-water emulsions, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsions), solutions, and elixirs; liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient; and sterile solids (e.g., crystalline or amorphous solids) that can be reconstituted to provide liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient.","The formulation should suit the mode of administration. For example, oral administration may require enteric coatings to protect the active ingredient from degradation within the gastrointestinal tract. In another example, the active ingredient may be administered in a liposomal formulation to shield it from degradative enzymes, facilitate transport in circulatory system, and\/or effect delivery across cell membranes to intracellular sites.","The composition, shape, and type of dosage forms of the invention will typically vary depending on their use. For example, a dosage form used in the acute treatment of a disease may contain larger amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than a dosage form used in the chronic treatment of the same disease. Similarly, a parenteral dosage form may contain smaller amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than an oral dosage form used to treat the same disease. These and other ways in which specific dosage forms encompassed by this invention will vary from one another will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.
