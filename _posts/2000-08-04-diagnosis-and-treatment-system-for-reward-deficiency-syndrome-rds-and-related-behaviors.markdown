All products in the SynerGene line provide high quality nutrients consisting of amino acids, trace minerals, vitamins, minerals, and herbals. When combined into numerous blends they have demonstrable therapeutic health benefits. The uniqueness of this particular line is that each product is specifically formulated to achieve synergistic activity from the active ingredient which has been shown by specific studies as well as functional combinations which have not been previously available. The products are backed up by double blind, placebo, controlled open label research studies on humans as well as other rigorous studies (including both human and animal studies) and extensive anecdotal reports.","Another aspect contributing to the uniqueness of the SynerGene products is the fact that the origin of action of all the products is in the central nervous system. Some of the products ultimately affect the peripheral nervous system and some of them ultimately affect the central nervous system. However, all are formulated to affect the health of the central and peripheral nervous system.","The Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) results from a dysfunction in the Brain Reward Cascade which directly links abnormal craving behavior with a deficit in the DRD2 Dopamine Receptor Gene. Dopamine is a very powerful neurotransmitter in the brain which controls feelings of well being. This sense of well being is produced through the interaction of dopamine and neurotransmitters such as serotonin, the opioids, and other powerful brain chemicals. Low serotonin levels are associated with depression. High levels of the opioids (the brain's opium) are associated with a sense of well being. The complex interactions of these powerful neurotransmitters ultimately regulating the Dopaminergic Activity in the Reward Center of the Brain has been termed \u201cThe Brain Reward Cascade\u201d.","In individuals possessing an abnormality in the DRD2 Dopamine Receptor Gene, the brain lacks enough Dopamine receptor sites to use the normal amount of Dopamine in the Reward Center of the brain and thus reduces the amount of Dopamine produced in this area of the brain. In individuals not possessing the variant in the Dopamine Receptor Gene who lived certain lifestyles (heavy cocaine abuse, extremely low caloric diet, high levels of stress over an extend ed period of time, etc.) their brains function as if the persons have the DRD2 genetic variant.","Nutraceuticals are nutritional supplements which have been shown to affect the peripheral by nervous system or other systems of the body. These include products for symptoms such as pain, inflammation, cardiovascular disorders, immune system responses, etc. Neutraceuticals are also nutritional supplements which have been shown to affect the central nervous system of the body. These products are for disorders such as addictions to alcohol, cocaine, nicotine, carbohydrates, sex, gambling, etc. and disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette Disorder, personality disorders, depression, premenstrual syndrome, premenstrual dysphoria disorder, etc.","The overall effect is inadequate Dopaminergic Activity in the Reward Center of the Brain. This defect drives individuals to engage in activities which will increase brain Dopamine function. Consuming large quantities of alcohol or carbohydrates (carbohydrate binging) stimulate the brain's production of and utilization of Dopamine. So too does the intake of crack\/cocaine and the abuse of nicotine. Also, it has been found that the genetic abnormality is associated with aggressive behavior which also stimulates the brain's use of Dopamine.","The Reward Deficiency Syndrome involves a form of sensory deprivation of the brain's reward or pleasure mechanisms. The Reward Deficiency Syndrome can be manifested in relatively mild or severe forms that follow as a consequence of an individual's biochemical inability to derive reward from ordinary, everyday activities. We believe that we have discovered at least one genetic aberration that leads to an alteration in the reward pathways of the brain. It is a variant form of the gene for the dopamine D2 receptor, called the A1 allele. This genetic variant also is associated with a spectrum of impulsive, compulsive, and addictive behaviors. The concept of the Reward Deficiency Syndrome unites those disorders and may explain how simple genetic anomalies give rise to complex aberrant behavior.","The pleasure and reward system in the brain was discovered by accident in 1954. The American psychologist James Olds was studying the rat brain's alerting process, when he mistakenly placed the electrodes in a part of the limbic system, a group of structures deep within the brain that are generally believed to play a role in emotions (Olds, 1995). When the brain was wired so that the animal could stimulate this area by pressing a level, Olds found that the rats would press the lever almost nonstop, as much as 5,000 times an hour. The animals would stimulate themselves to the exclusion of everything else except sleep. They would even endure tremendous pain and hardship for an opportunity to press the lever. Olds had clearly found an area in the limbic system that provided a powerful reward for these animals. Research on human subjects revealed that the electrical stimulation of some areas of the brain (medial hypothalamus, which is in the limbic system) produced a feeling of quasi-orgasmic sexual arousal. If certain other areas of the brain were stimulated, an individual experienced a type of light-headedness that banished negative thoughts. These discoveries demonstrated that pleasure is a distinct neurological function that is linked to a complex reward and reinforcement system (Hall, eta!. 1977).","During the past several decades research has been able to establish some of the brain regions and neurotransmitters involved in reward. A neuronal circuit deep in the brain involving the limbic system and two regions called the nucleus accumbens and the appears to be critical in the expression of reward for people (Wise and Bozarth, 1984). Although each substance of abuse (listed above) and each activity of abuse (listed above) appears to act on different parts of this circuit, the end result is the same.","Dopamine is released in the nucleus accumbens and the hippocampus (Koob and Bloom, 1988). Dopamine appears to be the primary neurotransmitter of reward at the reinforcement sites. It is useful to think of the brain's reward system as a cascade in which one reaction triggers another. At the level of individual neurons, the Brain Reward Cascade (Blum and Kozlowski, 1990) is catalyzed by a number of neurotransmitters. Each neurotransmitter binds to certain types of receptors and serves a specific function. The binding of the neurotransmitter to a receptor on a neuron triggers a reaction that is part of the cascade. Disruption of these intercellular cascades results in one form or another of the Reward Deficiency Syndrome.","During the past decades, considerable attention has been devoted to the investigation of the neurochemical and neuroanatomical systems that underlie a variety of substance seeking behaviors. In a normal person, neurotransmitters (the messengers of the brain) work together in a pattern of stimulation or inhibition, the effects spreading downward from complex stimuli to complex patterns of response like a cascade, leading to feelings of well being, which is the ultimate reward (Cascade Theory of Reward) (Cloninger, 1983; Stein and Belluzzi, 1986; Blum and Koslowski, 1990).","In the reward areas, the following interactions take place (Stein and Belluzzi, 1986; Blum, 1989):\n\n","4. an alternate pathway involves norepinephrinein the locus of ceruleus whose fibers project into the hippocampus at a reward area centering around cluster cells which have not been precisely identified, but which have been designated a CAx. When GABA A receptors in the hippocampus are stimulated, they cause the release of norepinephrine at the CAx site.","It is to be noted that the glucose receptor (GR) in the hypothalamus is intricately involved and \u201clinks\u201d the serotonergic system with opioid peptides leading to the ultimate release of dopamine at the n. accumbens.","In the Brain Reward Cascade (Blum and Kozlowski, 1990), these interactions may be viewed as activities of subsystems of a larger system, taking place simultaneously or in sequence, merging in cascade fashion toward anxiety, anger, low self-esteem, or other bad feelings or toward craving or a substance that will make these bad feelings go away, for example alcohol, carbohydrates, etc. Genetic anomalies, long-term continuing stress, or long-term abuse of substances can lead to a self-sustaining pattern of abnormal craving behavior in both animals and humans. Animal model support for the cascade theory can be derived from a series of experiments carried out by T. K. Li et. al., (Russell, Lanin, and Taljaard, 1988; McBride, 1990; Zhou, 1990; McBride, et. al. 1993) upon their alcohol-preferring (P) and non-preferring (NP) rat lines. They found that the P rats have the following neurochemical profile:\n\n","This suggests a four-part cascade sequence leading to a reduction of net dopamine release in a key reward area. This was further confirmed when they found that by administering substances that increase the serotonin supply at the synapse, or by stimulating dopamine D 2 receptors directly, they could reduce craving for alcohol (McBride et al. 1994). Specifically, D2 receptor agonists reduce alcohol intake in high alcohol preferring rats whereas D2 dopamine receptors antagonists increase alcohol drinking in these inbred animal s (Dyr, et al. 1993). Human support for the Brain Reward Cascade also can be derived from a series of clinical trials with neuronutrients (precursor amino acid loading technique and enkephalinase inhibition) indicating reduced craving, reduced stress rates, facilitated recovery and reduced relapse rates (Brown et al. 1990; 1988; Blum et al. 1989).","Most recently, the notion of dopamine as the final common pathways for a number of diverse drugs of abuse such as cocaine, morphine, and alcohol is supported by Ortiz and associates at Yale University School of Medicine and University of Connecticut Health Services Center demonstrating that chronic treatment of either cocaine, morphine, or alcohol similarly results in several biochemical adaptations in the meso-limbic dopamine system, which may underlie prominent changes in the structural and functional properties of the neuronal pathways related to the above (Also see Routtenberg, DiChiara, and Inperato, 1988). We propose that the Reward Deficiency Syndrome gives rise to a wide range of disorders that can be classified as impulsive-addictive-compulsive disorders. Impulsive disorders include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Tourette's Disorder. Addictive disorders include substance-seeking behaviors involving alcohol, drugs, nicotine, and food. Compulsive diseases include pathological gambling and excessive sexual activity.","CyberPharm, Incorporated through an intellectual property license from 1899 LLC controls the following related art with the specified limitations:","Anti-Inflammatory, Analgesics","1.

The basic concept of this important category resides in the understanding that impulsive-compulsive-addictive behaviors constitute a very significant proportion of the world population. In the United States alone there are 28 million adult children of alcoholics, twenty-two million a alcoholics, fifty-four million smokers, ninety-two million overeaters\/obese, ten million cocaine dependent persons, five to eight million young children with attention deficit-hyperactivity (ADSD), over three million pathological gamblers and millions of sex addicts. Over the last three decades our understanding of this grave societal dilemma has grown and today in the 90's we are in the decade of the brain. Certainly, even more rapid advances will come before the millennium. While the basic pharmacology, biochemistry, neurochemistry, toxicology, and pharmacogenetics of abusable drugs have not changed much over the years, the psycho-biology and molecular genetic aspects of a new discipline known as Addiction Medicine (supported by the American Medical association), have significantly increased with better understanding of the meaning of the addiction process in general.","One important outcome of the basic understanding of addiction medicine is \u201cReward Deficiency Syndrome\u201d. In this term scientists embrace the fact that addictive impulsive compulsive behaviors including alcoholism, attention deficit disorder, drug abuse, smoking behavior and food binging\u2014may have a common genetic root. The SynerGene NutraLife neutraceuticals were designed to address this dilemma. The inventor foresees the possibility for promoting a healthier life-style change in those victims carrying the genetic predisposition to related \u201creward seeking\u201d behaviors.","Scientific evidence reveals the healing powers of botanicals, herbals and amino-acids. These natural substances have been associated with stress reduction, anti-hypertension, enhancement of mood, improve d immune response, stimulation of sexual performance, increased focus and cognition, reduced carbohydrate binging, and anti-craving action. Herbs and phyto-medicines are experiencing explosive growth in pharmacies and other mass-market retail outlets. An estimated 30 percent of American adults (60 million persons) are reported to be using herbs and phyto-medicinal products, spending an estimated $ 3.24 billion in 1996 and much more in the years to follow. An excellent example of the mainstream acceptance of well-researched herbs and phyto-medicines can be seen in a huge increase in sales of St. John's Wort, Ginko, Ginsing, Garlic, Echinacia and Saw Palmetto. Granting herbs some legal protection as dietary supplements in the United States, was clarified in the report from the senate committee on Labor and Human Resources that accompanied Senate Bill 784, the HatchHarkin bill, eventually passed and became the DSHEA.","The natural healing powers of many herbals and botanicals have been known for thousands of years, and even more profound is the understanding that brain endogenous mechanisms seed natural healing processes leading to well being. Therefore, combining nature's photo-medicines and amino-acid precursors to alter brain chemistry (affect on the mind), contributes to a powerful healing approach.","The SynerGene NutraLife Essentials meet established standards for purity and all products are subject to testing through rigorous quality-control methods.","Nutraceuticals are the category the products address peripheral disorder that are still influenced by the brain but the products are a combination of specific herbals and natural patented substances having very specific uses which have end actions on organs controlled by the peripheral nervous system. For example, the uses of D-amino acids such as d-phenylalanine have analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions as well as the use of water extracts of gandermalucidum as an anti-inflammatory. Another example of CyberPharm nutraceutical products involves the anti-hypertensive properties of enkephalinase inhibitors including d-phenylalanine. In the area of immune enhancement, CyberPharm has products involving the combination of zinc-dlphenylalanine and herbals which promote a positive immune response. The products in this category include PRoFLEx, CARDIOPLEX, and MuNoPRo (See the Intellectual Property Section above for amore detailed description of the science and technology behind these products). The Neutraceutical Product, KRAVEX, consists of amino-acid precursor amines, natural enkephalinase inhibitors, minerals, vitamins trace metals, and herbals. The product is designed to promote normal physiological drive especially in individuals prone to addictive behavior of the depressant kind. Based on a number of clinical trials (See Table 4), the KRAVEX essential is designed to affect abnormal cravings for depressant type abusable substances such as alcohol, barbiturates and benzodiazepine anti-anxiety agents.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0070"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","orient":"land"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"595pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 4"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"SUMMARY OF COMPLETED CLINICAL STUDIES WITH 1899 L.L.C.

In general, since deficits have been found in brain chemical functions underlying craving behavior, and since these deficits may be alleviated by facilitated dopamine release consequent to the use of drugs such as alcohol, combining amino-acid precursors and enkephalinase inhibition may simulate the brain's reward system and compensate for neurotransmitter imbalance (thereby attenuating craving behavior). In an attempt to understand that depressant-drug abuse seeking behavior (craving), is a subset of generalized craving behavior (Reward Deficiency Syndrome), due in part to low dopamine function (an impaired reward cascade), scientists believe individuals self-heal through biochemical attempts to alleviate the low dopaminergic brain activity via drug (alcohol)-reward site interaction.

The road to stop smoking is not simply a matter of \u201cjust saying no\u201d. Similar to other addictive substances (i.e. alcohol, cocaine, glucose etc.), the most successful approach is to bring about a life-style change. The SMART approach to quitting corrects nutritional deficits and emphasizes improved nutritional intake, exercise and behaviors that will help the smoker become smoke-free. As a smoker, the body constantly is being robbed of vital nutrients. Moreover, the 54 million smokers are not only placing their bodies under the influence of stress-inducing substances like nicotine, but may indeed be more genetically prone to overreact toward stressful events. This is based on a number of reports linking one variant of the dopamine D2 receptor gene to smoking behavior. This same variant has been linked to alcoholism, carbohydrate binging, cocaine dependence, pathological gambling and an inability to cope with stress. In this regard, nicotine is known to release dopamine from neurons in the brain reward site and this effect is paramount to its addictive qualities. Scientists believe that nicotine dependent persons, self-heal through biochemical attempts to alleviate the low dopaminergic brain activity via nicotine\u2014reward site interaction. Stress is an inescapable element in life which can negatively impact your health and is linked to many disorders such as substance abuse, cancer, cardiovascular disorders, headaches, ulcers, weakened immune response as well as other health problems. It is noteworthy, that abuse of nicotine via smoking is linked to stress and smoking behavior leads to poor nutrition.

precursor monoamines, natural enkephalinase inhibitors, minerals, vitamins, trace metals, and herbals. The product is designed to promote normal physiologic drive especially in individuals prone to Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMD b). a premenstrual mood disorder that recurs cyclically during the majority of menstrual cycles.","While there is a paucity of research with regard to PMX in contrast there are number of clinical trials with regards to the neutraceutical and \u201cReward Deficiency Syndrome\u201d and related behaviors (See Table 4). It is noteworthy, a former product known as SAAVE, in which over 100,000 female alcoholics used to reduce craving, many reported attenuation of PMDD symptoms. The scientific basis for this effect resides in the affect PMX will have on the brain's \u201cBrain Reward Cascade\u201d. The four pathways involved include Serotonergic, Opioidergic (endorphins), GABAergic and Adrenergic. In women with severe premenstrual dysphoria it was found that compared with asymptomatic controls, symptomatic women have lower levels of serotonin. It also has been found that during the luteal phase platelet serotonin uptake is decreased with PMDD as compared to controls. In addition, depleting the serotonin precursor tryptophan is significantly more likely to provoke premenstrual symptoms during both luteal and follicular phases in PMDD patients compared to asymptomatic women. In four studies it was found that lower luteal phase Beta-endorphin levels in symptomatic patients compared with controls. More over, during the premenstrual period, levels of both endorphin and estrogen change rapidly and there are reports that narcotic antagonists reduce PMDD symptoms. Others have found decreases in plasma gamma-aminobutyric acid levels during the luteal phase in women with PMDD symptoms. Recently, it was found that plasma methionine-enkephalin and a decrease in plasma norepinephrine levels on day 22 in menstrual migraine group and an increase in plasma methionine, norepinephrine during pain. Moreover, while the above biological evidence does not definitively implicate any single, neurobiological system, changes in serotonin levels, endorphinergic activity, GABA levels and adrenergic binding activity, suggest neurobiological abnormalities associated with an impaired \u201cBrain Reward Cascade\u201d and subsequent expression of PMD. Because there is no single-neurotransmitter involved but instead it is a multi-neurotransmitter phenomenon, proper nourishment is essential for the health of brain function to reduce PMDD expression.","PMX is a unique, scientifically advanced product that provides a multi-nutritional approach to normal brain function. The product supplies your body with a patented blend of amino-acids to mimic the reward cascade providing proper balance, chromium salts to enhance penetration of select precursoramino-acid (tryptophan to assist in the synthesis of serotonin), minerals, vitamins, riboflavin and folic acid to act as co-factors for the production of neurotransmitters, certain natural patented pain killers-d-phenylalanine (See U.S. Pat.

In fact, in young adult healthy volunteers the SMART Blend amino-acid composition enhanced visual attention tasks, spacial orientation, contingent continuous performance and P300 wave magnitude and latency. In terms of cognition, it is well known that brain electrical activity analysis has revealed the existence of subtle neurological change in a wide variety of disorders including depressions, criminal pathology, Alzheimers, auto-immune-deficiency syndrome (AIDS), drug addictions and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). With regard to the latter, a study in the early 70's showed that a major ingredient in PROCOG, dl-phenylalanine, a natural enhancer of opioid peptides (endorphins), by preventing the breakdown of these biologically active peptides, increased the mood and reduced anxiety in subjects diagnosed with ADHD.","Our brain is an intricate organ that controls every thought, every move and every gesture we make moment by moment. In order to carry out these complex functions the brain depends on oxygen. Oxygen is vital for nerve cells to properly transmit chemical messengers. It is noteworthy, that experiments in swine, provide evidence that the natural opioid methionine-enkephalin when administered to the swine resulted in enhancement of blood flow in specific brain sites especially in the basal ganglia, frontal cortex, and hippocampus, important reinforcement and memory sites. It is logical that increases of the neurotransmitter enkephalin, by inhibition of the enzyme enkephalinase, would augment brain oxygenation via increased blood flow.","It also is important to point out that cognition is associated with the chemical messenger dopamine.

Since the precursors for synthesizing the amines are dependent upon dietary intake, it is possible that dietary supplements can alter available biogenic amine stores in the brain. This has led to various clinical strategies that target nutritional improvement of the brain's chemistry for enhancing memory and focus. Defects in dopamine metabolism have long been implicated in attentional processing (short-term memory) as well as ADHD. There are specific reasons for this relationship: studies in rodents show that destruction of dopaminergic brain nerve cells results in hyperactivity and, poor response to stress; studies in rodents showing that the chemical destruction of frontal lobe dopaminergic neurons shortly after birth produces an animal model of ADHD that responds to stimulants; an association of low levels of dopamine metabolites in children with ADHD; brain imaging studies show deficits of dopaminein ADHD subjects; hyperactivity is produced in mice when dopaminergic genes (dopamine transporter and dopamine D3 receptor genes) are knocked out; and, effectiveness of drugs which mimic dopamine in the treatment of poor cognition including ADHD.","The brain is one of the most active body tissues. Although it constitutes only about five percent of body weight and it consumes 20 percent of the available oxygen, it is indeed the master organ. PRoCoG is formulated to maintain healthy levels of oxygen and blood flow as well as enhancing well being.

PROFLEX helps provide temporary relief of minor pains from arthritis.","While there is a paucity of research with regard to PROFLEX specifically, there are numerous animal and clinical reports regarding the pain killing and anti-inflammatory properties of certain d-amino acids such as d-phenylalanine. The amino acid, d-phenylalanine, is a natural inhibitor of opioid peptides (i.e. enkephalins, endorphins, and dynorphins) in both animals and humans. D-phenylalanine has been shown to enhance the analgesic effects of acupuncture. In double-blind studies the compound has induced analgesia in patients reactive to approved analgesic drugs including opiates. In cross-over studies in humans D-phenylalanine reduced pain associated with osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of the D-amino acids appears to involve the prostaglandins via an opioid peptide interaction. The product also includes extract which has been shown to have a number of biological actions. In mice the water extract of was found to be a potent anti-inflammatory agent. An extracted and characterized compound was as active as hydrocortisone without the typical side effects (thymic involution and gastropathy).","Since the anti-inflammatory effect observed in mice worked in both the carrageenan and croton oil experiments, indicates that the mushroom based compound may have multiple mechanisms. CyberPharm's scientists believe the combination of d-phenylalanine with could have powerful synergistic actions. The combination of d-phenylalanine and a number of non-steroidal substances like aspirin are synergistic in animal carrageenan experiments. A benefit of this essential is the addition of glucosamine, a substance known to act as a building block of the proteoglycons, an essential constituent of collagen, which gives cartilage its cushioning property. It has been suggested that glucosamine is require d to make the material that binds water in the cartilage matrix.","The product supplies your body with patented natural pain killers having anti-inflammatory properties such as DL-phenylalanine and an extract of the mushroom , as well as white willow bark a natural, aspirin-like form of salicin.

It is well known that as our bodies age, connective tissue and cartilage needs important nutrients to maintain vitality. It is also well known that in seniors the ability to produce some of these nutrients necessary for cartilage building declines. Proper nutrients safe guard against inflammation of all the 143 different joints in the human body such as hands, feet, fingers, wrists, elbows, neck, shoulders, knee, back, hip, and ankles. The patented PROFLEX-SYNERGY-SYSTEM is the most natural scientifically advanced product that provides a nutritional approach to both reduction of pain and inflammation through its DL-Phenylalanine (See U.S. Pat. No. 4,730,007) and its natural (1899 LLC and the University of Texas System) extract of ganodermalucidum, which has been shown to be a very potent anti-inflammatory agent. Using gas chromatography and mass spectral analysis along with NMR and X-ray techniques two isomers were identified out of several hundred triterpines in the mushroom, both having significant anti-inflammatory properties.

The product is designed to promote healthy cardiovascular function and normal blood pressure.","To date, there are no clinical trials on CARDIOPLEX per se, but certain ingredients have been tested in both animals and humans. There are a number of classes of drugs which currently are in use to treat hypertension. These consist of the following: drugs which modify the adrenergic part of the autonomic nervous system; drugs which dilate blood vessels; diuretics, drugs that inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme; drugs that block calcium channels; and, drugs that block angiotensin receptors. With this in mind, the inventor has CyberPharm's scientists have discovered a natural anti-hypertensive substance which by itself lowers blood pressure in hypertensive individuals without causing blood pressure lowering in normals. A provisional patent was filed on Jan. 12, 1999 entitled Hypertensive Agents Including Inhibitors of the Breakdown of Enkephalins and\/or Endorphins and Combinations of SAID, Anti-Hypertensive Agents with other AntiHypertensive Drugs and Natural Substances. The enkephalins and endorphins are peptides which are present in blood and in the central nervous system. Although their main function appears to be control of the pain response, they have other important actions including lowering blood pressure in some animal species, but these compounds have many drawbacks when administered.","Ehrenpreis discovered the natural enkephalinase inhibitor d-phenylalanine is highly effective in lowering blood pressure in animals and in man and is the major ingredient of CARDIOPLEX. In this regard, our scientists found that D-phenylalanine significantly lowered both systolic and diastolic blood pressure with no change in heart rate in genetically bred spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). D-Phenylalanine was able to lower systolic blood pressure of these rats close to normal (average drop of 36.7 mm Hg). It is noteworthy that this effect is blocked by the narcotic antagonist and the effect on blood pressure is synergistic with the beta-blocker popranolol. Even more important is that the lowering of blood pressure by d-phenylalanine lasted several days. A single dose of d-phenylalanine lowers blood pressure for one or more days in human 5 having no effect in normotensive individuals.","Because there is no single neurotransmitter involved in controlling blood pressure, we have designed CARDIOPLEX as a combination of substances which have been shown in numerous studies to promote a healthy heart. In fact d-ribose is included, since it plays a role in myocardial metabolism and post-myocardia schemia. The product also includes the trace metal chromium nicotinate because it has been shown to reduce blood pressure in humans. Moreover the patented SMART composition was found in one study to reduce blood pressure when given on a chronic basis. Unique to this product is the addition of certain herbs that enhance cognition including huperzine, rhodiola rosea extract, and ganoderma lucidum as well as other natural anti-hypertensive agents like hawthorn berry, Co-enzyme Q, and Pycogenol.

The great majority of cases are presently undetected, untreated, or inadequately treated, and it is twice as life threatening if you do not know you have it. High blood pressure takes years to develop and up to 30 years to do its damage not just to your heart and arteries, but also to your kidneys, lungs, brain, and nervous system. Next to old age and obesity, high blood pressure is the most potent predictor of a shortened life span. Of the 60 million Americans who are hypertensive, 10 million or more may be on medication of questionable value or may be on medication of real danger. Current reports of the American Medical Association, The American Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health indicate that treating your high blood pressure with drugs in current use can reduce sex drive, produce accelerated aging of all the major organs (the heart, lungs, and kidneys) and can shorten life expectancy by 16 years. Moreover, fifty percent of all elderly patients on diuretics show severe potassium and magnesium deficiencies. Most high blood pressure medications interfere with normal brain function, decrease alertness and memory, and can cause premature senility symptoms in persons over 60 years of age. Finally, certain high blood pressure medications (e.g. Captopril, Vasotec, etc.) may worsen the quality of life for 30 to 40 percent of all individuals. Heart attacks can be caused in-part by the development of cholesterol and fatty deposits on the walls of the arteries. Lipoproteins are the sticky molecules that stick to artery walls that make up fatty deposits beside cholesterol particles. These molecules form a biological \u201cadhesive tape\u201d around the particles of fat and could lead to the clogging of blood vessels. L-Lysine and L-Proline prevent and neutralize the sticky particles and reduce clogging.","CARDIOPLEX provides a SMART composition which contains natural blood pressure lowering substances as well as herbs which enhance cognition.

About $5.5 million are spent annually on colds in the United States. Persons have more than one billion colds each year, of which 110 million are disabling: the result is about 300 million days of restricted activity, about 60 million los t days of school and about 50 million work day. Although it is well recognized that most colds are caused by rhinoviruses, at least S37.5 million worth of antibiotics were prescribed for the common cold in 1994 in the United States. More than 100 distinct rhinoviruses exist, making it impossible to produce a useful vaccine. Therefore, leaders in the pharmaceutical industry have looked more recently to the nutrition as a possible answer to this health issue. However, this has not been an easy task, for example review of six major studies on vitamin C supplementation gave no evidence that high dose vitamin C supplementation decrease the incidence of the common cold. In contrast, a look at the trace metal zinc lead to more definitive conclusions.","In 1974 it was reported that zinc ions inhibit rhinovirus replication. A review of published clinical studies on the use of zinc lozenges in colds found four studies that reported zinc salts to be beneficial and four were did not do so. One important note is that the four studies that did not show benefit s used zinc lozenges with substances known to complex zinc ions, where as the four studies with positive results used an ionizable form of zinc without such substances. Zinc ions have other benefits that may shorten the severity and duration of non-viral symptoms associated with the common cold. In 1998, the CyberPharm scientist, Kenneth Blum, in conjunction with others in a randomized, double-masked, placebo controlled study demonstrated the effectiveness of zinc acetate lozenges on common cold symptoms in allergy tested subjects. Zinc acetate significantly shortened the duration of common cold symptoms and re3lieved symptoms associated with allergies. Moreover, zinc is an essential element in immune system functions. The inhibitory effect of zinc on histamine release from mast cells is attributed to its action on the stabilization of mast cell membranes.","Opioids (exogenous opiates and endogenous opioid peptides) have been found to modulate the immune system by regulating the function of immunocompetent cells. Several laboratories have indicated that opioids can operate as cytokinins, the principal communication signals of the immune system. Chronic activation of the endogenous opioid system augments the natural immune response. One important method to increase the activity of endogenous opioid peptides is to use D-amino acids, like D-phenylalanine, which inhibits the neuropeptidases known to breakdown the enkephalins, endorphins, and dynorphins in the brain. This in turn would enhance the natural immune response.","Two other important aspects that relate to the design of IMUNOPRO is that it is well know that catecholamines, like dopamine, seem to play an important role in the regulation of the immune function, both after chronic exercise and emotional stress. The second important aspect relates to the finding that the zinc ion is a potent inhibitor of one of the opioid peptide degrading enzymes, specifically aminotripepidase.","Experimental data available today strongly indicate that various types of physiological stressors, including physical exercise and emotional stress, can influence immune function. It is noteworthy, that natural immunity is strongly influenced by chronic exercise, and this regulation includes interaction between the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems as well as a positive effect on the endogenous opioids.","Moreover certain herbs are believed to promote immune system health and may stimulate the production and action of white blood cells, which are critical to the body's ability to promote cell repair and health.","IMUNOPRO also consists of herbs know to have an anti-oxidant and immune-stimulatory action including curcumin the active ingredient of spice tumeric which protects the body from free-radical damage. The product also features the following herbs: cat's claw, garlic, elderbery, , astralgus, and echinacea, which are believed to promote immune system health.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0140"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00026","num":"00026"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 29"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["BENEFITS","FEATURES"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Increases the Endorphinergic","Includes Patented SMART"]},{"entry":["System*","Composition."]},{"entry":["Blocks the Aminopeptidase","Includes d-phenylalanine to Boost"]},{"entry":["Enzymes*","Endorphins."]},{"entry":["Enhances the Immune System*","Contains the Novel Zinc-dl-"]},{"entry":[{},"phenylalanine Complex."]},{"entry":["Protects Against Free ","Consists of Zinc Acetate"]},{"entry":"Radical Damage*"},{"entry":["Has Anti-Oxidant Properties","Contains Curcumin of Tumeric"]},{"entry":["Releases Brain Dopamine and","Provides the Immune Stimulant"]},{"entry":["Norepinephrine","Echinacea"]},{"entry":["Has Anti-Viral Activity","Includes Other Herbal Immune"]},{"entry":[{},"Stimulants"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"*These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

This system has three lines of defense: physical, the inflammatory response, and the immune response. Physical barriers, such as the skin and mucous membranes, prevent most organisms from invading the body. Organisms tat penetrate this first barrier simultaneously trigger the inflammatory and immune response. Both responses involve stem cells in the bone marrow that form blood cells. Four structures in the body make up the immune system: lymph nodes, thymus, spleen, and tonsils.","Certain cells have the ability to distinguish between foreign matter and what belongs to the body. When foreign substances invade the body, two types of immune responses are possible cell mediated and humoral immunity. In cell-mediated immunity, T cells respond directly to antigens (foreign substances such as bacteria or toxins that induce antibody formations). This response involves destruction of target cells\u2014such as virus-infected cells and even cancer cells\u2014through the secretion of lymphokines (lymph protein). Eighty percent of blood cells are T cells. In humoral immunity B cells act in a different way that T cells are responsible for humoral or immunoglobulin-mediated immunity. B cells originate in the bone marrow and mature into plasma cells that produce antibodies (immunoglobin molecules that interact with a specific antigen). Antibodies destroy bacteria and viruses, thereby preventing them from entering host cells. There are still other cells\u2014not lymphocytes\u2014called phagocytes, or \u201ccell eaters\u201d, that digest microbes. IMUNMOPRO is designed to combine amino acids, vitamins, and minerals which naturally stimulate the immune system response via enhancement of the opioid peptide and the catecholamine systems as well as providing herbs that can be a powerful aid in supporting the body's defense against infections and when combined with good nutrition and exercise leads to a healthy lifestye.","Nutritional Information",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0143"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00027","num":"00027"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 30"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Supplement Facts"},{"entry":"Serving Size: 1 Caplet"},{"entry":"Servings Per Container: 90"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Amount per Serving","% Daily Value"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["SMART\u2009\u2122 Composition","+"]},{"entry":["Zinc-dl-Phenylalanine 100 mg","+"]},{"entry":["Zinc Acetate 10 mg","+"]},{"entry":["Tumeric Rhizome Extract 100 mg","+"]},{"entry":"Standardized to 85.0% Curcuminoids, 95 mg."},{"entry":["Echinacea Purpurea Extract 100 mg.","+"]},{"entry":"Standardized to 4% Phenolic Compounds, 4 mg."},{"entry":["ImunoPro Blend 200 mg.","+"]},{"entry":["Garlic Bulb.","+"]},{"entry":["Astragalus Root","+"]},{"entry":["Elderberry Fruit","+"]},{"entry":["Ganoderma Lucidum","+"]},{"entry":["Cats Claw Bark","+"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"+ Minimum Daily Requirements not established for this ingredient.

nature of alcoholism and other impulsive, addictive, compulsive behaviors, and half a century of intensifying research into their causes, a consensus is beginning to emerge that is agreed to by most scientists in the field: craving for abusable substances is a malfunction of the reward centers of the brain involving the neurotransmitters the enzymes that control them and that certain other repetitive behaviors are due to imbalances of neurotransmitter systems.","As yet, this information has not led to dependable methods of prevention or cure. In the area of addiction, abstinence is still the only sure way to combat addiction to alcohol or drugs. But we now have adjuncts that make treatment easier. Tests are under development that will enable us more accurately to identify individuals at risk. The goal is to diagnose individuals \u201cat risk\u201d for RDS behaviors sufficiently early to prevent the impulsive, addictive, or compulsive behavior from becoming established and to diagnose them accurately enough to help in the removal of the treatment retarding \u201cdenial\u201d phenomenon. An additional goal is to provide more targeted treatment in tertiary probands either for alcoholism with bromocryptine as a function of one's genome (Lawford et al., 1995) or for carbohydrate binging with chromium response as a function of one's genome (Blum et al., 1999). The important point to make here is that as we make progress with regard to understanding the human genome, and as we continue to identify genetic links to polymorphisms for many disease states the more refined treatment approaches will be derived from such knowledge. In fact we believe, a new scientific term will emerge in this new millennium\u2014Pharmacogendmics. This area of endeavor will help define the role of our genome in terms of individual differences with regard to a number of drug responses including pharmacokinetics and pharmatherapeutics.","The relationships among a wide range of impulsive, addictive, compulsive behaviors\u2014from alcoholism to drug addiction to food abnormalities to attention deficit disorder\u2014are now beginning to be understood, and the door to effective therapies is beginning to open wide.","The first definitive insight grew out of the discovery that addiction-free behavior is facilitated by an adequate supply of neurotransmitters; the availability of enzymes to regulate the supply of such brain chemicals and maintain balance among them; and the presence of receptors to give neurotransmitters access to the neurons that determine feelings of well-being. A malfunction in any of these areas may trigger a biogenic behavioral disorder.","The second definitive insight was that these various RDS disorders involve complex interactions of neurotransmitters. In alcoholism, for example, we may see the progressive involvement of serotonin, opioid peptides, GABA, dopamine, and\u2014in some instances\u2014norepinephrine. Each in its turn initiates or promotes changes in the brain's biochemistry.","The third definitive insight grew out of the discovery of an association between a severe form of alcoholism and defects in the Dgene in the reward area of the brain and other dopaminergic genes (i.e. the dopamine transporter gene and the dopamine P-hydroxylase gene). This genetic defect leads to such behavioral disorders, as severe alcoholism, polysubstance abuse\/dependence, attention deficit disorder, and carbohydrate binging, severe gambling, nicotine abuse among other behavioral abnormalities.","The fourth definitive insight was that these physiological conditions constitute a somatopsychological syndrome: sequential changes in brain chemistry that cause or trigger changes in feelings, beliefs, and behaviors. Just as emotional and mental disturbances can lead to physical illness as in psychosomatic medical theory, so somatic deficiencies or imbalances can cause emotional and mental disturbances including compulsive diseases, anxiety, hostility, depression, or anti-social attitudes. If a genetic defect is the original cause of the behavioral anomaly, somatopsychological responses may be the mind's way of coping with or adapting to the problem in the gene. The recent scientific literature continues to support this definitive insight (see meta analyses by Uhl et al., 1993; Blum et al., 1995; and, Noble, 1998).","The initial work opening the way to an understanding of common causes underlying compulsive behaviors was carried out by the present inventor and associates in 1990. A variant of the Dgene was shown to be associated with a severe form of alcoholism. This sparked numerous studies of similar associations of gene variants with a wide spectrum of related compulsive disorders.","As previously discussed, numerous studies found significantly high prevalence of the Dvariant gene in subjects with ADHD, Tourette's Disorder, conduct disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One striking example was that 59 percent of Vietnam veterans with PTSD carried the Dgene variant, compared with only 5 percent of those who did not. These results suggest that not only do drug abuse, ADHD, Tourette's Disorder, conduct disorder, and PTSD have a common genetic origin, but that the Dgene is one of the primary causative factors.","Given the widespread prevalence of ADHD in children and the frequent association of ADHD with substance use disorder and a wide range of other behavioral disorders, it seems reasonable to suggest that childhood ADHD may be a predisposing cause in these other anormalies or at least a pre-existing condition.","Gittleman (1985), for example, found a significant correlation between ADHD and adult substance use disorder. Studies by Comings (1991) showed an intimate relationship between Tourette's Disorder and ADHD. In his various studies, 50 percent to 80 percent of persons with Tourette's Disorder had ADHD, and 20 percent to 60 percent of their relatives, who themselves had Tourette's Disorder, also had ADHD.","While the exact identity of the genes causing ADHD and Tourette's Disorder are still unknown, mutations of genes affecting dopamine function have been strongly implicated. Certainly, the Dgene appears to be one of the primary genes involved. One of its variants seems to lower the number of Dreceptors, thereby affecting dopamine function, and perhaps playing the role of risk factor for ADHD, Tourette's disorder, conduct disorder, anti-social personality disorder, food binging, smoking behavior, posttraumatic stress disorder, pathological gambling, and polysubstance dependence, including severe alcoholism.","While other genes playing a role in these interrelated disorders are still to be identified, the concept of a \u201cReward Deficiency Syndrome\u201d (RDS), first proposed by KB, unites addictive, impulsive, and compulsive behaviors and may explain for the first time the way in which simple genetic anomalies give rise to complex aberrant behavior.","As Milam (1992) pointed out in his landmark paper, \u201cThe Alcoholism Revolution\u201d, which may serve the addiction field best by providing a blueprint for action: \u201c----meanwhile, the ugly battle for control will continue in the political arena. The public has heard the hostile allegations (Fingeratte 1988) that nobody understands alcoholism, that alcoholism does not exist, that it is merely willful misbehavior, that since treatment does not work anyway, only the briefest and least expensive should be funded. \u201c. . . every word they say chagrins us\u201d . . . because all of these criticisms are true of the bankrupt psychogenic approach to alcoholism; none, however, is true of the biogenic approach.\u201d","In a more modern approach to treat or prevent the onset of RDS behaviors, we know that premorbid behaviors to substance use disorder, including nicotine dependence, food addiction, violence, sexual deviancy, acting out in a variety of uncontrollable type behaviors, potentially could be treated with behavioral therapy, along with amino acid therapies, pharmaceuticals, electrical therapies, acupuncture type therapies, subluxation correction, biofeedback therapies, which all work on the neurophysiological mechanisms controlled by our brain. This novel approach will short circuit the genetic roots to this premorbid trait and reduce RDS behaviors.","It is the hope of the inventor that, through rigorous scientific exploration in both animals and humans, still unsolved mysteries about our \u201caddictive brains\u201d will become less mysterious. However, at this juncture we believe that great progress already has been made and it is time to move from the bench to the clinic and begin to apply our present knowledge base. In this regard we are working, in different ways, toward the development of standard diagnosis and treatment of \u201cReward Deficiency Syndrome\u201d.","The inventor is hopeful that he will find an optimal amino-acid composition which will constitute the core of the short-term intravenous bolus therapy similar to what has been proposed in this provisional application.","The inventor is convinced that treatment of RDS associated behaviors should consist of:\n\n","They also are convinced the treatment of RDS behaviors in the future will include the development of a wide variety of treatment settings which include development of community out-patient clinics, day hospitals, inpatient treatment programs, etc. These treatment programs will have programs geared for all the subtypes of behavioral problems under one-roof similar to the a one-stop shopping network. All of the RDS behaviors will be treated together in one location (alcoholism, substance use disorder, smoking, eating disorders-carbohydrate bingers, pathological gambling, sex addiction, violent offenders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder).","It is the goal of the inventors to continue the search for solutions to the world's oldest dilemia our addictive brains and we believe through sound scientific exploration as described herein, we will as humans begin to learn how to ease oue \u201clegacy of pain\u201d.","In Alcohol and the Addictive Brain (1991) (in collabration with Payne) stated: \u201cIn the remainder of this century and the early decades of the century to come, I think that we will see neurobiology, neuropharmacology, biogenetics, psychiatry, and medicine moving forward in close coordination to reduce the devastating behavioral and social costs of faulty brain function. My vision of the future is a world in which the chemical and electrical functions of the brain are understood; the problem of chemical imbalances as they affect behavior has been solved; the role of genetic anomalies in defective brain chemistry is understood; pharmaceutical and nutritional intervention as an adjunct to Twelve-Step programs and professional treatment is precise and effective; and the technique of defective-gene replacement has been perfected, enabling us to break (or repair) the genetic chain of inherited addiction. In this world, each individual will be able to enjoy the inborn legacy of reward and pleasure without having the need for addictive substances, without having to pay the price of addiction and pain.","Currently, due to poorly distributed knowledge regarding the etiology of the variety of RDS behaviors, all the treatment categories listed above are treated separately. We the inventors, believe that with the knowledge base described in this patent application the rationale of developing standard protocols for the treatment of all RDS behaviors (Intravenous amino-acid bolus short-term therapy) in integrated groups is clear and clearly will be cost effective. This should give all of us involved in the diagnosis and treatment of impulsive, addictive, compulsive disorders hope for the future.","Moreover, it is important to realize that awarding of this invention is important because the commercialization of this knowledge will positively benefit millions here in America and around the globe. For example, in the United States alone there are 18 million alcoholics, 28 million children of alcoholics, 6 million cocaine adicts, 14.9 million people who abuse other substances, 25 million people addicted to nicotine, 54 million who are at least 20 pounds overweight, 3.5 million school-aged children with ADHD or Tourette's syndrome, and about 3.7 million compulsive gamblers. The inventors believe that using amino-acid bolus intravenous therapy on a short term and repeated basis coupled with genotyping humans for the alleles of the DRD2 gene as well as: other genes (described in Blum's PCT application) related to psychological disorders in the present invention is indeed the first steps toward rational treatment for a devastating problem in society.","The invention first provides intravenous compositions for the treatment of RDS behaviors in a subject.

In certain preferred aspects of the invention, the composition is preferably used in the treatment of SUD and other preferred embodiments such as smoking behavior, carbohydrate bingeing and even ADHD, attentional processing and\/or memory, and stress. As used herein \u201cderivative\u201d may refer to a chemically modified compound, and \u201canolog\u201d refers to a different compound that has similar properties or structure to the compound it is being compared.","In certain aspects of the invention, these intravenous compositions which have never been used before as short-term bolus therapy, may be used in the treatment of all RDS related behaviors previously disclosed in Blum's published PCT application of Apr. 29, 1998 which has: been nationalized in numerous countries on Oct. 29, 1999 and Nov. 29, 1999. RDS behaviors are those behaviors related to a chemical imbalance which manifests itself as one or more behavioral disorders related to an individual's feeling of well-being with anxiety, SUD, smoking, Body Mass Index, Obesity, carbohydrate binging, pathological gambling, sexual deviancy, axis II diagnosis, Schizoid avoidant behavioral cluster, ADD\/ADHD, conduct disorder, Tourettes Syndrome, family history of SUD, and obesity as well others previously defined as well as other non-RDS disorders as defined herein.","The inventor believes that various psychological disorders are linked by a common biological substrate, a \u201chard-wired\u201d system in the brain that provides pleasure in the process of rewarding certain behavior. The inventors propose in this invention that an inborn chemical inbalance that alters the intracellular signaling in the nucleus accumbens or other limbic reward regions could supplant an individual's feeling of well-being with anxiety, anger or a craving for a substance (i.e. alcohol) that can alleviate the negative emotions. This chemical inbalance manifests itself as one or more behavioral disorders for which the term \u201cReward deficiency Syndrome\u201d has been coined (Blum et al. 1996a).","While a major aspect of this invention involves the use of an intravenous amino-acid based bolus composition for the short-term treatment of RDS behaviors as well as other non-RDS behaviors, disorders or diseases, certain aspects of this invention does involve the coupling of intravenous administration with gene testing. The gene testing aspect has already been applied for via a previous PCT application (Apr. 29, 1998). In order to be complete it is important to realize that in RDS, genetic defects in the reward pathways is best understood as a polygenic disorder, and genetic testing would require the testing of multiple genes. The earlier PCT identified the correlation between predisposition to RDS and alleles of a number of genes including but not limited to the dopaminergic genes DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, DRD5, dopamine transporter gene (DAT1); serotonin genes HTT, HTRA, HTRDb, HTRA, HTRC, HTIA, 5HT2R, tryptophan 2,3-hydroxylase (TD02); Norepinephrine genes, DbH, ADRAA, ADRAC, NT; Catecholamine metabolizing genes, MAOA, COMT; GABA genes, GABRAA, GABRAB; Canabinoid receptor gene, CNR; Nicotinic cholinergic, CHRNA; NMDA receptor gene, NMDAR; Enkephalin genes. PENK: Androgen receptor gene, AR; Interfereron gamma gene, INFG, CDA; Presenilin, PS; CRF gene, CRF; obesity genes, OB, leptin recteor gene; catechol-O methyl-transferase (COMT) gene; the neuronal nitric oxide gene synthase gene (nNOS1\u03b1); Apolipo protein-D (APO-D) and, uncoupling protein (UCP1 and UCP2) among others.","Enkephalins and endorphins are opiate-like substances which have been found to be endogenous in various animal species and man, whereby the general term endorphins includes but is not limited to Beta-endorphin, methionine-enkephalin, leucine-enkephalin and dynorphins. These substances are peptides or polypeptides which are normally found in the brain and in the periphery as well.","As pointed out in U.S. Pat. No. 4,439,452, it has been observed that both enkephalins and endorphins have an ability to act as a biologically active pain killer when administered by even intracerebral injections. However, the major drawbacks of utilizing the endogenous substances directly for therapeutic purposes, including intravenous therapy to treat RDS or non-RDS disorders, are their extremely labile nature and poor penetration into the brain via oral administration and their ability to induce addiction. It is known that the destruction of the endognous enkephalins and or endorphines is due to the actions of certain enzymes which resemble carboxypeptidase or endopeptidase (catelepsin), respectively. These and other enzymes which inactivate enkephalins and endorphins are known collectively as enkephalins and endorphinases. An enkephalinase F inhibitor is a substance which inhibits a class of enzymes known as enkephalinases and endophinases known to destroy these neuropeptides in both animals and humans.","Pharmaceutical Compositions","Aqueous compositions of the present invention comprise an effective amount of the various compounds disclosed to treat RDS related disorders, including substance use disorder, obesity, ADHD, Tourettes syndrome, PMS, smoking, any other related behavior described herein, dissolve or dispersed in a pharmaceutically or pharmacologically acceptable carrier or aqueous medium. The phrases \u201cpharmaceutically or pharmacologically acceptable\u201d refer to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce an adverse, allergic or other untoward reaction when administered to an animal, or a human, as appropriate.","A preferred chromium salt, in addition to those previously mentioned, is chromium niacin-glycerate. Clyclodextrin maybe added to composition in the kits of the present invention. This clyclodextrin could aide in the absorption of many of the various components in the composition. The kits also preferably contain a reward deficiency syndrome related scale. This scale allows the patient to gage the degree of his RDS problems.","Each of the several embodiments of the invention hereinafter to be described not only reduces intake of alcohol, cocaine, heroin, nicotine, glucose but reduces all known RDS behaviors. The following examples of compositions is provided to best describe the invention herein:","The invention includes the intravenous administration of a new class of anti-craving compositions provided by substances which inhibit the breakdown of endogenous substances such as enkephalins and endorphins. Specifically, D-phenylalanine, DL-phenylalanine, D-Leucine, DL-Leucine, and hydocinnamic acid, each in an intravenous solution in sufficient concentration to bring about enkephalinase inhibition which would significantly lower alcohol intake in animals and humans. The anti-alcohol desire effect has been observed in animals genetically prone to choose alcohol over water, but this effect has never been observed via the intravenous route. The inventors believe that the intravenous route would be advantageous since the dose needed would be much less than what is required by the oral dose. In a series of experiments the exact dose will be determined in both humans and animals to at least reduce alcohol or drug intake. In this invention only and not in limitation, the term enkephalin inhibitors includes D-phenylalnine (DPA), DL-PA, hydrocinnamic acid and D-amino acids such as D-leucine. It is anticipated that other enkephalinase inhibitors (depending on ability to place the substance into a safe and effective intravenous solution) selected from a group consisting of certain protein synthesis inhibitors (bacitracin, bestatin, and puromycin); and peptide amino acids (mono free form amino acids in the D-form; thiol benzyl amino acids (2-[mercapto-3-phenyl-propanoyl]-L-leucine; carboxyalkyl methyl esters, N-[(R,S)-2 carbethoxy-3-phenyl propanol]-L-leucine; as well as a number of other structurally unrelated compounds such as secobarbital, pyrophosphate, o-phenanthroline, phosphamidon, Z-Ieucine-NHOH, and Z-glycine-NHOH.","The potencies will be determined by trial and error, but a starting point for the various enkephalinase inhibitors in vitro range from 10 nM to nM amounts and, therefore, the anticipated human dosage range is from milligrams to micrograms per kilogram based on a 80 kilogram man. It is understood that the daily, recommended dosage is to be sufficient to alter the activity of enkephalinase and\/or opioid receptor function so as to reduce the craving for euporiants such as alcohol, cocaine, heroin, marijuana, nicotine, glucose as well as behavioral acts including but not limited to pathological gambling and sexual deviancy. It is further anticipated that the broad range of dosage will be provided in the final application due to both pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic elements. It is also important for this invention, that these substances alone, in equal dosages are less efficatious enkephalinase or endorphinase inhibitors in reducing craving but should be synergistic when used in combination with said inhibitors and other precursor amino-acids and even when combined with intravenous ethanol solutions.","An intravenous solution of D-Phenylalanine 16500 mg","For example, without testing, it is anticipated, that the range of the daily dosage of D-amino acid like D-leucine is between 15-5000 mg but a more definitive amount will be determined. The intravenous solution could be expanded to include any substance which inhibits enkephalinases, endorphinases and or dynorphinases. It is also anticipated that intravenous solutions could also contain the DL-forms as well.","The inventor believes that the substrate for RDS behaviors is mediated by regions in the brain's \u201cpleasure center\u201d or \u201creward centers\u201d which are high in a number of neurotransmitters including dopamine. These regions include the dopamine\u2014containing nucleus accumbens, and its projection to limbic structures and frontal cortex. It has been observed that if dopamine projections to limbic and cortical areas are lessioned the self-administration of psychoactive drugs which release dopamine (e.g. alcohol, cocaine, heroin, nicotine etc) by animals are greatly reduced. Moreover, selective dopamine receptor antagonists, like haloperidol, atenuate or block alcohol and cocaine self-administration in animals. Similarly, in humans, pretreatment with dopamine receptor antagonits will block stimulant-induced \u201ceuphoria\u201d. Additionally, dopamine receptor agonists e.g. bromocryptine, apomorphine etc) have rewarding actions. These and other studies suggest that the lack of \u201creward\u201d as observed in RDS subjects is due to a deficiency of certain neurotransmitters involved in the mediation of dopamine release and function.","A second step in the invention is to induce restoration and balance within the limbic structures of important neurotransmitters. This is accomplished by utilizing the brain's own natural biochemical mechanisms involved in the synthesis of individual chemical messengers such as serotonin, Gamma-amino-butryic acid (GABA) and the catecholamines (dopamine norepinephrine and epinephrine). In understanding the chemistry involved, these neurotransmitters of the monoamine type are derived via enzymatic actions concerned with known precursor amino acids.","Catecholamine are compounds which passes two adjacent hydroxyl (OH) groups; on a benzene ring. In the body, such substances are synthesized from the aromatic amino acid L-tyrosine, which is hydroxylated to L-3,4-dihydoxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. L-trosine is actively taken up into noradrenergic nerve terminals. L-phenylalanine is a precursor of L-Tyrosine. In the cytoplasm, L-DOPA is decarboxylated to dopamine by L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, an enzyme which requires pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6) as a cofactor. The dopamine is actively taken up into granular storage vesicles in which the dopamine is hydroxylated to form norepinephrine by the enzyme dopamine-beta-hydroxylase.","It is known that dopamine is the precursor of norepinephrine and epinephrine, and each of these three neurotransmitters have distinct functions in the central nervous system and at some ganlia in the autonomic nervous system. Dopamine is stored in storage granules where the catecholamine is complexed with chromogranins, divalent metal ions and ATP. Dopamine is believed to be released into the syneptic cleft by exocytosis. As with norepinephrine, this is a calcium dependent process and occurs in response to action potentials reaching nerve terminals or to drugs. The following drugs\/substances can induce a dopamine release\u2014they include: alcohol, cocaine, amphetamine, methyamphetamine, amantadine, morphine, heroin, phentermine, nicotine, marijauna, glucose to name a few.","The use of these precursors may be supplemented at appropriate stages of treatment of an RDS subject following the short-term bolus intravenous therapy. These include dopaminergic releasers, blockers, agonists or antagonists or agents affecting the reuptake or degradation of dopamine, norepinephrine or epinephrine. However, it should be understood that the entire range of dopaminergic activity including synthesis, and release is regulated to some degree by certain opioid peptides (e.g. enkephalins and endorphins). Centrally administered opioid peptides produce elevations in levels of catecholamines in blood plasma in animals and humans (Clouet Ann: N.Y. Acad. Sci., 398; 130-139, 1982). In fact, blockade of presynaptic dopaminergic receptors results in an enhancement of B-endorphin release, showing a unique reciprocal relationship.","Serotonin (5-HT) is a CNS neurotransmitter. It is also found in the enterochromaffin system of the intestine, and in blood platelets. This neurochemical is biosynthesized by first hydroxylating the precursor amino acid L-Tryptophan to obtain 5-hdroxytryptophan and then decarboxylating the latter to obtain serotonin. The hydroxylation (the rate limiting step) is performed by the enxyme tryptophan hydroxylase, while the decarboxylation is accomplished by the ubiquitous enzyme L-aromatic acid decarboxylase. This enzyme requires pyridoxal phosphate as acofactor.","Unlike tyrosine hydroxylase, tryptophan hydroxylase, under normal physiological conditions, is not saturated, therefore, the enzyme is not working to full capacity and thus tryptophan hydroxylase activity is significantly affected by 1-tryptophan. The amount of available free tryptophan is dependent on a number of factors including the concentration of circulating L-7 tryptophan in the plasma at the rate of its uptake in the brain and presynaptic terminals. We contemplate using L-tryptophan or 5-hdroxytryptophan, to restore the serotonergic system disrupted by either genes or other environmental elements.","There is come controversy concerning the usefulness of another amino acid precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan, which is about 20 times more potent than L-tryptophan. The rate of entry of L-tryptophan into the brain depends upon the ratio of free-bound tryptophan in the plasma, and this ratio is influenced by the concentration in the blood of neutral amino acids, insulin, glucose levels, and pharmaceutic agents, which compete for plasma protein binding sites, as well as for the tryptophan-uptake sites. Also 5-hdroxytryptophan is taken up by neurons other than just serotoninergic neurons; therefore the increases in serotonin synthesis are not selectively limited to serotoninergic neurons. Since the inventors plan to utilize the intravenous compositions via an FDA approved drug drug, and since in the United States physicians are allowed to subscribe or utilize L-tryptophan, the preferred embodiment is the L-tryptophan precursor rather than the L-5-hydroxytryptophan amino-acid.","Serotonin can be released into the synaptic cleft by the process of exocytosis in response to action potentials and to certain drugs\/substances. Facilitation of serotonin release is accomplished with cocaine, alcohol, amphetamine, metamphetamine, fenfluramine, chlorimipramine and others. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter which controls the release of dopamine (Gessa et al. 4th World Congress on Biological Psychiatry 459 No. 620:10 1985).","The main synthetic pathway to gamma-aminobutyric acid is via decarboxylation of L-Glutamic acid by glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). Like other amino acid decarboxylases, this enzyme needs pyridoxal phosphate or vitamin B6. GAD is found exclusively in the cytoplasm of an synaptic GABA nerve terminals. The basic control of GABA synthesis is GAD, which is the rate limiting step. Saturation concentrations of L-glutamic acid are present in the presynaptic neurons: thus, increased substrate concentrations do not normally affect the rate of GABA synthesis. Therefore, the exogenous administration of L-glutamic acid may not significantly increase GABA levels, unless the L-glutamic levels are abnormally low. However, it has been shown that a 10 day administration of 1-glutamine (@ 500 ng\/kg per day) with the drinking water to adult albino rats resulted in significant increase in the content of glutamate, GABA and taurine in the brain. Glutamine is an active intermediate in transport of ammonia from brain and therefore may greatly affect metabolism of different amino acid acids in nervous tissue. After deamination, glutamine may become a precursor of glutamate and, accordingly, GABA. (Thawki et al. J. Neurochem. 41:611-617, 1983).","Changes in affinity of GABA receptors for GABA, the benzodiazepine-binding sites for benzodiazepines and\/or barbiturate binding site for barbiturates is regulated by a protein \u201cGABA-modulin\u201d. No reports have indicated that the use of GABA precursors can postively affect RDS behaviors in the short-term. However, the inventors believe, that since in a number of RDS behaviors there is a significant association of stress and\/or anxiety the addition of L-glutamine may act to increase GABA, which in turn could stimulate the benzodiazepine-ionophor complex and reduce anxiety through this mechanism, even on a short time period for initial interaction via the intravenous route.","It will also be recognized that while this invention is directed to the use of a substance which inhibits the destruction of endogenous neuropeptidyl opiates (as described in Example 1), especially in combination with dopamine, serotonin and\/or GABA precursors, it may also be beneficial to add certain soluble neurotransmitter agonists, blockers, antagonists, releasers, or degradation inhibitors into one intravenous solution if desired or if proven to effect the efficacy of the base composition.","There are other substances which could also effect the activity of neurotransmitters and brain cell dynamics which can be contemplated as well in this invention. For example, calcium; is a required substance for proper neurotransmitter release and function. Zinc is essential for protein synthesis and can inhibit enzymes involved in the destruction of endogenous opiates. Thiamine promotes the synthesis of niacinamide and enhances oxidative metabolism of brain cells. Riboflavin is a cofactor which acts as a hydrogen acceptor and promotes the conversion of tryptophan to niacinamide. Niacinamide is an essential part of the enzyme system concerned with the efficient use of oxygen by neurons and promotes brain cell respiration. Pantothenic acid is a vital substance involved in cellular metabolism. It is believed that the combination of riboflavin, niacinamide, and pantothenic acid reduce irritability, restlessness and fatigue. Cyanocobalamine is a cofactor\/coenzyme for both chemical synthesis and neuronal electrical activity. Ascorbic acid is involved in the metabolism of phenylalanine and tyrosine and can reduce drug-induced withdrawal reactions. Follic acid promotes oxidation in the blood as a hematopoietic agent. D-Ribose is a cardiac protector and may play a role in memory.","An example of the precursor amino-acids in treating RDS behaviors as an intravenous composition is as follows:","In an intravenous solution these amino-acid precursors could be given alone or in any combination with any of the other precursor amino-acid at the specified dosage range.\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0209","num":"0254"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00033","num":"00033"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Amino Acid Precursor Formulation Daily Dose"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"L-Phenylalanine","1500","mg"]},{"entry":[{},"L-Tyrosine","900","mg"]},{"entry":[{},"L-Tryptophan","500","mg"]},{"entry":[{},"L-Glutamine","300","mg"]},{"entry":[{},"Pyridoxal Phosphate","20","mg"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Note: "]},{"entry":[{},"While the foregoing doses are preferred, it is contemplated that the quantities of each ingredient may be varied by an order of magnitude (10% to 1000%).

"]}]}}]}}},"In this composition the inventors are including a tryptophan concentration enhancing amount of all salts and chelates of chromium (e.g. picolinate, nicotinate, ablion chelate etc).","Background on Chromium","Body cells need chromium to keep insulin working properly as well as a host of other important biological actions. Scientists agree, that insulin directs the movement of digested food into the body's cells and affects how that food is used. When insulin doesn't act as intended, blood glucose and fat aren't stored and used properly. This malfunction leads to obesity, heart disease, or diabetes.","Our diets contain little chromium, and what chromium we do eat is often in a form that is difficult for the body to absorb. Therefore, chromium must be combined with a substance that will allow this substance to enter the bloodstream. A number of forms include picolinate, polynicotinate as well as Ablion chelate. Dozens of studies have proven that chromium, in the form of chromium picolinate, helps control blood fat, blood glucose, body fat, food cravings, and age-related bone weakening or osteoporosis, lowers blood pressure and reduces both total and LDL cholesterol, and induce higher levels of HDL cholesterol.","Dietary chromium is an essential nutrient whose value in human nutrition has been conclusively documented. Interest in chromium stems from the view that because chromium is an essential trace mineral and a cofacactor to insulin, it could play a role in glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism by it's potentiating effects on insulin action. Supporting this argument is the observation that chromium deficiency results in impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, elevated blood glucose levels, and symptoms of type 11 diabetes; in addition, adequate amounts of physiogically active forms of chromium can reduce insulin requirements in humans (Kaats et al. 1996).","The National Academy of Sciences has classified chromium as an essential trace mineral and recommends daily intakes of 50 to 200 micrograms. However, the most reliable studies report that among Americans (which is similar for other countries) is suboptimal\u2014only 40% of the minimum for women and 60% for men. There are more than 25 human studies documenting the beneficial effects of supplemental chromium on subjects living at home including improvements in glucose, insulin, and lipid levels: impaired glucose tolerance; adults with elevated cholesterol levels; insulin and hypoglycemic patients (Mertz, 1992).","To increase the bioavailability of chromium, several studies have suggested using picolinate acid, a naturally occurring metabolic derivative of tryptophan. Picolinate acid appears to combine with trace metal ions in the intestines and blood which facilitates the collection and use of essential trace metals (Evans & Brown, 1992). We are in this invention, only interested in the intravenous use of chromium. We will explore the absorption of unsalted chromium compared to various salts and chelated forms in terms of absorption and potency using typical studies involving glucose sensitivity and tolerance as a measure of biological activity.","Enhancing Brain Tryptophan","Because deposition of body fat appears in part by insulin, improvements in insulin utilization should lead to reductions in fat deposition. Enhancing the effects of insulin can also have positive effects on muscle tissue because insulin directs amino acids into muscle cells; once amino acids enter the muscle cells, they are assembled into proteins through insulin's effect on the cell's genetic material, that is, DNA and ribonucleic acid. This effect of chromium is important for this invention, since by doing so it reduces required amounts of the amino acid tryptophan (Wurtman, 1982). By enhancing tryptophan, this will lead to an enhanced synthesis of serotonin. The newly synthesized serotonin, will stimulate dopamine release via an indirect action on enkephalinergic neurons resulting in GABA inhibition, and through this mechanism enhance dopamine release at the nucleus accumbens. This would therefore benefit RDS behaviors, including substance use disorder, carbohydrate binging, pathological gambling, sexual deviancy, ADHD among other known and defined RDS behavioral subtypes.","Moreover, chromium can potentially facilitate the maintenance or addition of fat-free mass (FFM). It has been suggested that if chromium can lower insulin resistance it can improve body composition, as insulin resistance or deficiency results in impaired entry of glucose and amino acids into muscle cells, and increased catabolism of muscle protein as well as insulin deficiency's potential to accelerate lipid disposition (Kaats et al. 1996). Other references indicate that insulin resistance may help stabilize body fat in the obese patient, albeit at an obese level, acting much like a \u201cset point\u201d to prevent further weight gain (Eckel, 1992).","Why Intravenous","In general, although animal studies have supported this contention (Liarn et al, 1993), one human study found positive changes in body composition with chromium supplements (Hasten et al. 1992), another reported positive, although not statistically significant changes in body composition (Hallmark et al. 1993), and a third failed to find any positive changes in body composition with chromium supplementation (Clancey et al. 1994). The controversial nature of the literature reveals that most human studies used small numbers of subjects, and patients often followed exercise or conditioning programs that could increase the need for chromium at amounts higher than amounts provided in these studies. Previous work observing concurrent chromium supplementation and exercise training has been restricted to effects on body weight and composition, with conflicting results (Clancy et al, 1994; Evans et al 1989; Evans et al, 1993; Hallmark; et al. 1996; Hasten et al. 1992). Chromium Picolinate is the most heavily used, studied and promoted compound, but in vitro work suggests that chromium nicotinate may be also viable in the area of weight loss and changes in body composition. In this regard, very recent work by Grant et al. (1197), suggests that the nicotinate salt may be even more important than the picolinate salt.","While there still is controversy regarding the effects of chromium salts (picolinate and nicotinate) on body composition and weight loss in general, recent work seems to support the positive change in body composition in humans. Considering the work of Lawford, et al. (1995), showing a selective positive effect of bromocryptine, a Dagonist, in reducing relapse rates in alcoholics as a function of dopamine Dreceptor genotype, one of us (KB) embarked on a similar phamacogenomic study with CrP (see below).","Recently, there was concern over the demonstration that, at concentrations thousands of times higher than physiological levels, trivalent chromium can break chromosomes in cell culture. It is the inventor's position that this finding is not relevant to nutritional supplementation. In this regard, a prediction that CrP will accumulate in tissues to dangerous levels during long-term supplementation is based on an inappropriate pharmacokinetic model and is at odds with data from long-term rat feeding studies. Furthermore, clastgenicity is not equivalent to either mutagenicity or carcinogenicity and studies in animals reveal that any effects observed with regard to clastogenicity of trivalent chromium is only relevant to cell culture studies, not to living animals or humans. Moreover, the therapeutic-toxic-dose ratio for trivalent chromium is 1:10,000 and the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States has established a \u201cReference Dose\u201d for nutritional chromium that is 350 times higher than the upper end of the nutritional range. Considering the wide margin of safety for trivalent chromium, as well as its picolinate salt, we believe large scale, worldwide use of CrP is justified as an important dietary supplement to assist in reducing obesity.","Thus, it can be seen that effects of chromium supplementation on different subject populations (obese and lean) were variable with respect to changes in body composition regardless of dose. Given the comparable study designs for most studies, the results taken together suggest that a subset of responders in each study may account for the observed variability among studies.","In order to resolve the issue of non-responders, the inventor decided to test the hypothesis that typing the obese patients by genotyping the DRD2 gene prior to treatment with CrP would result in a differential treatment outcome. This was based on previous research which indicated that the DRD2 TaqA1 allele associated with obesity in general; the BMI; carbohydrate binging; co-morbid substance use disorder; and contributed to the overall variance of percent body fat in the present population at the high rate of 45.9 percent (Blum et al. unpublished). One of us (KB) predicted carriers of the DRD2 A2 allele would retain the positive metabolic effects of P, but in contrast the DRD2 A1 carriers, because there is a proclivity to increased carbohydrate binging, would possibly mask the metabolic effects of CrP on weight loss and change in body fat attenuating any positive effects. One prophetic example as described earlier (see page 48):","The inventor genotyped 130 obese subjects for the dopamine Dreceptor gene (DRD2) utilizing standard PCR techniques. The subjects were assessed for scale weight and for percent body fat using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXAR). The subjects were divided into matched placebo and chromium picolinate (CrP) groups (400\u03bcg. per day). The sample was separated into two independent groups; those with either an A1\/A1 or A1\/A2 allele and those with only the A2\/A2 allelic pattern. Each of these groups was tested separately for differences between placebo and treatment means for a variety of measures of weight change. These measures consisted of calculations of the percent of fat weight change; the change in fat weight; the change in body weight; the change in free mass, the percent change of fat weight; the body composition index; and the body weight change in kilograms. T-analysis revealed that carriers of the DRD2 A2 allele were more responsive to the effects of CrP than were the DRD2 A1 allele carriers. The measures of the change in fat weight (p<0.041), change in body weight (p<0.017), the percent change in weight (p<0.044), and the body weight change in kilograms (p<0.012) were all significant, whereas no significance was found for any parameter for those subjects possessing a DRD2 A1 allele.","These results suggest that the dopaminergic system, specifically the density of the Dreceptors, confers a significant differential therapeutic effect of CrP in terms of weight loss and change in body fat. Moreover, we propose for the first time that mixed effects now observed with CrP administration in terms of body composition, may be resolved by typing the patient via DRD2 genotyping prior to treatment with chromium salts.","The point here is that, depending on a number of important factors, genetic make-up as well as absorption results obtained with any chromium supplement are equivocal. It is the intent of this invention to resolve this controversy by administering the chromium via the intravenous route either alone (25-10,000 \u03bcg), or in combination with Composition B as specified above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0226","num":"0271"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00034","num":"00034"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Amino Acid Precursor Formulation Daily Dose"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"L-Phenylalanine","1500","mg"]},{"entry":[{},"L-Tyrosine","900","mg"]},{"entry":[{},"L-Tryptophan","500","mg"]},{"entry":[{},"L-Glutamine","300","mg"]},{"entry":[{},"Pyridoxal Phosphate","20","mg"]},{"entry":[{},"Chromium (picolinate, or","400","ug"]},{"entry":[{},"nicotinate)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Note: "]},{"entry":[{},"While the foregoing doses are preferred, it is contemplated that the quantities of each ingredient may be varied by an order of magnitude (10% to 1000%).

Therefore, a further enhancement of the intravenous composition, is to combine an enkephalinase inhibitor with an enkephalin releasing agent. The rationale for this is that by doing so we could significantly enhance the effect of enkephalin on its respective opiate receptor sites (e.g. delta or mu). To accomplish this aim, we would prefer to use the peptide Tyr-Arg (Kyotorphin), or its stable analog, Tyr-D-arg, which has been shown to be analgesic and to enhance intracellular calcium in synaptosomes in rat brain slices. These substances appear to be putative methionine-enkephalin releases acting by an unknown mechanism (Udeda et al. Biochem,. Biophy. Res. Comum. 137:897, 1986).","To provide both enkephalinase inhibition as well as enhanced neuronal enkephalinase release the substance Kyotorphin may be used as a daily dosage range of 15 micrograms \u221215 milograms orally. In our experiments to come, the inventors will provide the best dose for the intravenous composition preferred. (Takagi et al. 55:109, 1979).

In the altai mountains, in Eastern Siberia, Tien-sdhein and in the Far East, the cultivation of Rhodiola rosea has, been successfully mastered.","The rhizomes contain phenolic compounds, among them the most important are p-oxyphenylethanol (tyrasol) and its glycoside salidoside determining the biological activity of the Rhodiola preparations (Saratikav et al. 1968). Rhodiola possess stimulative and adatogenic characteristics. It is thought that this compound improves the ability to perform physical work; reduce fatigue; shorten the recovery period after prolonged muscular workloads; and normalize cardiovascular activity. During intensive muscular work, Rhodiola prevents loss of phosphates in brain and muscles by optimization of the processes of oxidative phosphorylation, stabilizing the muscular activity of lipids; improving the indicators of metabolism (activation of aminacyl-t-RNA-synthetase) in the skeletal muscles, increase of the RNA content, and increasing the blood supply to the muscles, especially to the brain.","Rhodiola can increase attention span, memory; improve mental work and enhance performed work. The area of the brain involved in this activity is the thalamocortical and posterior hypothalamus (Marina et al. 1973). Various other actions have been noted for Rhodiola and include prevent development of hyper-and hypoglycemia, leukocytosis and leukopenia, erythrocytosis and erythropenia, hypoxia; reduce stress and bring about a cardio-protective action. The stress-regulative effect of Rhodiola involves it's normalizing effect on the hypophyso-adrenal and opioidergic system. It has also been found that Rhodiola increases the anti-tumor resistance of the organism. It significantly inhibits the growth of experimental tumors, decreases the frequency of their metastasises; prolongs the life expectancy of animals with recidivistic tumors, and decreases the outcome of spontaneous tumors (Dementyeva and Yaremnko, 1983). There is some evidence that this compound also reduces neurosis and fights exhaustion (Saratikov, 1977).","Salidosid (an extract of Rhodiola) [SAL], at 30 mg\/kg prevented disulfuram-induced decrease of NE in the brain of animals. SAL influences brain NE by virtue of it's ability to inhibit the activity of COMT and MAO. SAL does not decrease the permeability of the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) for precursors of the catecholamines and serotonin, and this property makes it useful for the intravenous composition to treat RDS behaviors. Administration of rhodosine (which contains: SAL, aglycone p-tyrosol and rosavin) at 2 mg\/kg increases the brain concentration of DOPA, dopamine, and serotonin in the cortex and a decrease of the level of NE in the caudate nucleus in the brain of the intact mice, 30 min after subcutaneous injection. Others have shown that SAL did not alter the levels of epinephrine and DOPA: at a dose of 30 mg\/kg, it decreased the content of NE by 26% and of 5-HT by 15%; at a dose of 100 mg\/kg, it decreased the concentration of NE, Dopamine and serotonin by 20, 28, and 23% respectively. Studies involving the administration of L-Dopa (50 mg\/kg) and 5-HTP (100 mg\/kg) to mice showed that SAL (30 mg\/Kg) increases the rise in exogenous DOPA and serotonin in animals by 26 and 13%, respectively, compared to saline-dopa-5-HT-controls. These data indicate that the preparation increased the permeability of the blood-brain barrier for the catecholamine precursor.","Moreover, from the research of Petrov (1981) indicates that SAL decreases MAO activity and inhibits COMT activity thereby, slowing the inactivity of Catecholamines by o-methylation and oxidative deamination. Moreover, studies have shown that SAL does not alter the activity of 5-HTP decarboxylase. Consequently, it does not influence the synthesis of serotonin from 5-HTP, but may slow the biotransformation of the amine, by slightly inhibiting MAO. Evidently the increase in the rise of serotonin in the brain studies involving the combined administration of 5-HTP and SAL is governed by the capacity of the latter to increase the permeability of the blood brain barrier for 5-HTP.","The effects of Rhodiola in rats was studied using several methods of active avoidance with negative and positive reinforcement (Petrov et al. 1986). Using the maze-method with negative reinforcement, it has been found that Rhodiola extract in a single dose of 0.10 ml per rat improves learning and retention after 24 hours. In terms of the bolus therapy, it is of interest that significant improvements of the long-term memory is also established in memory tests after 10 day treatment with the same dose of the extract. Other work on the positive effects of Rhodiola on learning and memory has been noted (Lazarova et al. 1986).","Huperzine is a compound belonging to a class known as acetlycholinesterase inhibitors. It has been shown to inhibit the enzyme that is responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter, or brain chemical, which is critical in not only memory and\/or learning but is critical in peripheral nervous system as well. This could have a beneficial effect in the disorder known as Myastenia Gravis. Huperzine is a naturally occurring compound that: was originally isolated from the club moss Huperzine Serrata. It has been used in Chinese folk medicine and more recently in limited clinical trials conducted in China as a treatment for age-related memory disorders. Results suggest that it improves learning and memory in certain patients. However, these suggested results have not been substantiated by clinical trials. This natural substance is contemplated for use with the composition of matter claimed in this patent application (provisional) to affect attentional processing. In humans the recommended oral dose to enhance memory is 150 micrograms daily (the therapeutic range is 1.5 to 1,500 mcg daily). We will determine the best intravenous dose via experimentation alone and in combination with the claimed compositions.","Huperzine A, a novel potent, reversible, and selective acetylcholinesterase (AchE) inhibitor has been expected to be superior to other AchE inhibitors now known for the treatment of memory deficits in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The compound has been studied by a number of investigators including Zhi and associates (1995) with very positive results. In fact huperzine A is superior in activity to Cognex, the first drug licensed in the USA for Alzheimer's disease. The drug also blocked glutamate-induced cellular death of neurons. The duration of action of Huperzine A at 3 hours is superior to Cognex(2 hours) and physostigmine (30 min.).

In the present invention, the inventors propose to expand the use to all RDS behaviors. The rational here is that Bonin never appreciated the fact that alcohol like other substances of abuse such as nicotine, heroin, cocaine, marijauna, glucose to name a few, all release neuronal dopamine at the \u201creward site\u201d in the brain. It is anticipated then that by using alcohol to induce dopamine release, the subject would overcome potential genetic deficits as outlined in this application and induce, for example, proliferation of dopamine D2 receptors, thereby reducing generalized craving behavior as seen in most RDS subjects. Therefore, this short-term approach may even be useful in ADHD, Tourettes, pathological gambling and even sexual deviancy.","It is the intent of the inventor to determine the potential optimal and wide spread utility of this intravenous approach as first proposed by Bonin (specific for alcohol dependence). The inventor will also determine the best composition (A-E) described herein to combine with the ethanol solution.","The Bonin invention is a method of treating alcohol dependence in which an ethanol solution is infused intravenously into a patient. Typically, for the new patient, the treatment is continued for ten days, with a steady decrease in the amount of ethanol infused each day. It is preferred that about 40-50 ml of ethanol be initially administered in two separate aliquots, and that the volume of ethanol be decreased by about 2 to 4 ml per day for the first three days. On the fourth day, the volume of ethanol is decreased by about 20 ml and this volume is given in only one aliquot. From the fourth through the tenth day, the volume is again decreased by about 2 ml per day so that on the final day, preferably only about 4 ml of ethanol is infused in one aliquot.","The preferred concentration of ethanol in solution is about 10 to 20% by volume. However, the concentration and the total volume of solution infused can vary considerably (5% to 25%), depending primarily on the tolerance and weight of the patient. One suitable alcohol solution which is available in prepackaged form is manufactured by Kendall-McGraw Laboratories, Inc. And contains 5% dextrose and 10% ethanol in distilled water.","According to the Bonin patent, it has been found that after the initial treatment program, the patients who suffer recidivism (this can be checked against genotyping the individual for multiple polymorphisms such as the DRD2A1 allele-see tables presented herein), can often be effectively retreated by a six day course of alcohol infusion, rather than the full ten day treatment program. With this shorter program, the same volume of ethanol, i.e. about 40 to 50 ml, is initially administered, and it is then decreased following the same schedule described above for the ten day treatment. On the final day treatment, preferably about 12 ml of ethanol infused.","Initial Test:","Preferred solution includes the 5% dextrose and 10% ethanol solution, begins with 220 ml of solution twice daily on the first day. At least about two and one-half hours rest or waiting period should be given between successive infusions. Following the above-described treatment on the first day, the preferred treatment schedule, using the aforementioned 10% ethanol solution, is as follows:\n\n","If the shorter treatment program is not effective, a longer re-treatment program can be used. Further, the volume of solution, the rate of infusion, and the concentration can all be varied with the shorter program in the same manner, and subject to the same concentrations, in which they are varied in the longer ten day program.","Is the Preamble of the Bonin Patent Limiting in its Use?","In terms of expanded use, the inventors point out that Bonin was very specific in its specified use-alcohol dependence and alcohol craving. This is stated in the preamble of the claims and throughout the text. In fact Bonin;'s proposed mechanism is strictly directed to alcoholism. He states:","\u201cA proposed explanation for the effectiveness of this treatment is that alcohol addiction is the result of an immune response to ethanol antigen. The intestine is lined by a great number of macrophage. Phagocytization of an antigen by macrophage is usually the first step in the immune response. Thus, when alcohol is introduced intravenously, it does not pass through the macrophage-rich intestine, and the immune response is substantially ameliorated. At the same time, however, this alcohol is available in the bloodstream to satisfy the needs of the central nervous system and abate the usual [alcohol induced] withdrawal symptoms. Because the amount of alcohol administered in gradually decreased, the patient is desensitized to the alcohol antigen, which caused the allergic-type reactions. Ultimately, the patient becomes immunologically non-reactive to alcohol, and the craving for it diminishes.\u201d","Therefore, if Bonin is correct the use of intravenous alcohol alone would have no effect on other substances of abuse and addiction i.e cocaine, heroin, nicotine, glucose, marijauna as well as other ZDS behaviors (ADHD, pathological gambling, sexual deviancy etc.)","The inventor expects to find a surprising and unexpected effect of ethanol infusions to reduce cravings for other drugs of abuse; this would be indeed a patentable advance. This coupled with the outlined amino-acid, herbal and mineral combinations would also provide a novel step in the treatment of RDS behaviors with short-term bolus intravenous therapy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0255","num":"0314"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00037","num":"00037"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Amino Acid Precursor Formulation Daily Dose"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"L-Phenylalanine","1500","mg"]},{"entry":[{},"L-Tyrosine","900","mg"]},{"entry":[{},"L-Tryptophan","500","mg"]},{"entry":[{},"L-Glutamine","300","mg"]},{"entry":[{},"Pyridoxal Phosphate","20","mg"]},{"entry":[{},"Chromium (picolinate, or","400","ug"]},{"entry":[{},"nicotinate)"]},{"entry":[{},"Tyr-D-Arg","15","ug"]},{"entry":[{},{"i":"Rhodiola rosea"},"25","mg"]},{"entry":[{},"and\/or"]},{"entry":[{},"Huperzine A","10","ug"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Ethanol","10%"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Note: "]},{"entry":[{},"While the foregoing doses are preferred, it is contemplated that the quantities of each ingredient may be varied by an order of magnitude (10% to 1000%).

To test this idea we characterized the influences of alanine substitution for each of 29 phenylalanine residues lying in or near a putative DAT TM domain. Cells express 22 mutartts at near wild-type levels, manifest by DAT immunohistochemistry and binding of the radiolabeled cocaine analog [(3) H](\u2212)-2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4.fluoroph5nyl)tropane \u00a9 FT), Seven mutants fail to express at normal levels. Four mutations selectively reduce cocaine analog affinities. Alanine substitutions at Phe(76), Phe(98), Phe(390), and Phe(381) located In TM domains 1 and 2, the fourth extracelkilar loop near TM 4 and In TM 7, displayed normal affinities for dopan\u02dcIne but 3- to 8-fold reductions in affinities for CFT. One TM 3 mutation, F(155)A, selectively decreased dopamine affinity to less than 3% of wild-type levels while reducing CPT affinity less than 3-told. In a current DAT structural model, each of the residues at which alanine substitution selectivefy reduces cocaine analog or dopamine affinitIes faces a central transporter cavity, whereas mutations that Influence expression levels are more lIkely to lIe at potentIal helixlhellx interfaces.
