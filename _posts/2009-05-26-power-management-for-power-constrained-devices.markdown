title: Power management for power constrained devices
abstract: Techniques are disclosed for optimizing power consumption in electronic devices that operate on battery-based or scavenged power. The power scavenged or otherwise supplied by such devices may therefore last longer, allowing longer performance on a given charge (whether sourced from scavenged power, battery power, or a combination thereof). An energy distribution circuit can be used in conjunction with a hysteretic switch, wherein the hysteretic switch can be used to switch an energy storage element in-circuit (so that it can provide charge to sub-circuitry or components) when the charge stored on that element exceeds a given charge threshold; otherwise, the hysteretic switch presents as a high resistance or open circuit when the charge stored on the energy storage element drops below a lower recharge threshold. The energy distribution circuit can be configured for adaptively providing different discharge rates for different loads.

An example such device is a passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag. When two or more sub-circuits of the device are directly connected to that storage element, the discharge time of the entire device is determined by the shortest time constant of any of the sub-circuits. This is the case, regardless of varying power demands of the various sub-circuits. As a result, the power scheme is not optimal, and may limit application of the device.","There is a need, therefore, for techniques for optimizing power consumption in electronic devices having limited power supplies.","One embodiment of the present invention provides a system for optimizing the use of energy consumption by electronics having multiple loads. The system includes a hysteretic switch circuit having an input for coupling to an energy storage circuit and an output coupled to a node, the hysteretic switch circuit for coupling power stored by the energy storage circuit to the node when the power stored by the energy storage circuit reaches a charge threshold. The system further includes an energy distribution circuit having an input coupled to the node, and for controlling operating time during which DC voltage above an operating threshold voltage is presented to each of a plurality of device loads coupled to an output of the energy distribution circuit, wherein at least two of the device loads have different operating times. In some cases, at least two of the device loads have different operating threshold voltage ranges. The system may further include the energy storage circuit. In one specific case, the energy storage circuit includes a capacitor capable of storing potential electrical energy from a DC power source. The system may include a DC power source for providing DC electrical power to the system. The DC power source may include, for example, a battery and\/or an antenna operatively coupled to a rectifier, wherein RF energy scavenged by the antenna is rectified to provide DC power. In another specific case, a first device load can be coupled to the node (prior to the energy distribution circuit). In another specific case, the energy distribution circuit comprises at least one diode and one capacitor associated with each of at least two of its outputs, the at least one diode for setting a maximum DC voltage provided by that output, and the at least one capacitor for setting the operating time associated with that output. In another specific case, the energy distribution circuit is for controlling an amount of energy that is allotted for each of at least two of the device loads.","The features and advantages described herein are not all-inclusive and, in particular, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and not to limit the scope of the inventive subject matter.","Techniques are disclosed for optimizing power consumption in electronic devices having limited power (e.g., battery-based or scavenged power), such as RFID tags or other devices that can operate on battery-based or scavenged power. The power scavenged or otherwise supplied by such devices may therefore last longer, allowing longer performance on a given charge (whether sourced from scavenged power, battery power, or a combination thereof).","General Overview","As previously explained, in electronic devices having battery-based or scavenged power sources, a charge storage capacitor can be used as the energy storage element. The charge can be provided to the storage device by, for example, a rectenna circuit. As is known, a rectenna is configured with an antenna operatively coupled to a rectification circuit. In such devices, RF energy collected or otherwise \u2018scavenged\u2019 by the antenna is rectified to provide DC power, which is then stored in the capacitor (or other suitable energy storage element). This rectified, stored DC power can then be used to power one or more sub-circuits directly connected to the energy storage element.","In cases where the electronic device includes multiple sub-circuits each having a different load, the discharge time of the entire device is typically determined by the shortest time constant of any of the sub-circuits. A disadvantage of such conventional power schemes is that there is no way of controlling the per-charge lifetime or the amount of energy allotted for each sub-circuit or component at the output of the energy storage element. However, and in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, by appropriately providing different charge storage capacitances for different loads, the per-charge lifetime of each sub-circuit\/component can be individually controlled, thereby optimizing the overall power consumption and performance of the power constrained electronic device. Said differently, the time period during which a sub-circuit functions on a single charge can be optimized or otherwise extended.","This optimization can be achieved, for example, by integrating an energy distribution circuit, which in some embodiments includes switching diode and capacitor circuitry. The energy distribution circuit can be used in conjunction with a hysteretic switch, wherein the hysteretic switch can be used to switch the energy storage element in-circuit (so that it can provide charge to sub-circuitry or components) when the charge stored on that element exceeds a given charge threshold. The hysteretic switch presents as a high resistance or open circuit when the charge stored on the energy storage element is below a lower turn-off threshold.","Thus, the energy distribution circuit can be configured for adaptively providing different discharge rates for different loads. Such a circuit is particularly useful in devices requiring extremely low DC Power (such as the case with passive RFID tags and other batteryless power scavenging devices).","Example Multi-Load System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["2","1","3"]},"The DC power source can be, for example, a source of a small amount of a DC electrical power (e.g., 0.5 to 5.0 volts DC). One example such DC power source is a battery with a relatively limited or short lifetime. Any number of conventional battery technologies can be used (e.g., electrolytic cells, galvanic cells, voltaic piles, fuel cells, and flow cells), whether rechargeable or not. Another example DC power source can be implemented with a rectenna, which as previously explained operates to convert RF power to DC power, wherein RF energy scavenged by an antenna is rectified to provide DC power. Any number of conventional rectification technologies can be used. In some cases, both a battery and rectenna can be used. For instance, the rectenna circuit can be used to extend battery-life by supplementing additional DC power\/energy when RF energy is available for scavenging. Specific example embodiments will be discussed with reference to -","The power produced by the DC power source is stored in the energy storage circuit. This circuitry can be implemented, for example, with a capacitor capable of storing potential electrical energy from the output of the DC power source. Other suitable energy storage devices\/circuitry will be apparent in light of this disclosure. Specific embodiments will be discussed with reference to -","The hysteretic switch circuit is an electrical circuit that provides a small resistance (switch is effectively closed) from the input to output when the input voltage provided by the energy storage circuit reaches a specified charge threshold (e.g., turn-on threshold). When the input voltage falls below a lower specified charge threshold (e.g., turn-off threshold), the hysteretic switch circuit provides a large resistance (switch is effectively open) from input to output. Specific example embodiments will be discussed with reference to -","Each of device loads , , and  represents any active electrical components\/devices\/circuitry making up or otherwise contributing to the functionality of the system. For instance, in the context of a laptop, load # might be that associated with powering a disk drive, load # might be that associated with powering a LCD display, and load # might be that associated with a CPU. Note that the system can be made up of discrete components, integrated circuitry, or a combination of both. In any case, the three device loads - generally include electrical components that require DC power\/energy to operate correctly. However, they do not necessarily require the same amount of DC power\/energy to function properly. Further note that the number of device loads can vary from one system to the next. In , three loads were chosen as an example, but fewer or greater loads may be used in other embodiments of the present invention, as will be apparent in light of this disclosure. The number of device loads will generally depend on the requirements of the system.","In this example embodiment, the energy distribution circuit operates to distribute the amount of electrical energy provided to device load # and device load #, and thereby controls the amount of energy allocated for each device load # and device load #. Such adaptive distribution can be useful in many situations. For example, consider the situation where some devices in the system need to operate for a longer period of time than other devices. In such cases, the energy distribution circuit will allow stored power from the energy storage circuit to discharge to load # at one rate, and discharge to load # at a different rate.","There are a number of benefits of incorporating an energy distribution circuit at the output of a hysteretic switch. For instance, and in the context of scavenging DC power (from an RF power supply) to provide DC power to a DC Powered circuit, the energy distribution circuit allows control of the maximum DC voltage presented to each component (at the energy distribution circuit output) of the DC powered circuit. In addition, each component can have a different maximum DC voltage presented to it by adding or removing diodes from the energy distribution circuit. The energy distribution circuit also allows control of the amount of scavenged energy that is allotted for each component (at the energy distribution circuit output) of the DC powered circuit. The energy distribution circuit also allows control of the amount of time each component (at the energy distribution circuit output) of the DC powered circuit is powered (above a certain voltage). This is achieved, for instance, by varying an output capacitor (in the energy distribution circuit) associated with each component in the DC powered circuit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":"a "},"The DC power source of this example is configured to provide DC power for device loads -, using an RF power scavenging source having an open circuit voltage of about 14.7 VDC (designated as V) and a series resistance of about 39 K\u03a9 (designated as R). Device loads - are generally designated as resistors for simplicity, where is load # is designated R (about 20 K\u03a9), load # is designated R (1.0 K\u03a9), and load # is designated R (10 K\u03a9). The energy storage device is a capacitor (C), which in this example is 8 \u03bcF. The hysteretic switch circuit of this example embodiment includes transistors Q and Q (e.g., Q: PNP 2N5089 and Q: NPN 2N5087, in surface mount package, if desired) coupled as shown along with diodes D and D (e.g., both 1N5711, in surface mount package, if desired) and resistors R-R (e.g., 1 K\u03a9, 7.5 M\u03a9, 470 K\u03a9, and 120 K\u03a9, respectively, in thin or thick film deposited on substrate, if so desired). The energy distribution circuit of this example embodiment includes diodes D-D (e.g., each 1N5711, in surface mount package, if desired) and capacitors C and C (e.g., 0.6 \u03bcF and 1.0 \u03bcF, respectively) coupled as shown. The diodes are used to adjust the maximum DC voltage provided to the respective load, and the capacitors are used to set the discharge time and effectively how long the respective load can be powered before the DC voltage being provided drops below a certain threshold. In this particular example, diode D is used to adjust down (e.g., by about 0.4 VDC, or one Schottky junction drop) the maximum voltage applied to device load # by the energy distribution circuit, while diodes D and D are used to adjust down (e.g., by about 0.8 VDC, or two Schottky junction drops) the maximum voltage applied to device load # by the energy distribution circuit. With respect to discharge time, each of capacitors C and C operate to form an RC time constant in conjunction with the resistance of the corresponding load device. For instance, the operation time for device load  can generally be determined from the R*Cproduct and operation time for device load  can generally be determined from the R*Cproduct. As explained herein, this operation time is the time during which the DC voltage presented to the device load is at or above an operating threshold voltage. Thus, once the resistance of the corresponding load and the desired operating threshold voltage for that load are known, the value of each capacitor (in Farads) can be selected to provide the desired operation time.","For purposes of discussion, assume such circuit values and the various component values have a tolerance in the range of +\/\u221220%, or better. Example RF power scavenging sources are illustrated in and .

In , the maximum charging level on C is generally designated as charge threshold, and the time to reach that voltage is generally designated as charge time. Once the maximum charging level on C is reached, the hysteretic switch circuit conducts (or effectively \u2018turns on\u2019) and couples a percentage of the C charge to the input of device load #. Note that there may be some voltage drop across the hysteretic switch circuit, such that the circuit's output voltage is less than its input voltage. In this particular example, the maximum DC voltage at the output of the hysteretic switch circuit (and input to device load #) is about 4.8 VDC.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["1","2","3","1","2","3","1","3","2","3","4","5","2"]},"With further reference to the example time-voltage graphs of , note that each of the performance criteria of Table 1 have been satisfied. In particular, device load # requires a DC supply voltage in the range of 2 to 4.4 VDC for 9 ms or more on a single charge of the storage element C. As can be seen with reference to , the actual operating time for device load # is about 9.5 ms, with an operating threshold voltage of 2.0 VDC or higher. Device load # requires a DC supply voltage in the range of 2.4 to 5.2 VDC for 3 ms or more on a single charge of the storage element C. As can further be seen, the actual operating time for device load # is about 3.5 ms, with an operating threshold voltage of 2.4 VDC or higher. Device load # requires a DC supply voltage in the range of 2 to 4 VDC for 6.5 ms or more on a single charge of the storage element C. As can further be seen, the actual operating time for device load # is about 7 ms, with an operating threshold voltage of 2.0 VDC or higher.","As previously explained, the energy distribution circuit allows control of the amount of scavenged energy that is allotted to each device load included in the system. For instance, and with further reference to and , the energy allotted for device load # can be computed as (0.5) (C) (Max DC Voltage), which equals (0.5) (0.6 \u03bcF) (4.36V)=5.7 \u03bcJ. Similarly, the energy allotted for device load # can be computed as (0.5) (C) (Max DC Voltage), which equals (0.5) (1.0 \u03bcF) (3.85V)=7.4 \u03bcJ. As shown by the calculations above, the energy allotted for device load # and device load # can be controlled by varying the maximum DC voltage presented to the device and\/or by varying the capacitors C and C. In addition, recall that the maximum DC voltage presented to device load # and device load # can be controlled by the number of series diodes (e.g., D, D, D). Although Schottky diodes are used in this example, other embodiments may include other diode\/junction types (e.g., silicon, germanium, etc).","The energy distribution circuit also controls the amount of time each load is powered above a certain operating threshold voltage. This is done by setting the output capacitor in the energy distribution circuit associated with each device load, as needed. In the example provided in , the amount of time the device load # operating threshold voltage is at or above 2.0 VDC can be adjusted by varying the capacitance of C. Likewise, the amount of time the device load # operating threshold voltage is at or above 2.0 VDC can be adjusted by varying the capacitance of C.","Alternative Configurations and Circuitry","Although shown as driving two device loads in , the energy distribution circuit can be configured to provide power to any number of loads (e.g., 3, 4, or more). In addition, the energy distribution circuit can use any number of diodes and capacitors to adjust or otherwise set the maximum DC supply voltage for each load and the operating time (e.g., to operating threshold voltage for that load), respectively. The energy distribution circuit is not intended to be limited to diodes and capacitors. Rather, other embodiments can use alternative voltage adjusting mechanisms such as resistive dividers, transistors, and other voltage setting circuitry. Likewise, other embodiments can use alternative discharge time adjusting mechanisms such as various other RC circuits, LC circuits, and transistor circuits (or other active circuitry) configured to actively couple small amounts of charge over a set period of time from the hysteretic switch output to the corresponding device load. Thus, the actual configuration of the energy distribution circuit can vary and will depend on factors such as the desired complexity, power constraints, and cost.","As will be further apparent in light of this disclosure, the energy distribution circuit can be used with any number of DC voltage sources and\/or hysteretic switch circuits. For instance, illustrates an example schematic of a specific DC voltage source implemented with a rectenna used in conjunction with an energy storage circuit (C) and a hysteretic switch circuit, configured in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The DC power source (or rectenna) is configured with an antenna operatively coupled to a rectification circuit that includes capacitor C and diodes D and D, and provides DC power to capacitor C by rectification of RF energy collected by the antenna. The antenna can be implemented with conventional technology, and will depend on the frequency band of interest (numerous radiative structures can be used). Similarly, the values of capacitors C and C will depend on the frequency band of interest and the amount of RF energy to be stored. Likewise, diodes D and D can be selected based on the frequency band of interest and the amount of RF energy to be stored. In one specific example embodiment, the antenna is implemented with a 2.4 GHz surface mount or monopole antenna (e.g., Antenova, Ltd., P.N. 3030A6250-01). Diodes D and D can be implemented, for example, with hot carrier RF detector diodes (e.g., Avagotech, P.N. HSCH5340). Capacitor C can be implemented, for example, with a 100 pF antenna coupling capacitor, and capacitor C can be implemented, for example, with luF energy storage capacitor. The hysteretic switch circuit is implemented with transistors Q and Q coupled as shown (e.g., Q: PNP 2N5089 and Q: NPN 2N5087, in surface mount package, if desired). Other hysteretic switching schemes will be apparent in light of this disclosure. In any such cases, the hysteretic switch circuit is operative to switch capacitor C to a node (designated node A) associated with device load # and the energy distribution circuit when the voltage across capacitor C is above a predetermined level, and to maintain the connection of capacitor C to node A until such time as the charging on capacitor C drops below a predetermined lower turn-off level. In this way, the hysteretic switch circuit allows conduction of electrical current when a charge threshold is reached (which triggers operation of the devices loads , , and ), and continues to allow conduction of electrical current until a lower recharge threshold is reached, at which time conduction ceases (and device loads , , and  stop operating after their discharge times expire). With a DC power source operatively coupled to the capacitor C, this charging-discharging-recharging process can continually repeat. As previously explained, the DC power source may be battery-based, scavenging-based, or a combination thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":"c ","b":["1","16","1","8","17"]},"The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description.
