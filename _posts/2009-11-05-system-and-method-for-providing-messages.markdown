{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of the following U.S. Provisional Patent Application incorporated herein by reference in its entirety: App. No. 61\/198,520 filed on Nov. 6, 2008 and entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING ADVERTISEMENTS.\u201d","1) Field of the Invention","The invention relates to the field of mobile communications and more particularly to improved methods and systems for information delivery associated with a telecommunications network.","2) Discussion of the Related Art","Because of an increasing popularity of communication devices, such as mobile phones, a growing need exists for providing messaging services, such as advertising messaging services, to users of such communication devices. Existing technologies allow a phone switch to play messages during a phone call. The phone switch can play a recorded message, such as an advertising message, in place of a ring-back tone.","Common architecture for providing custom ring-back tone includes a Mobile Switching Center (MSC), a Home Location Register (HLR), and a ring-back tone generator (RBTG). In this architecture, software in a network MSC, in conjunction with the Home Location Register (HLR), identifies which received calls have been placed by or to corresponding subscribers of the ring-back service. The MSC sets up a voice path to the RBTG for conveying a ring-back tone to the recipient while also placing an outbound call connection to alert the called party. A RBTG is also conveyed in situations where the recipient has received a busy signal after connecting to the called party, indicating that the called party is busy.","The RBTG then plays the selected audio message back to the recipient through the voice path while the called party phone is alerted of the incoming call connection request. After detecting that the called party answers the phone, the MSC breaks a link to the RBTG and bridges the recipient phone to the called party phone via a voice communication channel so that the recipient and the called party can talk with each other without the custom ring-back tone being played.","Current methods and systems are ineffective when it comes to communicating customer service messages to mobile subscribers. While methods deliver advertisements to the recipient based cursory or preliminary information, such methods fall flat when those who want to deliver advertisements want to definitively target their advertisements or communicate effectively to a subscriber. Further, such third parties are at a loss when it comes to feedback from any delivery undertaken to such a subscriber.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment,\u201d \u201can embodiment,\u201d or similar language means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, appearances of the phrases \u201cin one embodiment,\u201d \u201cin an embodiment,\u201d \u201cin another embodiment,\u201d and similar language throughout this specification may, but do not necessarily, all refer to the same embodiment.","As used herein, the term \u201cMessage\u201d can be all types of information, but is not limited to marketing including advertising or those messages that can be used for life cycle management and customer relationship management. The messaging could also include information that is not related to the purpose of selling goods and\/or services.","The message is directed to an end-user or wireless\/mobile subscriber (hereinafter \u201cRecipient\u201d)  using a communication device, which includes, but is not limited to the communication device used for placing calls and playing back \u201cMessages\u201d. For example, the communication device can be a phone, such as a cell phone, mobile phone, smart phone, landlines, PDA phone, or the like. The communication device can also be a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) device. For example, the communication device can be a computing device, such as a desktop computer, laptop computer, tablet computer, or PDA, with software enabling the computing device to make VoIP calls over the Internet, or the communication device could simply be a device that plays audio and accepts commands, such as voice commands (more later).","The timing of providing Messages to the communication device, a Message(s) could be provided prior to, during or after the ring back tone, ringing tone or busy signal. Further, the playback of the Message could be interleaved with a busy signal, or the ringing of the Recipient's  telephone. For example, the busy signal and the Message could both be provided to the unsuccessful caller at the same time. Alternatively, one or more Messages could be provided to the caller in between rings of the Recipient's  telephone or between the tones of the busy signal (i.e., the Messages may be \u201cinterleaved\u201d with the rings or the busy signal). Similarly, one or more Messages could be provided to the caller prior to the first ring of the called party's telephone, after a predetermined number of rings, and\/or after a predetermined time period from the first ring. The Message could also be provided after the caller request to delay the call. In the case of an audio speaker the playback of the Message could be triggered once a particular Recipient  walks by a location that detects the Recipient's  presence.","As used herein, the term \u201cmodules,\u201d and as employed herein, are considered computer-executable program stored on a computer-readable storage medium. These modules provide information to a flagged Recipient  and carrying one or more sequences of instructions, wherein execution of the one or more sequences of instructions by one or more processors embodied therein causes the one or more processors to perform a method for providing information to the Recipient  using the communication device. A party is connected to the EP  and can potentially receive information from the EP  using the communication device connected to the NCS , and is hereinafter together referred to as the Recipient ","Further, the term \u201cmodules\u201d is used in an embodiment of the present invention. Modules can be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of executable code can, for instance, comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions, which can, for instance, be organized as an object, procedure, or function. Nevertheless, the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together, but can comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which, when joined logically together, comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.","Further, storage medium can include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: any type of physical media including floppy disks, optical discs, DVDs, CD-ROMs, microdrives, magneto-optical disks, holographic storage devices, ROMs, RAMs, EPROMs, EEPROMs, DRAMs, PRAMS, VRAMs, flash memory devices, magnetic or optical cards, nano-systems (including molecular memory ICs); paper or paper-based media; and any type of media or device suitable for storing instructions and\/or information. Various embodiments include a computer program product that can be transmitted in whole or in parts and over one or more public and\/or private networks wherein the transmission includes instructions and\/or information which can be used by one or more processors to perform any of the features presented herein.","A module of executable code can be a single instruction, or many instructions, and may even be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices. Similarly, operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules, and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set, or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices, and may exist, at least partially, merely as electronic signals on a system or network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["38","38","42","40","44","50","40","42","44","42"]},"The Exchange Platform (hereinafter \u201cEP\u201d)  connects to the CS  from, in one embodiment, outside the network via any communication Connection , typically a SS7 network with a Voice Trunk Connection (hereinafter \u201cSS7\/VTC\u201d) and via a Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol Connection (hereinafter \u201cTCP\/IP\u201d) connection  explained more in , but all connections inside NCS  can be any time of appropriate network connection.","The EP  can also be located within the CS  environment. The Connection , typically the SS7\/VTC, but can also be through alternatives such as an IP Multimedia Subsystem (hereinafter \u201cIMS\u201d) or other Long Term Evolution (hereinafter \u201cLTE\u201d) communication protocols connecting callers (which are expected to supplant currently installed SS7 infrastructures). The EP  is also operatively connected to an Account  via a Connection  that can be any type network connection that allows for data communication, typically a TCP\/IP connection.","The EP  is also operatively connected to the Recipient  via any type communication line that allows for voice communication, generally referred to as a Voice Trunk Connection (hereinafter \u201cVTC\u201d) . The Connection  illustrated between the EP  and the Recipients  allows support for all communications types, including those required for transferring such items as text, images, video, data, VoIP, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["42","46","60","40","44","42"]},"The CS  is comprised of at least one Originating Switch or Mobile Switching Center (hereinafter \u201cMSC\u201d) , at least one Home Location Register (hereinafter \u201cHLR\u201d) , at least one Service Control Point (hereinafter \u201cSCP\u201d) , at least one OSS\/BSS\/SMSC  and at least one Terminating Switch or MSC , also referred to as a Terminating MSC or T-MSC. Under certain conditions, to be explained in detail later, the communication is then routed and interconnected to the EP .","The NCS  includes Accounts  that are connected with the EP . The EP  allows Accounts  to interact with the EP  via the Connection , but could be any type of appropriate communication connection. The Accounts  are third parties who create, utilize, target, deliver, and monitor information for communicating, marketing, advertising and\/or selling to Recipients . Recipients , in an embodiment, are the Calling (A) Party , the Called (B) Party , an Online User(s) , and\/or the Communication Device . In another embodiment Recipients  can also be Accounts .","When any Calling (A) Party , Called (B) Party , Online User(s)  and\/or Communication Device  is first routed to the EP  from the CS  they are referred to as a Flagged Recipient , as in they have been identified and flagged by the CS  and party to potential receive the Message from the EP . It is then up to the instructions stored in the EP  determine if the Message is sent, and what Message is sent.","Communication Devices  used by Recipient's  can be a transceiver that allows communication from itself and the EP . Further, the Recipient  would not have to be physically being carrying the Communication Devices . For example, a person could be identified while in an environment where that identification then triggers the EP  to send that specific person (now flagged) a particular Message to the Communication Devices  in the environment. For example, the Communication Devices  could simply have a speaker that can play the appropriate audio Message relative to any data known about the flagged person in the EP  when passing say, a motion detector, such as those known in the art.","This person who has been flagged to receive the Message from the EP  could respond to the audio Message played using the same Communication Devices  with the speaker attached, and\/or the Communication Devices  could be broken into separate components where the person flagged could respond by such methods as a voice command\/prompt, pressing a designated button in the environment\/area connected to the Communication Devices , by making a designated motion, and\/or by some other method that can communicate a specific Action request back by the Recipient  back to the EP .","The Accounts  can also be considered marketers and advertisers, which can also be the Mobile Operator\/Carrier(s)  themselves. The data Accounts  input can include their total budget for messaging and advertising, a particular bid for a particular Campaign, and\/or specific to segmentations, such as specific time, locations, and\/or Recipient  segments. The Accounts  input can also be content for audio Messages to a group of cellular subscriber\/Recipients , such as whose contract is ending soon, available minutes have been consumed, and\/or eligible for a new phone offer. The input can also be the particular Account's  choices for targeting Message delivery with rules and instructions (more later). The Accounts  can be categorized into user types, such as Mobile Operator\/Carrier(s) , Handset Provider\/Manufacturer(s) , Content Provider(s) , Advertiser(s) and Brand(s) , Advertising Agencies , Mobile Subscriber(s) , and Online User(s) .","The mobile network operator who is in control of the CS , and\/or some other component within the CS  can typically communicate with the EP , from within the CS  environment. For example, a mobile network operator such as Verizon\u00ae could communicate to the EP  from within the CS  environment and likely through an operator firewall (not shown), but along both the Connection  and via a TCP\/IP  connection and\/or any appropriate network connection.","Verizon\u00ae in this example could also connect from outside the CS  as an Account  or more precisely as a Mobile Operator\/Carrier(s) . Whereas a particular mobile network operator who did not control the particular CS  in this example, such as Sprint\u00ae, may instead be allowed by the CS  owner, Verizon\u00ae in this example, to participate on the EP  through any network connection, here depicted as the Internet Connection  as the Mobile Operator\/Carrier(s)  Account. In addition, Sprint\u00ae could have its own rules and permissions for Accounts  it allows access to the EP  connected to its (Sprint's\u00ae) own CS  separate from the Verizon's\u00ae rules and permissions for its (Verizon's\u00ae) CS  and connected EP .","The same basic functionality applies for Handset Provider\/Manufacturer(s)  that are Accounts  such as Nokia\u00ae, Research-In-Motion\u00ae, Apple\u00ae, Microsoft\u00ae, etc. where the information, advertisements, and\/or communications they provide could be in general, and\/or tailored to a particular mobile operator (e.g. Verizon\u00ae, AT&T\u00ae, T-Mobile\u00ae, Rogers\u00ae, Orange\u00ae, etc.), and\/or to a particular mobile subscriber who is using their brand, and\/or a specific handset type (mobile communication device) used by any Calling (A) Party  and\/or any Called (B) Party  that is connected to the CS  and\/or the EP .","Content Provider(s)  are Accounts  such as ESPN\u00ae, TMZ\u00ae, The Weather Channel\u00ae, etc. where the content they provide to the EP  can be in any form retrievable by the Recipient , such as audio Messages, SMS\/MMS, text, images, video, etc. This content can be made available for free, a fee, in exchange for service, in exchange for another event and\/or Action, such as participating in a poll, and\/or some combination of these. This content in some cases can be made available to Recipients  in delineations referred to as Channels. Collections of channels are referred to as Programs in the invention and more on this later in .","Advertiser(s) and Brand(s)  are Accounts  such as Coke\u00ae, McDonalds\u00ae, Nike\u00ae, Best Buy\u00ae, Starbucks\u00ae, etc. where the information, advertisements, and\/or communications they provide to the EP  can be directly associated with a particular brand and\/or a particular product and where such items are owned and controlled by the participating advertiser or brand. For example, the brand Coke\u00ae could pay to run audio Messages that promote a new line of soft-drinks owned by Coke\u00ae. A retail brand such as Best Buy\u00ae could advertise a sale at their participating stores.","Advertising Agencies  can also be Accounts  including Interpublic\u00ae, WPP Group\u00ae, Omnicom\u00ae, the Publicis Groupe\u00ae, Havas, Dentsu\u00ae, etc. where the information, advertisements, and\/or communications they provide to the EP  are for a client of theirs.","Mobile Subscriber(s)  are Accounts  where the information, advertisements, and\/or communications they provide to the EP  are as a mobile subscriber of a particular CS  owner, such as Verizon\u00ae, AT&T\u00ae, T-mobile\u00ae, Sprint\u00ae, Rogers\u00ae, Orange\u00ae, etc. that has allowed the Mobile Subscriber  access to the EP  with an Account . In this embodiment, Mobile Subscriber(s)  are allowed to setup standard, or personalized Messages, advertisements, etc.","Online User(s)  can also be Accounts  where the information, advertisements, and\/or communications they provide to the EP  are as a random consumer or business who would typically connect via the World Wide Web. For example, a member of a social network, such as Facebook\u00ae could interact with the EP  by creating a particular Message and\/or Campaign for others to interact with, e.g. hear, read, view, buy, sell, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["50","50","38","50","50","60","50","58","98","60"]},"The EP  further allows third parties or Accounts  to create, manage, distribute, measure, report and adjust their messaging or advertising for a client. The EP  allows the Accounts  to setup specific Campaigns with Messages and\/or advertising, along with specific follow-up actions that can be taken by the Recipients , setup with rules and instructions for each particular Message and\/or Campaign. In addition, the EP  allows accounts other organization capabilities and reporting functionality, including revenue reports with various ways to view data, such as summary totals by Recipient  segmentations (e.g. Demographics, Psychographics, Location, Motion, Contact History, Behavioral, etc.); timing, and usage tracking; Action metric or conversion metric; and advertiser optimization goal type, explained in detail later.","The EP  is comprised of a Message Service Platform (hereinafter \u201cMSP\u201d)  and a Message Management Platform (hereinafter \u201cMMP\u201d) . The MSP  and MMP  can communicate with each other through a standard Network Connection , typically a TCP\/IP and a File Transfer Protocol (hereinafter \u201cFTP\u201d) connection, but can be any type connection that supports data. The MSP  and MMP  include a series of servers and modules, explained later in detail, which communicate and are otherwise operatively connected within the EP .","The MMP  is comprised of a Content Server , a Customer Relationship Management (hereinafter \u201cCRM\u201d) Server , an Operator Gateway Server , a Web Server , a WAP Server , and an IVR Server . The Web Server  allows Accounts  to connect with the EP  via the Connection  or via any network connection.","When Accounts  interact with the MMP  using a web interface accessible on the Web Server , the information needed for the logic and the association of items, such as what content belongs to which Account  and\/or Campaign is stored and maintained on the CRM Server  and the associated Message content, such as audio clips or Messages, sometimes referred to as Message Clips, are stored and maintained on the Content Server . The logic stored to identify a specific Message Clip is referred to as a Message ID.","The content associated to a particular Account  and\/or Campaign and addressable via the logic in the CRM Server  for WAP (Wireless Access Protocol) pages is stored and maintained on the WAP Server , which can be used interactively by the Recipients  via the Connection  or any network connection. The content associated to a particular Account  and\/or Campaign and addressable via the logic in the CRM Server  for IVR (Interactive Voice Response) information is stored and maintained on the IVR Server , which can be used interactively by the Recipients  via the VTC  connection or any network connection.","All the content needed to support the near real-time playback of Messages is copied and pushed from the MMP's  Content Server  to the MSP's  Signal\/Media Server  and tracked by the CRM Server . All the logic needed to support the near real-time instructions of an Account's  Campaign are pushed as a copy of the master file from the MMP's  CRM Server  to the MSP's  Message Server . This push of needed content, Campaign logic, and settings can either be set up to happen in preset time intervals (e.g. every hour), when updates are made, by rules determined by an Account , based on timing rules, based on billing\/budgeting\/bidding rules (explained more later), and\/or some combination of these push methods.","The CS  (in the previous ) can communicate with the MSP  via the Connection  and into a Signal\/Media Server  or via any network communication connection appropriate. When the CS  routes a call to the Signal\/Media Server , as stated the Signal\/Media Server  is meant to contain all the content needed for near real-time playback of Messages; any instructions for when to play a Message for a particular Campaign, such as the Timing Rules and Sequencing Rules (explained in detail later) for a particular Recipient  and\/or Campaign; any instructions for whether the particular Campaign has Predetermined Recipients , referred to as Predetermined Recipients ; or if instead the particular Campaign will employ a Message Selection Engine  (hereinafter \u201cMSE\u201d), described in detail later, which can employ multiple rules and engines to determine which Message or group of Messages gets played and in what order (Sequencing Rules), included in the Message Selection Rule Module  (hereinafter \u201cMSRM\u201d), described in detail later in  respectively; any instructions for whether to incorporate an Optimization Selection Module  (hereinafter \u201cOSM\u201d) which is based on previous performance data, described in detail later in ; and any instructions for follow-up Actions to a particular Message, such as a Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (hereinafter \u201cDTMF\u201d) signal from a button typically pressed by the Calling (A) Party  for requesting a SMS\/MMS, a tiny URL, Web page, WAP page, Offer, coupons, External Communications (e.g. Email, Outbound Calls, Direct Mail, etc.), etc. The call flow itself will be explained in more detailed later in , , , , , and ; and in an alternative embodiment in , , , , and .","EP  also communicates with the OSS\/BSS\/SMSC  (in the previous ) via an Operator Gateway Server  through the TCP\/IP  connection or any appropriate network connection. The OSS\/BSS\/SMSC  represents the Mobile Operator's typical Legacy systems such as the Operations Support System (OSS); the Business Support System (BSS), the system typically to manage business operations such as provisioning, billing, sales management, customer-service management and customer database; the Short Message Service Center (SMSC), the system typically supports Short Message Service (hereinafter \u201cSMS\u201d) and\/or Multimedia Messaging Service (hereinafter \u201cMMS\u201d) Message storage, point-to-point, mobile originated and terminated short message service.","The Recipient  can respond to a Campaign Message in a number of manners, including the pressing any number or key combinations on their communication device (or handset) that have been pre-designated by an Account  as a means to notify the EP  for a specific request for any additional information to a Message played, referred as an Action. If there is a series of potential sequential Actions to a particular Message, the first Action is referred to as the Initial Action for this invention. Each Action following a previous Action is called a Subsequent Action whether initiated by the Recipient  or the EP . An \u201cAction Response\u201d is a subset of Actions and refers to a specific Action that is sent back to the Recipient  in \u201cresponse\u201d to particular Action taken by the Recipient , as is depicted later in .","For example, the Calling (A) Party  and Called (B) Party  can communicate these Actions using SMS, when SMS is designated as an Action by an Account . SMS is a mechanism of delivery of short messages over mobile networks. In addition to SMS, Smart Messaging (from Nokia), EMS (Enhanced Messaging System) and MMS have emerged. MMS adds images, text, audio clips and ultimately, video clips to SMS.","For example, if an Account  had a Campaign that included an audio Message that suggested the Recipient  press any key on their communication device, known in the telecommunications industry as a DTMF command, to receive additional information in the form of a SMS or MMS, the Account  can utilize the Message Management Platform's  UI to setup this Action to a particular Message in advance. The Mobile Operator\/Carrier  API's are typically connected via the TCP\/IP  between the OSS\/BSS\/SMSC  and the Operator Gateway Server , but they can use any network connections appropriate. The data contents and instructions are typically stored on the CRM Server .","For example, employing the Connection , or any network connection appropriate such as the SS7\/VTC, in one embodiment a Recipient  presses the DTMF Action described (and pre-assigned by the Account ) in response to an audio Message instruction heard, Message seen, and\/or per a previous Action explained, as long as there is still an open Connection  or similar network connection there remains a one-to-one relationship for identifying the specific Recipient  and the request, or Action, comes through the CS  to the EP  or via some other network connection. The EP  knows which particular incoming Action request or set of instructions, came from which particular Recipient , because of the one-to-one relationship between the audio Message played via the audio Message's Message ID, and the corresponding Action ID and instructions. The Message Server  sends the Action request to the CRM Server  where the associated content and instructions are stored and are in turned passed to the Operator Gateway Server  and back to the OSS\/BSS\/SMSC  via the TCP\/IP  connection.","In this embodiment, the Mobile Operator\/Carrier  in control of the CS  with the corresponding OSS\/BSS\/SMSC  can then push the SMS\/MMS Action Response back to the appropriate Calling (A) Party via Path  or any network connection appropriate. From the beginning of the connection between the Recipient  and the EP , the Message Server  creates and stores a unique session ID for that particular Recipient  and any subsequent communications. Should this particular Recipient  later perform an Action such as request information based on instructions delivered in an earlier audio Message, SMS\/MMS, or some other Action, those Actions will contain the original unique session ID to track that particular Recipient  and the corresponding Actions.","Types of Actions which can be performed by a Recipient  can also include Clicks (on URLs embedded in the SMS\/MMS message), Conversions (transactions traced through the unique session ID back to subscribers who heard or saw a particular Message), Page Views on WAP or Web sites (traced through the unique session ID back to subscribers who heard or saw a particular Message).","The WAP Server , for example, can deliver WAP content and interact directly with Recipients  via Connection  or any network connection appropriate for communications with the EP . When a particular Recipient  requests a WAP page, that Action request comes with the original session ID mapped through Tiny URL (explained more below) for that WAP page. Both WAP pages and Web Pages also can be related with this particular Recipient's  initial session ID by mapping through Tiny URL for the pages for tracking the collective effectiveness\/success of a multi-step Campaign. Besides sending SMS\/MMS responses through the Mobile Operator\/Carrier  who controls the CS  and correlating OSS\/BSS\/SMSC , in another embodiment, the EP  could also host or subscribe to its own independent SMS\/MMS server or service and such capabilities (not shown), similar to the WAP Server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0112","num":"0111"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["90","90","104","106","104","50","60","106","60","60","106","38","60"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"b":["106","340","340","60","350"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0113"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["340","350","352","354","360","370","360","46","46","370"]},"For example, a third party could log into the MMP  using the Input Module  to access their existing Account . The Account  could create a distinct Campaign using the Campaign Management  module and could assign an audio Message and instructions as to how, when and where to play the Message using the Message Management  module. In the Action Management  module the Account  could input what SMS message the Recipient  should receive should the Recipient  use the DTMF\/Action as a response.

If a specific Campaign has been specified already by the Account , the Message Management  module allows the Account  to determine if the Campaign will use audio by utilizing an Audio Message  option and\/or using another format by utilizing an Other Message Format(s)  option, for such formats as an image or video which can be created and managed utilizing a Create and Manage Other Message Format(s)  function before utilizing the Preview\/Save  function.","A Target Management  module allows the Accounts  to link specific Campaign components such as Messages and Actions to a particular segmentation element, category and\/or group of elements. These segmentation elements can also have rules associated with them independent of a particular Campaign or linked specifically for a particular Campaign. Segmentation elements can be relative to a Recipient , such as Geography, Demographics, Psychographics, Behavioral, Motion, Velocity, Direction, Altitude, Mode of Transit, Contextual, Mood, etc.; can be relative to time, such as the time of day, day of week, etc.; can be relative a budget, such as a monetary constraint per Message played to a Recipient , per Action taken by a Recipient , per result of an Action such as a Click, Conversion or Page View, etc.; and\/or some combination of these elements and incorporating rules, such as Boolean operator rules (and, or, not, etc.), weighting, prioritizing, sequencing, etc. and will be explained in more detail later.","The option to use the Target Management  module becomes available to the Account's  Dashboard  after the Account  has been setup. A potential Campaign can be created and saved, such as with a particular Message or a particular Action, and can be tied to a specific Campaign, but targeting rules can also be built and managed independent of a specific Campaign. For example, targeting rules could be created for a group of Recipients  with specific characteristics, such as Males in Los Angeles, over 40. This targeting rule can be saved, reused, and\/or applied later to other elements such as a specific Campaign as and when needed. Components such as Messages and Actions, segmentation elements, categories, groups, and\/or groups with rules can be made available for use to others within the same Account , and\/or to other Accounts , and these Account users are referred to as Members in this invention (more later).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0125","num":"0124"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["60","436","438","60","390","60","390"]},"A Create\/Modify Audio  module allows the Account  a range of inputs via an Audio Options Module  as depicted in the next Figure, . A Create\/Modify Action(s)  module allows the Account  to add at least one follow-up Action to the specific Message and\/or their Account . Similar to the Audio Options  there is an Action Options  module in which the Account sets up Action preferences and rules such as whether a particular URL entered in a particular SMS\/MMS Action Response will in turn be shortened to a Tiny URL (explained more below), will the clicks be tracked, and\/or whether the phone numbers entered in for a particular SMS\/MMS Action Response will in turn be replaced with a tracking phone number which then forwards to the Account-provided number (explained more later in ). In an embodiment, the Account  specifies the original URLs and the phone numbers associated with an Action to the CRM Server  which can then replaces these URLs with a unique tracking URL that allows the CRM Server  to track whether a Recipient  visited the original URL or made a call to the original phone number.","The Action Options  module also contains a Library of existing Actions similar to the functionality available from the Audio Options in . An Assign Action to Message ID and\/or Campaign  module is where the Account  can make existing Actions available only to a specific Message within a Campaign, to several Messages, and\/or several Campaigns, only to those Members within their particular Account or Accounts, Divisions (sub-Accounts), a particular kind of an Account (e.g. Advertiser(s)\/Brand(s) ), and\/or globally to all Accounts and\/or Members for a limited time and\/or for a limited budget threshold. A Subsequent Action  function allows the Account  to continually add Actions to a particular Message ID and\/or Campaign that are assigned sequentially started with the initial Action, typically a DTMF (more on Actions in usage in  and utilizing the Action Management module in ).","The Target Management  module also allows the Account  to assign multiple rules to Campaigns, Messages, and\/or Actions and will be discussed in more detail later in several Figures, including: , , , , -, and -.

The TE  provided in the Message Server  communicates to the Signal\/Media Server , to which incoming Flagged Recipients  will receive\/hear a Message based on several rules that have been collectively established by all the Accounts  using the TRM  and other rule modules. An Account  can setup a Campaign with Timing Rules through the TRM  for such things as limiting when Campaigns run or not run to particular days, days of the week and or times within a day. Another timing rule can control the \u201cFrequency Occurrence\u201d at which an incoming Flagged Recipient  will receive Messages.","For example, if the Frequency Occurrence was preset by an Account  to a 1:1 ratio for all Flagged Recipients  within a particular Campaign, than a Message would be played for every Flagged Recipient  routed to the EP .

This one Pool  and three individual Classes distinction can be used by Accounts  for setting up sequencing rules for controlling the playback sequence of Messages (and Actions) sent to the Recipients  using the SE .","For example, using Classes A, B, and C assigned to a specific Campaign, the Messages may have a sequencing playlist rule of either: play each Class completely randomly; play each Class in a given sequence (e.g. A then B then C); play the B Class Messages only after the A Class Messages accomplishes a defined goal of, say getting the Recipient  to perform a specific Action (e.g. DTMF); play A Class Messages 50% of the time, play B Class Messages 30% of the time, and C Class Messages 20% of the time; and\/or play each Class Message based only on instructions from the MSE .","In , for example, the Account  could setup a rule that creates three distinct Classes of A, B, and C, unlike the previous  example where Pool  and the Class were the same. For this example, each Class (A, B, and C) has a single Message ID (A, B, and C) inside respective of their parent Class (A, B, and C). The Account  could setup additional rules to play any Class Message (A, B, or C) inside the Pool  completely randomly. Whereas in the  example, the same Account  could instead setup a rule to play any Class Message (A, B, or C) inside the Pool  also randomly, but as depicted here, set the EP  to maintain a balance of 33.3% between the on going selection of the three Class choices to play over time. This balancing of the three Classes playback\/usage could be also given a plus\/minus tolerance factor of, say, 5% by the Account.","In addition, the Account  could place weighting on the three Classes differently, say A=22%, B=44% and C=34% with a 5% tolerance for each (not shown), so that more than the A Class Messages maintains a 17-29% playback ratio of the total Messages in one Pool, the B Class Messages maintain a 39-49% playback ratio of the total Messages in one Pool, and the C Class Messages maintain a 29-39% playback ratio of the total Messages in one Pool's playback.","In the  example, an Account  has set up a rule to play A Class Messages, then B Class Messages, and then C Class Messages in a predefined sequence all within a single Pool .

There could be further sequencing rules such as: only play the B Class Message after the Recipient  has responded to a particular call to Action from receiving the A Class Message.","Whereas in the  example, the Account  has setup a rule to play A Class Messages, the B Class Messages, and then C Class Messages sequentially, but with additional weighting, where the rule knows to only play the B Class Messages after 50% of the A Class Messages within the total Messages in the one Pool  (of all A, B, and C Class Messages combined) have been played either set to the total use for that Campaign and\/or setup to measure what a particular Recipient  has received so far for Messages.","For example, in the case in which the Account  has elected to control what a particular Recipient  receives (as opposed to in total for the Campaign), if there were only one A Class Message in the Pool  that played the audio \u201cHave a nice day\u201d and with the weighting tied to the Recipient's  usage, that Recipient  would receive that A Class Message twice before the sequence rules would then play the same Recipient  a B Class Message once, and then play a C Class Message once, due to the A=50%, B=25%, and C=25% sequence and weighting.","If on the other hand, the same Account  had used the same A=50%, B=25%, and C=25% sequence and weighting parameters, but instead set the Sequencing to be say, overridden by a particular Recipient  Action, then this particular Action would trigger the subsequent Class Message to be played the next time the same Recipient  was routed and scheduled to receive another Message from the EP .","In , the Account  has setup a sequence rule of A Class Messages, then B Class Messages, then C Class Messages, and then D Class Messages whereas in , the Account  has setup a different sequence rule of A Class Messages, then C Class Messages, then D Class Messages, and then B Class Messages.

The Psychographics  module option can include a Recipient's  current and past personality, tastes, interests, values, lifestyle, opinions, attitudes, and the like.","The Location and Motion  module option can include the Recipient's  current location, including an elevation, and this information can be calculated and measured against the Recipient's  previous location, in increments of time and\/or distance to also determine the Recipient's  current, past, and\/or future velocity. These data points can also be measured and compared against historical data of the same Recipient  and\/or other Recipients  who have traveled the same path, distance, velocity, and\/or time pattern, to create unique set of data points for targeting relevant information. In addition, these comparative data points can help predict likely destination(s), when compared along with data from the current starting point and the current location of the Recipient .","Some Mobile Operator\/Carrier  data comes from the Flagged Recipient's  calls that are routed to the EP . This collected and utilized data can consist of one or more call features associated with the communication. For example, one or more of the call feature(s) could be determined from the call itself, such as the originating number, the intended destination number, the time and data of the call.","When Mobile Operators\/Carriers  cannot provide geo-location data, the Message Server  rule engines will look for other cues when assigning a default geography for a Recipient , including any available billing address data and\/or called number data.","The Location and Motion  module can also be set up to analyze the call history of each Flagged Recipient's  communication device and determine that a significant portion of the calls are made to, for example, a pizza parlor.

For example, a particular Calling (A) Party  who has a New York City cell phone number, but whose location data from the Mobile Operator\/Carrier's  O-MSC  shows that the caller is nearly always in Los Angeles could be served Messages, based on a set of rules whereby, either the Calling (A) Party  is always treated like a Los Angeles subscriber even though he\/she has a New York cell number; is treated like the typical Los Angeles subscriber when calling from Los Angeles; as long as a certain percentage of current phone calls are made from within Los Angeles; and\/or some other set of rules that could define the difference between the pattern of calls made by a typical resident of a particular region verses the pattern of calls typical of someone who is just visited that particular region.","If the Calling (A) Party  is always calling NYC from outside that area code, then NYC specific Messages could be targeted towards him\/her as a potential visitor, such as travel packages or hotel rates. The MSRM  rules employed for targeting this Recipient  can also include past purchases made using or routed through the EP ; inquiries from\/of Messages directed to this Recipient ; times associated with follow-up Actions; and what types of Messages and\/or Campaigns the Recipient  has responded to better. Furthermore, successful Campaigns that are based on a particular region could expand to subscribers known to have similar calling patterns. These calling patterns could go beyond geography, to be based on any similar data patterns collected, such as time of day.","The Behavioral  module option can include all the Recipient's  other collectable behavioral data, conscious or unconscious, including travel behaviors, history, and patterns; mobile communication behaviors (e.g. beyond the Contract History ), history and patterns; EP  usage behaviors, history and patterns; purchase behavior, history, and patterns; and the like.","The Behavioral  module, as well as the other module options, differentiate between the change in relevancy over time between past data (behaviors) and likely current interests. For example, historical behavioral data could support that a particular Recipient  who is known to play games on their communication device (mobile handset) is more likely or less likely to have an extended period of interest in games relative to his\/her increased or decreased usage.","The Behavioral  module is also designed to collect data that can help gauge the interest by a particular Recipient Segment regarding a topic or behavior over time. Each data point can have a different rate of propensity reduction over time. The propensity reduction factors can be determined by evaluating a particular Recipient's  Actions or non-Actions, and then testing patterns from which the EP  can calculate the relative differences in data (behaviors) over time.","In another example of historical behavioral data, a test group of Recipients  could use an Action that is a response to allow future plays or to not allow future plays a particular holiday-focused Message or holiday-focused Campaign.

The Threshold  module option can be used for a range of thresholds, such as a particular Threshold for Date of Birth (DOB) range where a particular Recipient's DOB or a Group of particular Recipients  DOB must be within a certain range to receive a particular Campaign, Message, and\/or Action. For example, this threshold may be for a Campaign geared for teenagers, or a Campaign geared towards people over the age of 65, etc.","The threshold can be set for an entire Campaign for a group of Recipients  to receive a particular Message. The Segmentation rule settings can be setup with Boolean operators to either incorporate or not incorporate a range of data points, threshold, and weights. Another Threshold rule could be setup to limit the number of Recipients  that are selected to receive a particular Campaign ID, a particular Message ID, and\/or receive a particular Action ID before moving to the subsequent ID (e.g. Campaign, Message or Action) within the Sequence Rule.","The Weighting and Rules  module option can be setup to place a variety of weighting, prioritization and\/or rules to the collective data points, measurements, and cumulative results. For example, more weight could be assigned to a particular Recipient  with a relatively new phone contracts, say within the last week, where then a particular Campaign targeted for voicemail setup could be assigned.","The Campaign could be setup to go further and assigned Messages that evolve from a generic welcome Message, to a generic Message with a reminder to setup their new voicemail, to a particular Message with a specific call to Action for setting up their new voicemail, as the time and\/or number of made phone calls by a particular Recipient  incrementally increases from day zero and\/or from the number of calls made zero.","The manner in which an Account  applies rules such as the above Recipient Segmentation rules along with the associated Thresholds  and the associated Weighting and Rules creates a single Segmentation Rule that are calculated cumulatively in near real-time.

According to the industry, at the end of 2008, there were over 17 billion global mobile subscribers. Now, there are over 300 million mobile subscribers in just the United States and Canada. North American mobile operators are believed to collectively average over five customer service calls per mobile subscriber annually. The calls from these mobile subscribers into customer service centers are often quite costly to facilitate and time consuming to both the mobile call center as well as the subscriber.","Further, every year millions of mobile subscribers simply switch who their mobile service provider is contracted through, often due to frustrations encountered over difficult interactions and\/or misunderstandings with customer service, billing issues, hardware and software problems, and the like. Therefore, a great disconnect exists which facilitates the aforementioned problems.","As has been described above, according to the above-described embodiments, an advantage of the invention is that it facilitates the linkage of targeted information, customer service, content, marketing, and\/or advertising between the \u201cRecipient\u201d , typically a mobile subscriber of a particular \u201cMobile Operator\/Carrier\u201d , and parties who wish to effectively communicate to these Recipients . The ability to target individuals, or customers\/subscribers, with relevant information, marketing, and customer service messaging is crucial to the mobile communication industry in solving the mentioned issues.","The invention facilitates the ability for mobile network operators and carriers to communicate effectively with their customer base through targeted Campaigns. These profiled Messages can help the mobile network operators and carriers enhance their Lifecycle Management efforts to improve the customer experience, reduce churn, promote Value Added Services, and increase Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). These Campaigns are created to be unobtrusive and to provide actionable Messages that are inserted into the Recipient's  call stream, which can reinforce brand tenets, pre-empt customer service issues, and promote new products and services.","The invention further provides an advantage by offering a vehicle for competing mobile operators, advertisers, advertising agencies, retailers, brands, handset manufacturers, distribution channel owners, content providers, online users, and the mobile subscribers themselves to all become active participants or \u201cAccounts,\u201d  via a web-based Exchange Platform . This invention can leverage existing technology within the Mobile operator's\/Carrier's  network that is linked to the Exchange Platform's  content insertion capabilities and rules-logic engines. Yet, an advantage of the invention is that the platform is not limited to mobile operator and carriers' infrastructure. The invention can effectively connect anywhere there is a physical and\/or wireless communication link to the EP  via such connection tyically used for land lines, mobile devices, transceivers with motion detectors, etc.","A significant advantage of the system is the Exchange Platform . The Exchange Platform  provides the ability to target customer service, improve communication efficiencies, and provide information and content that's relevant to each Recipient . The aforementioned problems often sterns from one's ability to initially and properly collect, normalize and segment the data. The Exchange Platform  solves this problem. The Exchange Platform  facilitates these key elements and continually tracks usage and performance so that in turn, the data collected leads to even greater optimizations, functionality, and data granularity for improved information searching.","Another advantage of the Network Communication System  is the Campaign. The Campaign messaging setup by the Accounts  within the Exchange Platform  can employ a wide range of targeting rules and instructions that including sequencing, timing, permissioning, provisioning, budgeting, and\/or bidding","Furthermore, the Campaigns themselves have subsequent and trackable elements\/components that build upon the previously delivered Messages, Actions, and data that was sent, requested, and\/or collected. These data points are measured, and in turn, continually improve the effectiveness of subsequent Messages and Actions that follow within a Campaign or Campaign goal.","The Exchange Platform  also facilitates the ability to have mobile subscribers and online user's preselected channels of programs or Campaigns with content of interest to him or her individually, such as specific sports, news, weather, financial news, gossip, entertainment, etc. In addition, Recipients  can also become Accounts  and even create their own Campaigns that have targeted messages to family members and\/or friends.
