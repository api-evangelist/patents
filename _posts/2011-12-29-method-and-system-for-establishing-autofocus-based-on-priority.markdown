title: Method and system for establishing autofocus based on priority
abstract: An approach for enabling the autofocus feature of a camera to be directed towards priority targets within a frame is described. A camera retrieves a stored object image. An autofocus platform then compares an object viewed by the camera within a scene with the stored object image. The autofocus platform then determines a focus point within the scene based on the comparison. The image is captured by the camera using the determined focus point.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["Service providers are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by providing compelling network services and advancing the underlying technologies. One area of interest has been the development of services and technologies for enhancing the image capturing experience. Many cameras, smartphones and other imaging devices have an autofocus feature that enables users to select a specific point in the frame on which to focus for image capture. However, the traditional autofocus feature lack intelligence; for example, such feature cannot be trained to focus on priority targets.","Based on the foregoing, there is a need for enabling the autofocus feature of a camera to be directed towards priority targets within a frame.","An apparatus, method and software for enabling the autofocus feature of a camera to be directed towards priority targets within a frame are described. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","Although the various exemplary embodiments are described with respect to facial recognition, it is contemplated that these embodiments have applicability to any data protocols, methodologies or systems for performing object or pattern recognition of any type. Also, while various exemplary embodiments are described with respect to image capture enabled devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, the exemplary embodiments have applicability to any digital camera device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","101","103","103","107","107"],"i":["a","n ","a","n "]},"Many cameras, smartphones and other imaging devices have an autofocus feature that enables users to select a specific point in the frame on which to focus for image capture. Typically, the autofocus is configured to utilize facial recognition to target faces as an object type featured in the image frame. For example, when a user of a camera device directs the camera to a scene featuring multiple people, the autofocus targets each face in the scene as the focal point for imaging. However, there are instances where a particular person among the crowd is required to be the primary focal point. Unfortunately, conventional approaches do not provide any way for the user to automatically adapt the autofocus settings so that it may identify and focus on a specific target of interest rather than a rigid object type. Furthermore, these traditional systems provide no means of enabling an autofocus feature to be trained over time to prioritize the targeting of specific objects on the basis of one or more conditions being fulfilled.","To address this issue, system  presents an autofocus platform  that is configured to direct an autofocus feature of a camera or image capture device for targeting user specified objects. In addition, the autofocus platform  provides a user interface for enabling a user to maintain a repository of images and associated priorities of said images. By way of this approach, when object recognition is performed in connection with an autofocus feature of a camera, specific objects in the frame can be identified and associated with a designated priority. The autofocus platform  enables a higher priority designation for a given object to be the target for directing the autofocus. Lower or non-priority targets, i.e., those associated with a lower or no priority, are not established as the target in the frame even though they may be of the same object type or classification.","Under this approach, the autofocus platform  permits the camera to target specific objects rather than object types in the frame. For example, in the scenario described above of a scene featuring a group of people, a specific face among the group can be designated by the user as the focal point instead of the face of everyone in the group. In certain embodiments, the autofocus platform  provides a user interface for enabling the user to establish various autofocus settings, including the establishing of which objects are to be focused upon as well as their particular priority. Also, in this regard, the autofocus platform  maintains a signature repository  for storing one or more images of objects and labels to be associated with a specific priority designation with respect to a particular user.","For the purpose of illustration, the term \u201csignature\u201d as used in herein pertains to data for enabling the unique identification of objects of interest in the same manner, e.g., fingerprint data (e.g., unique patterns of the finger) or other biometric information (e.g., retina scan) can be correlated with a specific person. In the case of the autofocus platform , object identification is enabled on the basis of comparative image data, one or more labels for indicating contextual or descriptive information regarding the object of interest, or a combination thereof. By way of example, a user of device as subscribed to the platform  can upload images of friends and family to the signature repository  via the user interface. In certain instances, the images may be tagged\/labeled to include temporal information (e.g., date and time of image capture), location information, or descriptors such as object names, venue types, activity types, etc. Under this approach, an image of, for example, a family dog can be uploaded to the repository  in association with a tag specifying the name of the dog as \u201cCola.\u201d Similarly, the user can upload an image of a famous television personality in association with a tag specifying the name of the person or the television program they appear on. It is noted, therefore, that the signature repository  stores images and optionally, one or more labels associated with such images, in relation to a particular user (e.g., via user profile information ). This data may then be used in connection with recognition technology for correlating this data with a particular object determined in view of the camera.","In certain embodiments, the autofocus platform  also enables the user to associate a priority with a given image uploaded to the signature repository . The priority can be associated directly by the user or on a conditional basis. In the former, the user assigns the priority level to a specific image at their discretion. Hence, if the user is particularly fond of their dog named \u201cCola,\u201d an image of the dog may be assigned a higher priority than an image of a co-worker. Resultantly, when the dog is within view of the camera, the autofocus platform  makes the dog the focal point for enabling image capture. Alternatively, the user can specify the priorities to correspond to those established with respect to a social networking service  to which they are subscribed. Under this scenario, a profile, ranking, relationship type or other designation may be adopted by the autofocus platform  for establishing a prioritization scheme.","In the case of a conditional prioritization, the autofocus platform  prioritizes an object for image capture based on a number of times the object is imaged and\/or viewed by the camera. Under this scenario, the autofocus platform  maintains a record of the number of times an object is imaged. When a predetermined threshold is exceeded, the autofocus platform  flags this image and attempts to identify if it is currently associated with any images in the signature repository . When the image is present in the repository , the corresponding priority can be increased, while lack of the corresponding image in the repository triggers adding of the image to the repository for training purposes. It is noted that the conditional prioritization may override a user designated prioritization so as to account for a frequency of viewing\/observation of specific objects or a frequency of actual imaging of specific objects by the camera. For the purpose of illustration, the viewing\/observation of objects corresponds to a detecting of one or more objects within a scene prior to actual capture of the image.","In certain embodiments, the autofocus platform  may also be configured to upload images that are frequently imaged (captured) by the camera to the signature repository . By way of example, when it is detected that a co-worker of a user of an imaging device  is frequently imaged, at least one of the images of the co-worker is uploaded. As noted, this may be performed based when a predetermined frequency threshold is exceeded. Also, it is noted that the priority may be automatically associated with the image as uploaded depending on the recorded number of ties the object is imaged as well. This execution corresponds to a training capability, wherein the autofocus platform  recognizes object (e.g., faces) over time, enables them to be added to the signature repository for future identification and permits them to be prioritized for autofocus targeting from among a group of other objects within view of an imaging device (e.g., ). The autofocus mechanism of targets specific objects or hones in on targets that tend to be featured repeatedly.","In certain embodiments, the user interface provided by the autofocus platform  also enables establishing of different autofocus mode settings, wherein a different mode corresponds to a different set of priorities. By way of example, when the user is visiting a friend's home, an autofocus mode for indicating the friend as the highest priority may be chosen. This mode can be named by the user as \u201cBest Friend Mode\u201d for easy selection from the interface. Moreover, when the user is at work, an autofocus mode for indicating their boss as the highest priority target is chosen. This mode may be named by the user as \u201cWork Mode\u201d for easy selection from the interface.","It is noted, in certain embodiments, that the user may identify one or more images and therefore, one or more respective priority associations for defining a particular mode. For example, the above described \u201cBest Friend Mode\u201d may feature a priority list ranking from top to bottom for corresponding to an image of the best friend, the best friend's spouse and their child respectively. Under this scenario, the autofocus platform  directs the autofocus such that these specific targets are identified by priority when required by the user regardless of the other objects that may be within view at a given time. The user may then automatically switch to a different autofocus mode when required or on the basis of a determined change in context (e.g., determined location information change). It is noted that establishing of one or more autofocus modes enables the user to establish a theme based prioritization scheme that accounts for different environments and settings of the user. Under this approach, the user does not have to associate a priority with each of the images uploaded to the repository  but rather within the bounds of a particular autofocus mode or category.","In certain embodiments, context changes are detected by the autofocus platform  on the basis of context information gathered by context processing modules -. For example, a network detection signal of a friend's user device or as transmitted by their routing device may be detected by the context processing module  the user's device . The autofocus platform  uses this information to determine the user is in presence of their friend. Hence, the context processing module  conveys context information to the platform  in the form of location information, motion information, device usage information, device status information, network information, or a combination thereof. Sensors employed by the context processing module  for gathering such data may include a gyroscope, weather sensor, temporal sensor, global positioning sensor, motion detection sensor, or the like.","By way of illustration, when a group of individuals are detected by the camera as part of a scene capable of being imaged, the autofocus platform  performs one or more of: (1) receiving a request to perform a directed autofocus, i.e., from a camera device, pursuant to viewing\/detection of a scene; (2) compare the objects within the scene with one or more images uploaded by the user per a signature repository  to determine a match; (3) determine a priority associated with the objects to be imaged in response to a match; and (4) cause generation of a control signal for directing the autofocus of the camera to the object within the scene that is determined to be associated with the highest priority. In certain embodiments, the comparison is performed based on one or more pattern, object, facial or other image recognition techniques. In addition, the priority is established based on a ranking provided by the user or determined as a result of a frequency of a particular object being identified within a scene. Under this approach, therefore, a user can train the autofocus mechanism of their camera via the platform  to target specific objects or to automatically hone in on targets that tend to be featured in various scenes detected or imaged by the camera.","It is noted that user devices -may be any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), smartphone or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the user devices -can support any type of interface for supporting the presentment or exchanging of data, the capture and storing of data including images, or a combination thereof. For example, the various user devices may -may feature a data capture module  for supporting the capture of audio, image and video data in connection with one or more applications operable by the device.","In addition, user devices -may facilitate various input means for receiving and generating information, including touch screen capability, keyboard and keypad data entry, voice-based input mechanisms and the like. Any known and future implementations of user devices  are applicable.","In certain embodiments, user devices -, the autofocus platform  and other elements of system  may be configured to communicate via a communication network . According to certain embodiments, the communication network  may be any suitable wireline and\/or wireless network, and be managed by one or more service providers. In addition, the network  may employ various technologies for enabling wireless communication including, for example, code division multiple access (CDMA), long term evolution (LTE), enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), mobile ad hoc network (MANET), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, and the like.","Meanwhile, the network  may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, such as a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network. Still further, the communication provider network  may embody circuit-switched and\/or packet-switched networks that include facilities to provide for transport of circuit-switched and\/or packet-based communications. It is further contemplated that network  may include components and facilities to provide for signaling and\/or bearer communications between the various components or facilities of system . In this manner, the communication network  may embody or include portions of a signaling system 7 (SS7) network, Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), or other suitable infrastructure to support control and signaling functions.","It is noted, though not shown in the figure, that in certain embodiments user devices -may be configured to establish peer-to-peer communication sessions with each other using a variety of technologies\u2014near field communication (NFC), Bluetooth, ZigBee, infrared, etc. Also, connectivity can be provided via a wireless local area network (LAN). By way of example, a group of user devices -may be configured to a common LAN so that each device can be uniquely identified via any suitable network addressing scheme. For example, the LAN may utilize the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) to dynamically assign \u201cprivate\u201d DHCP internet protocol (IP) addresses to each user device , i.e., IP addresses that are accessible to devices connected to a service provider network as facilitated via a router.","It is also noted that the autofocus platform  can be implemented for use over the communication network  as a hosted solution or on a subscription basis by a service provider. This may include, for example, the telecommunications service provider that supports execution of user devices capable of performing image capture (e.g., has a data capture module ). Under this scenario, the signature repository  may also be accessed by the camera remotely or can be implemented as a cloud based repository. Alternatively, the autofocus platform  can be directly integrated for execution by user devices -. Under this scenario, the signature repository  is maintained as an internal data source of the user device . The exemplary embodiments presented herein pertain to either implementation, as the autofocus platform  can be adapted in the form of one or more network or device executable components accordingly.  is a diagram of the various components of the autofocus platform, according to one embodiment.","The autofocus platform  includes various executable modules for performing one or more computing, data processing and network based instructions that in combination provide a means of enabling the autofocus feature of a camera to be directed towards priority targets within a frame. Such modules can be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or a combination thereof. By way of example, the notification service platform  may include an authentication module , context evaluation module , image recognition module , tag processing module , autofocus direction module , user interface module , communication interface  and prioritization module .","In addition, the autofocus platform  also accesses image data from a signature repository  as well as profile information from a database . Various modules - access these databases  and  for performing several of their operations.","In one embodiment, an authentication module  authenticates users and user devices -for interaction with the autofocus service . By way of example, the authentication module  receives a request to subscribe to the autofocus platform . The subscription process may include the establishing of one of more image\/object priorities, preferred social networks, etc. Preferences and settings information may be referenced to a specific user, user device, wireless device, or combination thereof, and maintained as profile information . It is noted that the user may also establish various autofocus modes accordingly.","The authentication process performed by the module  may also include receiving and validating a login name and\/or user identification value as provided or established for a particular user during a registration process with the service provider. The login name and\/or user identification value may be received as input provided by the user from the user device  or other device via a graphical user interface to the platform  (e.g., as enabled by user interface module ). Profile data  for respective subscribers, which contain pertinent user or device information, can be cross referenced as part of the login process. Alternatively, the login process may be performed through automated association of profile information  maintained as registration data with an IP address, a carrier detection signal of a user device , mobile directory number (MDN), subscriber identity module (SIM) (e.g., of a SIM card), radio frequency identifier (RFID) tag or other identifier.","In one embodiment, the context evaluation module  analyzes the context information provided by context processing modules -of the various devices of the user. This analysis is performed in concurrence with processing of image data as processed by the image recognition module , such as to determine a relevant context of the user, the user device, or other user devices at the moment of viewing\/imaging a scene. In instances where a device associated with the user is not equipped with a context processing module  (e.g., wireless device), the context evaluation module  interprets data collected by one or more sensors of the device to generate context information. The data is processed according to the sensor type\u2014i.e., if the sensor is a network detection sensor, it processes and interprets the network data (e.g., internet protocol address information).","Once processed, the context evaluation module  further determines the current state, activity or actions of the user, user device, or other user devices (e.g., within proximity of the user device). It is noted that the context evaluation module  may operate in connection with the tag processing module  for extracting specific metadata or context information regarding an image in view of a user device . For example, a label associated with an image featuring a descriptor for indicating a name or for indicating location information may be used to facilitate the lookup of correlating image data via the signature repository . In addition, the tag processing module  may be configured to correlate one or more tags associated with images already in the repository  with a newly detected image that requires tagging and\/or prioritization. This corresponds to an instance wherein the prioritization module  determines that an image not previously catalogued in the repository  is determined to exceed a predetermined threshold of imaging by the device.","In one embodiment, the image recognition module  employs one or more recognition techniques for analyzing the images viewed by a user device and performing a comparison against known images in the signature repository  for a particular user. The image recognition module may employ one or more pattern, object, facial or other recognition techniques. Also, the image recognition module  may employ the use of various models for enabling comparative analysis and matching of an image being viewed by a device for potential capture against an image in the repository . A match or identification can be determined to within a predetermined tolerance on the basis of various correlation factors\u2014i.e., image skew, spatial parameters, dimensional factors, color, curvature, etc. When a match is determined, the image recognition module  reports this occurrence to the prioritization module . When no match is determined, the module  reports this occurrence to the user interface module , which in turn can render a message to the user for indicating the image is not recognized (optional). In addition, the image recognition module alerts the prioritization module  and\/or tag processing module  to add this image to the signature repository in connection with a label (if applicable and enough context information is known) and\/or in connection with a priority (if applicable).","In one embodiment, the prioritization module  determines the priority that is associated with the identified image based. For example, the prioritization module  retrieves profile information  associated with the user and\/or user device (e.g., camera) that enabled the request to determine the priority associated with the image. Once determined, the prioritization module  alerts the autofocus direction module  of the priority.","In one embodiment, the autofocus direction module  generates a control signal for affecting operation of the autofocus feature of a camera. The control signal causes the autofocus to be directed towards the object currently viewed by the camera that correlates to the determined prioritized target\u2014i.e., that matches an image in the repository or that is determined a frequently occurring object.","It is noted that the above described modules may operate in tandem to perform various autofocus learning features of the platform . For example, as noted previously, a recurrently viewed object as recognized by the image recognition module  can be subsequently tagged and prioritized. Once done, the autofocus direction module  can be set to automatically enable the camera to hone in on the recurring targets in future instances.","In one embodiment the user interface module  enables presentment of a graphical user interface for enabling a user to maintain a repository of images and associated priorities of said images. In addition, enabling the user interface module  enables various autofocus settings and modes to be configured in connection with a specific user. By way of example, the user interface module  generates the interface in response to application programming interfaces (APIs) or other function calls corresponding to the browser application or web portal application of the user devices -. Alternatively, the user interface module  renders the interface in connection with a function call of an imaging application operable by the device, such as without a network based connection. In either case, the user interface module enables the display of graphics primitives.","In one embodiment, a communication interface  enables formation of a session over a network  between the autofocus platform  and the context processing module  of respective user devices . By way of example, the communication interface  executes various protocols and data sharing techniques for enabling collaborative execution between a subscriber's user device -(e.g., digital camera, mobile device, smartphones, tablet computers) and the autofocus platform  over the network . It is noted that the communication interface  is also configured to support a browser session\u2014i.e., the retrieval of content as referenced by a resource identifier during a specific period of time or usage of the browser. The browser session may support the uploading of images, image tagging, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3D","FIG. 7"],"b":["103","300"]},"In steps  and  of process , a camera views a scene that includes an object and retrieves a stored object image. The object image is stored in the signature repository. In step , process  compares the object with the stored object image. As noted previously, this comparison may be performed based on a label associated with the image or one or more object recognition techniques. Per steps , process determines a focus point within the scene based on the comparison. In another step , process  causes the camera to capture the image based on the determined focus point. As noted previously, a control signal may be generated for directing the focal point of the camera to the target object.","In step  of process  (), a priority associated with the object image is determined. As noted above, the priority may be specified by the user directly and referenced by profile information associated with the user. In another step , process  determines a frequency of capture of the object by the camera meets a predetermined threshold. For example, when an object is determined to be imaged more than five times or any other value as set by the user, this may result in an updating or assigning of a priority to the object image based on the determination. In instances where no prior priority is established, a default (lowest) priority may be established. When the frequency is above the threshold by a predetermined extent, a top priority may be established for the object image.","In step , process  determines an object image, relationship type, ranking, or a combination thereof associated with a social networking profile of the user of the camera. By way of example, the user may specify one or more permissions or settings for enabling the autofocus platform to retrieve object images, names and other information regarding friends they interact with via the social networking service. In certain embodiments, process  retrieves this information and populates the signature repository with object images as retrieved. In addition, process  can generate labels based on the profile information retrieved via the social networking service. It is noted that the autofocus platform  translates the relationship type, ranking information and other data into a priority associate with the user. For example, a person that interacts with the user via the social networking site that is categorized\/labeled as \u201cBest Friend\u201d is assigned a higher priority than a person categorized\/labeled as \u201cAssociate.\u201d Per step , process  updates or assigns a priority to the object image based on the determination.","Process  of  correspond to the training and learning capabilities of the autofocus platform  as it operates in connection with a camera. In step , the camera captures an image that includes an object. In another step , a label and context information related to the camera, the user or other devices is associated with the object. Per step , the image of the object is stored as it is determined not to match any known object image. Hence, as noted above, the autofocus platform  persistently stores several of the objects captured for populating the signature repository in association with the user.","It is contemplated, in future embodiments, that the signature repository can be leveraged by the user for generating collections of images based on priority. For example, the user may generate a collection of only those images that feature priority targets while excluding all other images. As another example, the user may opt that only images featuring a first and second priority target object in the scene be synchronized with another device or downloaded to a home computer. Also, it is contemplated that the autofocus platform  be configured to share collections of images of a given person as taken by the camera with the person via their social networking profile automatically. Under this scenario, the person imaged based on priority can retrieve and view those images that correspond to them only rather than having to sift through all images shared by the user.","In step  of process  (), a determination is made whether a condition associated with the camera, a user of the camera, the object, or a combination thereof is met. By way of example, the condition may be a location condition, activity condition, temporal condition or other contextual condition. As noted previously, context information may be accounted for by the platform  for perceiving the present environment or settings of the user or objects on the scene. When a change is detected, a predetermined autofocus mode for specifying one or more priorities in association with specific object images may be activated. This corresponds to step , wherein the autofocus platform  determines a focal point within a scene based on the determined contextual condition (change) being met.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A-4B","b":["5","5","400","103"]},"In , a configuration interface is presented to the display  of the device. By way of example, the configuration interface presents various buttons, menus and selection options for the user to invoke for establishing their prioritization settings, network settings, autofocus mode of operation, etc. A first tab  may be selected by the user to enable one or more general mode settings to be established. General mode  corresponds to the standard operation of the autofocus platform  with respect to the device  while special mode  corresponds to a customized\/user designated prioritization mode, including a paparazzi mode, autofocus mode, etc. It is noted that the special mode enables the autofocus platform  to override any standard settings established via general mode  when activated.","The general mode settings include current priority settings  for adding or removing of objects to a prioritization scheme list . The user can select the ADD or REMOVE links  and  respectively to add or remove entries from the list . In this scenario, the user has included the designation of five targets objects in order of priority. The target objects correspond to the names of specific people, a symbol for representing a company logo and a character for a sports team. Upon selecting the ADD link , an additional window may be presented for enabling the user to upload an object image corresponding to each entry in the list .","Current network settings  are also presented for enabling a user to add or remove (via ADD and REMOVE links  and ) networks the user is subscribed to. Various icons, i.e., , are presented for representing the established networks. The user may also select a checkbox  for enabling the pulling of profile information, including image objects and relationship type information from the designated networks . It is noted that the information pulled from the networks correspond to the entries in the list .","The user may also select a checkbox  and  for activating or deactivating the sharing of context information or recurrence settings. In the former, activation of the checkbox  enables the device to directly share context information with the autofocus platform, such as via a context processing module. In the latter, activation of the checkbox  enables the user to indicate the number of times an object may be imaged before being assigned a priority or added to the repository. In some instances, the value established may correspond to a predetermined threshold to be met for designating the object as being a priority target.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":["404","409","410","400","418","414"]},"Once the user establishes their settings, they can select a SAVE action button  to save the configuration settings or can undo them by selecting the UNDO action button .

In this scene, the camera  determines an object corresponding to the image of a company logo  (Jazzy's Catering) has shown up over five times\u2014i.e., in excess of the reoccurrence setting . As a result of the reoccurrence setting , a message  is presented to the user for determining if the user wants to add an image of this recurring object to the repository, update a current priority associated with the logo, or cancel. Under this scenario, the autofocus indicator  also features a status indicator  with a question mark for indicating this particular object has no comparative image information in the repository. Hence, the user can add the image by selecting the ADD action button , update a current priority of the object  by selecting the UPDATE action button  or cancel viewing of the scene by selecting the CANCEL action button . The user can also respond by cancelling the message via a cancel button , which indicates that the general mode of operation corresponding to  is to be resumed.","For the purpose of illustration, when the logo  corresponds to the one featured in the list  as fourth priority 4 and the primary target (John Quincy) is not in the scene, the autofocus indicator  is presented around the logo .

In this scene, the camera  is in special mode where it is instructed to identify a custom priority per a setting . The priority object in this case is the face of a singer named Fernando of a popular Mariachi band. An image of the singer along with corresponding tag\/label information is maintained in the signature repository. As a result, the autofocus platform  causes the autofocus indicator  to be placed around the object  in the scene that substantially matches the image on file. In addition, a priority status indicator  and corresponding label  are shown. It is noted that this corresponds to a user designated priority mode of operation.","It is contemplated in certain embodiments as well that a paparazzi mode may be established for prioritizing certain high profile targets (e.g., movie stars, sports figures, etc.). This mode of operation may be coordinated based on direct user designation or on the basis of social networking profile information. For example, if the user is a big fan of Fernando as indicated via their social networking profile, a higher ranking will be automatically assigned to sensor\/image data indicating this object  is in view.","In , another scene is viewed by the device . In this scene, the camera  operates in autofocus mode, wherein device context information is processed to determine the user is at a location of one of their clients. This corresponds to the autofocus mode of ACME Law Firm, as indicated in the list . In this example, location information is determined to correspond to the location of the client. In addition, various objects in the scene are recognized as matching data in the signature repository, including the face  of the owner of the firm. Based on the determined context, a particular autofocus mode is recommended by the autofocus platform  via a message . The user can select the YES or NO action buttons  and  respectively to confirm\/activate the suggested autofocus mode or decline activation and maintain general mode settings.","Upon selection of the YES action button , the ACME Law Firm autofocus setting\/mode is activated. Resultantly, an indicator is presented to the display  to specify that the mode is active. In addition, the autofocus indicator  is automatically placed around the face of the senior partner of the firm, which is determined as the priority target based on image data within the repository. The priority status indicator  and label  is also shown.","It is contemplated that the autofocus indicator, i.e., , can also be placed around mutually designated targets within view of a scene. For example, if it is determined the face of the other person in the scene is that of another priority target, an autofocus indicator  is also placed around this object. In certain embodiments, the priority status indicator  associated with the object may reflect the relative priority of the object per the automode settings. It is noted that the priority status in this case is \u201c2,\u201d which is presented to the user accordingly while maintaining the other object as the focal point. It is noted that any designation or indicia for representing relative priorities may be used. Alternatively, the user could designate that both of the objects are top priority\u2014i.e., the status indicators  and  both indicate priority level 1.","The exemplary techniques and systems presented herein enable the autofocus feature of a camera to be directed towards priority targets within a frame. The autofocus platform interacts with a device, such as a camera, to enable directed, trained autofocus based on priority. In addition, the autofocus platform adapts the priority based on a determined contextual condition being met.","The arrangements and processes explained above, according to certain embodiments, enhance the user experience in capturing images, whereby opportunities to capture an event is optimized to provide a desired composition for the images. For example, if the event will not recur, the photo opportunity will be wasted on poor images if the subject is not captured properly.","The processes described herein for enabling the autofocus feature of a camera to be directed towards priority targets within a frame may be implemented via software, hardware (e.g., general processor, Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chip, an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc.), firmware or a combination thereof. Such exemplary hardware for performing the described functions is detailed below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","601","603","601","600","605","601","603","605","603","600","607","601","603","609","601"]},"The computer system  may be coupled via the bus  to a display , such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display, active matrix display, or plasma display, for displaying information to a computer user. An input device , such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to the bus  for communicating information and command selections to the processor . Another type of user input device is a cursor control , such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys, for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor  and for adjusting cursor movement on the display .","According to an embodiment of the invention, the processes described herein are performed by the computer system , in response to the processor  executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions can be read into main memory  from another computer-readable medium, such as the storage device . Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory  causes the processor  to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory . In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the embodiment of the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.","The computer system  also includes a communication interface  coupled to bus . The communication interface  provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link  connected to a local network . For example, the communication interface  may be a digital subscriber line (DSL) card or modem, an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card, a cable modem, a telephone modem, or any other communication interface to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of communication line. As another example, communication interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card (e.g. for Ethernet\u2122 or an Asynchronous Transfer Model (ATM) network) to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links can also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface  sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information. Further, the communication interface  can include peripheral interface devices, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface, a PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) interface, etc. Although a single communication interface  is depicted, multiple communication interfaces can also be employed.","The network link  typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, the network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer , which has connectivity to a network  (e.g. a wide area network (WAN) or the global packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d) or to data equipment operated by a service provider. The local network  and the network  both use electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals to convey information and instructions. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link  and through the communication interface , which communicate digital data with the computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves bearing the information and instructions.","The computer system  can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), the network link , and the communication interface . In the Internet example, a server (not shown) might transmit requested code belonging to an application program for implementing an embodiment of the invention through the network , the local network  and the communication interface . The processor  may execute the transmitted code while being received and\/or store the code in the storage device , or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, the computer system  may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to computer-readable storage medium ((or non-transitory)\u2014i.e., non-volatile media and volatile media), and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as the storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory, such as main memory . Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic, optical, or electromagnetic waves, such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, CDRW, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, optical mark sheets, any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example, the instructions for carrying out at least part of the embodiments of the invention may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario, the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory, from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"],"b":["700","700","700","700","700"]},"In one embodiment, the chip set or chip  includes a communication mechanism such as a bus  for passing information among the components of the chip set .
