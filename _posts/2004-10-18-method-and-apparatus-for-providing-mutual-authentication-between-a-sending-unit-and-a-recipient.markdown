title: Method and apparatus for providing mutual authentication between a sending unit and a recipient
abstract: A method and apparatus for providing mutual authentication between a user and a sending unit, (i.e. target resource) in one embodiment, includes determining, for a user that has been assigned an article, such as a card or other suitable article that has indicia thereon, desired sender authentication information that corresponds to actual sender authentication information that is embodied on the article. The sender authentication information can be located on the article by using the location information provided by the sending unit in a challenge. The method includes determining for the user, corresponding article identification information, such as a serial number that has been assigned to the article, or a shared secret, and sending a challenge for the user wherein the challenge includes at least location information, to allow the user to identify desired sender authentication information located on the article, and sending the article identification information.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED CO-PENDING APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROVIDING ELECTRONIC MESSAGE AUTHENTICATION, having Ser. No. 10\/849,402, filed on May 19, 2004, having as inventors Voice et al. and owned by instant Assignee, which is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SECURELY PROVIDING IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION USING TRANSLUCENT IDENTIFICATION MEMBER, having Ser. No. 10\/748,523, filed on Dec. 30, 2003, having as inventors Chiviendacz et al. and owned by instant Assignee.","The invention relates generally to method and apparatus for providing authentication between a user and a target resource or information sending entity, and more particularly to methods and apparatus that employ soft tokens or hard tokens for providing mutual authentication between a user and a target resource.","Mutual authentication systems and methods are known that attempt to authenticate a user or recipient of information that is being provided by a content service provider or other target resource that is, for example, accessible through an on-line communication link such as through the Internet, Intranet, or any other suitable wireless or non-wireless network. Such methods and apparatus attempt to thwart malicious exploits by hackers and others that attempt to steal a user's identity. For example, a malicious entity may send an email using the address of a legitimate bank and directs the recipient to a \u201ccounterfeit website\u201d. The recipient, believing that it is a legitimate site, may be tricked into providing information such as an account number and password that can be used by the malicious entity to access the recipient's online account. The problem may be particularly acute in the consumer world where conventional methods of online mutual authentication may be very complex, typically requiring expensive hardware deployment and complex user interactions that make such mutual authentication techniques impractical. As such, it would be desirable to provide a system and method that allows the confirmation of users or recipients that are accessing an intended target organization, (i.e. sending entity) in a relatively inexpensive but secure manner.","Two factor authentication techniques are known that, for example, use a first authentication factor to authenticate an end user's identity and a second factor that is used for authentication to supplement the user name and password typically used in the first factor authentication. The concept of a second factor is that a user can authenticate using something that they know (i.e. their password) and something that they have (i.e. the second factor which may be, for example, a hardware token). Typically the second factor mechanisms are hardware based and are physically distributed to the end user. For example, time synchronous tokens are known and are sometimes referred to as multi-factor authentication techniques. Several known techniques are described further below.","Also, various methods for performing authentication of a target organization in connection with Internet applications are known that include, for example, secure socket layer server authentication which provides certification from a trusted third party based on the identity of the organization hosting a given web application. However, this can require the user to perform the manual step of double clicking on an on-screen icon and reading through information. The requirement of manual action often precludes it from being performed consistently and, thus, undermines the effectiveness of the method. In addition, client security plug-in applications are also known that involve an end user downloading and installing client side software which provides a visual indication of when the user is communicating with the legitimate site. However, it can be burdensome for end users to download and install software or to go through several manual steps to confirm the identity of the target organization.","In addition, both user and target organization authentication methods can be impractical when extending to other channels of communication such as interactive voice response systems or communication through mobile devices, such as cellular phones, personal digital assistants, Internet appliances, or other mobile devices, as they can rely on a user display and entry methods unique to web based applications.","Ensuring that a sent email message or other electronic message has been sent by a sender that can be trusted, also referred to as being authentic, helps ensure against theft of important information by unscrupulous parties and can help limit spam and phishing. Phishing is a form of Internet scam that usually involves the mass sending of emails which appear to be from a legitimate organization such as a bank or other financial institution or other organization. These emails often direct the recipient to a fraudulent website or form where he or she is tricked into divulging personal or financial information. An alternative phishing scam may not ask for such information but, upon entering the URL, execute a download of a keystroke-logging program that lets the phisher harvest information from the recipient's machine. The information can then be used for identity theft and fraud.","Phishing attacks can be costly and can drain a company's resources since, for example a large number of attacks can be run against target companies in large volumes and billions of phishing messages pass through filtering systems that can slow down email delivery, use up valuable processing times of servers and can ultimately result in the loss of important financial data to unscrupulous parties.","Several solutions are known that attempt to address this problem. Because phishing attacks often begin with large volumes of email sent from a forged sending address, efforts to reduce spam email may be somewhat effective in reducing the number of phishing attacks. For example, one method referred to as Sender Policy Framework, an originator of a message or originator domain publishes in a directory or other suitable form legitimate sending computer addresses which are verified by receiving message transfer agents. The message transfer agent may verify a received message via a DNS server (domain name server). However, this technique can require widespread adoption of SPF-enabled message transfer agents which can potentially be costly to implement and deploy.","Another technique referred to as Coordinated Spam Reduction Initiative again requires originators in an originator domain to publish legitimate sending computer addresses which are verified by receiving message transfer agents in a relatively similar manner as described above.","Another technique requires domains to digitally sign email which is verified by the receiving message transfer agent via DNS servers. Again, this can require the widespread adoption of modified versions of message transfer agents.","Another technique uses the S\/MIME protocol wherein sending individuals or domains digitally sign emails that are verified by receiving incoming message transfer agents or user email clients. This can require special email client features or recipient message transfer agents that are not currently supported in web based email clients.","Another technique employs secret images that are shared between a sender and a recipient. As understood, a personalized image is sent by a user to an authentication server. The server stores the recipient sent image. The authentication server may then send the personalized image to the recipient with an email and the user seeing the image recognizes that it is the one he sent. Also, during logon to a site, the server may include the image in the logon page so that a user trusts the login page when the user sees their personalized image (see e.g., www.passmarksecurity.com). Among other drawbacks, this system appears to use the same image for multiple logins until the shared image is changed and may require the recipient to choose and send the image to a sending server.","In addition, other systems are known which attempt to provide, instead of sender authentication, recipient authentication. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,712,627 discloses, among other things, an issued identification card that has indicum at one of the addressable positions on an assigned card. The card may have rows and columns with different numbers, characters or symbols that are addressable by the rows and columns. To determine whether a person seeking access to data is authorized to obtain requested access, the identification card is distributed to authorized users. A requesting person seeking access provides the indicia at one or more addressable positions on the card as specified by a security system. To notify the person which indicum to enter and send back, the system selects coordinate indicia known to be present on a particular card. The recipient must then send back the indicia located at the address sent by the security system. If the indicia matches that assigned to the person seeking access then access is granted. However, such systems do not resolve the problem with respect to phishing since the system provides authentication of a receiver and not a sender and requests that a person seeking access identify themselves to the system and the system requires entry and sending by the user of information located on the security card.","Other authentication systems are also known that have been employed, for example, in the military, numeral cipher\/authentication systems have been used that employ cards that are held by a sender and recipient. A transmission is authenticated for example by using a challenge and reply authentication scheme. A sender of an electronic transmission for example may use the card and randomly select a row and column and transmit the row and column identifiers as a challenge. For a reply, row and column identifiers are used to look up an alphabetical letter which is then communicated back. As s such, the sender can be assured that the receiver is in possession of a card. However, the authentication of the sender to the receiver is typically done by repeating the same challenge and reply in reverse, and both sender and receiver must be in possession of the same authentication card to achieve mutual authentification.","Another technique also uses a card that includes rows and columns of information on both the sender and receiver side, however, this transmission authentication scheme is used to authenticate transmissions. For example during transmission authentication, columns of transmission authentication diagraphs are located on the back of a cipher table and used to authenticate a sender. Column assignments are made by a designated representative such as a commander of a unit. The column assignments are known to both the sender and receiver apriori. Transmission authentication diagraphs are used only once. The first unused authenticator in the assigned column is used and a line is drawn through that authenticator to preclude its reuse. Such schemes do not utilize a random selection of information on the card and do not utilize the sending of coordinate information since the column information is known apriori. As such, only the authentication information is apparently communicated. If the sender sends authentication information and it is valid as determined by the recipient, the recipient crosses the authentication information off the card. The next time authentication is required, the next authentication information in the same column is then used. As such, a sequential and non-random approach is used. However, if the authentication card of a recipient is lost or obtained by an unscrupulous party, they would know how to act as a sender since they know which authentication information is next in the column since no random selection is utilized and since the card has markings thereon. In this system no coordinate information is sent since the column of information used to authenticate a sender is made known apriori to the sender and receiver. In addition, if the receiver does not receive the sender's transmission, the synchronization between the sender and receiver would be lost which may cause subsequent authentication attempts to fail.","Also, information security and user identification security are becoming increasingly important as technology becomes more sophisticated. For example, multi-factor authentication schemes are used in an attempt to thwart hackers or to thwart other inappropriate uses of information and user identities. For example, a two factor authentication scheme may use information known to a recipient or user such as a password or personal identification number (PIN) as well as some type of physical token such as a banking card, credit card, password token or other physical token which a user must be in physical possession of in order to initiate and complete an on-line transaction. Another level of authentication may include biometric authentication that may include the scanning of a fingerprint, eye or other biometric to again verify that the user attempting to gain access to a process, device, application or other right is in fact the appropriate user.","Transaction cards are known that may include for example smart cards, magnetic strip-based cards, and other transaction cards that facilitate banking transactions, credit card transactions, or any other suitable transactions. As known in the art, a user personal identification number (PIN) is usually required in addition to the possession of a banking card to obtain cash from a cash-dispensing machine or to otherwise carry out an online transaction. One known multi-factor authentication technique employs the use of a hardware token such as a battery operated smart card that displays a periodically changing and seemingly random number on a portion of the smart card. When a user wishes to execute a transaction with the smart card, for example, the user enters the seemingly random number that changes often. The receiving transaction server compares the received code entered by the user as displayed on the smart card with a corresponding number generated by a code source generator. If the code entered by the user matches the number generated by the code source generator, the transaction is approved and the user is granted a particular right such as accessing a bank account, purchasing goods, obtaining information, gaining access to a website or other software application, or any other suitable right as desired. However, such hardware tokens can be quite expensive and are battery powered thereby requiring changing of the battery and the potential of an electronic malfunction due to moisture problems or any other problems related to electronic circuitry.","Other smart cards that do not employ such screens typically require a card reader that reads, for example, a magnetic strip. This can be a restriction where a user wishes to perform an online transaction but is not sitting at a terminal that contains or has access to a magnetic strip reader.","In an apparently unrelated field, translucent cards are known such as plastic cards that contain a semi-transparent picture or pattern that when visually evaluated does not appear to connote any particular information. However, when the translucent card is held over a display with a corresponding background filter pattern, the combination of the pattern on the card with the background pattern on the display screen combine to present a visually recognizable message or word such as the word \u201csorry\u201d or \u201cyou're a winner\u201d. These are static messages which are not unique to any user and typically include only a single message. Such plastic cards may be used for example to see if a holder has won a prize. The card for example may be mailed in the mail to members of a population. Those recipients then go to a web page identified on the translucent card or otherwise indicated in the mailing information to see if they have won a prize. However, such plastic cards do not provide multi-factor authentication, are not user specific, do not include multiple messages and typically include static messages.","Accordingly, a need exists for a method and apparatus that overcomes one or more of the above problems.","Briefly, a method for providing mutual authentication between a user and a sending unit, (i.e. target resource) in one embodiment, includes determining, for a user that has been assigned an article, such as a card or other suitable article that has indicia thereon, desired sender authentication information that corresponds to actual sender authentication information that is embodied on the article. The sender authentication information can be located on the article by using the location information provided by the sending unit in a challenge. The method includes determining for the user, corresponding article identification information, such as a serial number that has been assigned to the article, or a shared secret, and sending a challenge for the user wherein the challenge includes at least location information, to allow the user to identify desired sender authentication information located on the article, and sending the article identification information. The user then receives the location information and article identification information and uses the article identification information as authenticating information that indicates that the sender has sent the information is trustworthy since the article that is in the possession of the user also includes the article identification information thereon. The user then uses the location information that has been sent to the user device, to determine for example the corresponding desired sender authentication information that is located on the article, such as by column and row information sent by the target resource and sends a reply to the challenge back to the target resource (i.e. sending unit). The sender then authenticates the user based on the reply to the challenge. The reply includes user authentication information obtained from the article namely the desired sender authentication information. If the received sender authentication information sent by the user device (and obtained from the article), based on the location information, matches the desired sender authentication information, the target resource grants suitable access to the user (i.e. the user device). As such, article identification information is sent along with location information by a sender after, for example, a first level of authentication has been determined to be successful. The first level of authentication may include, for example, the user sending a password and user ID to the target resource in an initial stage of a logon procedure, as known in the art, whereafter the sending of the location information and article identifier information is subsequently sent based on a successful first factor authentication process.","In another example, a method for providing mutual authentication does not require the sending of the article identification information to the user, but instead only requires the sending of the location information to allow the user to identify the corresponding authentication information on the article and send a reply back to the target resource for verification. However, in this embodiment, if the reply does not include the expected target resource authentication information as expected by the sending unit, the method includes repeating the same challenge for the user that includes the same location information that was previously sent. This process is repeated over, for example, each successive session, until the user sends the appropriate target source authentication information that was derived from the article based on the location information sent in the challenge.","In addition, suitable devices are also disclosed that carry out the above methods. Also, a combination of the two methods is employed to effect a type of enhanced mutual authentication process.","Also disclosed is a method for providing electronic message authentication that employs an article (also referred to as a member or token), such as a card, sticker, or any other suitable article, that includes sender authentication information and location information, such as row and column headings. In one example, each recipient of interest is issued an article that embodies sender authentication information that is identifiable by corresponding location information such as column and row identifiers. When the sender of an electronic message wants to send a message to a recipient of interest, the sender sends the electronic message and both location information and corresponding desired sender authentication information located at the location identified by the location information. This includes data representing the location and authentication information (such as an index to, a reference to, the location information or authentication information itself, or any suitable representation thereof). The recipient may then, in one embodiment, look on their article (e.g. card) at the corresponding location and see if the sent desired sender authentication information matches the sender authentication information located on the article (also referred to as expected sender authentication information). If a match occurs, then the recipient trusts the sender of the message. The recipient need not send back any information to the sender. As such, a simple card or other article may be used to authenticate a sender of a message to thwart phishing, or other sender authentication problems. Other examples will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art.","In addition, a system for providing electronic message authentication is also disclosed that carries out the above methodology, and a transaction card is also disclosed that includes the location information and sender authentication information thereon in the form of a sticker or as part of the transaction card itself. In yet another embodiment, the article may be a translucent article to allow light to pass therethrough so that a visual filtering pattern and sender authentication information may be sent by a sender along with the message. A user may hold up the article to a display screen and overlay it on the visual filtering pattern sent by the sender. If the resulting sender authentication information matches the results sent in the message, the recipient may trust the sender of the message.","In another embodiment, an apparatus and method for securely providing identification information generates one or more obscured user (e.g., recipient) identifiers for a recipient, such as a plurality of identifiers that are generated based on user secret data such as a password, personal identification number or other secret or non-secret information or identifiers that are not based on user secret data, such as the identifier being randomly generated and then associated with the user. In this case, no user-related information is used, but the identifier can still identify the user. In another embodiment, a single obscured identifier may be used.","In one embodiment, the method and apparatus generates a translucent identification member (TIDM), such as a portion of, or an entire, plastic card, sheet, film, or other suitable member that has a translucent area that includes the one or more obscured identifiers. As used herein, translucent area can also include a transparent area. For example, the translucent identification member may be made from transparent or clear sheets, including smoked plastic or other suitable coloring with the obscured identifiers (including non-character information) printed in ink or otherwise placed thereon or therein. The one or more obscured identifiers may be for example one-time authentication identifiers that are unique to a recipient of the translucent identification member. As such, the translucent identification member or card contains what appears to visually be a random pattern of information.","A corresponding visual filtering pattern is also generated for display on a display device when the user desires to use the translucent identification member. For example, the visual filtering pattern also appears to be random from a visual point of view but when visually combined with the one or more obscured identifiers on the translucent identification member, a designated one of the one or more obscured identifiers is visually revealed. In one embodiment, a user may overlay the translucent identification member over a designated portion of a display device or in the designated portion of a display that displays the visual filtering pattern. A combination of the visual filtering pattern with the pattern of different obscured identifiers on the translucent identification member combine to form a visually revealed single identifier or message from the one or more identifiers. Hence, for example in one embodiment, a seemingly random pattern is generated on a screen which helps ensure only a single identifier is exposed visually to a user that is viewing the translucent identification member which is overlayed on the visual filtering pattern that is being displayed on the display.","Accordingly, if desired, a security officer that has access, for example, to a translucent identification member issuer may use a package of blank cellophane cards that may be used to make the translucent identification members on a local printer. The translucent identification members may be printed having translucent color pattern that serves as the one or more obscured identifiers, or have other suitable indicia that appears to be semi-random or obscured to a user. Use of color or color background may also be used to defeat photocopying attacks. It will be recognized that portions of or all functions of the translucent identification member issuer may be provided through a distribution of providers and networks or through a web based service. For example, a recipient may access a TIDM issuance service through a web connection and locally print the TIDM or receive the TIDM through the mail. Also, identifiers can be provided by one party and sent to another party for printing or manufacturing. Other distribution of operations may also be employed as desired.","Once a visually revealed identifier is presented to a user, a user enters the visually revealed identifier through a user interface where it is compared to an expected identifier. If the entered identifier matches the expected identifier, proper authentication is indicated and a recipient may be granted access to a device, application, or process or other desired right (or submitted data is accepted\u2014e.g. such as a vote). In addition, a list of revoked translucent identification members may also be maintained to prevent compromise due to theft or loss of translucent identification members. The list may be stored in any suitable location and updated by a service provider, translucent identification member issuer or any suitable entity. Since the translucent identification members do not require electronics to generate random numbers, the cost of such translucent identification members may be quite low and their reliability may also be relatively high since they are not susceptible to moisture or other damage typically associated with smart cards.","In an alternative embodiment, a smart card or other transaction card or non-transaction card (e.g., voting card or other suitable card) may include a translucent identification member if desired. Hence a transaction card is disclosed and includes for example a portion containing card identification information (such as a transaction card number, which may be impressed thereon such as through raised printing or electronically or through any other suitable storage mechanism such as magnetic strip or any other suitable mechanism), as well as a portion containing a translucent identification member that has a translucent area that includes one or more obscured identifiers. As such transaction cards such as credit cards, banking cards or any other transaction cards may include a window that contains the translucent identification member or may have a transaction identification number or other identification information affixed to a conventional transaction card to enhance security.","In another embodiment, the role of the translucent identification member and the recipient unit are reversed. For example, in this embodiment, the translucent identification member contains the visual filtering pattern and the display screen displays at least one obscured identifier that may be for example data representing user authentication data that is unique to a user, or other data if desired. The combination of overlaying the translucent identification member (visual filter) over the display that displays an obscured identifier, reveals (un-obscures) the at least one obscured identifier on the screen. The visual filtering pattern on the member stays the same since it is printed on the member, and the displayed obscured identifier is changed during each session or at other suitable intervals.","Accordingly, one or more of the following advantages may result. Since the translucent identification members can be printed by an organization security officer, no manufacturing costs need to be incurred and they can be generated locally for a recipient. Since there need not be electronics, there is no battery to be replaced and no damage from exposure to moisture need occur. No network or radio connectivity is required such as typically required by devices employing magnetic strips. The translucent identification member may be made of plastic or any other suitable material and in any suitable thickness. They are durable and easy to replace in the event of a compromise since they may be produced locally to an organization. Also investment in a substantial network infrastructure to continually generate master codes that are matched with dynamically changing codes on a screen and a smart card can be avoided.","In one embodiment, the displayed visual filtering pattern selectively illuminates a portion of a translucent identification member to visually reveal one of the one or more obscured identifiers. The visual filtering pattern can be changed with each authentication session. The one or more obscured identifiers are printed indicia on a semitransparent (or transparent) card and is preferably unique within a particular domain of users. The one or more obscured identifiers are visually obscured through many suitable techniques such as color shading, ordering of the characters, a combination thereof or any other suitable visual obfuscation technique.  illustrates one example of a system  for securely providing identification information that includes a translucent identification member issuer  operative to generate a secure identification member such as translucent identification member , a visual filter generator , a translucent identification member authentication module , a recipient unit  and memory . In this example, the visual filter generator  and translucent identification member authentication module  are included as part of a translucent identification member authenticator  that may be implemented as one or more software modules executing on a computing unit such as a personal computer, work station, server, hand held device, or any other suitable device or multiple networked devices. The translucent identification member authenticator  is operatively coupled, in this example, to a web server which in turn is operatively coupled to a network such as the Internet  to facilitate web based communication between a recipient unit  and a translucent identification member authenticator . As such multiple circuits are formed by the software and processing device(s). Also, as used herein, circuits also refers to any suitable electronic logic in any suitable form including but not limited to hardware (microprocessors, discrete logic, state machines, digital signal processor etc.), software, firmware or any suitable combination thereof.","The translucent identification member issuer , the visual filter generator , and the translucent identification member authentication module  may be implemented in any suitable manner and is preferably, but not limited to, software modules executing on one or more computing devices that contain one or more processing devices that execute instructions that are stored in memory.","In this example, the translucent identification member issuer  will be described as a local server that generates the translucent identification member  using a printer or other suitable mechanism to generate a translucent identification member . The translucent identification member includes a translucent area that includes one or more obscured identifiers thereon. However, it will be recognized that the translucent identification member issuer  may be included as part of the translucent identification member authenticator , or may be located on any other suitable device including a web server and it will be recognized that any of the software programs described herein may be suitably located on any suitable device or devices as well.","The memory  may be any suitable local or distributed memory and may be located on a web server or locally if desired. The memory may be RAM, ROM or any suitable memory technology. The recipient unit  may be any suitable device such as a laptop computer, desktop computer, hand held device or any other suitable device that includes a display  and user interface, and may include one or more processing devices that execute instructions stored in any suitable memory. The recipient device includes the requisite circuitry to provide one or more user interfaces such as graphic user interfaces through web browsers or other applications or operating systems and may include speech recognition interfaces or any suitable user input interfaces. As such the units include a display circuit operative to display a visual filtering pattern defined such that when the visual filtering pattern is visually combined with one or more obscured identifiers located on a translucent identification member, a designated one of the one or more identifiers is visually revealed; and an input interface operative to receive data representing the visually revealed identifier. In one example, a user interface is used to request entry of a serial number associated with the translucent identification member; and request entry of the revealed identifier to determine whether to grant a desired right for the recipient.","Also if desired, a receiver unit can receive the filter or obscured identifiers for display on a display screen and send the response back through a completely different device (or through a completely different channel) such as a cell phone, by SMS message, email message or other suitable channel and\/or device.","Referring also to , a method for securely providing identification information will be described. As shown in block , a recipient sends a request into the translucent identification member issuer  through the Internet or through any other suitable mechanism to request issuance of a translucent identification member . This may be done for example by a recipient registering with an online financial institution with user-supplied data such as a password or other secret information. This is shown as recipient specific information  that is received by the translucent identification member issuer .","As shown in block , the method includes generating one or more obscured identifiers for a recipient, which may be based on, for example, the recipient specific information  and\/or other information . The other information  may be a translucent identification member serial number or other suitable information if desired. This may be done for example by the translucent identification member issuer , or any other suitable entity. As shown in block , the method includes generating the translucent identification member  that has a translucent area  that includes one or more obscured identifiers . The one or more obscured identifiers  are generated by the translucent identification member issuer  in this example and stored in memory  in a database form. The one or more obscured identifiers are stored in memory  so that they may be subsequently accessed when it becomes necessary to create appropriate visual patterns  to reveal the desired revealed identifier  or when checking the returned revealed identifier .","For example, the translucent identification member issuer  may control a printer to print a cellophane card as a translucent identification member  that has printed thereon one or more obscured identifiers. One example of a translucent identification member is shown in . The translucent identification member  can be made of any suitable material such as plastic or any other suitable material that provides some level of transparency so that a combination of the one or more obscured identifiers when overlayed on a display that emits light, allows the light energy (or lack of light energy) from the display to combine with the one or more obscured identifiers to visually designate one of the one or more identifiers on a translucent identification member. The one or more identifiers on a translucent identification member may also be a plurality of different obscured identifiers.","The translucent identification member  may be a card, sheet, film or other member that may include if desired any suitable adhesive or connecting structure to be applied over a window of a transaction card, or any other suitable material. The translucent identification member may also be connected to a transaction card, such as, for example, by using a suitable connecting structure to join the translucent identification member to an end or side of a transaction card. The one or more obscured identifiers  that are printed on the translucent identification member , as noted above, may be characters (e.g., ASCII), symbols, print patterns, colored versions thereof or any other suitable indicia. The one or more obscured identifiers  appear to be visually obscured and hence seemingly random when viewed by a recipient. In other embodiments it may be desirable to print patterns of ink that do not connote characters but instead visually conceal a message or other information so that when overlayed on top of a display the pattern generated by the display in combination with the printed image, allows the viewer to visually decipher a revealed identifier.","The translucent area  includes an information pattern that represents one or more identifiers that may be unique identification information that may be used for one or more authentication sessions or other purposes. The information pattern represented by one or more obscured identifiers is preferably unique to a given domain of users to reduce the likelihood of the same user obtaining a same translucent identification member with the same obscured identifiers. The translucent area  is configured (e.g. sized) to overlay at least a portion of the display screen  on the recipient unit . In one embodiment, each of the one or more obscured identifiers may serve as one-time authentication identifiers for the recipient of the translucent identification member. It is noted, as used herein, identification information includes any information used to directly or indirectly authenticate a user (e.g., TIDM recipient) or other process of interest, or to get access to a desired right associated with a process or device, or any other suitable information that is intended to be kept secret except at the time a transaction is to be effected.","To make the TIDM, the method may include receiving a request from a user for one or more obscured user identifiers and recording a link between the user and the identification information associated with the one or more obscured user identifiers. The method may include providing the one or more obscured user identifiers to the user wherein the one or more obscured user identifiers are on a translucent identification member that is sent to the user, the one or more obscured user identifiers are sent to a third party to be placed on a translucent identification member for the user, the one or more obscured user identifiers are sent to the user for placement on a translucent identification member, and the one or more obscured user identifiers are selected from a pre-existing pool of obscured user identifiers. The request from the user may include user specific information and the user specific information may be used to create the one or more obscured identifiers or may be combined with other information to produce the one or more obscured user identifiers.","As shown in block , once the translucent identification member  has been generated and provided to a recipient, the visual filtering generator , or other suitable mechanism generates a visual filtering pattern for display on the display  of the recipient device. When the visual filtering pattern  is displayed by the recipient device, the visual filtering pattern visually combines with the one or more obscured identifiers located on the translucent identification member , to designate one of the one or more identifiers. In other words, the visual filtering pattern filters out undesired identifiers to reveal a selected one of the one or more identifiers.","As shown in block , the method may include overlaying, such as by a recipient, or a device, the translucent identification member  on the displayed filtering pattern  to visually identify a designated one of the obscured identifiers on the translucent identification member . The visually identified identifier is then entered by the recipient to facilitate a transaction or gain access to a specific desired right associated with any process or device of interest.","As shown again in , the steps of  are presented in more detail. As shown in block , generating one or more obscured identifiers for a recipient may be done for example by the translucent identification member issuer  or any other suitable entity by obtaining recipient specific information, such as secret or non-secret data or non-user related information. This process may also be accomplished by using non user-related and non user-supplied material, in which case, the generated one or more obscured identifiers are subsequently associated with a user. When recipient specific information is used, this may be a personal identification number, password, user name, account number or other data provided by the recipient through the recipient unit  or from any other suitable source. This is indicated as recipient specific information . As shown in block  the recipient specific information  is suitably combined, such as through a suitable mathematical function or algorithm, to produce the one or more obscured identifiers . The other information  may be, for example, output generated from a random number generator, the actual translucent identification member serial number  (or other TIDM identification information) that may be printed on the translucent identification member  or stored by the translucent identification member issuer , or any other suitable information. As shown in block , a translucent identification member serial number, or any other suitable information for identifying the translucent identification member, is assigned to the obscured one or more identifiers . It will be recognized that upon an initial request or generation of a translucent identification member that the translucent identification member issuer  may select a translucent identification member serial number and associate therewith the recipient specific information . This information may be combined to generate the one or more obscured identifiers . The translucent identification member serial number  may be stored in memory  for later use by the translucent identification member authenticator  (authenticating a recipient using the translucent identification member ). The order of the steps as described herein with respect to any method may be suitably reordered based on a desired result.","As shown in block , generating the translucent identification member  may include printing the obscured different identifiers in a desired format on a plastic film, sheet or card to produce the translucent identification member . As shown in block , displaying the filtering pattern  on a display may include randomly selecting, from the obscured identifiers, a selected identifier to produce a visual filtering pattern  on display  that reveals the selected one of the obscured identifiers as the identifier to be revealed when the translucent identification member  is overlayed on the visual filtering pattern .","As shown in , and to further illustrate an example, as shown in , the translucent identification member  has printed thereon the translucent identification member serial number  or other identification information and the one or more obscured identifiers  printed in the translucent area . As noted above this may be printed on cellophane material or other material readily accommodated by conventional printers, if desired, to reduce fabrication costs. However any suitable material or manufacturing process may be used. Once the recipient is in possession of the translucent identification member , multi-factor authentication is provided using the translucent identification member .","The filter may be generated in any suitable way. For example, a selected obscured identifier may be chosen from the stored one or more obscured identifiers whose position on the TIDM is defined. The visual filter pattern generator  produces a filtering pattern based on a predefined layout of the TIDM to insure that the filter blocks the proper character locations. Any other suitable technique may also be used.","As shown in , the recipient device  may display, through a web browser or other suitable user interface, an input screen, based on a received HTML page if a web browser is being used, containing fields that receive user input such as a user identifier field , a password field  and the translucent identification member serial number field . The user submits the entered information through suitable interface buttons . This information is then sent to the web server via the Internet and if desired forwarded to the translucent identification member authenticator . As shown in this example the information entered in user ID field  or the password field  may be considered recipient specific information  that was previously entered when the translucent identification member issuer  initially generated the translucent identification member .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"b":["30","14","600","40","30","24","40","20","40","602"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"],"b":["14","40","14","38","40","40","38","700","602","700","24","24","700","14","30","18","700","702","18","702","22","38","702"]},"Referring to  the issuance of a translucent identification member  will be described in more detail by way of an exemplary embodiment. In order to obtain a translucent identification member , a recipient registers with an online bank or other institution using recipient specific information  such as an account number or other information as indicated by registration request . This request is then passed through to a web server . The web server  then communicates with a bank server  which includes for example a customer management system and translucent identification member requester  which may be a suitable software application executing on a processing device if desired or any other suitable structure. The bank server  then generates a translucent identification member issuance request  to the translucent identification member issuer  which may be included in or separate from a suitable server . The translucent identification member issuance request  includes the recipient specific information  entered by the user. In response, the translucent identification member issuer  provides the obscured identifiers  in a response message  and generates and records a translucent identification member serial number  in the memory  along with the associated obscured identifiers  that will appear on the translucent ID member  for the requesting recipient. In this example, the bank server  links the recipient's account with the translucent identification member serial number  and then stores the linked information in a database  for later use. The bank server  then generates the translucent identification member  by, for example, formatting the obscured identifiers  for printing and sending the information to a printer  or other device which then prints out or manufactures the translucent identification member . Hence the translucent identification member serial number  is assigned by the translucent identification member issuer  and is associated (e.g., linked) with the one or more obscured identifiers  and with the user in memory  in a database.","The translucent identification member issuer  may include an information randomizer  and a translucent identification member formatter .

The challenge is preferably particular to each user and must be retrieved, based on the identity or user authentication information from the first level user authentication process. This ensures that the user is presented with the same challenge until successful authentication is complete.

The reply includes the sender authentication information located on the article, defined by the location information. If the article identifier in the challenge matches the article identifier on the article that is in the possession of the user, then the user trusts the sending unit. As shown in block , the method includes authenticating the user based on the reply to the challenge. In this example, again a first level of authentication is preferably carried out that was previously described based on a user password and\/or user ID. If that level of authentication is successful, then the method shown in  may be suitably carried out. As also noted, the article identification information may include a shared secret known to the user and to the sender or may be an article serial number, or any other suitable information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0126"},"figref":["FIG. 27","FIGS. 25 and 26","FIGS. 25 and 26"],"b":["2700","32","2702"]},"Among other advantages, the described apparatus systems and methods provide secure authentication of both the end user and sending unit or target organization and may be relatively easy to use and relatively inexpensive to produce and distribute such as the authentication cards versus more complex technologies such as smart cards, hardware tokens or public key infrastructures. In addition, the system may be readily implemented using web clients across multiple communication channels for mobile devices, non-mobile devices, voice activated devices or any other suitable devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0128"},"figref":"FIG. 28","b":["2800","2800","2402","2802","2402","2414","2416","2402"]},"The above detailed description of the invention and the examples described therein have been presented for the purposes of illustration and description and that other variations will be recognized by those in the art.
