title: Printer with foldable protective cover and print media feed mechanism
abstract: A printer includes a hollow body. The body houses an ink ejection printhead coupled to circuitry. In addition, the body bears a user interface. A foldable cover is pivotally mounted to the body to protectively cover the user interface. A print media feed mechanism includes a single motor driving rollers. The feed mechanism is configured to both grip an endmost sheet of print media from a print media stack and feed print media past the ink ejection printhead during printing. The operation of the feed mechanism is conditional upon the driven direction of the motor.

The printer utilizes an 8\u2033 page-width drop-on-demand microelectromechanical inkjet (\u201cMemjet\u201d) printhead which produces 1600 dots per inch (dpi) bi-level CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, black). It prints 30 full-color A4 or Letter pages per minute, and is intended as an entry-level desktop printer. The printer has been designated as iPrint and will be referred to by that name in the following description.","1.1 Operational Overview","iPrint reproduces black text and graphics directly using bi-level black, and continuous-tone (contone) images and graphics using dithered bi-level CMYK. For practical purposes, iPrint supports a black resolution of 800 dpi, and a contone resolution of 267 pixels per inch (ppi).","iPrint is, in use, attached to a workstation or personal computer (PC) via a relatively low-speed (1.5 MBytes\/s) universal serial bus (USB) connection [14]. iPrint relies on the PC to render each page to the level of contone pixels and black dots. The PC compresses each rendered page to less than 3 MB for sub-two-second delivery to the printer. iPrint decompresses and prints the page line by line at the speed of the Memjet printhead. iPrint contains sufficient buffer memory for two compressed pages (6 MB), allowing it to print one page while receiving the next, but does not contain sufficient buffer memory for even a single uncompressed page (119 MB).","1.2 Page Width","The standard Memjet nozzle layout has a half-inch unit cell, and so can be trivially adapted to page widths which are multiples of half an inch. Arbitrary page widths can be achieved with custom nozzle layouts, in markets which justify such specialisation. The initial Memjet building block is a widely useful four-inch printhead which makes efficient use of a six-inch silicon wafer. The iPrint design therefore assumes an eight-inch Memjet printhead, made up of two four-inch printheads joined together. The use of a wider print-head to achieve full bleed on A4\/Letter pages only affects a few aspects of the iPrint design\u2014specifically the exact mechanical design, and the logic of the printhead interface.","2 Memjet-Based Printing","A Memjet printhead produces 1600 dpi bi-level CMYK. On low-diffusion paper, each ejected drop forms an almost perfectly circular 22.5 micron diameter dot. Dots are easily produced in isolation, allowing dispersed-dot dithering to be exploited to its fullest. Since the Memjet printhead is page-width and operates with a constant paper velocity, the four color planes are printed in perfect registration, allowing ideal dot-on-dot printing. Since there is consequently no spatial interaction between color planes, the same dither matrix is used for each color plane.","A page layout may contain a mixture of images, graphics and text. Continuous-tone (contone) images and graphics are reproduced using a stochastic dispersed-dot dither. Unlike a clustered-dot (or amplitude-modulated) dither, a dispersed-dot (or frequency-modulated) dither reproduces high spatial frequencies (i.e. image detail) almost to the limits of the dot resolution, while simultaneously reproducing lower spatial frequencies to their full color depth. A stochastic dither matrix is carefully designed to be free of objectionable low-frequency patterns when tiled across the image. As such its size typically exceeds the minimum size required to support a number of intensity levels (i.e. 16\u00d716\u00d78 bits for 257 intensity levels). iPrint uses a dither volume of size 64\u00d764\u00d73\u00d78 bits. The volume provides an extra degree of freedom during the design of the dither by allowing a dot to change states multiple times through the intensity range (rather than just once as in a conventional dither matrix).","Human contrast sensitivity peaks at a spatial frequency of about 3 cycles per degree of visual field and then falls off logarithmically, decreasing by a factor of 100 and becoming difficult to measure beyond about 40 cycles per degree [2]. At a normal viewing distance of between 400 mm and 250 mm, this translates roughly to 150-250 cycles per inch (cpi) on the printed page, or 300-500 samples per inch according to Nyquist's theorem. Taking into account the fact that color sensitivity is less acute than grayscale sensitivity, contone resolution beyond about 400 pixels per inch (ppi) is therefore of limited utility, and in fact contributes slightly to color error through the dither.","Black text and graphics are reproduced directly using bi-level black dots, and are therefore not antialiased (i.e. low-pass filtered) before being printed. Text is therefore supersampled beyond the perceptual limits discussed above, to produce smooth edges when spatially integrated. Text resolution up to about 1200 dpi continues to contribute to perceived text sharpness (assuming low-diffusion paper, of course).","3.1 Constraints","USB (Universal Serial Bus) is the standard low-speed peripheral connection on new PCs [4]. The standard high-speed peripheral connection, IEEE 1394, is recommended but unfortunately still optional in the PC 99 specification [5], and so may not be in widespread use when iPrint is first launched. iPrint therefore connects to a personal computer (PC) or workstation via USB, and the speed of the USB connection therefore imposes the most significant constraint on the architecture of the iPrint system. At a sustained printing rate of 30 pages\/minute, USB at 1.5 MByte\/s imposes an average limit of 3 MB\/page. Since the act of interrupting a Memjet-based printer during the printing of a page produces a visible discontinuity, it is advantageous for the printer to receive the entire page before commencing printing, to eliminate the possibility of buffer underrun. Since the printer can contain only limited buffer memory, i.e. two pages' worth or 6 MB, then the 3 MB\/page limit must be considered absolute.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","2","3"]},"Other desktop connection options provide similar bandwidth to USB, and so impose similar constraints on the architecture. These include the parallel port at 2 MB\/s, and 10Base-T Ethernet at around 1 MB\/s.","3.2 Page Rendering and Compression","Page rendering (or rasterization) can be split between the PC and printer in various ways. Some printers support a full page description language (PDL) such as Postscript, and contain correspondingly sophisticated renderers. Other printers provide special support only for rendering text, to achieve high text resolution. This usually includes support for built-in or downloadable fonts. In each case the use of an embedded renderer reduces the rendering burden on the PC and reduces the amount of data transmitted from the PC to the printer. However, this comes at a price. These printers are more complex than they might be, and are often unable to provide full support for the graphics system of the PC, through which application programs construct, render and print pages. They often fail to exploit the high performance of current PCs, and are unable to leverage projected exponential growth in PC performance.","iPrint relies on the PC  to render pages, i.e. contone images and graphics to the pixel level, and black text and graphics to the dot level. iPrint  contains only a simple rendering engine which dithers the contone data and combines the results with any foreground bi-level black text and graphics. This strategy keeps the printer simple, and independent of any page description language or graphics system. It fully exploits the high performance of current PCs. The downside of this strategy is the potentially large amount of data which must be transmitted from the PC to the printer. We consequently use compression to reduce this data to the 3 MB\/page required to allow a sustained printing rate of 30 pages\/minute.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["6","7"]},"An 8\u2033 by 11.7\u2033 A4 page has a bi-level CMYK pagesize of 114.3 MBytes at 1600 dpi, and a contone CMYK pagesize of 32.1 MB at 300 ppi.","In the printer driver , we use JPEG compression  to compress the contone data. Although JPEG is inherently lossy, for compression ratios of 10:1 or less the loss is usually negligible [16]. To obtain an integral contone to bi-level ratio, and to provide some compression leeway, we choose a contone resolution of 267 ppi. This yields a contone CMYK pagesize of 25.5 MB, a corresponding compression ratio of 8.5:1 to fit within the 3 MB\/page limit, and a contone to bi-level ratio of 1:6 in each dimension.","A full page of black text (and\/or graphics) rasterized at printer resolution (1600 dpi) yields a bi-level image of 28.6 MB. Since rasterizing text at 1600 dpi places a heavy burden on the PC for a small gain, we choose to rasterize text at a fully acceptable 800 dpi. This yields a bi-level image of 7.1 MB, requiring a lossless compression ratio of less than 2.5:1 to fit within the 3 MB\/page limit. We achieve this with a two-dimensional compression scheme adapted from Group 4 Facsimile, all indicated generally at 10.","As long as the image and text regions of a page are non-overlapping, any combination of the two fits within the 3 MB limit. If text lies on top of a background image, then the worst case is a compressed pagesize approaching 6 MB (depending on the actual text compression ratio). This fits within the printer's page buffer memory, but prevents double-buffering of pages in the printer, thereby reducing the printer's page rate by two-thirds, i.e. to 10 pages\/minute.","3.3 Page Expansion and Printing","As described above, the PC renders contone images and graphics to the pixel level, and black text and graphics to the dot level. These are compressed  by different means and transmitted together to the printer.","The printer contains two 3 MB page buffers\u2014one 12 for the page being received from the PC, and one 13 for the page being printed. The printer expands the compressed page as it is being printed. This expansion consists of decompressing the 267 ppi contone CMYK image data , halftoning the resulting contone pixels to 1600 dpi bi-level CMYK dots , decompressing the 800 dpi bi-level black text data , and compositing the resulting bi-level black text dots over the corresponding bi-level CMYK image dots .","The conceptual data flow from the application to the printed page is illustrated in .","4 Printer Hardware","Because of the simplicity of the page width Memjet printhead, iPrint is very compact. It measures just 270 mm wide\u00d785 mm deep\u00d777 mm high when closed.  is a pictorial view of the iPrint  when closed.","The cover  opens to form part of the paper tray, as shown in . A second part  is hinged within cover  and opens to extend the paper tray. A paper exit tray  is slideably extendable from the front of the printer.","The front panel , revealed when cover  is opened, contains the user interface\u2014the power button  and power indicator LED , the paper feed button , and the out-of-paper  and ink low  LEDs.","4.1 Paper Path","iPrint uses a standard paper transport mechanism. The paper path  is illustrated in , in which a single stepper motor  drives both the sheet feed roller  and the paper transport. When running in the forward direction the stepper motor drives the paper drive roller  and the pinch wheels  at the start and end of the active paper path, respectively. When reversed, the stepper motor drives the sheet feed roller  which grabs the topmost sheet from the sheet feeder and transports it the short distance to the paper drive roller  where it is detected by the mechanical media sensor .","The paper centering sliders  ensure that the paper is centered. This ensures that a single centered media sensor detects the sheet, and also ensures that sheets wider than the printhead are printed with balanced margins.","4.1.1 Memjet Printhead","The replaceable Memjet printhead cartridge  is also shown in . This represents one of the four possible ways to deploy the printhead in conjunction with the ink cartridge in a product such as iPrint:\n\n","Under the printhead cartridge  is a printhead assembly  and a printhead capping mechanism , illustrated in pictorial cut away view in  and in section in . When not in use, the Memjet printhead  remains filled with ink, and so must be capped to prevent evaporation of ink through the nozzles. Ink evaporation can lead to gradual deposition of ink components which can impair nozzle operation.","iPrint includes a mechanical page width capping mechanism  which consists of a pivoting capping molding  with an elastomeric seal  and sponge . When the printhead is not in use, the capping molding  is held by a spring against the face of the printhead assembly , and the elastomeric seal  conforms to the face of the printhead assembly and creates an airtight seal around the printhead . The sponge  is used to catch drops ejected during the printhead cleaning cycle. When the printhead is in use, the capping molding  is held away from the printhead assembly  and out of the paper path.","The capping molding  is offset by a set of flexible arms  from a rod . The capping molding  and arms  pivot with the rod  about its axis. A slip wheel  is mounted at the end of rod . The slip wheel  makes contact with a drive wheel . When printing is occurring, the drive wheel  is coupled to the paper transport motor and is driven in the uncapping direction . This causes the slip wheel  and rod  to rotate about its axis and swings the capping molding  away from the printhead. Once the slip wheel rotates to the uncapping slip point , the slip wheel and the capping molding stop rotating. When printing is complete, the drive wheel is reversed and driven in the capping direction . Once the slip wheel rotates to the capping slip point , the slip wheel and the capping molding stop rotating, and the capping spring holds the capping plate in place against the face of the printhead assembly. The flexible arms  help the capping plate  conform to the face of the printhead assembly .","4.2 Printer Controller","The printer controller  is illustrated in , and consists of a small PCB  with only a few components\u2014a 64 Mbit RDRAM , the iPrint Central Processor (ICP) chip , a speaker  for notifying the user of error conditions, a QA chip , an external 3V DC power connection , an external USB connection , a connection to the paper transport stepper motor , and the flex PCB  which connects to the media sensor , LEDs ,  and , buttons  and , and a link  the printhead .","4.3 Ink Cartridge and Ink Path","There are two versions of the ink cartridge\u2014one large, one small. Both fit in the same ink cartridge slot at the back of the iPrint unit.","5 Printer Control Protocol","This section describes the printer control protocol used between a host and iPrint. It includes control and status handling as well as the actual page description.","5.1 Control and Status The USB device class definition for printers [15] provides for emulation of both unidirectional and bidirectional IEEE 1284 parallel ports [3]. At its most basic level, this allows the host to determine printer capabilities (via GET_DEVICE_ID), obtain printer status (via GET_PORT_STATUS), and reset the printer (via SOFT_RESET). Centronics\/IEEE 1284 printer status fields are described in Table 1 below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0100"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Centronics\/IEEE 1284 printer status"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["field","description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Select","The printer is selected and available for data transfer."]},{"entry":["Paper Empty","A paper empty condition exists in the printer."]},{"entry":["Fault","A fault condition exists in the printer (includes Paper"]},{"entry":[{},"Empty and not Select)."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Personal computer printing subsystems typically provide some level of IEEE 1284 support. Compatibility with IEEE 1284 in a printer therefore simplifies the development of the corresponding printer driver. The USB device class definition for printers seeks to leverage this same compatibility.","iPrint supports no control protocol beyond the USB device class definition for printers. Note that, if a higher-level control protocol were defined, then conditions such as out-of-ink could also be reported to the user (rather than just via the printer's out-of-ink LED).","iPrint receives page descriptions as raw transfers, i.e. not encapsulated in any higher-level control protocol.","5.2 Page Description","iPrint reproduces black at full dot resolution (1600 dpi), but reproduces contone color at a somewhat lower resolution using halftoning. The page description is therefore divided into a black layer and a contone layer. The black layer is defined to composite over the contone layer.","The black layer consists of a bitmap containing a 1-bit opacity for each pixel. This black layer matte has a resolution which is an integer factor of the printer's dot resolution. The highest supported resolution is 1600 dpi, i.e. the printer's full dot resolution.","The contone layer consists of a bitmap containing a 32-bit CMYK color for each pixel. This contone image has a resolution which is an integer factor of the printer's dot resolution. The highest supported resolution is 267 ppi, i.e. one-sixth the printer's dot resolution.","The contone resolution is also typically an integer factor of the black resolution, to simplify calculations in the printer driver. This is not a requirement, however.","The black layer and the contone layer are both in compressed form for efficient transmission over the low-speed USB connection to the printer.","5.2.1 Page Structure","iPrint has a printable page area which is determined by the width of its printhead, the characteristics of its paper path, and the size of the currently selected print medium.","The printable page area has a maximum width of 8\u2033. If the physical page width exceeds 8\u2033, then symmetric left and right margins are implicitly created. If the physical page width is less than 8\u2033, then the printable page width is reduced accordingly. The printable page area has no maximum length. It is simply the physical page length, less the top and bottom margins imposed by the characteristics of the paper path.","The target page size is constrained by the printable page area, less the explicit (target) left and top margins specified in the page description.","In theory iPrint does not impose a top or bottom margin\u2014i.e. it allows full bleed in the vertical direction. In practice, however, since iPrint is not designed as a full-bleed A4\/Letter printer because it uses an 8\u2033 printhead, an artificial top and bottom margin is imposed to avoid having to include a sponge large enough to cope with regular off-edge printing.","5.2.2 Page Description Format","Table 2 shows the format of the page description expected by iPrint.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0114"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Page description format"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["field","format","description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["signature","16-bit integer","Page description format signature."]},{"entry":["version","16-bit integer","Page description format version number."]},{"entry":["structure size","16-bit integer","Size of fixed-size part of page"]},{"entry":[{},{},"description."]},{"entry":["target resolution (dpi)","16-bit integer","Resolution of target page.

If the signature and\/or version are missing or incompatible with the printer, then the printer can reject the page.","The page description defines the resolution and size of the target page. The black and contone layers are clipped to the target page if necessary. This happens whenever the black or contone scale factors are not factors of the target page width or height.","The target left and top margins define the positioning of the target page within the printable page area.","The black layer parameters define the pixel size of the black layer, its integer scale factor to the target resolution, and the size of its compressed page data.

The bi-level data represents scanned black text and graphics on a white background, and the algorithm is tuned for this class of images (it is explicitly not tuned, for example, for halftoned bi-level images). The 1D Group 3 algorithm runlength-encodes each scanline and then Huffman-encodes the resulting runlengths. Runlengths in the range 0 to 63 are coded with terminating codes. Runlengths in the range 64 to 2623 are coded with make-up codes, each representing a multiple of 64, followed by a terminating code. Runlengths exceeding 2623 are coded with multiple make-up codes followed by a terminating code. The Huffman tables are fixed, but are separately tuned for black and white runs (except for make-up codes above 1728, which are common). When possible, the 2D Group 3 algorithm encodes a scanline as a set of short edge deltas (0, \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13) with reference to the previous scanline. The delta symbols are entropy-encoded (so that the zero delta symbol is only one bit long etc.) Edges within a 2D-encoded line which can't be delta-encoded are runlength-encoded, and are identified by a prefix. 1D- and 2D-encoded lines are marked differently. 1D-encoded lines are generated at regular intervals, whether actually required or not, to ensure that the decoder can recover from line noise with minimal image degradation. 2D Group 3 achieves compression ratios of up to 6:1 [13].","The Group 4 Facsimile algorithm [1] losslessly compresses bi-level data for transmission over error-free communications lines (i.e. the lines are truly error-free, or error-correction is done at a lower protocol level). The Group 4 algorithm is based on the 2D Group 3 algorithm, with the essential modification that since transmission is assumed to be error-free, 1D-encoded lines are no longer generated at regular intervals as an aid to error-recovery. Group 4 achieves compression ratios ranging from 20:1 to 60:1 for the CCITT set of test images [13].","The design goals and performance of the Group 4 compression algorithm qualify it as a compression algorithm for the bi-level black layer. However, its Huffman tables are tuned to a lower scanning resolution (100-400 dpi), and it encodes runlengths exceeding 2623 awkwardly. At 800 dpi, our maximum runlength is currently 6400. Although a Group 4 decoder core might be available for use in the printer controller chip (Section 7), it might not handle runlengths exceeding those normally encountered in 400 dpi facsimile applications, and so would require modification.","Since most of the benefit of Group 4 comes from the delta-encoding, a simpler algorithm based on delta-encoding alone is likely to meet our requirements. This approach is described in detail below.","5.2.3.2 Bi-Level Edge Delta and Runlength (EDRL) Compression Format","The edge delta and runlength (EDRL) compression format is based loosely on the Group 4 compression format and its precursors [1][17].","EDRL uses three kinds of symbols, appropriately entropy-coded. These are create edge, kill edge, and edge delta. Each line is coded with reference to its predecessor. The predecessor of the first line is defined to a line of white. Each line is defined to start off white. If a line actually starts of black (the less likely situation), then it must define a black edge at offset zero.

It introduces imperceptible image degradation at compression ratios below 5:1, and negligible image degradation at compression ratios below 10:1 [16].","JPEG typically first transforms the image into a color space which separates luminance and chrominance into separate color channels. This allows the chrominance channels to be subsampled without appreciable loss because of the human visual system's relatively greater sensitivity to luminance than chrominance. After this first step, each color channel is compressed separately.","The image is divided into 8\u00d78 pixel blocks. Each block is then transformed into the frequency domain via a discrete cosine transform (DCT). This transformation has the effect of concentrating image energy in relatively lower-frequency coefficients, which allows higher-frequency coefficients to be more crudely quantized. This quantization is the principal source of compression in JPEG. Further compression is achieved by ordering coefficients by frequency to maximise the likelihood of adjacent zero coefficients, and then runlength-encoding runs of zeroes. Finally, the runlengths and non-zero frequency coefficients are entropy coded. Decompression is the inverse process of compression.","5.2.4.2 CMYK Contone JPEG Compression Format","The CMYK contone layer is compressed to an interleaved color JPEG bytestream. The interleaving is required for space-efficient decompression in the printer, but may restrict the decoder to two sets of Huffman tables rather than four (i.e. one per color channel) [16]. If luminance and chrominance are separated, then the luminance channels can share one set of tables, and the chrominance channels the other set.","If luminance\/chrominance separation is deemed necessary, either for the purposes of table sharing or for chrominance subsampling, then CMY is converted to YCrCb and Cr and Cb are duly subsampled.

A four-inch printhead contains 8 such segments for a total of 25,600 nozzles.","6.1.1 Grouping of Nozzles within a Segment","The nozzles within a single segment are grouped for reasons of physical stability as well as minimization of power consumption during printing. In terms of physical stability, a total of 10 nozzles share the same ink reservoir. In terms of power consumption, groupings are made to enable a low-speed and a high-speed printing mode.","The printhead supports two printing speeds to allow speed\/power consumption trade-offs to be made in different product configurations.","In the low-speed printing mode, 128 nozzles are fired simultaneously from each 4-inch printhead.

The exact distance between the nozzles will depend on the properties of the Memjet firing mechanism.

A chromapod represents different color components of the same horizontal set of 10 dots on different lines. The exact distance between different color pods depends on the Memjet operating parameters, and may vary from one Memjet design to another. The distance is considered to be a constant number of dot-widths, and must therefore be taken into account when printing: the dots printed by the cyan nozzles will be for different lines than those printed by the magenta, yellow or black nozzles. The printing algorithm must allow for a variable distance up to about 8 dot-widths between colors.  illustrates a single chromapod.","6.1.1.3 Five Chromapods Make a Podgroup","5 chromapods  are organized into a single podgroup .

A Print Cycle involves the firing of up to all of these nozzles, dependent on the information to be printed. A Load Cycle involves the loading up of the printhead with the information to be printed during the subsequent Print Cycle.","Each nozzle has an associated NozzleEnable bit that determines whether or not the nozzle will fire during the Print Cycle. The NozzleEnable bits (one per nozzle) are loaded via a set of shift registers.","Logically there are 4 shift registers per segment (one per color), each 800 deep. As bits are shifted into the shift register for a given color they are directed to the lower and upper nozzles on alternate pulses. Internally, each 800-deep shift register is comprised of two 400-deep shift registers: one for the upper nozzles, and one for the lower nozzles. Alternate bits are shifted into the alternate internal registers. As far as the external interface is concerned however, there is a single 800 deep shift register.","Once all the shift registers have been fully loaded (800 load pulses), all of the bits are transferred in parallel to the appropriate NozzleEnable bits. This equates to a single parallel transfer of 25,600 bits. Once the transfer has taken place, the Print Cycle can begin. The Print Cycle and the Load Cycle can occur simultaneously as long as the parallel load of all NozzleEnable bits occurs at the end of the Print Cycle.","6.1.2.1 Load Cycle","The Load Cycle is concerned with loading the printhead's shift registers with the next Print Cycle's NozzleEnable bits.","Each segment has 4 inputs directly related to the cyan, magenta, yellow and black shift registers. These inputs are called CDataIn, MDataIn, YDataIn and KDataIn. Since there are 8 segments, there are a total of 32 color input lines per 4-inch printhead. A single pulse on the SRClock line (shared between all 8 segments) transfers the 32 bits into the appropriate shift registers. Alternate pulses transfer bits to the lower and upper nozzles respectively. Since there are 25,600 nozzles, a total of 800 pulses are required for the transfer. Once all 25,600 bits have been transferred, a single pulse on the shared PTransfer line causes the parallel transfer of data from the shift registers to the appropriate NozzleEnable bits.","The parallel transfer via a pulse on PTransfer must take place after the Print Cycle has finished. Otherwise the NozzleEnable bits for the line being printed will be incorrect.","Since all 8 segments are loaded with a single SRClock pulse, any printing process must produce the data in the correct sequence for the printhead. As an example, the first SRClock pulse will transfer the CMYK bits for the next Print Cycle's dot 0, 800, 1600, 2400, 3200, 4000, 4800, and 5600. The second SRClock pulse will transfer the CMYK bits for the next Print Cycle's dot 1, 801, 1601, 2401, 3201, 4001, 4801 and 5601. After 800 SRClock pulses, the PTransfer pulse can be given.","It is important to note that the odd and even CMYK outputs, although printed during the same Print Cycle, do not appear on the same physical output line. The physical separation of odd and even nozzles within the printhead, as well as separation between nozzles of different colors ensures that they will produce dots on different lines of the page. This relative difference must be accounted for when loading the data into the printhead. The actual difference in lines depends on the characteristics of the inkjet mechanism used in the printhead.

To fire them all at once would consume too much power and be problematic in terms of ink refill and nozzle interference. Consequently two firing modes are defined: a low-speed printing mode and a high-speed printing mode:\n\n","The nozzles to be fired in a given firing pulse are determined by\n\n","When one of the PodgroupEnable lines is set, only the specified Podgroup's 4 nozzles will fire as determined by ChromapodSelect and NozzleSelect. When both of the PodgroupEnable lines are set, both of the podgroups will fire their nozzles. For the low-speed mode, two fire pulses are required, with PodgroupEnable=10 and 01 respectively. For the high-speed mode, only one fire pulse is required, with PodgroupEnable=11.","The duration of the firing pulse is given by the AEnable and BEnable lines, which fire the PhasegroupA and PhasegroupB nozzles from all firegroups respectively. The typical duration of a firing pulse is 1.3-1.8 Ts. The duration of a pulse depends on the viscosity of the ink (dependent on temperature and ink characteristics) and the amount of power available to the printhead. See Section 6.1.3 for details on feedback from the printhead in order to compensate for temperature change.","The AEnable and BEnable are separate lines in order that the firing pulses can overlap. Thus the 200 phases of a low-speed Print Cycle consist of 100 A phases and 100 B phases, effectively giving 100 sets of Phase A and Phase B. Likewise, the 100 phases of a high-speed print cycle consist of 50 A phases and 50 B phases, effectively giving 50 phases of phase A and phase B.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0195","num":"0204"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":["130","131"]},"For the high-speed printing mode, the firing order is:\n\n","For the low-speed printing mode, the firing order is similar. For each phase of the high speed mode where PodgroupEnable was 11, two phases of PodgroupEnable=01 and 10 are substituted as follows:\n\n","When a nozzle fires, it takes approximately 100 Ts to refill. The nozzle cannot be fired before this refill time has elapsed. This limits the fastest printing speed to 100 Ts per line. In the high-speed print mode, the time to print a line is 100 Ts, so the time between firing a nozzle from one line to the next matches the refill time. The low-speed print mode is slower than this, so is also acceptable.","The firing of a nozzle also causes acoustic perturbations for a limited time within the common ink reservoir of that nozzle's pod. The perturbations can interfere with the firing of another nozzle within the same pod. Consequently, the firing of nozzles within a pod should be offset from each other as long as possible. We therefore fire four nozzles from a chromapod (one nozzle per color) and then move onto the next chromapod within the podgroup.","In the low-speed printing mode the podgroups are fired separately. Thus the 5 chromapods within both podgroups must all fire before the first chromapod fires again, totalling 10\u00d72 T cycles. Consequently each pod is fired once per 20 Ts.","In the high-speed printing mode, the podgroups are fired together. Thus the 5 chromapods within a single podgroups must all fire before the first chromapod fires again, totalling 5\u00d72 T cycles. Consequently each pod is fired once per 10 Ts.","As the ink channel is 300 microns long and the velocity of sound in the ink is around 1500 m\/s, the resonant frequency of the ink channel is 2.5 MHz. Thus the low-speed mode allows 50 resonant cycles for the acoustic pulse to dampen, and the high-speed mode allows 25 resonant cycles. Consequently any acoustic interference is minimal in both cases.","6.1.3 Feedback from the Printhead","The printhead produces several lines of feedback (accumulated from the 8 segments). The feedback lines are used to adjust the timing of the firing pulses. Although each segment produces the same feedback, the feedback from all segments share the same tri-state bus lines. Consequently only one segment at a time can provide feedback.","A pulse on the SenseSegSelect line ANDed with data on Cyan selects which segment will provide the feedback. The feedback sense lines will come from the selected segment until the next SenseSegSelect pulse. The feedback sense lines are as follows:\n\n","The printing process has a strong tendency to stay at the equilibrium temperature. To ensure that the first section of the printed photograph has a consistent dot size, the equilibrium temperature must be met before printing any dots. This is accomplished via a preheat cycle.","The Preheat cycle involves a single Load Cycle to all nozzles with 1s (i.e. setting all nozzles to fire), and a number of short firing pulses to each nozzle. The duration of the pulse must be insufficient to fire the drops, but enough to heat up the ink. Altogether about 200 pulses for each nozzle are required, cycling through in the same sequence as a standard Print Cycle.","Feedback during the Preheat mode is provided by Tsense, and continues until equilibrium temperature is reached (about 30\u00b0 C. above ambient). The duration of the Preheat mode is around 50 milliseconds, and depends on the ink composition.","Preheat is performed before each print job. This does not affect performance as it is done while the data is being transferred to the printer.","6.1.5 Cleaning Cycle","In order to reduce the chances of nozzles becoming clogged, a cleaning cycle can be undertaken before each print job. Each nozzle is fired a number of times into an absorbent sponge.","The cleaning cycle involves a single Load Cycle to all nozzles with 1s (i.e. setting all nozzles to fire), and a number of firing pulses to each nozzle. The nozzles are cleaned via the same nozzle firing sequence as a standard Print Cycle. The number of times that each nozzle is fired depends upon the ink composition and the time that the printer has been idle. As with preheat, the cleaning cycle has no effect on printer performance.","6.1.6 Printhead Interface Summary","A single 4-inch printhead has the connections shown in Table

However, there is twice as much data to transfer to the 2 printheads before the next line can be printed. Depending on the desired speed for the output image to be printed, data must be generated and transferred at appropriate speeds in order to keep up.","6.2.2.1 Example","As an example, consider the timing of printing an 8\u2033\u00d712\u2033 page in 2 seconds. In order to print this page in 2 seconds, the 8-inch printhead must print 19,200 lines (12\u00d71600). Rounding up to 20,000 lines in 2 seconds yields a line time of 100 Ts. A single Print Cycle and a single Load Cycle must both finish within this time. In addition, a physical process external to the printhead must move the paper an appropriate amount.","From the printing point of view, the high-speed print mode allows a 4-inch printhead to print an entire line in 100 Ts. Both 4-inch printheads must therefore be run in high-speed print mode to print simultaneously. Therefore 512 nozzles fire per firing pulse, thereby enabling the printing of an 8-inch line within the specified time.","The 800 SRClock pulses to both 4-inch printheads (each clock pulse transferring 32 bits) must also take place within the 100 T line time. If both printheads are loaded simultaneously (64 data lines), the length of an SRClock pulse cannot exceed 100 Ts\/800=125 nanoseconds, indicating that the printhead must be clocked at 8 MHz. If the two printheads are loaded one at a time (32 shared data lines), the length of an SRClock pulse cannot exceed 100 Ts\/1600=62.5 nanoseconds. The printhead must therefore be clocked at 16 MHz. In both instances, the average time to calculate each bit value (for each of the 51,200 nozzles) must not exceed 100 Ts\/51,200=2 nanoseconds. This requires a dot generator running at one of the following speeds:\n\n","The printer controller consists of the iPrint central processor (ICP) chip , a 64 MBit RDRAM , and the master QA chip , as shown in .","The ICP  contains a general-purpose processor  and a set of purpose-specific functional units controlled by the processor via the processor bus, as shown in . Only three functional units are non-standard\u2014the EDRL expander , the halftoner\/compositor , and the printhead interface  which controls the Memjet printhead.","Software running on the processor coordinates the various functional units to receive, expand and print pages. This is described in the next section.","The various functional units of the ICP are described in subsequent sections.","7.2 Page Expansion and Printing","Page expansion and printing proceeds as follows. A page description is received from the host via the USB interface  and is stored in main memory. 6 MB of main memory is dedicated to page storage. This can hold two pages each not exceeding 3 MB, or one page up to 6 MB. If the host generates pages not exceeding 3 MB, then the printer operates in streaming mode\u2014i.e. it prints one page while receiving the next. If the host generates pages exceeding 3 MB, then the printer operates in single-page mode\u2014i.e. it receives each page and prints it before receiving the next. If the host generates pages exceeding 6 MB then they are rejected by the printer. In practice the printer driver prevents this from happening.","A page consists of two parts\u2014the bi-level black layer, and the contone layer. These are compressed in distinct formats\u2014the bi-level black layer in EDRL format, the contone layer in JPEG format. The first stage of page expansion consists of decompressing the two layers in parallel. The bi-level layer is decompressed  by the EDRL expander unit , the contone layer  by the JPEG decoder .","The second stage of page expansion consists of halftoning  the contone CMYK data to bi-level CMYK, and then compositing  the bi-level black layer over the bi-level CMYK layer. The halftoning and compositing is carried out by the halftoner\/compositor unit .","Finally, the composited bi-level CMYK image is printed  via the printhead interface unit , which controls the Memjet printhead.","Because the Memjet printhead prints at high speed, the paper must move past the printhead at a constant velocity. If the paper is stopped because data can't be fed to the printhead fast enough, then visible printing irregularities will occur. It is therefore important to transfer bi-level CMYK data to the printhead interface at the required rate.","A fully-expanded 1600 dpi bi-level CMYK page has a size of 114.3 MB. Because it is impractical to store an expanded page in printer memory, each page is expanded in real time during printing. Thus the various stages of page expansion and printing are pipelined. The page expansion and printing data flow is described in Table 14. The aggregate traffic to\/from main memory of 174 MB\/s is well within the capabilities of current technologies such as

It represents a bi-level image in terms of its edges. Each edge in each line is coded relative to an edge in the previous line, or relative to the previous edge in the same line. No matter how it is coded, each edge is ultimately decoded to its distance from the previous edge in the same line. This distance, or runlength, is then decoded to the string of one bits or zero bits which represent the corresponding part of the image. The decompression algorithm is also defined in Section 5.2.3.2.","The EEU consists of a bitstream decoder , a state machine , edge calculation logic , two runlength decoders  and , and a runlength (re)encoder .","The bitstream decoder  decodes an entropy-coded codeword from the bitstream and passes it to the state machine . The state machine  returns the size of the codeword to the bitstream decoder , which allows the decoder  to advance to the next codeword. In the case of a create edge code, the state machine  uses the bitstream decoder to extract the corresponding runlength from the bitstream. The state machine controls the edge calculation logic and runlength decoding\/encoding as defined in Table 18.","The edge calculation logic is quite simple. The current edge offset in the previous (reference) and current (coding) lines are maintained in the reference edge register  and edge register  respectively. The runlength associated with a create edge code is output directly to the runlength decoders, and is added to the current edge. A delta code is translated into a runlength by adding the associated delta to the reference edge and subtracting the current edge. The generated runlength is output to the runlength decoders, and is added to the current edge. The next runlength is extracted from the runlength encoder  and added to the reference edge . A kill edge code simply causes the current reference edge to be skipped. Again the next runlength is extracted from the runlength encoder and added to the reference edge.","Each time the edge calculation logic  generates a runlength representing an edge, it is passed to the runlength decoders. While the runlength decoder decodes the run it generates a stall signal to the state machine. Since the runlength decoder  is slower than the edge calculation logic, there's not much point in decoupling it. The expanded line accumulates in a line buffer  large enough to hold an 8\u2033 800 dpi line (800 bytes).","The previously expanded line is also buffered . It acts as a reference for the decoding of the current line. The previous line is re-encoded as runlengths on demand. This is less expensive than buffering the decoded runlengths of the previous line, since the worst case is one 13-bit runlength for each pixel (20 KB at 1600 dpi). While the runlength encoder  encodes the run it generates a stall signal to the state machine. The runlength encoder uses the page width  to detect end-of-line. The (current) line buffer  and the previous line buffer  are concatenated and managed as a single FIFO to simplify the runlength encoder .","Runlength decoder  decodes the output runlength to a line buffer  large enough to hold an 8\u2033 1600 dpi line (1600 bytes). The runlength passed to this output runlength decoder is multiplied by the scale factor , so this decoder produces 1600 dpi lines. The line is output scale factor times through the output pixel FIFO . This achieves the required vertical scaling by simple line replication. The EEU could be designed with edge smoothing integrated into its image scaling. A simple smoothing scheme based on template-matching can be very effective [10]. This would require a multi-line buffer between the low-resolution runlength decoder and the smooth scaling unit, but would eliminate the high-resolution runlength decoder.","7.2.2.1 EDRL Stream Decoder","The EDRL stream decoder , illustrated in , decodes entropy-coded EDRL codewords in the input bitstream.

If the first run is actually black (color ), then it must be preceded by a zero-length white run. The runlength decoder keeps track of the current color internally.","The runlength decoder appends a maximum of 8 bits to the output stream every clock. Runlengths are typically not an integer multiple of 8, and so runs other than the first in an image are typically not byte-aligned. The run decoder maintains, in the byte space register , the number of bits available in the byte currently being built. This is initialised to 8 at the beginning of decoding, and on the output of every byte.","The decoder starts outputting a run of bits as soon as the next run line latches a non-zero value into the runlength register . The decoder effectively stalls when the runlength register goes to zero.","A number of bits of the current color are shifted into the output byte register  each clock. The current color is maintained in the 1-bit color register . The number of bits actually output is limited by the number of bits left in the runlength, and by the number of spare bits left in the output byte. The number of bits output is subtracted from the runlength and the byte space. When the runlength goes to zero it has been completely decoded, although the trailing bits of the run may still be in the output byte register, pending output. When the byte space goes to zero the output byte is full and is appended to the output stream.","The 16-bit barrel shifter , the output byte register  and the color register  together implement an 8-bit shift register which can be shifted multiple bit positions every clock, with the color as the serial input.","The external reset line is used to reset the runlength decoder at the start of a line. The external next run line is used to request the decoding of a new runlength. It is accompanied by a runlength on the external runlength lines. The next run line should not be set on the same clock as the reset line. Because next run inverts the current color, the reset of the color sets it to one, not zero. The external flush line is used to flush the last byte of the run, if incomplete. It can be used on a line-by-line basis to yield byte-aligned lines, or on an image basis to yield a byte-aligned image.","The external ready line indicates whether the runlength decoder is ready to decode a runlength.

They are also inefficient to access since each color component requires the retrieval of a different bit from the volume. In practice, there is no need to fully decouple each layer of the dither volume. Each dot column of the volume can be implemented as a fixed set of thresholds rather than 256 separate bits. Using three 8-bit thresholds, for example, only consumes 24 bits. Now, n thresholds define n+1 intensity intervals, within which the corresponding dither cell location is alternately not set or set. The contone pixel value being dithered uniquely selects one of the n+1 intervals, and this determines the value of the corresponding output dot.","We dither the contone data using a triple-threshold 64\u00d764\u00d73\u00d78-bit (12 KB) dither volume.

If dither cell registration is desired between color planes, then the same triple-threshold value can be retrieved once and used to dither each color component. If dither cell registration is not desired, then the dither cell can be split into four sub-cells and stored in four separately addressable ROMs from which four different triple-threshold values can be retrieved in parallel in one cycle.

In addition, the processor is responsible for setting up the appropriate parameters in the DMA controller  for the transfers from memory to the LLFU. This includes loading white (all 0's) into appropriate colors during the start and end of a page so that the page has clean edges.","The internal structure of the Printhead Interface  is shown in .","7.3.1 Line Loader\/Format Unit","The line loader\/format unit (LLFU)  loads the dots for a given print line into local buffer storage and formats them into the order required for the Memjet printhead. It is responsible for supplying the pre-calculated nozzleEnable bits to the Memjet interface for the eventual printing of the page.","A single line in the 8-inch printhead consists of 12,800 4-color dots. At 1 bit per color, a single print line consists of 51,200 bits. These bits must be supplied in the correct order for being sent on to the printhead. See Section 6.1.2.1 for more information concerning the Load Cycle dot loading order, but in summary, 32 bits are transferred at a time to each of the two 4-inch printheads, with the 32 bits representing 4 dots for each of the 8 segments.","The printing uses a double buffering scheme for preparing and accessing the dot-bit information. While one line is being loaded into the first buffer , the pre-loaded line in S the second buffer  is being read in Memjet dot order. Once the entire line has been transferred from the second buffer  to the printhead via the Memjet interface, the reading and writing processes swap buffers. The first buffer  is now read and the second buffer is loaded up with the new line of data. This is repeated throughout the printing process, as can be seen in the conceptual overview of ","The actual implementation of the LLFU is shown in . Since one buffer is being read from while the other is being written to, two sets of address lines must be used. The 32-bits DataIn from the common data bus are loaded depending on the WriteEnables, which are generated by the State Machine in response to the DMA Acknowledges.","A multiplexor  chooses between the two 4-bit outputs of Buffer ,  and Buffer , , and sends the result to an 8-entry by 4-bit shift register . After the first 8 read cycles, and whenever an Advance pulse comes from the MJI, the current 32-bit value from the shift register is gated into the 32-bit Transfer register , where it can be used by the MJI.","7.3.1.1 Buffers","Each of the two buffers  and  is broken into 4 sub-buffers , ,  and , 1 per color. All the even dots are placed before the odd dots in each color's buffer, as shown in .","The 51,200 bits representing the dots in the next line to be printed are stored 12,800 bits per color buffer, stored as 400 32-bit words. The first 200 32-bit words (6400 bits) represent the even dots for the color, while the second 200 32-bit words (6400 bits) represent the odd dots for the color.","The addressing decoding circuitry is such that in a given cycle, a single 32-bit access can be made to all 4 sub-buffers\u2014either a read from all 4 or a write to one of the 4. Only one bit of the 32-bits read from each color buffer is selected, for a total of 4 output bits. The process is shown in . 13 bits of address allow the reading of a particular bit by means of 8-bits of address being used to select 32 bits, and 5-bits of address choose 1-bit from those 32. Since all color buffers share this logic, a single 13-bit address gives a total of 4 bits out, one per color. Each buffer has its own WriteEnable line, to allow a single 32-bit value to be written to a particular color buffer in a given cycle. The 32-bits of DataIn are shared, since only one buffer will actually clock the data in.","7.3.1.2 Address Generation","7.3.1.2.1 Reading","Address Generation for reading is straightforward. Each cycle we generate a bit address which is used to fetch 4 bits representing 1-bit per color for the particular segment. By adding 400 to the current bit address, we advance to the next segment's equivalent dot. We add 400 (not 800) since the odd and even dots are separated in the buffer. We do this 16 times to retrieve the two sets of 32 bits for the two sets of 8 segments representing the even dots (the resultant data is transferred to the MJI 32 bits at a time) and another 16 times to load the odd dots. This 32-cycle process is repeated 400 times, incrementing the start address each time. Thus in 400\u00d732 cycles, a total of 400\u00d732\u00d74 (51,200) dot values are transferred in the order required by the printhead.","In addition, we generate the TransferWriteEnable control signal. Since the LLFU starts before the MJI, we must transfer the first value before the Advance pulse from the MJI. We must also generate the next 32-bit value in readiness for the first Advance pulse. The solution is to transfer the first 32-bit value to the Transfer register after 8 cycles, and then to stall 8-cycles later, waiting for the Advance pulse to start the next 8-cycle group. Once the first Advance pulse arrives, the LLFU is synchronized to the MJI. However, the MJI must be started at least 16 cycles after the LLFU so that the initial Transfer value is valid and the next 32-bit value is ready to be loaded into the Transfer register.","The read process is shown in the following pseudocode:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0318","num":"0354"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00027","num":"00027"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"DotCount = 0"},{"entry":"For DotInSegment0 = 0 to 400"},{"entry":"\u2003CurrAdr = DotInSegment0"},{"entry":"\u2003Do"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003V1 = (CurrAdr=0) OR (CurrAdr=3200)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003V2 = Low 3 bits of DotCount = 0"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003TransferWriteEnable = V1 OR ADVANCE"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003Stall = V2 AND (NOT TransferWriteEnable)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003If (NOT Stall)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003Shift Register=Fetch 4-bits from CurrReadBuffer:CurrAdr"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003CurrAdr = CurrAdr + 400"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003DotCount = (DotCount + 1) MOD 32 (odd&even, printheads 1&2,"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003segments 0-7)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003EndIf"},{"entry":"\u2003Until (DotCount=0) AND (NOT Stall)"},{"entry":"EndFor"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Once the line has finished, the CurrReadBuffer value must be toggled by the processor.","7.3.1.2.2 Writing","The write process is also straightforward. 4 DMA request lines are output to the DMA controller.

The dot count for each color is a 32-bit value, individually cleared, by a signal , under processor control. At 32-bits length, each dot count can hold a maximum coverage dot count of 17 12-inch pages, although in typical usage, the dot count will be read and cleared after each page.","The dot counts are used by the processor to update the QA chip  (see Section 7.5.4.1) in order to predict when the ink cartridge runs out of ink. The processor knows the volume of ink in the cartridge for each of C, M, Y, and K from the QA chip. Counting the number of drops eliminates the need for ink sensors, and prevents the ink channels from running dry. An updated drop count is written to the QA chip after each page.

The color profile is normally selected implicitly by the user when the user specifies the output medium in the printer (i.e. plain paper, coated paper, transparency, etc.). The page description sent to the printer always contains device-specific CMYK color.","We assume that the host graphics system renders images and graphics to a nominal resolution specified by the printer driver, but that it allows the printer driver to take control of rendering text. In particular, the graphics system provides sufficient information to the printer driver to allow it to render and position text at a higher resolution than the nominal device resolution.","We assume that the host graphics system requires random access to a contone page buffer at the nominal device resolution, into which it composites graphics and imaging objects, but that it allows the printer driver to take control of the actual compositing\u2014i.e. it expects the printer driver to manage the page buffer.","8.2 Two-Layer Page Buffer","The printer's page description contains a 267 ppi contone layer and an 800 dpi black layer. The black layer is conceptually above the contone layer, i.e. the black layer is composited over the contone layer by the printer. The printer driver therefore maintains a page buffer  which correspondingly contains a medium-resolution contone layer  and a high-resolution black layer .","The graphics systems renders and composites objects into the page buffer bottom-up\u2014i.e. later objects obscure earlier objects. This works naturally when there is only a single layer, but not when there are two layers which will be composited later. It is therefore necessary to detect when an object being placed on the contone layer obscures something on the black layer.","When obscuration is detected, the obscured black pixels are composited with the contone layer and removed from the black layer. The obscuring object is then laid down on the contone layer, possibly interacting with the black pixels in some way. If the compositing mode of the obscuring object is such that no interaction with the background is possible, then the black pixels can simply be discarded without being composited with the contone layer. In practice, of course, there is little interaction between the contone layer and the black layer.","The printer driver specifies a nominal page resolution of 267 ppi to the graphics system. Where possible the printer driver relies on the graphics system to render image and graphics objects to the pixel level at 267 ppi, with the exception of black text. The printer driver fields all text rendering requests, detects and renders black text at 800 dpi, but returns non-black text rendering requests to the graphics system for rendering at 267 ppi.","Ideally the graphics system and the printer driver manipulate color in device-independent RGB, deferring conversion to device-specific CMYK until the page is complete and ready to be sent to the printer. This reduces page buffer requirements and makes compositing more rational. Compositing in CMYK color space is not ideal.","Ultimately the graphics system asks the printer driver to composite each rendered object into the printer driver's page buffer. Each such object uses 24-bit contone RGB, and has an explicit (or implicitly opaque) opacity channel.","The printer driver maintains the two-layer page buffer  in three parts. The first part is the medium-resolution (267 ppi) contone layer . This consists of a 24-bit RGB bitmap. The second part is a medium-resolution black layer . This consists of an 8-bit opacity bitmap. The third part is a high-resolution (800 dpi) black layer . This consists of a 1-bit opacity bitmap. The medium-resolution black layer is a subsampled version of the high-resolution opacity layer. In practice, assuming the medium resolution is an integer factor n of the high resolution (e.g. n=800\/267=3), each medium-resolution opacity value is obtained by averaging the corresponding n\u00d7n high-resolution opacity values. This corresponds to box-filtered subsampling. The subsampling of the black pixels effectively antialiases edges in the high-resolution black layer, thereby reducing ringing artefacts when the contone layer is subsequently JPEG-compressed and decompressed.","The structure and size of the page buffer is illustrated in .","8.3 Compositing Model","For the purposes of discussing the page buffer compositing model, we define the following variables.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0378","num":"0424"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00036","num":"00036"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 32"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Compositing variables"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["variable","description","resolution","format"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["n","medium to high resolution scale","\u2014","\u2014"]},{"entry":[{},"factor",{},{}]},{"entry":["C","background contone layer color","medium","8-bit color"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"component"]},{"entry":["C","contone object color","medium","8-bit color"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"component"]},{"entry":["\u03b1","contone object opacity","medium","8-bit opacity"]},{"entry":["\u03b1","medium-resolution foreground black","medium","8-bit opacity"]},{"entry":[{},"layer opacity",{},{}]},{"entry":["\u03b1","foreground black layer opacity","high","1-bit opacity"]},{"entry":["\u03b1","black object opacity","high","1-bit opacity"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"When a black object of opacity \u03b1is composited with the black layer, the black layer is updated as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0380","num":"0426"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["\u2022","FgH"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["x","y"],"mo":","}}},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["\u2022","FgH"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["x","y"],"mo":","}}},{"msub":{"mi":["\u2022","TxH"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["x","y"],"mo":","}}}],"mo":"\u22c1"}],"mo":"\u2190"}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"Rule","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["\u2022","FgM"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["x","y"],"mo":","}}},{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","msup":{"mi":"n","mn":"2"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"0"},{"mi":"n","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"0"},{"mi":"n","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mn":"255","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u2022","FgH"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["nx","i"],"mo":"+"},{"mi":["ny","j"],"mo":"+"}],"mo":","}}}}}}}],"mo":"\u2190"}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"Rule","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}}]}]}}}},"The object opacity is simply ored with the black layer opacity (Rule 1), and the corresponding part of the medium-resolution black layer is re-computed from the high-resolution black layer (Rule 2).","When a contone object of color Cand opacity \u03b1is composited with the contone layer, the contone layer and the black layer are updated as follows:\n\n](1\u2212\u25a1]) if \u25a10\u2003\u2003(Rule 3)\n\n\u25a10 if \u25a10\u2003\u2003(Rule 4)\n\n\u25a10 if \u25a10\u2003\u2003(Rule 5)\n\nC[x,y]\u2190C[x,y](1\u2212\u25a1[x,y])+C[x,y]\u25a1[x,y]\u2003\u2003(Rule 6)\n","Wherever the contone object obscures the black layer, even if not fully opaquely, the affected black layer pixels are pushed from the black layer to the contone layer, i.e. composited with the contone layer (Rule 3) and removed from the black layer (Rule 4 and Rule 5).

Although these two interpretations are different, they share the same representation, and so no data conversion is required.","9 Windows 9X\/NT Printer Driver","9.1 Windows 9x\/NT Printing System","In the Windows 9x\/NT printing system [8] [9], a printer  is a graphics device, and an application  communicates with it via the graphics device interface  (GDI). The printer driver graphics DLL  (dynamic link library) implements the device-dependent aspects of the various graphics functions provided by GDI.","The spooler  handles the delivery of pages to the printer, and may reside on a different machine to the application requesting printing. It delivers pages to the printer via a port monitor  which handles the physical connection to the printer. The optional language monitor  is the part of the printer driver which imposes additional protocol on communication with the printer, and in particular decodes status responses from the printer on behalf of the spooler.","The printer driver user interface DLL  implements the user interface for editing printer-specific properties and reporting printer-specific events.","The structure of the Windows 9x\/NT printing system is illustrated in .","Since iPrint uses USB IEEE-1284 emulation, there is no need to implement a language monitor for iPrint.","The remainder of this section describes the design of the printer driver graphics DLL. It should be read in conjunction with the appropriate Windows 9x\/NT DDK documentation [8][9].","9.2 Windows 9x\/NT Graphics Device Interface (GDI)","GDI provides functions which allow an application to draw on a device surface, i.e. typically an abstraction of a display screen or a printed page. For a raster device, the device surface is conceptually a color bitmap. The application can draw on the surface in a device-independent way, i.e. independently of the resolution and color characteristics of the device.","The application has random access to the entire device surface. This means that if a memory-limited printer device requires banded output, then GDI must buffer the entire page's GDI commands and replay them windowed into each band in turn. Although this provides the application with great flexibility, it can adversely affect performance.","GDI supports color management, whereby device-independent colors provided by the application are transparently translated into device-dependent colors according to a standard ICC (International Color Consortium) color profile of the device. A printer driver can activate a different color profile depending, for example, on the user's selection of paper type on the driver-managed printer property sheet.","GDI supports line and spline outline graphics (paths), images, and text. Outline graphics, including outline font glyphs, can be stroked and filled with bit-mapped brush patterns. Graphics and images can be geometrically transformed and composited with the contents of the device surface. While Windows 95\/NT4 provides only boolean compositing operators, Windows 98\/NT5 provides proper alpha-blending [9].","9.3 Printer Driver Graphics DLL","A raster printer can, in theory, utilize standard printer driver components under Windows 9x\/NT, and this can make the job of developing a printer driver trivial. This relies on being able to model the device surface as a single bitmap. The problem with this is that text and images must be rendered at the same resolution. This either compromises text resolution, or generates too much output data, compromising performance.","As described earlier, iPrint's approach is to render black text and images at different resolutions, to optimize the reproduction of each. The printer driver is therefore implemented according to the generic design described in Section 8.","The driver therefore maintains a two-layer three-part page buffer as described in Section 8.2, and this means that the printer driver must take over managing the device surface, which in turn means that it must mediate all GDI access to the device surface.","9.3.1 Managing the Device Surface","The printer driver must support a number of standard functions, including the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0411","num":"0457"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00037","num":"00037"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 33"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Standard graphics driver interface functions"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["function","description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["DrvEnableDriver","Initial entry point into the driver graphics DLL."]},{"entry":[{},"Returns addresses of functions supported by the driver."]},{"entry":["DrvEnablePDEV","Creates a logical representation of a physical device"]},{"entry":[{},"with which the driver can associate a drawing surface."]},{"entry":["DrvEnableSurface","Creates a surface to be drawn on, associated with a"]},{"entry":[{},"given PDEV."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"DrvEnablePDEV indicates to GDI, via the flGraphicsCaps member of the returned DEVINFO structure, the graphics rendering capabilities of the driver.

The virtual device surface which encapsulates these two layers has a nominal resolution of 267 ppi, so this is the resolution at which GDI operations take place.","Although the aggregate page buffer requires about 33 MB of memory, the PC 99 office standard [5] specifies a minimum of 64 MB.","In practice, managing the device surface and mediating GDI access to it means that the printer driver must support the following additional functions:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0416","num":"0462"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00038","num":"00038"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 34"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Required graphics driver functions for a device-managed surface"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["function","description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["DrvCopyBits","Translates between device-managed raster surfaces"]},{"entry":[{},"and GDI-managed standard-format bitmaps."]},{"entry":["DrvStrokePath","Strokes a path."]},{"entry":["DrvPaint","Paints a specified region."]},{"entry":["DrvTextOut","Renders a set of glyphs at specified positions."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Copying images, stroking paths and filling regions all occur on the contone layer, while rendering solid black text occurs on the bi-level black layer. Furthermore, rendering non-black text also occurs on the contone layer, since it isn't supported on the black layer. Conversely, stroking or filling with solid black can occur on the black layer (if we so choose).","Although the printer driver is obliged to hook the aforementioned functions, it can punt function calls which apply to the contone layer back to the corresponding GDI implementations of the functions, since the contone layer is a standard-format bitmap. For every DrvXxx function there is a corresponding EngXxx function provided by GDI.","As described in Section 8.2, when an object destined for the contone layer obscures pixels on the black layer, the obscured black pixels must be transferred from the black layer to the contone layer before the contone object is composited with the contone layer. The key to this process working is that obscuration is detected and handled in the hooked call, before it is punted back to GDI. This involves determining the pixel-by-pixel opacity of the contone object from its geometry, and using this opacity to selectively transfer black pixels from the black layer to the contone layer as described in Section 8.2.","9.3.2 Determining Contone Object Geometry","It is possible to determine the geometry of each contone object before it is rendered and thus determine efficiently which black pixels it obscures. In the case of DrvCopyBits and DrvPaint, the geometry is determined by a clip object (CLIPOBJ), which can be enumerated as a set of rectangles.","In the case of DrvStrokePath, things are more complicated. DrvStrokePath supports both straight-line and B\u00e9zier-spline curve segments, and single-pixel-wide lines and geometric-wide lines. The first step is to avoid the complexity of B\u00e9zier-spline curve segments and geometric-wide lines altogether by clearing the corresponding capability flags (GCAPS_BEZIERS and GCAPS_GEOMETRICWIDE) in the flGraphicsCaps member of the driver's DEVINFO structure. This causes GDI to reformulate such calls as sets of simpler calls to DrvPaint. In general, GDI gives a driver the opportunity to accelerate high-level capabilities, but simulates any capabilities not provided by the driver.","What remains is simply to determine the geometry of a single-pixel-wide straight line. Such a line can be solid or cosmetic. In the latter case, the line style is determined by a styling array in the specified line attributes (LINEATTRS). The styling array specifies how the line alternates between being opaque and transparent along its length, and so supports various dashed line effects etc.","When the brush is solid black, straight lines can also usefully be rendered to the black layer, though with the increased width implied by the 800 dpi resolution.","9.3.3 Rendering Text","In the case of a DrvTextOut, things are also more complicated. Firstly, the opaque background, if any, is handled like any other fill on the contone layer (see DrvPaint). If the foreground brush is not black, or the mix mode is not effectively opaque, or the font is not scalable, or the font indicates outline stroking, then the call is punted to EngTextOut, to be applied to the contone layer. Before the call is punted, however, the driver determines the geometry of each glyph by obtaining its bitmap (via FONTOBJ_cGetGlyphs), and makes the usual obscuration check against the black layer.","If punting a DrvTextOut call is not allowed (the documentation is ambiguous), then the driver should disallow complex text operations. This includes disallowing outline stroking (by clearing the GCAPS_VECTOR_FONT capability flag), and disallowing complex mix modes (by clearing the GCAPS_ARBMIXTXT capability flag).","If the foreground brush is black and opaque, and the font is scalable and not stroked, then the glyphs are rendered on the black layer. In this case the driver determines the geometry of each glyph by obtaining its outline (again via FONTOBJ_cGetGlyphs, but as a PATHOBJ). The driver then renders each glyph from its outline at 800 dpi and writes it to the black layer. Although the outline geometry uses device coordinates (i.e. at 267 ppi), the coordinates are in fixed point format with plenty of fractional precision for higher-resolution rendering.","Note that strikethrough and underline rectangles are added to the glyph geometry, if specified.","The driver must set the GCAPS_HIGHRESTEXT flag in the DEVINFO to request that glyph positions (again in 267 ppi device coordinates) be supplied by GDI in high-precision fixed-point format, to allow accurate positioning at 800 dpi. The driver must also provide an implementation of the DrvGetGlyphMode function, so that it can indicate to GDI that glyphs should be cached as outlines rather than bitmaps. Ideally the driver should cache rendered glyph bitmaps for efficiency, memory allowing. Only glyphs below a certain point size should be cached.","9.3.4 Compressing the Contone Layer","As described earlier, the contone layer is compressed using JPEG. The forward discrete cosine transform (DCT) is the costliest part of JPEG compression. In current high-quality software implementations, the forward DCT of each 8\u00d78 block requires 12 integer multiplications and 32 integer additions [7]. On a Pentium processor, an integer multiplication requires 10 cycles, and an integer addition requires 2 cycles [11]. This equates to a total cost per block of 184 cycles.","The 25.5 MB contone layer consists of 417,588 JPEG blocks, giving an overall forward DCT cost of about 77 Mcycles. At 300 MHz, the PC 99 desktop standard [5], this equates to 0.26 seconds, which is well within the 2 second limit per page.","10 References",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0431","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0023","list-style":"none"},"li":["[1] ANSI\/EIA 538-1988, 4 , August 1988","[2] Humphreys, G.
