In particular, the invention provides a large plurality of flight-stabile darts for target release.","The 155 mm high explosive (HE) M483A1 cargo round carries a payload of dual-purpose grenades: (a) armor defeating (M42) and (b) anti-personnel (M46). Upon detonation of the primer, the flash ignites the propelling charge producing gases that eject the spin-stabilized projectile from the gun and propels the projectile to the target. The fuze, having been set to function at a pre-determined time in flight, initiates the expulsion charge ejecting the entire grenade load from the rear of the projectile. Centrifugal force from spinning disperses the grenades radially from, the projectile's line-of-flight. The M42 and M46 grenades are ground-burst submissiles that explode on impact.","Conventional submunition configurations for the cargo round yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, various exemplary embodiments provide a cargo round (e.g., 155 mm high explosive projectile) for dispensing submunitions. The round includes a nose tip, a casing attached thereto forming a chamber, a tail and a payload in the chamber between the tip and tail. The payload includes a plurality of axi-symmetric darts mounted on a plurality of front and rear tandem plates.","Each dart has fore and aft ends along a polar axis. Each dart is shaped as a cone at its fore end and includes a cavity at its aft end. Each plate has a plurality of orifices arranged in a regular pattern. Each orifice receives a corresponding dart to protrude from both obverse and reverse sides of the plate. Each fore end of its dart in the rear plate inserts into the cavity of a counterpart dart in the front plate, and each plate shears apart on release of the payload to disperse the darts.","In various exemplary embodiments, the plates preferably have a plurality of notches arranged in rows on the reverse side, together with a lip at an outer rim and bounded recess region within the lip on the obverse side, with the orifices are disposed in the region.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Various exemplary embodiments provide an arrangement for packing and releasing a larger plurality of conical darts than available in conventional designs. The exemplary designs provide a payload of conical shaped darts that fit into the 155 mm HE projectile. The embodiments account for the stress the projectile experienced at firing-launch and in-flight. After ejecting the darts out the rear of the round, the projectile's in-flight stability is maintained to ensure maximum penetration. The embodiments thus satisfy several criteria.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","110","120","130","140","120","130","150","160","170","180"]},"The darts contained within the round  are designed for stability upon release at a pre-determined time in flight to impact the target nose first. The material for the darts can preferably be tungsten to optimize penetration, but the reactive amalgam aluminum-teflon can also be incorporated into the design of the dart. The payload can be designed for loading a plurality of darts together. This delivery system withstands the initial forces at launch and separates upon expulsion from of the rear of the round . The payload separates releasing the plates to shear apart therefore expelling the darts. The darts then strike the target set consisting of light armor vehicles, small boats, personnel, and suspected mine-fields.","Dart Stability: To design an effective dart, a variety of different shapes were examined between speeds of Mach 1 and Mach 2.5 to evaluate static and dynamic stability. Gyroscopic (or static) stability provides a return to the desired angle-of-attack in response to initial rotation about the yaw axis (perpendicular to the longitudinal axis).

A shaded region  above and inside the curve  identifies the region of dynamic stability, such that any point therein is stable in flight. The lower limit for static stability corresponds to s=1 represented by a line , and intersects the curve  at the minimum point .","Dart Material: The reactive material aluminum-teflon may be preferred in the design of the darts, because its low density (0.2 g\/cm) inert material only detonates at a high-velocity impact. Originally the material begins as powder, but forms into the desired shape under high temperature and pressure, rendering a plastic appearance and texture. Upon striking at a high velocity, the dart shears causing the aluminum and teflon to tear apart, the energy from the separation causes additional damage. One gram of this amalgam shearing at Mach 1 releases about fifteen-hundred calories of energy, equivalent to 25% of a gram of trinitrotoluene (TNT). The carbon reacts with the oxygen to release another thousand calories of energy in a sealed vessel as the penetrated target.","Dart Criteria: Multiple dart designs were considered, all of which required to satisfy several dimensional criteria. Dart designs for the HE round are two inches tall with a diameter of 0.34375 inch. This diameter was selected in order to fit one-hundred-fifty-one darts on a plate that can fit inside the round . With this configuration there can be nineteen plates each with one-hundred-fifty-one darts, yielding a total of 2869 darts within the HE round.","Stacked Cones: The dart incorporates an interior conical shape. This permits 1-inch of the dart's upper portion to fit from underneath into the cavity of the dart above.  shows elevation views  of a pair of conical darts in tandem configuration. The right side features an exterior view of a lower dart  inserted into the bottom cavity of an upper dart . The left side illustrates a B-B cross-section with the lower dart  having a conical cavity  at the bottom, and the upper dart . The nose of the lower dart  inserts into the corresponding cavity of the upper dart .","The internal and external cone half-angles differ slightly from each other to prevent the nose of the lower cone  from jamming into the upper cone  above. The insertion of lower darts into upper darts reduces volume consumption as well as the dart's weight, and translates the center-of-gravity forward from a solid dart of uniform material. The preferred material is tungsten due to its greater density to enable greater penetrability. However, incorporating reactive materials into the design is also highly desirable due to enhanced effect against the target.","The dart is designed to satisfy static and dynamic stability between Mach 1 and Mach 2.5 flight conditions. To determine the stability characteristics of the dart, a stability and trajectory calculating program called Projectile Data Simulation (PRODAS) was employed. PRODAS is used with small projectiles, like the darts, up to the large artillery shells to calculate mass properties, aerodynamics, aero stability, trajectories, and other properties. The aero stability was the main focus for the darts, which provided the static and dynamic stability. PRODAS uses for input the geometry of the projectile followed by all the initial conditions, such as mass, density, exit muzzle velocity, initial spin rate, caliber of the gun, center of mass, and transverse and axial moments of inertia from the center of mass.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"500"},"Dart Geometries: Four different axi-symmetric shapes are considered for the dart round's shape.

The small witch's-hat is statically unstable throughout the entire Mach range. This means that upon release, an induced rotation about the yaw axis does not dampen out; rather the witch's-hat dart continues to rotate, compromising likelihood of striking the target nose-first, thereby reducing accuracy and kinetic energy transfer. This instability might be due to the center-of-mass being proximate to the center-of-pressure, because without a moment to counteract the acceleration, the witch's-hat dart lacks opposing force for returning to the desired angle-of-attack, and is thus discarded for design considerations in this application.","Cylinder Cone: The cylinder-cone is based off a projectile shape found in some projectiles in military usage. An aerodynamic simulation of the cylinder-cone  was executed in PRODAS, with the results described herein.  provides a graph . The abscissa  is Mach number and the ordinate  is static stability factor. A legend  identifies lines corresponding to cylinder-cone variations.","Seven examples of the cylinder-cone are evaluated: a monolithic steel dart with 0.2-inch cylinder, a monolithic tungsten dart with 0.2-inch cylinder, a monolithic reactive dart with 0.2-inch cylinder, a 75%-reactive version of the cylinder, a 25%-reactive version of the cylinder, a tungsten-shell reactive plug, and a reactive cone tip. There are six variations of cylinder cone, three of which are a cylinder cone made out of steel, tungsten, or reactive material. There are also two other variations with 25% and 75% of the 0.2-inch cylinder composed of a reactive material attached to the rest of the cone. A tungsten shell wrapped around reactive material represents another variation, along with a small reactive cone placed inside the tungsten dart.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1410","1420","1430","1440","1450","1460","860"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIGS. 15A through 15C","FIG. 15A","FIG. 15B","FIG. 15C"],"b":["1500","1510","1520","1530","1540","1550","1560","1570","1520","1530"]},"Design Selection: Analyzing all the types of darts showed that any are a suitable for use except the witch's hat form. The original cone dart develops a large stress at a point upon launch along the bottom of the cones as stacked together. The boat-tail is both statically and dynamically stable, but may be more difficult to manufacture. Thus, the preferred choice is the cylinder-cone due to its distribution of stress along the cylinder. Moreover, the design facilitates manufacture in comparison to alternative designs. Reactive material can be disposed inside of the cylinder cone and the cylinder-cone is both statically and dynamically stable.","Further analysis determined that the mass of a tungsten cylinder cone exceed the carrying weight of the 155-mm cargo round. Currently the cargo round  is permitted to weigh only up to 104.8 pounds without fuze; to avoid damage to the gun. With almost three-thousand tungsten darts, the round would weigh up to two-hundred pounds, greatly exceeding that limit. One solution reduces the number of rows from thirteen to six, thereby reducing the carrying capacity to only 906 darts (or only \u2153 of the original) to satisfy the weight requirement. Consequently, the material of the dart was changed to alloy steel.","Alloy steel has about half the density of tungsten, therefore possess about half the mass for the same volume. This allows for 1963 darts out of the 2869 darts maximum to fit into the round  and also satisfy the weight limit. The alloy steel is not as statically stable as the tungsten dart, but both are dynamically stable from Mach 1 through Mach 2.5. The ability for the steel dart to pierce light armor and boats is expected to be less than that of tungsten, due to its lower density by comparison.  shows a reactive plug inside of a tungsten shell, with a mass about the same of the steel dart, but expected to possess the penetrability of the tungsten dart. With the dart design chosen, an effective release system can be constructed.","Release System: The release system includes at least one plate that can hold one-hundred-fifty-one darts. These can be stacked thirteen plates high in order to stay within the weight restraint of 104.8 pounds. These holding plates not only secure the darts, but also are able to withstand the shock of launch. Upon ejection from the round  into the air stream, they immediately disintegrate, dispersing the darts without restraint. An expulsion cylinder holds the thirteen plates to withstand the shock of launch. The cylinder is sufficiently strong to shear the threads on the outer circumference of the cargo round base plug . The threads connect the base plug  to the casing  and separate upon release into the air.","Design of Holding Plates:  show views of a holding plate , having a 0.2-inch thickness and composed of Aluminum Al-3003.  show isometric views from above and below respectively,  shows a plan view from the reverse (bottom) side,  shows an elevation view showing thickness, and  shows a plan view from the obverse (top) side. Of the thickness, 0.1-inch provides a lip along the plate's top surface  meant to firmly hold the top row of darts in place and the remainder 0.1-inch represents a bounded recessed region  with holes  to hold a lower row of darts firmly in place, of which a single example dart  is shown. The plate's reverse surface  may include corrugation row divots or scores of 0.085-inch to facilitate fragmentation upon release from the round . The cavity  provided at the rear of the cylindrical cone dart  provides a receptacle for the nose of a lower dart to be inserted.","The plate  is designed with one-hundred-fifty-one holes  in a hexagonal pattern, although other regular patterns can be contemplated. Each hole  holds a corresponding dart  to enable the top one-inch of the dart to protrude from the top surface  for insertion into the cavity  of the dart above on an adjacent plate . This arrangement enables adjacent tandem plates  to be stacked above each other, together with their corresponding darts . The top one-inch of the nose of the lower dart  inserts into the rear cavity . Each plate  can hold up to approximately three pounds of mass and withstand a centripetal force of 260 Hz and 10,000 G's of acceleration. After release from the expulsion cylinder  the plates  are sufficiently fragile to frangibly break apart immediately so that the darts  can disperse un-restrained.","Plate In-Flight Stress Analysis: Cosmos software is a stress analysis program in SolidWorks\u00ae used to calculate the stresses on the plate , suspended as a free-floating object with no forces applied thereto. A centripetal force of 260 Hz was then applied to simulate spinning in-flight. Lift and drag viscous forces from the air contacting the plate were not incorporated into the simulations, in order to determine whether the plate breaks merely from centripetal force as intended.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIGS. 17A and 17B","FIG. 17A","FIG. 17B"],"b":["1800","1710","1720","1700","1600","1650","710","1730","1740"]},"Plates Launch Stress Analysis: For the stress analysis on aluminum Al-3003 plates, Cosmos revealed that the centripetal force induced by an angular rate of 260 Hz and 10,000 G's of acceleration shears the plate .  illustrates this Al-3003 result by a contour plot  of an axi-symmetric wedge of the round  adjacent to a legend . The yield strength of aluminum Al-3003 is 6000 psi, represented by the upper value in the legend . The round  includes an exterior  (representing the casing ), a notched interior , and an aft closure  (representing the tail ). The interior  holds an exemplary triple series of plates , one of which holds a dart . Centripetal force vectors are shown  along corresponding surfaces.","The plates  exceed 6000 psi at most their surfaces. The material of the plate was then changed to aluminum Al-2018 that has a higher yield strength of 46,000 psi. Another stress analysis executed under the same conditions.  shows this Al-2018 result by a contour plot  adjacent to a legend . These results showed that the plates  withstand the forces  of launch. The Al-2018 plate was then analyzed by itself in mid-air and the stress analysis showed that the plates  do not shear with 260 Hz of centripetal force. Thus, the plate material preferably remains Aluminum Al-3003, with bands or columns can be disposed underneath the plates for additional reinforcement. Alternatively, deeper scoring on the obverse side  may weaken the plate structure of Al-2018 for adequate frangibility.","The dart chosen, reactive plug with tungsten tip, offers the best flight stability as well as potential lethality. Upon piercing an object with the tungsten tip, the dart fractures the reactive material, thereby causing an explosion with a magnitude of 25% of a gram of TNT. With almost 2000 darts and the release system, the cargo round maintains under the maximum requirement for weight. The stress analysis shows that unreinforced plates cannot withstand the conditions at launch, but do break apart upon ejection from the round . Overall, this round can be used to penetrate boats, light armor vehicles, personal and mine-fields, and to generate secondary damage from the reactive material.","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art.
