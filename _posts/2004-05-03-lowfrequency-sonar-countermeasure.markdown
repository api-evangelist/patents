title: Low-frequency sonar countermeasure
abstract: A multi-port projector of acoustic energy in water includes a cylindrical hollow transducer having open annular ends. A thin, flexible member is secured to each annular end to extend across each opening to be displaced by the transducer, and the transducer and flexible members form an interior sealed from ambient water. A battery/electronics module is in the interior and is spaced from the transducer and flexible members to couple driving signals to the transducer for reciprocally displacing it and the flexible members in response to the driving signals. An inert liquid fills the interior around the module, and an open truss on each annular end exposes the flexible members to the ambient water. Cylindrical portions coaxially extending with the transducer on a common longitudinal axis are connected to the open trusses for projecting acoustic energy of lower frequency than conventional cylindrical transducers of similar size.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to active sonar countermeasures. More particularly, this invention relates to a cost effective, cylindrically shaped acoustic countermeasure that lowers transmitted frequencies by one half as compared to contemporary transducers of the same size.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Acoustic countermeasures are an integral part of undersea offensive and defensive operations, and compact transducers are routinely used as expendable acoustic sources. The expendable sources can project acoustic energy over bandwidths that are predetermined or limited by the dimensions of a source's cylindrical-shaped housing. The current state of the art expendable acoustic source is only capable of projecting acoustic energy at a low end frequency level that is approximately two times higher than the desired or optimum low frequency for successful countermeasure operations.","The size of a source's housing and hence the lowest operating frequencies are constrained by the dimensions of the launch or deployment systems in the submerged or surface vessel. Larger acoustic countermeasures would be capable of lower frequency operation, but larger sound sources are incompatible with existing systems used to deploy expendable acoustic countermeasures.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for an expendable cylindrical-shaped acoustic source that is capable of operating at one half the present lowest operating frequency of a contemporary source of similar dimensions.","The first object of the invention is to provide a multi-port underwater projector of acoustic energy.","Another object is to provide a multi-port projector that is capable of projecting acoustic energy at about one half the lowest frequency of a contemporary source of similar size.","Another object is to provide a multi-port projector that is capable of projecting acoustic energy at about one half the lowest frequency of a contemporary source of similar size.","Another object is to provide a multi-port acoustic energy projector compatible with existing allotted spaces in a countermeasure device and capable of projecting acoustic energy at one half the lowest frequency of a similar sized contemporary source.","Another object is to provide a multi-port projector of acoustic energy having thin flexible members, such as membranes or thin plates at opposite ends of a cylindrical transducer.","Another object is to provide an acoustic projector having flexible members at opposite ends of a cylindrical transducer to fit into an existing allotted space in a countermeasure device and project acoustic energy.","Another object is to provide a cylinder-shaped acoustic source having flexible membranes extending across a cylindrical transducer containing a power source\/electronics in liquid-filled voids and spaces.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Accordingly, the present invention is a multi-port projector of acoustic energy in water that includes a cylindrical hollow transducer having annular ends around an opening. A thin, flexible member is secured to each annular end to extend across each opening to be displaced by the transducer. The transducer and flexible members form an interior that is sealed from ambient water. The thin flexible members can be either thin, disc-shaped flexible membranes or thin disc-shaped plates. A battery\/electronics module is in the interior and is spaced from the transducer and flexible members to couple driving signals to the transducer for reciprocally displacing it and the flexible members in response to the driving signals.","An inert liquid fills the interior around the module, and an open truss on each annular end exposes the flexible members to the ambient water. Cylindrical portions coaxially extending with the transducer on a common longitudinal axis are connected to the open trusses for projecting acoustic energy of a lower frequency than conventional cylindrical transducers of similar size.","The battery\/electronics module includes a battery section and an electronics section to couple the driving signals to the transducer. The electronics section has a case containing electronic components, and the inert liquid fills voids around the components in the case. A duct extends from the battery section to the ambient water to flood the battery section thereby activating seawater batteries in the battery section.","Referring to the  there is illustrated a multi-port projector  of acoustic energy of the invention is included as a part of an elongate cylinder-shaped countermeasure device . Countermeasure device  has a diameter of only a few inches allowing it to be fitted into an individual launch tube of a compact launcher system (not shown) for deployment into seawater .","Multi-port projector  has a diameter of only a few inches and is substantially the same diameter as cylindrical-shaped portions  of countermeasures device  so that it can be securely fitted between cylindrical-shaped portions . Cylindrical-shaped portions  coaxially extend in opposite directions from multi-port projector  in allotted space  along a common longitudinal axis . Cylindrical-shaped portions  can have sensors\/instrumentation, guidance\/propulsion, electronics, and\/or ordnance, etc. in rigid shells  on each portion  to perform other tactical functions of countermeasures device .","Multi-port projector  is a cylindrical projector of acoustic energy having an elongate cylindrical hollow magnetostrictive, or piezoelectric transducer . Transducer  can have a thin, strong metal or plastic shell  (for protection from abuses and watertight integrity) that is slightly separated from transducer  by a thin layer  of electrical insulation. Protective shell  could also be a watertight layer or coating of rugged, flexible insulation material bonded onto transducer  or insulation layer  that will withstand the rigors of handling and deployment yet will flex as transducer  is displaced. Shell  seals out or is impervious to ambient water  over expected depths of operation. Transducer  with shell  can be considered the hull portion of multi-port projector  of countermeasures device . Transducer  (and shell ) can be connected at its opposite annular ends  (and end A of shell ) to an open truss  of rigid members A that extend through portions A of ambient seawater . Each truss  is also secured at its opposite end to one end A of rigid shells  of cylindrical portions . Trusses  can sandwich circumferential annular strips of flexible members  between them and annular ends  & ends A of shell .","Cylindrical hollow magnetostrictive transducer  can be any of many well know designs that can have stacked ring-shaped magnetostrictive portions interleaved with serial or parallel connected electrodes. The exact construction and interconnection need not be further elaborated on or shown to avoid unnecessary detail concerning what is of general knowledge in the art. For purposes of demonstration of this inventive concept, however, a single electrode A at opposite ends of transducer  is shown to be suitably attached and interconnected to create and impart responsive longitudinal reciprocal displacements thereof along the longitudinal axis  of countermeasures device  in accordance with or in response to applied driving signals (shown as arrows A). Optionally, transducer  could be polarized to impart responsive reciprocal radial displacements if desired.","A very thin and flexible disc-shaped member  such as a thin membrane or thin disc-shaped plate is disposed on each annular opposite end  of transducer  to radially inwardly extend across it. Flexible members  are connected or secured to annular ends  of transducer  in a sealed relationship and can be connected directly to annular opposite ends  and protective shell  by a wide variety of well known means, such as for example, by a commercially available heavy duty epoxy-like bonding agent. Flexible members  are thin with respect to the wavelengths of interest, which in this case are the projected low-frequency signals. Since thin flexible members  will flex so freely, to the cylindrical multi-port projector  it appears as if there are no end plates. Consequently, this construct creates multiple ports for multi-port projector , and the cylinder-shaped structure of transducer  of multi-port projector  with cylindrical-shaped portions  becomes, or is the hull of, countermeasure device . Transducer  (and shell ) can be connected at its opposite annular ends  (and end A of shell ) to an open truss  of rigid members A that extend through portions A of ambient seawater . Each truss  is also secured at its opposite end to one end A of rigid shells  of cylindrical portions . Trusses  can sandwich circumferential annular strips of flexible members  between them and annular ends  & ends A of shell .","A battery\/electronics module  can be held in a position spaced away inwardly from transducer  and thin end plates  by resilient members  inside of hollow transducer . Being so resilient, or compliant, resilient members  do not overly restrict or compromise the reciprocal excursions of transducer  as low-frequency acoustic signals are created and transmitted from multi-port projector  of countermeasures device . A battery section  of battery\/electronics module  provides sufficient electrical power for an interconnected electronics section  of battery\/electronics module  to enable electronics section  to generate predetermined driving signals A for transducer .","Multi-port projector  has an interior  that is enclosed by transducer  and thin end plates  and contains battery\/electronics module . The part of interior  that is not filled by battery\/electronics module  is filled completely with an inert liquid  such as a high-purity isoparaffinic solvent with a narrow boiling range. In the preferred embodiment, inert liquid  would be the trademarked solvent. ISOPAR produced by Exxon Mobil Corporation 3625 Gallow Road, Fairfax, Va. 22037. Because the volume of interior  that is outside of battery\/electronics module  is filled completely with inert liquid , a lower-frequency projection of acoustic energy is created.","The inside of a case  containing electronic components  of electronics section  of battery\/electronics module  may have small air-filled spaces or voids  around components . Inert liquid  is used to fill spaces  to further improve performance of multi-port projector . Since battery section  is most likely to be a seawater battery, some of the ambient seawater (shown as arrows B) can flow into the seawater battery of battery section  through a pair of sealed resilient ducts  extending through transducer  or other convenient transition points while multi-port projector  sinks in water . Ducts  allow flooding and filling of battery section  with some of ambient seawater  for ensuing activation of battery section . Battery section  could also be a sealed structure and does not need to be flooded or activated with a part of ambient seawater ; however, such a structure may be more susceptible to the problems associated with overheating than a seawater battery.","Electronics section  has leads  coupled to connect driving signals A to annular electrodes A at opposite annular ends of transducer  and create responsive reciprocating displacements of transducer  and impart responsive reciprocating displacements of thin flexible members . The reciprocating displacements of transducer  transmit representative acoustic signals at opposite ends of multi-port projector  via thin, flexible members  that radiate to open water  through portions A of water  in both open trusses . The reciprocating displacements of transducer  also transmit the same representative acoustic signals at opposite ends of multi-port projector  through the rigid members A of both trusses  to both rigid shells  of cylindrical portions  that radiate into open water . In other words, the entire hull of the countermeasure device  that includes multi-port projector  connected by trusses  to cylindrical portions  will become a large multi-port transducer that will operate at much lower frequency than a conventional cylindrical transducer of the same size.","Multi-port projector  of the invention projects acoustic energy at about one half the lowest frequency of a comparably dimensioned contemporary transducer partially because it is liquid-backed. That is, multi-port projector  is filled with inert liquid  in interior  around battery\/electronics module , is filled with inert liquid  around components  in case  of electronics section , and substantially filled with seawater in its battery section . This also provides the added operational advantage of heat dissipation. Furthermore, 1.) making transducer  and battery section  essentially the same length as multi-port projector , 2.) having liquid  filling the surrounding battery\/electronics module  directly against the inside of transducer , and 3.) having transducer  covered or capped by thin flexible members  exposed to seawater  via open trusses  at opposite ends, assures excitation of countermeasure device  and projection of acoustic energy at the lower frequencies desired.","It is understood that multi-port projector  could be made in accordance with this invention in different sizes in different acoustic systems for many different purposes where lower frequency operation is needed. Other transducers such D.C. linear motors could be used instead of magnetostrictive elements and different arrangements of batteries and electronics could be used without departing from the scope of this invention herein described. Having this disclosure in mind, selection of suitable components from among many proven contemporary designs and compactly interfacing them as disclosed herein can be readily done without requiring anything beyond ordinary skill.","The components and their arrangements as disclosed herein all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Multi-port projector  of this invention provides a reliable and cost-effective means to improve the low-frequency response of countermeasures. Therefore, multi-port projector  as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting, but rather, is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as it becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00021","num":"00021"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00022","num":"00022"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
