More specifically, embodiments of the present invention relate to an interface for a search engine that can be moved anywhere on a desktop and remains visible on the desktop as long as the computer is on.","With the advent of the World Wide Web (WWW) an abundance of information on the Internet has become available to people who have computers. Search engines have been developed to find information based on search terms that the users provide to the search engines.  depicts a block diagram of prior art interfaces for using search engines to find information on the Internet. For example, typically, users open a browser window  on a screen  of their computer , type the URL of the search engine A they want to use in order to display a user interface  for that particular search engine A. The user interface  will have one or more fields for entering search terms. The user may instruct the search engine A to perform the search of information A associated with the search engine A based on the entered search terms when the user clicks on a button ","Different search engines (A, B) have access to different sets of information (A, B) on the Internet . For example, search engine A may have access to information A, which may include, for example, the contents of the Wall Street Journal, whereas search engine B may have access to information B, which may include, for example, the contents of Time magazine. Each search engine (A, B) searches the information (A, B) that it has access to based on search terms the user enters and provides results from the search to the user in the browser window . For example, search engine A would search information A and search engine B would search information B. The information each search engine has access to shall be referred to as the search engine's \u201cenvironment.\u201d","One problem with search engine user interfaces  is that they disappear when the user closes their browser window . A second problem with the search engine user interfaces  is that they take up a lot of space on the screen .","Referring to , free ware called \u201cDave's Quick Search\u201d, which can be found at \u201cnotesbydave.com\/toolbar\/\u201d has addressed this problem by providing a user interface  (referred to hereinafter as \u201cDave's user interface\u201d) as a part of the task bar . Dave's user interface  provides a small window that users can enter search terms into and a button that users can click on to instruct the user's default search engine to perform a search based on the search terms currently in the window ","One problem with Dave's user interface  is that it takes up valuable space on the task bar .","For these and other reasons, a method and\/or a system would be valuable that provides a search engine user interface that is available as long as the user's computer is on regardless of whether the browser is open. A method and\/or system that does not take up valuable space on the task bar would also be value.","Embodiments of the present invention are described which pertain to methods and systems for a movable interface to a search engine that remains visible on a desktop regardless of whether a browser is open or closed. In one embodiment, a search engine interface is created by displaying a graphical image of a window on a screen of the computer. The window may receive search terms for searching information available to a search engine. The search engine interface is also created by associating a two dimensional graphical image that has a specified shape and color with the window. The search engine interface is designed to remain available on the screen of the computer regardless of whether a browser associated with the computer is open or closed. Further the search engine interface is designed to be moved anywhere on the screen.","The drawings referred to in this description should not be understood as being drawn to scale except if specifically noted.","Reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in conjunction with these embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention to these embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents, which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore, in the following description of the present invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},"The software system  includes a computer  that communicates with the Internet  to perform searches on information (A, B) using search engines (A, B). As depicted in , screen  displays a search engine interface , a browser window , and a task bar . Further, according to one embodiment, search engine interface  includes a window for entering search terms, button for displaying a list of user selectable search engine names, a search button , and a two dimensional graphical image for enhancing the appearance of search engine interface . In yet another embodiment, software  executing on computer , displays the search engine interface  on the screen  on computer . In one embodiment, software  may provide other interfaces and\/or services besides displaying search engine interface , as will be described in more detail.","A user of computer  may interact with search engine interface , browser window , and task bar  to instruct computer  on what actions to perform. For example, according to one embodiment, the user may enter search terms into window to cause a search engine (A, B) to search the information (A, B) associated with the search engine (A, B) based on the entered search terms. In response, the results of the search may be returned in a browser window .","According to one embodiment, the search engine interface  remains available on the screen  for searching information (A, B) available to search engines (A, B) even when the browser window  is closed. For example, referring to , since browser window  has to be open to display user interface , user interface  will disappear when browser window  is closed. In contrast, referring to , by associating the user interface  with the \u201cdesktop\u201d or screen , search engine interface  is available for receiving search terms regardless of whether browser window  is open or closed. If browser window  is closed when a user instructs a search engine (A, B) to perform a search with search engine interface , a browser window  may be opened to display the results of the search, according to one embodiment.","According to another embodiment, search engine interface  may be moved any where on screen . For example, referring to , Dave's search interface  is located on the task bar  and therefore it cannot be moved around. In contrast, referring to , search engine interface  may be moved to the left, the right, up or down on the screen . In fact, according to one embodiment, search engine interface  may be moved so that it is almost entirely off the screen .","In yet another embodiment, the user may select which search engine (A, B) performs the search using a list of search engines names. For example, assume that the name of search engine A is Google\u2122 and the name of search engine B is Alta Vista. A user may click on a button to cause a list which includes two user selectable options, e.g., \u201cGoogle\u201d and \u201cAlta Vista\u2122\u201d, to be displayed. The user may cause Google\u2122 to perform the search by selecting the option \u201cGoogle\u201d from the list and clicking on button ","Any language, tool kit, and\/or library that may be used for displaying graphical images, receiving search terms, communicating search terms to search engines, and for receiving the results of a search, may be used for creating search engine interface . For example, C++, Pascal, Visual Basic, Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), Java Script, Viassory, may be used for coding software  which creates search engine interface  when software  is executed.","According to one embodiment, a user may cause the search engine interface  to display a list of user selectable search engine names by clicking on button . For example, the company that owns the software that creates search engine interface  may create a partnership with several companies, such as Google\u2122, AltaVista\u2122, Ask Jeeves\u00ae, Inktomi\u00ae, etc., that have search engines, they may allow users to select the search engine the users desire from among the companies the owner of software  partnered with. In this case, a list of names for the search engines, e.g., Google\u2122, AltaVista\u2122, Ask Jeeves\u00ae, Inktomi\u00ae, may be displayed for user selection when a user clicks on button ","In yet another embodiment, an option for searching the hard drive of computer  may be associated with the list of search engine names. For example, an option such as \u201cMy Computer\u201d may be displayed when a user clicks on button . If the user chooses the \u201cMy Computer\u201d option, another interface may be displayed asking the user what they want to search for on their computer 's hard drive. In this case, the interface may allow the user to search for a particular file name or for a word in all of the files on computer 's hard drive. In one embodiment, the interface that is displayed when a user chooses the \u201cMy Computer\u201d option is the interface for performing searches of whatever operating system is running on computer . In another embodiment, the company that owns search engine interface  may develop their own interface for allowing users to search their hard drive. In this case, an Application Programming Interface (API) provided by the operating system may be used to instruct the operating system to perform the search.","In one embodiment, multiple search engines may be used for performing searches (also referred to as \u201caggregate searches\u201d). For example, a user may be allowed to select the name of more than one search engine. Assume in this case that the list of search engine names includes Google\u2122, AltaVista\u2122, and Ask Jeeves\u00ae. The user may be allowed to select Google\u2122 and Ask Jeeves\u00ae to perform the search. Additionally, the user may be allowed to perform a search using all of the search engines in the list.","What are known as search engine aggregators, such as \u201cwww.dogpile.com,\u201d have the ability to search information on the internet using multiple search engines. For example, in one embodiment, the company that owns the search engine interface  may contract with a search engine aggregator, such as \u201cwww.dogpile.com\u201d to perform aggregate searches.","In another embodiment, the results from a search may be returned in a browser window associated with the search engine that performed the search. In yet another embodiment, the results may be returned in an interface associated with the search engine interface . For example, the results that the search engines found may be returned to software  in data structures, such as XML feeds. The software  may extract the results from the data structures and display the results in an interface that is associated with the software . According to one embodiment, the interface that is used to provide results from a search may be displayed as a part of a browser window , as depicted in .","In one embodiment, the names of search engines are easily added and\/or deleted from the list of search engine names. For example, the names of the search engines may be associated with button using an INI file, a registry, a text file, a proprietary data format, an XML file, among other things.","According to one embodiment, the appearance of the search engine interface  may be modified by associating a different two dimensional graphical image with the search engine interface . For example, as depicted in , the two dimensional graphical image that is associated with the search engine interface  is an oblong shape. However, the shape and color of the two dimensional image could be any shape or color. For example, the two dimensional image could have the shape of a heart, square, circle, triangle, a base ball bat, race car, etc. Further, the two dimensional image could be any color such as green, blue, red, yellow, etc.","In yet another embodiment, different two dimensional graphical images may be associated with different search engines (A, B). For example, if a user chooses Google\u2122 from the list of search engine names, then a two dimensional graphical image with Google\u2122's logo may appear and when the user chooses Alta Vista from the list of search engine names, then a different two dimensional graphical image with Alta Vista's logo may appear.","According to one embodiment, the company that owns search engine interface  develops the two dimensional graphical images that can be used for modifying the appearance of the search engine interface . The two dimensional graphical images may be shipped as a part of software . According to another embodiment, user communities may develop the two dimensional graphical images . In this case, software  may provide a facility for associating the two dimensional graphical images with the search engine interface .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","300","300","300","300","300","300","212"]},"For the purposes of illustration, the discussion of flowchart  shall refer to the structures depicted in . Further, for the purposes of illustration, assume that the software  was created with Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC).","In step , a graphical image of a window is created for display on a screen. For example, a search engine interface  may be created, at least in part, by using the windows class of MFC to create an object that represents window . For the purposes of explanation, assume that the object that represents window is a part of software . Additionally, MFC may be used to create button and button . When software  as well as object are executed on computer , search engine interface , which includes button , window , and search button are displayed on the screen  of computer .","In step , a two dimensional graphical image is associated with the window. For example, bit maps may be used to create two dimensional graphical images that have a specified shape and color. MFC may be used to associate these bit maps with the window . For example, assume that a particular bitmap forms a blue oval. If this particular bit map is associated with window then when software  is executed on computer , it would display a two dimensional graphical image that is a blue oval.","In step , the search engine interface is enabled to remain available on the screen. For example, by coding software  in a way that search engine interface  may be associated with computer 's screen , also known as the \u201cdesktop\u201d, when software  is executed on computer , the search engine interface  may remain available to receive search terms regardless of whether a browser window  is open or closed.","In step , the search engine interface is enabled to be moved any where on the screen. For example, by coding software  in a way that search engine interface  will be associated with computer 's screen  when software  is executed on computer , the search engine interface  may be moved anywhere on screen .","In step , a list of search engine names are associated with the search engine interface. For example, by putting a list of search engine names, such as Google\u2122, Alta Vista\u2122, and Inktomi\u00ae, in an INI file and associating the INI file with button when software  is coded, a list of search engine names may be associated with search engine interface  when software  is executed on computer . According to one embodiment, MFC may be used to associate the list of search engine names with the button of the search engine interface .","In step , the search engine is invoked that corresponds to the search engine name a user selected. For example, after software  is installed on computer  causing the display of the search engine interface  on screen , a user may decide to use search engine interface . Assume that the user wants to search for information on \u201ccats\u201d on Google\u2122. The user may enter the search term \u201ccats\u201d into window . Software  may be coded in a way that when the user clicks on button , a list that includes user selectable options \u201cGoogle,\u201d \u201cAlta Vista,\u201d and \u201cInktomi\u201d is displayed. Continuing the example, assume the user selects \u201cGoogle\u201d and clicks on button to start the search. The software  uses the URL of Google\u2122, \u201cwww.google.com\u201d to locate Google\u2122's search engine. A string, which includes Google\u2122's URL and the search term, e.g., \u201cwww.google.com?cats\u201d, are passed to the Google\u2122's search engine. In one embodiment, a promotion code for the company that developed software  may also be a part of the string that is passed to Google\u2122's search engine to facilitate any kind of agreements that may have been made between Google\u2122 and the company that owns search engine interface . Assuming that Google\u2122 is search engine A in , Google\u2122 would search information A for information on cats.","In step , the results of the search are returned in a browser window. For example, in searching information A, Google\u2122 may return a list of URLs to documents found on the internet  that pertain to \u201ccats.\u201d Google\u2122 may then cause the list of URLs or \u201cresults\u201d to be displayed in a browser window . Software  may be coded in a way that if the browser window  is not open at the time the user instructed search engine interface  to perform the search by clicking on button , then window  may be opened to display the results to the user.","According to one embodiment, the types of controls that browser window  has is controlled by parameters set by software . For example, software  may specify whether browser window  may resize, have horizontal and\/or vertical scroll bars, a back button, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["490","490","400","401","400","402","400","401","403","400","401","404","400","405","400","406","400","401","407","400","401","408","490"]},"Display device  utilized with computer system  may be a liquid crystal device, cathode ray tube, or other display device suitable for creating graphic images and alphanumeric characters recognizable to the user. Cursor control device  allows the computer user to dynamically signal the two-dimensional movement of a visible symbol (pointer) on a display screen of display device . Many implementations of the cursor control device are known in the art including a trackball, mouse, joystick or special keys on alphanumeric input device  capable of signaling movement of a given direction or manner of displacement. It is to be appreciated that the cursor control  also may be directed and\/or activated via input from the keyboard using special keys and key sequence commands. Alternatively, the cursor may be directed and\/or activated via input from a number of specially adapted cursor directing devices.","In one embodiment, the software  may be executed on the computer system .","In conclusion, search engine interface  provides an interface that is quick, easy, and convenient for searching the internet. Search engine interface  is the kind of interface that users would want to use frequently and leave on their desktop for a number of reasons.","For example, search engine interface  does not take up valuable space either on the task bar or the desktop. Since it is not on the task bar, valuable space is available for other applications on the task bar. Further, since it is compact, it does not take a lot of space on the desktop either. In fact, it can be moved almost entirely off the desktop to provide even more space.","Secondly, leaving the browser open takes up a lot of space on the desktop. Since search engine interface  does not require leaving the browser open, more space is available on the desktop.","Thirdly, search engine interface  is convenient to use because it provides the essential features necessary for performing a search. For example, search engine interface  provides a window for entering search terms, a list of user selectable search engine names, and a button to initiate a search, thus, making it easy and convenient for a user to perform searches.","Fourthly, by providing a list of search engine names, users have the flexibility to choose from a number of search engines for performing searches.","Fifth, search engine interface  is convenient because it remains available for user input, whereas, a browser window may be closed.","Also, search engine interface  provides commercial benefits to the company that owns the software  that creates search engine interface . For example, new search engine names may easily be added to the list of search engines names without requiring the recompilation of software  or the recompilation of any code associated with the search engines. Thus, it is easy for the company that owns code  to enter into new partnerships with companies that own search engines.","Similarly, by making it easy to add new names to the list of search engine names, it would be easy for the company that owns software  to sell software  to other companies."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and form a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
