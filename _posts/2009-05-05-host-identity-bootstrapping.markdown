title: Host identity bootstrapping
abstract: Automated provisioning of hosts on a network with reasonable levels of security is described in this application. A certificate management service (CMS) on a host, one or more trusted agents, and a public key infrastructure are utilized in a secure framework to establish host identity. Once host identity is established, signed encryption certificates may be exchanged and secure communication may take place.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["Provisioning is the installation and configuration of an end entity on a network. This end entity, or \u201chost,\u201d may be a router, network attached storage, physical server, virtual server, etc. Traditionally, provisioning involves human interaction to establish the identity of the device. This establishment of host identity allows other security processes to reliably know who the host is, in order to ensure that only those hosts that are authorized to run a particular service do so.","Various schemes have been put forth to streamline and automate provisioning. However, these provisioning techniques rely upon a human actor to complete the provisioning process by participating in the establishment of the host identity. Virtual servers provide multiple separate server instances executing on common physical host, with each instance requiring separate provisioning. With the increasing population of servers, both physical and virtual, the problem becomes more challenging.","In large data center environments, this requirement for human interaction can lead to delays in provisioning as well as increased operational costs. Thus, there is a need for reasonably secure automated identification of hosts prior to their being turned over to production in order to permit fully automated provisioning of hosts.","As described above, provisioning of hosts, including servers, in a data center has traditionally involved human interaction. Currently available solutions still ground the root of trust of a host's identity in a human that authorized the provisioning of a newly installed host and, thus, are not completely automated. Other available solutions rely on placement within a network to establish identity, a reliance which breaks down in large data center environments.","This disclosure describes techniques for automating the provisioning process. Using techniques described herein, host identity may be established to a network without human intervention, even before an operating system (OS) is fully instantiated on the host being provisioned. Once the host OS boots, a certificate management service loads and automatically retrieves one or more encryption certificates (certificates) from a certificate authority (CA). In one example, this certificate retrieval may utilize hypertext transport protocol secure (HTTPS). The certificates allow future secure communications between the host and the network. Certificates may also be renewed for a provisioned host without human intervention. Exceptional circumstances such as a change in the hardware may cause a change in the hardware identification (HWID) of the requesting host. This would make it a new host and require a new certificate.","The value of encryption certificates in the context of this application is not in the mere possession by a host of the encryption certificate. Possession only proves that a host has a certificate issued by an appropriate certificate authority. Rather, the value of the certificate is in the permissions granted to the identity authenticated by possession of the certificate, such as the host\/hostclass mapping. So, while a rogue host may obtain a certificate, only legitimate hosts can take actions of value such as obtaining the software necessary to be a member of a hostclass. A host class is a grouping of hosts, and may be maintained by a trusted centralized authority. Thus, the issuance of a certificate is not necessarily a sensitive operation, but rather provisioning a host into a hostclass or otherwise trusting a host that has proven its identity, is a sensitive operation. The establishment of identity during the provisioning process is discussed in more detail next.","Illustrative Host Identity Bootstrapping Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"Security services used to provide secure web services include authentication, access control, and auditing. Auditing  requires, among other things, authentication to establish the actor attempting access and service access controls to determine what the actor did. This authentication may rely on some form of key management . Service access control  in turn depends upon binding an authenticated identity with a resource. Service-to-service authentication  further requires an authenticated identity. The authenticated service identity depends on there being a service identity  in the first place.","However, the service identity  is only as trustworthy as the manner in which that service was imbued with its identity. If a service is provisioned with its proof of identity after someone who could be untrusted has touched it, the identity may be untrustworthy. Thus, some sort of host identity framework  is called for.","Within host identity framework , a network  provides communication between devices which are attached to it. Network  may comprise an Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Token Ring, Fibre Channel, or other network including hardware and\/or software configured to permit communication between devices. For illustration only, and not by way of limitation, the network in this application is described in the context of an Ethernet network using the internet protocol suite Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP).","Trusted agent(s)  attached to network  may include several entities. These trusted agent(s)  may include a build-out server (BOS)  which provides build-out information to a host and updates a host management database (HMDB)  to reflect the host status and hardware identification (HWID) of the new host. HMDB  provides storage and retrieval of host information such as host status and HWID values. Each HWID is associated with a particular instantiation of an operating system, and not necessarily the specific underlying hardware in which the OS is running. For example, each instantiation of an operating system on each virtual server on a common physical server would have a different HWID.","A permissions database (PDB)  provides a permissions service which maintains a database of network resources accessible to specific encryption certificates.","An OS image server (OSIS)  provides operating system images for installation on a host .","A trusted issuer server (TIS)  provides a certificate signing request (CSR) request processing service, and responds to valid requests for CSRs from hosts with a CSR.","An infrastructure coordination server (ICS)  provides a management interface and facilitates communication between the hosts, public key infrastructure, and trusted agent(s) . The ICS  also provides a level of abstraction, allowing interaction and management between different security domains. For example, an ICS would allow a host in a \u201cproduction\u201d security domain to interact with servers in an \u201cexperimental\u201d security domain.","A public key infrastructure (PKI)  is also included in the host identity framework . PKI  may include a Certificate Authority Server (CAS)  and Registration Authority Server (RAS) . CAS  signs encryption certificates, while RAS  may act as a proxy for the CAS . In other implementations, portions of PKI  may be operated by a same or different entity as an end entity  and\/or trusted agents .","End entities  are also included in the host identity framework . These end entities may include servers, routers, storage devices, virtualized instances, or other unique computing resource that needs an identification certificate. Host  may be such an end entity  that is, or needs to be, authenticated to the network .","While shown as discrete devices, the servers and databases shown in  may be consolidated or distributed across several physical or virtual devices. For example, in one implementation TIS  and host  may be deployed as virtualized instances across a shared physical host. In such an implementation, a high degree of trust may be assumed for communication via a trusted control channel between these virtualized servers on shared computing hardware. This control channel may include a virtual networking connection between the virtualized servers, shared memory such as a common disk or memory location, and so forth. Thus, use of virtualized servers on shared computing hardware may result in increased security resulting from a greater level of trust for data exchanged between server instances via the control channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","126","126","202","204","202","204","206","206","138","206","138","208","138","210","126","202","114"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","128","302","304","302","304","306","306","304","308","116","130","136","310","128","302","114"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["400","132","132","402","404","402","404","406","406","138","404","408","410","408","410","406","138","410","132","412","402","114"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["500","134","502","504","502","504","506","506","504","130","132","510","134","502","114"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"],"b":["600","138","138","602","604","602","604","606","604","608","138","610","138"]},"A certificate management service module (CMSM)  is configured to request CSR's from TIS  or self-generate CSRs, send those CSRs to CAS , and receive, store, and control access to encryption certificates on the host .
