title: XML payload specification for modeling EDI schemas
abstract: Modeling an electronic data interchange (EDI) document using extensible Markup Language (XML) at runtime. A plurality of structural elements is identified in the EDI document. A plurality of corresponding data values is identified from the identified plurality of structural elements in the EDI document. A plurality of annotations is generated for a plurality of rules included in the EDI document. The plurality of rules defines operations associated with the plurality of corresponding data values. The determined data values and the generated annotated is transformed into an XML schema corresponding to the EDI document. The XML schema is processed at runtime.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Electronic data interchange (EDI) is one of the ways businesses use for exchanging computer-to-computer business information based on approved formatting standards and schemas. For example, millions of companies around the world transmit data associated with business transactions (e.g., purchase orders, shipping\/air bills, invoices, or the like) using EDI to conduct commerce.","In a typical EDI transaction model, a large business entity or an EDI integration broker trades with numerous partners and has the technical capability to handle numerous EDI transaction data in various EDI formats and schemas. These entities, also known as \u201chubs,\u201d transact with one or more suppliers, also known as \u201cspokes\u201d. Each of the spokes typically is a relatively small business entity that is only capable of dealing with one hub.","Before the spokes attempt to initiate transactions via EDI with the hub, the hub typically transmits various EDI schemas to the spokes so that the spokes may properly format the EDI transactions according to the EDI schemas. Currently, EDI schemas are large in size and the file size for each EDI schema typically ranges from 1 MB to 3 MB. In addition, the hub or large trading partners customarily transmit a large amount of schemas to the spokes, without taking into considerations of the spokes' lack of hardware capability. As such, thousands of such schemas, which may occupy several Gigabytes in bandwidth during transmission, are transmitted from the hub to the spokes.","In addition to transmitting a large amount of schemas which consume the spokes' transmission bandwidth, related systems or techniques define EDI schemas using a linear or flat file-based to represent EDI schemas. These types or models of representation, while having a simple composition, do not have the full capability to represent additional and sometimes have critical information associated with EDI schemas. As such, the spokes and the hub alike may not maximize the full benefit of the convenience of EDI transactions.","Embodiments of the invention enhance the previous approaches and practices of representing EDI schemas by describing a structured EDI documents using eXtensible Markup Language (XML) configurations. By modeling an EDI payload as XML payload during runtime, embodiments of the invention reduce the time in developing schemas and transformation maps. In addition, alternative embodiments generate annotations in the XML EDI schemas including information associated with a plurality of validation rules that exists in the EDI data.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Other features will be in part apparent and in part pointed out hereinafter.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the drawings.","Referring first to , a block diagram illustrates a system  for conducting electronic data interchange (EDI) transactions according to an embodiment of the invention. The system  includes a hub  linked to and communicating with one or more spokes . In one embodiment, the hub  includes a server computer or a computing device serving one or more processors (e.g., processor ) or processing units for executing computer-executable instructions for serving the spokes . In one example, the spokes  include a computing device having one or more components included in or coupled with a computer , as shown in .","In one example, the hub  also includes a memory area  for storing one or more EDI schemas, such as an EDI schema . Initially, the hub  and the spokes  establish agreements as to the EDI formats or standards to be used for transmitting transaction data therebetween. Once the parties determine the particular EDI formats or standards to use, the hub  selects the appropriate EDI schemas to be transmitted to the spokes . In another example, the hub  may choose to select all EDI schemas for all types of transactions, such as purchase orders, bills of lading, invoices, payrolls, or the like, to the spokes . Although the communications between the hub  and the spokes  can be a private or public communications network, a wired or wireless network, the spokes  typically lack the hardware resources to handle large amount of EDI schemas sent from the hub . In addition, the type and bandwidth of computing network communications for the spokes  are not equipped to handle such demand imposed by the thousands of EDI schemas, which can reach several Gigabytes in data size.","Referring now to , a block diagram illustrates a structured EDI schema using XML according to an embodiment of the invention. As discussed above, related practices would represent EDI schema using a simplified, linear, or flat configuration. Table 1 illustrates three EDI transactions in a structured EDI schema embodying aspects of the invention in the left column and the corresponding three transactions in the traditional EDI representation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Three EDI transactions in a structure (left column)"},{"entry":"and in three EDI documents (right column)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"EDI transactions in a Structure","Flat EDI transactions"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"BeginOfTransaction#1","BeginOfTransaction#1a"]},{"entry":[{},"POHeaderSegment","POHeaderSegment"]},{"entry":[{},"POLine1","POLine1"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"POSchedule1.1","POSchedule1.1"]},{"entry":[{},"POSchedule1.2","POLine1Totals"]},{"entry":[{},"POLineTotals","POTotals"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"POLine2","EndOfTransaction#1a"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"POSchedule2.1"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"POLine2Totals","BeginOfTransaction#1b"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"POTotals","POHeaderSegment"]},{"entry":[{},"EndOfTransaction#1","POLine1"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"POSchedule1.2"]},{"entry":[{},"POLine1Totals"]},{"entry":[{},"POTotals"]},{"entry":[{},"EndOfTransaction#1b"]},{"entry":[{},"BeginOfTransaction#1c"]},{"entry":[{},"POHeaderSegment"]},{"entry":[{},"POLine2"]},{"entry":[{},"POSchedule2.1"]},{"entry":[{},"POLine2Totals"]},{"entry":[{},"POTotals"]},{"entry":[{},"EndOfTransaction#1c"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"As illustrated, the flat EDI schema uses more characters and thus occupies more data size than a structured EDI schema in the left column. In one embodiment, the structure of EDI schemas is represented using XML which enables faster processing during runtime and easy configuring, editing, and modifying by users using known XML editing tools.","In one example, an EDI schema is identified by a DocType, which may include a combination of namespace and root node name. In one example, DocType is defined as TargetNamespace \u2018#\u2019 RootNodeName. In the example where X12 standard is used, X12 schemas use the following format:\n\nX12 Schemas=X12_{Version}_{TsId},\n\nwhich indicates that:\n\n1). all X12 schemas have a root node name that starts with X12;\n\n2). \u201cVersion\u201d represents the version information of the document, and it is a dynamic piece of information which is configuration or instance driven; and\n\n3). \u201cTsId\u201d stands for \u201ctransaction ID\u201d of the document being processed and is always read from the input instance.\n","As another example, another well-known standard, EDIFACT, includes the following format for representing the EDIFACT schemas:\n\nEDIFACT Schemas=Efact_{Version}_{Tsid},\n\nwhich indicates that:\n\n1). all EDIFACT schemas have root node name that starts with Efact;\n\n2). \u201cVersion\u201d represents the version information of the document, and it is a dynamic piece of information which is configuration or instance driven; and\n\n3). \u201cTsId\u201d stands for \u201ctransaction ID\u201d of the document being processed and is always read from the input instance.\n","As shown in , an EDI schema  in a structural overview may include one or more root nodes . Each root node  includes a sequence of loops  and segments  as children. Loops  may include one or more nested sub-loops  or sub-segments .","Similarly, the segment  may include one or more component data elements  and data elements . In one embodiment, an XML payload schema representing an EDI schema may possess the following structure:","1. Schema\u2212>RootNode","2. RootNode\u2212>(Block)+","3. Block\u2212>Segment|Loop","4. Loop\u2212>(Block)+","5. Segment\u2212>(DataElement)+, RuleSet","6. DataElement\u2212>SimpleField|CompositeField","7. SimpleField\u2212>data","8. CompositeField\u2212>(data)+","9. RuleSet\u2212>(Rule)+|BlankRuleSet","10. Rule->PairedRule|RequiredRule|ExclusionRule|ConditionalRule|ListRule.","In one embodiment, in modeling the EDI schemas using XML, a plurality of schema rules are applied to configure the XML schema. For example, the plurality of rules may include:","1. One or more elements (e.g., loop, segment, or the like) are at each level with no attributes.","2. Every ComplexType would use \u2018sequence\u2019 compositor. In one example, the ComplexType is a construct for modeling hierarchical data entities. Each ComplexType may use \u201csequence\u201d, \u201cchoice\u201d or \u201cany\u201d compositor to group its children, and each compositor may be used according to the following:","a) Sequence\u2014the children should occur in a specific order within an XML instance","b) Choice\u2014only one of the children can appear in an XML instance","c) Any\u2014children can appear in any order in an XML instance","In one embodiment, an EDI schema uses only the sequence compositor. In an alternative embodiment, \u201cchoice\u201d and \u201cany\u201d compositor would not be used. The ComplexType may only be included elements as children.","3. Starting from the root node of the document, any element that includes substring \u201cLoop\u201d would be considered a Loop element. Otherwise, it would be considered a segment (see additional discussion below).","4. Once a segment has been identified, substrings of the segment will not be identified.","5. Segments can have children and grand-children in the structured XML schema. For example, only descendants at distance 1 and 2 from the segment node would be permitted as part of the structure.","6. One or more annotations are generated to represent the rules in the EDI schemas. For example, the annotations may be used to represent one or more of the following:","a) Cross field validation rules;","b) Trigger field information, to be used with schemas associated with compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA);","c) Reference designator;","d) Split point information rules. For example, the split point information indicates information when the EDI schema or EDI transactions satisfying requirements of EDI schemas have split into multiple sub-documents.","In one embodiment, the XML schema is structured using one or more two- or three-character tags.  is a diagram illustrating a XML schema embodying aspects of the invention. For example, a panel  illustrates one or more two- or three-character tags. For example, tags include \u201cST\u201d, \u201cBEG\u201d, \u201cCUR\u201d.","In one embodiment, based on the name of the segment element, the first three characters may be considered as a tagId. In an alternative embodiment, if the third character of the three-character tag is a \u201c_\u201d character, the segment ID would only be the first two characters. In addition, if one of the two characters includes a \u201c-\u201d character, a compilation error would occur. For instance:","a) \u201cBEG_BeginTransaction\u201d means the Segment ID is BEG;","b) \u201cN1850Segment\u201d means the Segment ID is N1;","c) \u201cN_abc\u201d means a invalid segment;","d) \u201cN1_Loop\u201d means this is a loop and not a segment; and","e) \u201cN_Loop\u201d means this is not an invalid segment but a loop.","In another embodiment, one or more special rules may apply to a set of segment tags. For example, tags such as \u201cISA\u201d, \u201cIEA\u201d, etc. have special significance and they are called control segments. Similarly, tags such as \u201cST\u201d and \u201cSE\u201d are both control and data segments. The list below provides an exemplary set of control segment tags:","ISA","GS","ST","SE","GE","IEA","UNOA","UNB","UNG","UNH","UNT","UNE","UNZ","In another example, embodiments of the invention enhance the functionality of EDI schemas by accounting for one or more rules using annotations. For example, in handling one or more cross field validation rules, rules are expressed as annotations at segment level nodes. Every segment includes an optional list of rules, which are also known as RuleSet. For example, a panel  illustrates one or more annotation tags in a structured XML schema. As an illustration, a set of exemplary rules are described in the following paragraphs:","Paired\/Multiple\u2014(all, absent)\u2014Either all subject names are present or absent.

previous representation or model of EDI schemas, embodiments of the invention provide a rich set of information for describing rules associated with EDI schemas using XML.","As illustrated above, each rule has a \u201csubject\u201d attribute, an optional qualifier attribute, and a list of subject elements. For example, each of the rules is defined based on values of (subjects, qualifier) pairs:","In one embodiment, the operands of a rule are data elements found within a segment. In this embodiment, during the rule evaluation, a specific value of an operand is not needed. Rather, what is needed is the information whether the data element was valued or not. Using the system  in  as an example, during parsing or serialization by a parser\/serializer , on encountering a segment, the parser\/serializer  may keep track of the data elements that had a non-blank value. After segment processing is over, the parser\/serializer  may be able to evaluate all rule operands and hence execute the RuleSet. In the situation where errors occurred in processing the rule operands, one or more error codes are issued. As an example, an exemplary set of suitable error codes is described below corresponding to particular rule violations:","Error code 2\u2014Conditional required data element missing\u2014This would be reported when a Conditional rule is violated.

For example, computer storage media include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that may be used to store the desired information and that may be accessed by computer . Communication media typically embody computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and include any information delivery media. Those skilled in the art are familiar with the modulated data signal, which has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. Wired media, such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media, such as acoustic, RF, infrared, and other wireless media, are examples of communication media. Combinations of any of the above are also included within the scope of computer readable media.","The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of removable and\/or non-removable, volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory. In the illustrated embodiment, system memory  includes read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM . RAM  typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently being operated on by processing unit . By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data .","The computer  may also include other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media. For example,  illustrates a hard disk drive  that reads from or writes to non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic media.  also shows a magnetic disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk  such as a CD-ROM or other optical media. Other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media that may be used in the exemplary operating environment include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like. The hard disk drive , and magnetic disk drive  and optical disk drive  are typically connected to the system bus  by a non-volatile memory interface, such as interface .","The drives or other mass storage devices and their associated computer storage media discussed above and illustrated in , provide storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computer . In , for example, hard disk drive  is illustrated as storing operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Note that these components may either be the same as or different from operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data  are given different numbers here to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies.","A user may enter commands and information into computer  through input devices or user interface selection devices such as a keyboard  and a pointing device  (e.g., a mouse, trackball, pen, or touch pad). Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are connected to processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to system bus , but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port, or a Universal Serial Bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to system bus  via an interface, such as a video interface . In addition to the monitor , computers often include other peripheral output devices (not shown) such as a printer and speakers, which may be connected through an output peripheral interface (not shown).","The computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to computer . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) , but may also include other networks. LAN  and\/or WAN  may be a wired network, a wireless network, a combination thereof, and so on. Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets, and global computer networks (e.g., the Internet).","When used in a local area networking environment, computer  is connected to the LAN  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a wide area networking environment, computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the WAN , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, is connected to system bus  via the user input interface , or other appropriate mechanism. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in a remote memory storage device (not shown). By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates remote application programs  as residing on the memory device. The network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","Generally, the data processors of computer  are programmed by means of instructions stored at different times in the various computer-readable storage media of the computer. Programs and operating systems are typically distributed, for example, on floppy disks or CD-ROMs. From there, they are installed or loaded into the secondary memory of a computer. At execution, they are loaded at least partially into the computer's primary electronic memory. Aspects of the invention described herein includes these and other various types of computer-readable storage media when such media contain instructions or programs for implementing the steps described below in conjunction with a microprocessor or other data processor.
