Pat. App. 61\/305,925 entitled, \u201cAutomated transaction system,\u201d to Casares and to U.S. Prov. Pat. App. 61\/373,205 entitled, \u201cSettlement processes in an automated payments system,\u201d to Casares et al., which are both incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.","The disclosed embodiments relate generally to automated transactions and, more specifically, to both an automated transaction system including wireless and contactless transactions on a network and to settlement processes in an automated transaction system.","Current transaction processing and settlement systems, including those of the national payment transaction networks operating on global systems, are dominated by large processors, financial institutions, and third parties. These networks can be expensive to utilize and do not offer robust security.","This disclosure relates to a transaction service facilitating fast, efficient, and secure transactions. The transaction service may be used by consumers, merchants, financial institutions, and other third parties located in the same geographic region, but may be easily adapted to other systems. The transaction service is designed to reduce per-transaction costs, enabling the development of relationships between consumers, merchants, financial institutions, and other third parties, enabling real-time processing, and enabling a rich communication channel including rewards, coupons, marketing functionality, etc.","This disclosure also relates to settlement processes in an automated transaction service facilitating fast, efficient, and secure transactions. The settlement process may be initiated by the automated transaction service to settle accounts between consumers, merchants, and financial institutions after a transaction takes place over a transaction network.","This disclosure also relates to fraud prevention over a transaction processing and settlement network.","This disclosure also relates to a dynamic identification for consumers and merchants using a transaction processing and settlement network system.","This disclosure also relates to confirmation of transactions or payments, verification of transactions or payments, and other communications between a point of sale device and a consumer.","The automated transaction system allows consumers, merchants, financial institutions, and other third parties to strengthen their relationships through a local transaction network that offers more efficient transaction processing and settlement for reduced per-transaction cost and risk management costs; increased security; and rich, targeted rewards and loyalty offers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","102","101","103","102","105","105","104","106","107","105","107","104","108","108","104","109","104","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","201","205","210","203","200","210","210"]},"The consumer identifier mechanism  may be a sticker equipped with a near-field communication (NFC) chip that allows consumers to initiate contactless transactions on the network . The merchant terminal  may be a wireless point-of-sale terminal equipped with a contactless reader that allows merchants to accept payments initiated by a consumer, and the terminal  may also be provided by the transaction network itself, a financial institution, or other third party. The merchant terminal  may also be a merchant acceptance method integrated with any type of merchant acceptance hardware or software, including any other point-of-sale terminal. Firmware and hardware operated on the merchant terminal  are implemented through computer instructions stored on a computer-readable medium on the merchant terminal in order to effect the functions described herein. The methodologies discussed herein are not limited to any one type of terminal and, in an embodiment, are \u201chardware agnostic\u201d and may be employed with any financial transaction hardware or software. The transaction platform or network  connects the consumer and merchant to a financial institution or other funding source  to form a transaction network.","The consumer identifier mechanism  allows consumers to make convenient and secure transactions by tapping the mechanism or \u201ctag\u201d  on a merchant terminal  installed at a local merchant in the transaction platform or network . In an embodiment, the transaction is made simply by tapping or otherwise placing the mechanism  in near proximity to a merchant terminal  installed at a local merchant in the transaction platform or network . In an embodiment, using methods further described below, consumers receive instant confirmation on their phone after a successful transaction.","The automated transaction system  also offers a rewards module that allows financial institutions and merchants to offer rewards to consumers who perform mobile transactions on a consumer identifier mechanism . A consumer may accrue reward points for purchases made on the transaction platform . In an embodiment, using methods further described below, a consumer may redeem reward points at any network merchant.","The automated transaction system  may be designed to provide multiple levels of security and risk management to make the transaction network more secure than traditional credit and debit networks. In an embodiment, as further described in the present application, no personal or account information is stored on or inside the consumer identifier mechanism  or used at any stage of initiating and processing the transactions made on the transaction platform . The automated transaction system uses a set of encryption keys for the consumer identifier mechanism  and the merchant terminal  for transaction processing. In another embodiment, which is also further described below in the present application, the automated transaction system uses dynamic encryption keys (changing periodically based on a security algorithm) for both the consumer identifier mechanism  and the merchant terminal  to substantially decrease the risk of unauthorized replication or duplication of the devices.","As described herein, encrypted communication is used to transmit security\/encryption keys between devices, and the keys are stored at the hardware level, making the keys difficult to retrieve by \u201cskimming.\u201d As used herein, skimming refers to the theft of information, including account information, used in an otherwise legitimate transaction. In another embodiment, the automated transaction system employs a two-factor authentication process. For certain transactions, a consumer or merchant may be prompted to enter a unique PIN on their mobile device or on the merchant terminal  for authorizing the transaction. As further described herein, real-time short messaging (SMS messaging) confirmation on a consumer's mobile device is implemented to enable ongoing monitoring of account activity for a consumer.","Fraud Prevention and Dynamic Identification","The consumer identifier mechanism  may be designed to protect consumers against identity fraud and to prevent sticker cloning. Unlike traditional credit or debit cards, the consumer identifier mechanism  does not store any consumer personal or account information on the sticker. Instead, it uses a combination of two encryption keys during the transaction to identify the consumer for authorization purposes. These two keys are read by the merchant terminal  and are passed on to the transaction platform  for consumer authentication. If either of the keys is incorrect, the transaction is denied.","In the two-key authentication method described above, the first key is a unique identification number that is stored within a digital device on the consumer identifier mechanism , and this unique identifier serves as the primary identification for the sticker. The second key is a dynamic identification number, which is a dynamic number that changes after each transaction or after some number of transactions. When the consumer identifier mechanism  is read by the merchant terminal , the reader reads the old dynamic identification number and simultaneously replaces the old number with a new dynamic identification number that is generated by the merchant terminal  using a proprietary algorithm. The dynamic nature of the secure identification number may provide protection, such as preventing cloning of the mechanisms  for fraudulent purposes.","In an embodiment, each merchant terminal  has proprietary firmware that provides the transaction management and security functionalities. This proprietary firmware may comprise computer instructions stored on a computer-readable medium for operation of the transaction management and security functionalities. Like the consumer identifier mechanism , the merchant terminal  does not store any consumer personal or account information, nor does it have the ability to access or otherwise manipulate this information. Like the consumer identifier mechanism , the merchant terminal  may also use a dual-key design where a set of terminal-specific encryption keys is used during transactions to authenticate a consumer identifier mechanism . These keys may be stored at the hardware level for added security.","When the transaction platform  successfully receives a message from a merchant terminal , it generates a new key to be used by the terminal in the following message. This key is transmitted from the transaction platform  to the merchant terminal  with the synchronous response to the original message. This prevents or greatly hampers cloning of merchant terminals  in the network.","In an embodiment, each merchant terminal  may also periodically initiate a handshake process with the transaction platform  to set up a key that will be accepted for a given period of time. This key is obtained after a handshaking process that provides more security level than the message key process. The combination of both keys provides a secure channel between the merchant terminal  and transaction platform .","The transaction platform  infrastructure is designed as a three-tier solution where security zones (e.g., virtual area networks or VLANs) are created segregating web, application, and database networks. Accordingly, traffic is permitted to flow directly from the Internet to the different VLANs upon utilization of a two-factor virtual private network (VPN), e.g., both a security certificate and a username and password combination.","Firewalls are implemented according to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) specification to support the two-factor authentication. In an embodiment, by default, firewalls may deny inbound and outbound traffic that is not required for the application. Documented justification is required for any other available protocols, e.g., HTTP, SSL, SSH, and VPN. Any relatively risky protocol, such as FTP, may also require documented justification.","The transaction platform  may be run on servers at a certain location. In an embodiment, the servers are run using robust measures for security monitoring and reporting. In an embodiment, the transaction platform  utilizes a network security scanner (e.g., DataPipe, eEye's Retina network security scanner, etc.) to conduct fast, accurate, and non-intrusive scanning The servers are designed to be secure against the most recent of discovered vulnerabilities. A network-based intrusion detection system with real-time reporting may be used to monitor and detect malicious network activity that can compromise the security of the transaction platform . In-depth system integrity monitoring is performed to detect and report system changes so such changes can be tracked and validated. In an embodiment, the transaction platform  provides ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) and HTTP monitoring of servers (e.g., SureMonitor Enhanced Monitoring). The monitoring and reporting processes provide real-time reporting of file system changes including files, security settings, configuration parameters, and permissions, ensuring that changes have been planned and verified, and that unauthorized changes are investigated.","The security of the wireless channel between the merchant terminal  and the transaction platform  system is comprised of several aspects. Whenever a merchant terminal initiates activity with transaction platform , there is an agreement between both systems to share an encryption key, and the exchange of information is made through a layer of data encryption. Both the merchant terminal and the transaction platform  use Secure Internet Live Conference (SILC) Key Exchange (SKE) algorithms with symmetrical keys for data encryption\/decryption.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","308","300","341","361","341","302","308","341","361","308","302","370","341","361","308","341","361","308","302"]},"The consumer system  may include a consumer mobile device , a consumer computer , and\/or a consumer identifier mechanism . In an embodiment, the consumer identifier mechanism  is attached to the consumer mobile device , but the consumer identifier mechanism  may be used separately from a consumer mobile device . The consumer identifier mechanism  is used to communicate  (e.g., via near-field communication) with a merchant terminal . Thus, the consumer identifier mechanism  may be attached to an item that the consumer typically carries (e.g., keys, wallet, mobile device, planner, etc.) or may be carried separately by the consumer. The consumer computer  may be a personal computer providing the consumer with access to a number of program manager websites (e.g., a personal banking site or an airline miles site). A consumer may also access various aspects related to their account at the automated transaction platform  via the consumer computer . For example, the automated transaction platform  may provide a consumer website over the Internet  providing content for the consumer's transactions, available rewards, coupons, memberships, etc. The consumer may also be able to access merchant websites via the Internet.","Connections  (indicated by a dotted line) are exemplary connections between the consumer system , merchant system , program manager system , and automated transaction platform , but other connections may be possible.","The merchant system  may include a merchant terminal , a point of sale (POS) server , a merchant computer system , an awards server , and a merchant server . The POS server  may be used for storing information and for processing space for POS transactions at the merchant terminal . The awards server  may be used for storing information for merchant reward, award, coupon, etc. information and to process related programs. In an embodiment, an awards server  is located at the automated transaction platform  and a merchant computer  may access this awards server  to determine merchant reward, award, coupon, etc. information and to process related programs. In another embodiment, both the merchant system  and the automated transaction platform  have awards servers , . The merchant server  may be used for storing other merchant-related information including marketing information, HR records, accounting, etc. and for executing or processing related programs.","The merchant computer  may also provide the merchant access to a number of websites (e.g., a business banking site). A merchant may also access various aspects related to merchant and customer accounts at the automated transaction platform  via the merchant computer . For example, the automated transaction platform  may provide a merchant website portal over the Internet  providing content for the merchant's transactions, available rewards, coupons, memberships, etc. The merchant may also be able to access consumer data including, but not limited to, data warehouse analytics, at the automated transaction platform's data server .","The separate modules for the POS server , merchant computer system , awards server , and merchant server  are for illustration purposes only. The servers and computer system may all be encompassed within one machine or may be a group of networked machines. The merchant terminal  may be networked with the merchant computer system and servers.","When a transaction is initiated by a consumer via their consumer identifier mechanism  at a merchant terminal , the merchant system  may transmit information to and access information from the automated transaction platform . For example, when a consumer uses their consumer identifier mechanism  for coupon redemption, the merchant system  may access the automated transaction platform's  coupon server  to determine whether the coupon is valid and how much the coupon is worth. Alternatively, the merchant may have coupon validity and value information stored at the merchant server  and may access the automated transaction platform's  coupon server  to link the consumer identifier mechanism  with the coupon and with the consumer's account. The automated transaction platform  may facilitate an automatic transaction using the coupon information, consumer information, merchant information and, optionally, associated financial institution or program manager information. Similar levels of involvement are true for other types of transactions including rewards-based transactions and payment transactions. The automated transaction platform  may be flexible depending on each consumer, merchant, and program manager to provide as little or as much transaction information and processing as is used by a particular transaction.","The program manager system  may include an automated transaction system server , a merchant account server , a consumer account server , an awards server , and an account processor . The program manager system  may be a financial institution system with servers ,  for consumers and merchants. The account processor  may process transactions and update information related to consumers, merchants, and awards at the servers , , . The automated transaction system server may store information related to the automated transaction platform  and the automated transaction platform  may access and update the automated transaction system server  during a transaction.","The separate modules for the automated transaction system server , the merchant account server , the consumer account server , the awards server , and the account processor  are for illustration purposes only. The servers and computer system may all be encompassed within one machine or may be a group of networked machines.","The automated transaction platform  may include a consumer server , merchant server , SMS module , program management inquiry server , queue server , coupon server , awards server , data server , and account processor . The automated transaction platform  facilitates transactions and transaction-related communication between the consumer system , merchant system , and the program management system . The consumer server  may store data related to a number of consumer accounts and execute consumer-related programming. The merchant server  may store data related to a number of merchant accounts and execute merchant-related programming. The SMS module  may communicate with a GPRS provider  to provide alerts to a consumer mobile device  via the GPRS network . The program management inquiry server  may store data related to program management inquiries and execute program management inquiry-related programming. The queue server  may store data related to queue management and execute related programming. The coupon server  may store data related to coupons and execute related programming. The awards server  may store data related to awards and rewards and execute related programming. The data server  may store aggregated data related to consumer and merchant transactions as well as execute data warehouse analytics programming. Other servers may be possible including any servers related to consumer-merchant transactions or exchanges.","The separate modules for the consumer server , merchant server , SMS module , program management inquiry server , queue server , coupon server , awards server , data server , and account processor  are for illustration purposes only. The servers and computer system may all be encompassed within one machine or may be a group of networked machines.","In an embodiment, the program manager system  is a depository institution. The depository institution may provide a consumer identifier mechanism  to a depository institution customer so that the consumer customer can initiate payments. In this case, the depository institution will be referred to as an \u201cIssuing Bank\u201d herein. In another embodiment, a depository institution provides merchant terminals  to a depository institution merchant customer so that the merchant customer may accept payments. In this case, the depository institution will be referred to as an \u201cAccepting Bank\u201d herein. A participating depository institution may act as an Issuing Bank, an Accepting Bank, or both in any transaction in the automated transaction system .","As discussed in U.S. Prov. Pat. App. No. 61\/305,925, in an embodiment, the consumer identifier mechanism  may be a sticker attached to a mobile device. A consumer may initiate contactless transactions with a merchant at the point of sale by tapping the consumer identifier mechanism  on a merchant terminal . The consumer identifier mechanism  initiates a payment through the transaction platform .","The automated transaction platform  is operable to conduct a transaction in the automated transaction system . The automated transaction platform  directs settlement and reconciliation processes over the automated transaction system .","In an embodiment, after the consumer identifier mechanism  is tapped on the merchant terminal , the transaction platform  issues instructions to the Issuing Bank and Accepting Bank that result in the consumer identifier mechanism  user account at the Issuing Bank being debited and the merchant's designated account at the Accepting Bank being credited. As described in more detail below, as part of the settlement process, multiple amounts are distributed: (1) an issuing fee is distributed to the Issuing Bank; (2) an accepting fee is distributed to the Accepting Bank; (3) a processing fee is distributed to automated transaction system account; and (4) the balance of the funding is distributed to the merchant.","In an embodiment, the Issuing Bank is responsible for settling funds to the Accepting Bank arising from the transactions conducted by the Issuing Bank's consumer identifier mechanism users with their mechanisms . The Issuing Bank will rely upon settlement information provided by the transaction platform to effect this settlement.","For all of the specific machines or components illustrated in , there are multiple computers and\/or servers that will implement the functionality to be performed by those machines. These computers and\/or servers will operate according to instructions that have been stored to instruct the operations of processors on those computers and\/or servers, and those instructions will be stored on computer-readable mediums. For the sake of simplicity and readability of these figures, the computer-readable memory is not illustrated in all cases, but one of ordinary skill in the art will know how to provide such memory and instructions to effect the functions described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","414","416","418","420","422","418","414","400","422","414","416"]},"The automated transaction platform  is connected to other components  of the automated transaction system, e.g., a consumer identifier mechanism or merchant terminal, via a connection . In an embodiment, the connection  is a wireless connection. The connection between the other components  and the automated transaction platform  is protected by an Internet firewall . The automated transaction platform  is also connected to the Internet  via a connection  protected by an Internet firewall . In an embodiment, the connection  is a wireless connection.","The computer cluster  is in communication with a server . The connection  between the computer cluster  and the server  is protected by a database firewall . In an embodiment, the server  is an Oracle server and the connection  is an Oracle native connection. The computer cluster  is also in communication with the interfaces  and the servlets . The connections  between the computer cluster , the interfaces , and the servlets  are protected by a middleware firewall . In an embodiment, the connections  are remote method invocation (RMI) connections. The servlets  are connected with the consoles  and the web machines  via connections . The connections  are protected by middleware firewalls . In an embodiment, the connections  may comprise POST\/JSON connections. In an embodiment, the connections  and  are also protected by an authentication system . The computer server machines, firewalls, and other components of the system illustrated in  are implemented according to computer instructions stored on computer-readable mediums in communication with their associated machines. These implementations are consistent with the other implementations of such computer machines in the present application, and therefore it should be understood that computer-implemented instructions stored on computer-readable media will be effected for multiple computer system elements throughout this specification.","Referring back to , communication between a merchant terminal  and the transaction platform  may be made through a single entry point. That allows the transaction platform to securely communicate with the external world while protecting the sensitive services behind the firewalls. As a result of the handshaking process, the transaction platform  provides new encryption keys to the merchant terminal  and grants access to the core services through the single entry point. In an embodiment, the encryption keys have a 24-hour expiration policy.","In an embodiment, messages are transmitted through a general packet radio service (GPRS) system or any other mobile phone system. Messages sent through the GPRS network are encrypted using these encryption keys discussed above. Messages arrive to the single entry point (the only service made public by the transaction platform) and once there, the transaction platform  validates the security credentials provided by the message.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","501","503","505","503","501"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","601","604","603","601","607","605","604","605","604"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","700","700","707","702","707","706","706"]},"Referring back to , with each response to a particular device , the transaction platform  generates a one-time key called message key that is included with the response message. When the transaction platform  receives a message from such a device, it also checks that the key received is the same one as the one provided to that particular device  with the last response. If not, the transaction platform  will reset the channel with that particular device  and request a new handshaking","Referring back to , the transaction platform  may provide financial institutions  with a web-based management console to configure, monitor and control the transaction network. An SSL certificate exclusive to each financial institution  is issued by the transaction platform , and a financial institution designated administrator is provided with console privileges unique for that financial institution . To access the transaction platform  from one or more of a financial institution's  computers, the financial institution  installs the SSL certificate into the web-browser on those computers. The transaction platform  management console may reject connection requests from computers where a valid SSL certificate issued by the transaction platform  is not installed. The financial institution designated administrator may ensure the safekeeping of the SSL certificate.","Communications between the financial institution's  management console and the transaction platform  may be encrypted using 128-bit SSL algorithms (e.g., https). Each financial institution  also has the option to require that a VPN connection be established before allowing a financial institution  computer to access the transaction platform . Once a financial institution's  computer is authenticated, the administrator may create new console users and grant them different access levels based on customized profiles created in the console.","The transaction platform  may also provide a management console for use by participating merchants . A merchant-designated administrator is provided with console privileges unique to that merchant . Communications between the merchant's management console and the transaction platform  may be encrypted using 128-bit SSL algorithms (e.g., https).","Settlement Process","As discussed above, transactions processed using the automated transaction system are initiated by consumers, and accepted by merchants, through the transaction platform. Unlike prior art settlement processes, which used batch processing to process and balance large groups (sometimes a day's worth) of transactions, the present system enables real-time or near-real-time settlement of each transaction.","Referring back to , using the approach set forth in the present application, for a given transaction, upon presentment of a consumer identifier mechanism , the financial institution associated with that mechanism can be assessed a fee, the merchant bank associated with the merchant to which the mechanism  can be credited with funds, and the intermediate or automatic transaction processing service can be credited with a transaction processing fee. The efficient, real-time automatic system for receiving and processing of these consumer-identified transactions is enabled by the system architecture defined in embodiments of the present application.","Transactions may be routed \u201con-us\u201d (generally speaking, \u201con-us\u201d refers to intra-institution routing for financial instruments where consumers and merchants bank with the same financial institution). The transaction platform may enable community-based financial institutions to participate fully in the economic benefits of payment processing. The automated transaction network empowers consumers with innovative mobile technology to enable fast, convenient and secure payments with merchants in the community. At the same time, local merchants benefit from simplified, low-cost acceptance and expedited funding.","Thus, as described herein, consumers can initiate contactless debit transactions at local merchants by tapping their consumer identifier mechanism  on a merchant terminal . Once a transaction is authorized, a consumer's account is substantially immediately debited for the amount of the transaction, and the merchant immediately receives funds as part of the settlement process. During the settlement process, for example, four amounts may be transferred: (1) an issuing fee is transferred to the issuing financial institution, which is the financial institution that issues consumer identifier mechanisms  to consumers; (2) an accepting fee is transferred to the accepting financial institution, which is the financial institution that enables acceptance of payments by merchants using a merchant terminal  (in an \u201con-us\u201d transaction, the accepting financial institution is the same as the issuing financial institution); (3) a processing fee is transferred to the automated transaction service; and (4) the balance of the funding is transferred to the merchant. All of these activities can occur substantially in real-time through the automated systems defined herein.","The settlement of \u201con-us\u201d transactions, or intra-financial institution transactions, is initiated by the automated transaction service and, in an embodiment, may be completed in real-time through the transaction platform  transaction processing service, although most financial institutions may only wish to settle once per day. Same-day processing provides advantages including, but not limited to, efficient distributing issuing and accepting fees to financial institutions; efficient distributing of the processing fee to the automated transaction service; same day funding of the merchant account; and efficient clearing and reconciling of the operating account.","The automated transaction system approach to settling transactions may expedite merchant funding, expedite delivery of issuing fees, and eliminate the high monthly services invoice typically associated with network transaction processing. Services provided by the automated transaction service, including authorization, authentication, settlement, and console-based client management and reporting are included in the automated transaction service transaction fee that is collected from the financial institution during the settlement process. The automated transaction service also supports rewards programs. Rewards programs may be offered by consumer identifier mechanism  issuers and participating merchants to encourage spending and loyalty.","The participants in an \u201con-us\u201d transaction include a consumer and a merchant that both maintain demand deposit checking accounts with the same financial institution. The architecture of the automated transaction system service promotes and rewards \u201con-us\u201d transactions as they enable community financial institutions to participate in the economic benefits of both issuing consumer identifier mechanisms  to consumers and enabling acceptance of payments by merchants with merchant terminals . Typically, only the largest institutions are able to conduct \u201con-us\u201d processing\u2014and the economic benefits are limited or unavailable to smaller or community financial institutions. In an embodiment, the consumer initiates \u201con-us\u201d transactions with the consumer identifier mechanism  on their mobile device at the merchant's merchant terminals . The automated transaction system service may complete transaction settlement the same day.","Participants in an \u201copen loop\u201d transaction include a consumer maintaining an account with one financial institution and the merchant maintaining an account with another financial institution.","The automated transaction system service enables participating financial institutions to develop and implement customized transaction level risk management policies. A configuration setting may be recommended, but participating financial institutions may configure transaction level risk management policies. In an embodiment, risk configurations are based on consumer transaction behavior, specifically the amount and frequency of transactions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","802","804","806"]},"The no-PIN-required authentication standard  may be used for transactions defined by a financial institution to be low in risk. These transactions may be authorized without the entry of a PIN number. In an embodiment, the transaction size and merchant business categories are defined by participating financial institutions.","The PIN-requested-via-the-merchant-terminal authentication standard  may also be configured by the financial institution. In this embodiment, a financial institution configures the transaction platform to ask consumers to enter a PIN number into the merchant terminals based on the transaction characteristics. A message on the merchant terminal will inform the merchant to ask the consumer to enter the PIN. In another embodiment, the consumer or merchant determines which transaction sizes and merchant business categories for which a PIN number is requested.","The PIN-requested-via-IVR authentication standard  may be used, either by request of the financial institution or of the end users (merchant or consumer). In an embodiment, the PIN-requested-via-IVR authentication standard  may be used for transactions having the highest risk. For transactions determined by the financial institution to have the highest risk, the transaction platform may be configured to initiate an automated outbound IVR phone call to the consumer's mobile phone. An automated transaction system service phone service may then prompt the consumer to enter the consumer's PIN into the mobile phone.","Once the appropriate PIN authentication has been completed, the transaction will be approved or declined. In an embodiment, PINs are created at the time the consumer identifier mechanisms are issued to consumers.","Referring back to , in the event a consumer or merchant requests (or is required) to provide a refund, if the transaction has not settled (meaning the consumer's account has not been debited and the merchant's account has not been credited), a reversal can be initiated from the merchant terminal . A reversal request is input into the merchant terminal  by the merchant and results in the deletion of the initial transaction. No fees are charged to the merchant or participating financial institutions for a reversal transaction.","In the event a consumer or merchant requests (or should provide) a refund, if the transaction has settled (meaning the consumer's account has been debited and the merchant has been credited and the payment is complete for the initial transaction), a merchant may initiate a refund transaction to the consumer as described below.","Once an automated transaction system transaction has been settled and a consumer requests a full or partial refund, a refund transaction is used to return funds from the merchant to the consumer. Merchants may initiate refund transactions at the merchant terminal  or via a web-based merchant management console . When a refund takes place, the merchant account will be debited for the refund amount and the consumer account will be credited for the refund amount. A refund may be requested for the full purchase amount or a partial refund amount.","At any time, a consumer may choose to dispute a transaction.

Also as referred to herein, a server is a machine deployed to execute a program operating as a socket listener and may include software instances.","Resources may encompass any types of resources for running instances including hardware (such as servers, clients, mainframe computers, networks, network storage, data sources, memory, central processing unit time, scientific instruments, and other computing devices), as well as software, software licenses, available network services, and other non-hardware resources, or a combination thereof.","A networked computing environment may include, but is not limited to, computing grid systems, distributed computing environments, cloud computing environment, etc. Such networked computing environments include hardware and software infrastructures configured to form a virtual organization comprised of multiple resources which may be in geographically disperse locations.","While communication protocols may be described herein, the coverage of the present application and any patents issuing there from may extend to other local-area network, wide-area network, or other network operating using other communications protocols.","Services and applications are described in this application using those alternative terms. Services can be java services or other instances of operating code. A service\/application is a program running on a machine or a cluster of machines in a networked computing environment. Services may be transportable and may be run on multiple machines and\/or migrated from one machine to another.","Various terms used herein have special meanings within the present technical field. Whether a particular term should be construed as such a \u201cterm of art,\u201d depends on the context in which that term is used. \u201cConnected to,\u201d \u201cin communication with,\u201d or other similar terms should generally be construed broadly to include situations both where communications and connections are direct between referenced elements or through one or more intermediaries between the referenced elements, including through the Internet or some other communicating network. \u201cNetwork,\u201d \u201csystem,\u201d \u201cenvironment,\u201d and other similar terms generally refer to networked computing systems that embody one or more aspects of the present disclosure. These and other terms are to be construed in light of the context in which they are used in the present disclosure and as those terms would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art would understand those terms in the disclosed context. The above definitions are not exclusive of other meanings that might be imparted to those terms based on the disclosed context.","Words of comparison, measurement, and timing such as \u201cat the time,\u201d \u201cequivalent,\u201d \u201cduring,\u201d \u201ccomplete,\u201d and the like should be understood to mean \u201csubstantially at the time,\u201d \u201csubstantially equivalent,\u201d \u201csubstantially during,\u201d \u201csubstantially complete,\u201d etc., where \u201csubstantially\u201d means that such comparisons, measurements, and timings are practicable to accomplish the implicitly or expressly stated desired result.","While specific software packages are described herein, it should be understood that such applications running on servers, or through distributed web applications, servlets, or other software implementations function practically as particular machines in a the described embodiments. In many described instances, underlying data is representative of real-world items, and operations on such data are transformative of that data. The described embodiments are practical applications and are implemented on real-world machines having hardware, software, and firmware elements. References to particular software packages or firmware releases should be understood to include all version of such packages or releases.","Additionally, the section headings herein are provided for consistency with the suggestions under 37 CFR 1.77 or otherwise to provide organizational cues. These headings shall not limit or characterize the invention(s) set out in any claims that may issue from this disclosure. Specifically and by way of example, although the headings refer to a \u201cTechnical Field,\u201d such claims should not be limited by the language chosen under this heading to describe the so-called technical field. Further, a description of a technology in the \u201cBackground\u201d is not to be construed as an admission that technology is prior art to any invention(s) in this disclosure. Neither is the \u201cBrief Summary\u201d to be considered as a characterization of the invention(s) set forth in issued claims. Furthermore, any reference in this disclosure to \u201cinvention\u201d in the singular should not be used to argue that there is only a single point of novelty in this disclosure. Multiple inventions may be set forth according to the limitations of the multiple claims issuing from this disclosure, and such claims accordingly define the invention(s), and their equivalents, that are protected thereby. In all instances, the scope of such claims shall be considered on their own merits in light of this disclosure, but should not be constrained by the headings set forth herein."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Reference is now made to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.
