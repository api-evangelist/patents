Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase is a heme-containing intracellular enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate-determining step in the degradation of the essential amino acid L-tryptophan to N-formyl-kynurenine. N-formyl-kynurenine is then metabolized by multiple steps to eventually produce nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Tryptophan catabolites produced from N-formyl-kynurenine, such as kynurenine, are known to be preferentially cytotoxic to T-cells. Thus an overexpression of IDO can lead to increased tolerance in the tumor microenvironment. IDO overexpression has been shown to be an independent prognostic factor for decreased survival in patients with melanoma, pancreatic, colorectal and endometrial cancers among others. Moreover, IDO has been found to be implicated in neurologic and psychiatric disorders including mood disorders as well as other chronic diseases characterized by IDO activation and tryptophan depletion, such as viral infections, for example AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, cancers including T-cell leukemia and colon cancer, autoimmune diseases, diseases of the eye such as cataracts, bacterial infections such as Lyme disease, and streptococcal infections.","Accordingly, an agent which is safe and effective in inhibiting production of IDO would be a most welcomed addition to the physician's armamentarium.","The present invention provides compounds and\/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, stereoisomers thereof or tautomers thereof, methods of modulating or inhibiting the enzymatic activity of IDO, and methods for treating various medical conditions using said compounds.","The present invention also provides processes and intermediates for making the compounds of the present invention and\/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or stereoisomers thereof or tautomers thereof.","The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and one or more of the compounds of the present invention and\/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or stereoisomers thereof or tautomers thereof.","The compounds of the invention and\/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or stereoisomers thereof or tautomers thereof may be used in the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of multiple diseases or disorders associated with enzymatic activity of IDO inhibition, such as cancer, viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and other maladies.","The compounds of the invention and\/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or stereoisomers thereof or tautomers thereof may be used in therapy.","The compounds of the invention and\/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or stereoisomers thereof or tautomers thereof may be used for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of multiple diseases or disorders associated with enzymatic activity of IDO.","The compounds of the invention and\/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or stereoisomers thereof or tautomers thereof can be used alone, in combination with other compounds of the present invention and\/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or stereoisomers thereof or tautomers thereof, or in combination with one or more other agent(s).","Other features and advantages of the

This treatment protocol temporarily separates the circulation of the involved limb from the rest of the body and injects high doses of chemotherapy into the artery feeding the limb, thus providing high doses to the area of the tumor without exposing internal organs to these doses that might otherwise cause severe side effects. Usually the fluid is warmed to 102\u00b0 to 104\u00b0 F. Melphalan is the drug most often used in this chemotherapy procedure.

Substantially simultaneous administration can be accomplished, for example, by administering to the subject a single dosage form having a fixed ratio of each therapeutic agent or in multiple, single dosage forms for each of the therapeutic agents. Sequential or substantially simultaneous administration of each therapeutic agent can be effected by any appropriate route including, but not limited to, oral routes, intravenous routes, intramuscular routes, and direct absorption through mucous membrane tissues. The therapeutic agents can be administered by the same route or by different routes. For example, a first therapeutic agent of the combination selected may be administered by intravenous injection while the other therapeutic agents of the combination may be administered orally. Alternatively, for example, all therapeutic agents may be administered orally or all therapeutic agents may be administered by intravenous injection. Combination therapy also can embrace the administration of the therapeutic agents as described above in further combination with other biologically active ingredients and non-drug therapies (e.g., surgery or radiation treatment). Where the combination therapy further comprises a non-drug treatment, the non-drug treatment may be conducted at any suitable time so long as a beneficial effect from the co-action of the combination of the therapeutic agents and non-drug treatment is achieved. For example, in appropriate cases, the beneficial effect is still achieved when the non-drug treatment is temporally removed from the administration of the therapeutic agents, perhaps by days or even weeks.","Pharmaceutical Compositions and Dosing","The invention also provides pharmaceutically acceptable compositions which comprise a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the compounds of Formula I, formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (additives) and\/or diluents, and optionally, one or more additional therapeutic agents described above.","The compounds of this invention can be administered for any of the uses described herein by any suitable means, for example, orally, such as tablets, capsules (each of which includes sustained release or timed release formulations), pills, powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, suspensions (including nanosuspensions, microsuspensions, spray-dried dispersions), syrups, and emulsions; sublingually; bucally; parenterally, such as by subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intrasternal injection, or infusion techniques (e.g., as sterile injectable aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions); nasally, including administration to the nasal membranes, such as by inhalation spray; topically, such as in the form of a cream or ointment; or rectally such as in the form of suppositories.

The reactions are performed in a solvent or solvent mixture appropriate to the reagents and materials employed and suitable for the transformations being effected. It will be understood by those skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present on the molecule should be consistent with the transformations proposed. This will sometimes require a judgment to modify the order of the synthetic steps or to select one particular process scheme over another in order to obtain a desired compound of the invention.","The novel compounds of this invention may be prepared using the reactions and techniques described in this section. Also, in the description of the synthetic methods described below, it is to be understood that all proposed reaction conditions, including choice of solvent, reaction atmosphere, reaction temperature, duration of the experiment and workup procedures, are chosen to be the conditions standard for that reaction, which should be readily recognized by one skilled in the art. Restrictions to the substituents that are compatible with the reaction conditions will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art and alternate methods must then be used.","The Compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared by the exemplary processes described in the following schemes and working examples, as well as relevant published literature procedures that are used by one skilled in the art.
