title: Die mounting stress isolator
abstract: One method of the present invention includes preparing a die with traces and pads as desired for the intended use of the die. A MEMS device is mounted to the die. The die is then mounted to a substrate of the same material as the die. The substrate is then mounted to a package. The die and/or the substrate may be flip-chip mounted.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein was made in the performance of work Under U.S. Government Contract No. DAAE30-01-9-0100. The Government Agency is U.S. Army, TACOM-ARDEC. The Government may have rights to portions of this invention.","Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices or computer chips are often mounted on dies. Stresses due to die mounting can affect the performance of MEMS devices. The stresses change with temperature because of the differing coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of the package and the die; dies made of silicon or borosilicate glass typically have a lower CTE than that of the package, so as temperature changes, the package stresses the die. Thus, as shown in , a die  with a lower CTE than a package  are heated when attaching the die  to the package . When the assembly  cools, the package experiences more shrinkage than the die, and creates stress at attachment points . The stress affects the performance of the MEMS device .","The stresses also change due to shock when wire bonds change shape, which causes problems for capacitive sensors that require stable geometry for stable output. Additionally, making wire bonds at the package level makes the parts more expensive because each part must be handled separately, as well as increasing the chance of damage to the assembly.","The present invention provides a system and method of reducing the stress associated with a die mount, as well as eliminating the wire bonding operation.","In an example embodiment, a die is prepared with traces and pads as desired for the intended use of the die. A MEMS device is mounted to the die. The die is then mounted to a substrate of the same material as the die. The substrate is then mounted to a package.","With reference to , a device  according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. A MEMS device , which may be an accelerometer, a gyroscope, or any other suitable MEMS device, is mounted to a rectangular block die  during the MEMS build. The die  is mounted to a rectangular block cover plate  via gold bumps  (which can be approximately 0.001\u2033 to 0.005\u2033 in diameter, and the die  can be flip-chip mounted to the cover plate . The gold bumps  provide all of the structural strength necessary to prevent dislodging the die  during use. The MEMS device  can be protected from contact during flip-chip mounting using etched features or process controls. The cover plate  is mounted to a package , a rectangular block including a recess  (or wirebond shelf) with a step , sized and shaped to receive the MEMS device , the die , and the cover plate . The cover plate  is mounted to the step  of the package  via gold bumps , and the cover plate  can be flip-chip mounted to the package . The package  can be a Leadless Ceramic Chip Carrier (LCCC). Electrically conductive traces  from the MEMS device  to the gold bumps , and conductive traces  from the gold bumps  to the gold bumps  provide a connection between the MEMS device  and the package  so that the MEMS device  can be in electrical contact with devices or systems (not shown) outside the package as necessary depending on the intended use of the device .","The die  has a preselected CTE, and the package  has a preselected CTE that is higher than the CTE of the die . The cover plate  is preferably made of the same material as the die  with the same CTE as the die . Alternatively, the cover plate  is made of a different material than the die , as long as the CTE of the cover plate  has an intermediate CTE higher than the CTE of the die  and lower than the CTE of the package , and preferably the CTE of the cover plate  is closer to the CTE of the die  than the package .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["26","27","29","24","29","24","27","27","28","28","27","24","29"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["40","42","44","46"]},"Note that the electrically conductive traces ,  electrically connect the MEMS device to the package. The traces are mechanically more stable under shock than wirebonds, because they are printed on the package and cover plate.","While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, as noted above, many changes can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the embodiments disclosed use gold bumps, but solder balls, conductive polymers, or directional conductors may be used instead. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is not limited by the disclosure of the preferred embodiment. Instead, the invention should be determined entirely by reference to the claims that follow."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Preferred and alternative embodiments of the present invention are described in detail below with reference to the following drawings:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
