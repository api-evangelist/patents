{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This disclosure relates generally to test circuits, and more specifically to a test circuit having a scan chain.","Consumers continue to demand complex functional circuits, with higher performance and lower cost, such as data processors, very large scale integrated circuits (VLSI), systems on chips (SoCs), central processing units (CPUs), advanced processing units (APUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), memory sub-systems, system controllers, and peripheral functions. At the same time, testing the operation of the functional circuit and determining that the functional circuit is operating as desired is increasingly difficult. Robust testing technologies have been developed such as boundary scan, now defined as a standard by the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG). Also, Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG), which is compatible with many automatic test equipment systems, is used to determine if a functional circuit is operating according to specification. More advanced \u201cat speed\u201d ATPG technologies launch test patterns and capture the resulting data in a manner that tests a functional circuit at substantially the same speed the functional circuit runs during normal operation.","However a problem arises when testing circuits at speed by using a test pattern received and launched from an internal scan chain. The scan operation involves shifting bits of data serially through the scan chain at a relatively low speed. Once the test is enabled, however, a relatively large number of logic gates switch at high speed and their outputs are captured in the scan chain. This scan-to-test transition can cause a significant disruption on the internal power supply voltage, and the disruption can distort the test and cause circuits that operate according to specifications to fail.","In the following description, the use of the same reference numerals in different drawings indicates similar or identical items. Unless otherwise noted, the word \u201ccoupled\u201d and its associated verb forms include both direct connection and indirect electrical connection by means known in the art, and unless otherwise noted any description of direct connection implies alternate embodiments using suitable forms of indirect electrical connection as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120"]},"Multiplexer  has a select input to receive a scan enable signal labeled \u201cSE\u201d, an input (\u201c1\u201d) to receive a scan data input signal labeled \u201cSDI\u201d, an input (\u201c0\u201d) to receive a data signal labeled \u201cD\u201d, and an output. Scan latch  has a clock input to receive a clock signal labeled \u201cSCLK\u201d, a data input (\u201cD\u201d) connected to the output of multiplexer , and an output (\u201cQ\u201d) to provide a serial data output signal labeled \u201cSDO\u201d and which forms a signal input to a functional circuit also labeled \u201cQ\u201d. The serial data output signal is used as a signal input to the \u201cSDI\u201d input of the next scan cell in a scan chain arrangement.","In operation, in a scan shift mode, multiplexer  provides SDI to the D input of scan latch  in response to a logic high on signal SE. Scan latch  latches SDI on a rising edge of SCLK to provide SDO. Other latches in the scan chain (not shown in ) are used to shift a test pattern through the scan chain until it is properly aligned.","In a test mode, during a launch phase, scan cell  launches the Q output of scan latch  after the scan shift mode is finished. In a capture phase, multiplexer  provides captured data D to the D input of scan latch  in response to a logic low on signal SE. Scan latch  latches the capture data on a rising edge of SCLK.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","240","200","210","220","230","240"]},"Functional circuits , , and  may have a multiple number of inputs (not shown for functional circuit ) and a multiple number of outputs (not shown for functional circuit ).","Test circuit  includes a controller  and a scan chain . Controller  has an output to provide a scan shift enable signal labeled \u201cSSE\u201d, an output to provide a shift clock signal labeled \u201cSCLK\u201d, and an output to provide a control signal labeled \u201cWARMUP_EN\u201d to scan cells in scan chain . Controller  also has a scan data output to provide scan data to the first scan cell in scan chain , and a scan data input to receive test data from the last scan cell in scan chain .","Scan chain  includes a multiple number of scan cells  forming a chain in which a scan data output of one scan cell is connected to a scan data input of the next scan cell in the chain. The first scan cell  of scan chain  has a scan data input connected to the scan data output of controller . Each subsequent scan cell  of scan chain  receives serial data input from the previous scan cell . The last scan cell  of scan chain  has a scan data output connected to the scan data input of controller .","In operation, controller  provides an interface for an external agent to load a scan pattern into integrated circuit , perform a test using the scan pattern, and determine the response of the various functional circuits to the test pattern. In this particular example, controller  defines a common boundary scan test interface and conforms to the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (\u201cIEEE\u201d) standard 1149.1. Controller  first controls scan chain  to shift in the desired test pattern. During scan shifting, controller  provides the SCLK signal at a relatively low speed, such as 200 megahertz (MHz). When the test pattern has been shifted into the appropriate position in scan chain , controller  warms up the functional circuits by repetitively outputting the desired test pattern from scan cells  to the corresponding functional circuits and captures preliminary test data generated by the test pattern in scan cells . Controller  then restores the original test pattern to the output of scan latches within scan cells . Controller  provides SCLK as a relatively high-speed clock, such as 2 gigahertz (GHz), during test mode. The relatively high-speed clock allows the functional circuits to react in the same way they would react during normal operation, and to load the power supply in the same way. By repetitively performing warmup sequences and then restoring the desired test data to the scan latches, test circuit  causes the power supply voltage to settle so that the results of the at-speed test will eventually reflect the operation of the circuit under normal operating conditions. After a desired number of repetitions, corresponding to a power supply voltage settling time interval during which the power supply voltage initially deviates from its nominal value and subsequently returns to approximately the nominal value, test circuit  captures test response data generated by the functional circuits into scan chain  and shifts the test response data out.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","280","300","310","320","330"]},"Restore latch  has an active low enable input to receive signal WARMUP_EN, a D input to receive signal SDI from a previous scan latch, and a Q output. Multiplexer  has an input to receive a scan shift enable input labeled \u201cSSE\u201d, a 1 input connected to the Q output of restore latch , a 0 input to receive a data signal D, and an output. Scan latch  has a clock input to receive signal SCLK, a D input connected to the output of multiplexer , and a Q output to provide serial data output signal SDO to a subsequent latch and output signal Q to a functional circuit.","Considering both , in a scan shift mode, controller  provides signal WARMUP_EN at a logic low and signal SSE at a logic high to scan cell . Restore latch  operates in a transparent mode during an inactive WARMUP_EN (WARMUP_EN at a logic low) in which the output changes in response to changes in the input. Multiplexer  provides SDI to the D input of scan latch  while signal SSE is at a logic high. Scan latch  latches the value of SDI on the next low-to-high transition of SCLK. Controller  provides additional transitions of SCLK to move data into successive positions until the desired test pattern has moved into the desired position in the scan chain.","When controller  has shifted the test pattern into the desired position in the scan chain, it provides signal WARMUP_EN at a logic high to latch SDI in restore latch  and enters the test mode. The test mode has three phases: restore, launch, and capture. In the restore phase, controller  provides SSE at a logic high at a time sufficient to provide adequate setup time at the input of scan latch . A low-to-high transition of SCLK captures the data in scan latch  and outputs the data to the corresponding functional circuit. In the capture phase, controller  provides signal SSE at a logic low to select the D input of multiplexer  at a time sufficient to provide adequate setup time at the input of scan latch , and this value is latched into scan latch  on the next rising edge of SCLK. The launch phase separates the restore and capture phases. Controller  repeats the restore, launch, and capture phases a multiple number of times to warm up the functional circuits. By changing the data at the output of scan latch  with data from the D input (via the multiplexor  selector SSE=0 path) during the launch phase, scan cell  ensures that the functional circuits under test are subjected to the same type of signal transitions at the same speed as they would encounter during normal operation.","After the end of the test mode, controller  enters a shift out mode by providing WARMUP_EN at a logic low and SSE at a logic high and providing a series of SCLK pulses at a relatively low speed to shift the captured test response data out of the scan chain for comparison with expected results.","Note that while scan cell  adds an additional level-sensitive restore latch  that requires a few extra transistors to implement, restore latch  eliminates the need for extra hold time buffers between scan cells as is typically needed in scan chain . Thus in actual embodiments the additional circuit area required to implement scan cell  will be smaller than the size of an extra latch per cell.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["400","240","400","410","420","430","0","8","0","0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","8"]},"In operation, controller  performs a launch on capture (LOC) test methodology. For the LOC test methodology, test circuit  launches a test pattern, the functional circuits under test provide data to the (D) input signal of multiplexer , and scan latch  captures the data on a rising edge of CLK (waveform ) when signal SSE is at a logic low (SSE waveform ).","Before time t, controller  provides SCLK at a relatively low speed, such as 200 MHz, and test circuit  operates in the scan-in mode to shift a test pattern through scan chain . When controller  has shifted the test pattern into scan chain , it provides signal WARMUP_EN at a logic high. Between time t and t, controller  performs an initial RESTORE cycle and restore latch  latches the test data. The initial RESTORE cycle is needed for ATPG to shift the test pattern into the desired position in the scan chain. Controller  subsequently provides signal SSE at a logic low and after a launch period starting at t, the scan chain captures the test data on the next rising edge of SCLK.","Time t to time t defines a WARMUP period covering the launch and capture phases, during which controller  provides SSE at a logic high with sufficient setup time before the next rising edge of SCLK to set the test data in restore latch  to the D input of scan latch . At the next rising edge of SCLK at time t, scan latch  restores the test data before another WARMUP period.","The RESTORE and WARMUP periods described from time t to time t repeat at times t to t, t to t, and t to t. From times t to t, controller  performs final LAUNCH and CAPTURE phases, which includes a launch period starting at t before capturing the output data at the next rising edge of SCLK. To scan the test data out, controller  deactivates WARMUP_EN after t, and scan chain  shifts the test data to controller  again using a relatively low-frequency clock.","Signal SSE is a pipelined signal that is at a logic high a setup time before a rising edge of SCLK to implement the restore phase, and is at a logic low a setup time before subsequent rising edges of SCLK to implement the launch and capture phases. Test circuit  uses a tree circuit to generate SSE with appropriate timing, that has a trunk and branches to account for propagation delays throughout the scan chain.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"],"b":["500","300","500","510","520","530","0","3","0","1","2","2","3"]},"In operation, controller  implements the timing diagram of  to perform a launch on shift (LOS) test methodology. For the LOS test methodology, test circuit  launches a test pattern on the last shift cycle of the scan shift mode, when signal SSE is active before a low-to-high transition of SCLK (SSE waveform ).","Before time t, controller  provides SCLK at a relatively low clock speed, such as 200 MHz, and integrated circuit  operates in the scan shift test mode to shift a test pattern through scan chain . At time t, controller  has previously asserted an active SSE and further asserts an active WARMUP_EN (waveform ). In response, restore latch  latches the test pattern. Scan latch  latches the test pattern on the next rising edge of SCLK (waveform ).","From time t to time t, during the LOS phase, controller  de-asserts SSE and provides a launch pulse on SCLK to launch the test pattern into functional circuitry such as functional circuit . From time t to time t, during a CAPTURE phase, controller  provides a capture pulse on SCLK and scan latch  latches the captured data, while restore latch  continues to store the test pattern. After the CAPTURE phase is performed, controller  asserts an active SSE and an inactive WARMUP_EN, and scan chain  shifts the test result to controller .","While scan cell  can be used to implement the LOS test methodology without warmup, it cannot realize the warmup capability at the same time as a LOS methodology. This incompatibility is due to the inability to restore the starting state from a LOS test pattern.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2"],"b":["610","280","620","630","610","612","614","616","612","614","1","616","612","616","2","614","616"]},"Gated clock signal generator  includes a latch  which is a level sensitive latch, and an AND gate .

Scan latch  operates with output latch  in an LSSD scan shift mode based on asserted non-overlapping SC and SC_CLK edges.","Controller  provides signal CLK at a second clock rate, faster than the shift clock rate, and gated clock signal generator  provides a CLK_g launch pulse followed by a CLK_g capture pulse, when enabled by ENABLE_g, as a function of CLK. While controller  provides RESTORE_EN at a logic low, gated clock signal generator  provides SC_CLK edges to scan cell  as a function of the lower-speed SC scan clock signal. While controller  provides RESTORE_EN at a logic high, gated clock signal generator  provides SC_CLK edges to scan cell  as a function of the higher speed CLK. Scan latch  restores test patterns to output latch  using the faster CLK.","As for scan cell  of , controller  controls scan cell  to perform a desired number of warm-up and restore cycles to mitigate the power supply droop that would otherwise occur during a rapid transition between scan and test modes.
