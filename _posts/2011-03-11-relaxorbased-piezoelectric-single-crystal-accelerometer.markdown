title: Relaxor-based piezoelectric single crystal accelerometer
abstract: A cantilever beam accelerometer design is disclosed that obviates the need of attaching electrical leads directly to the piezoelectric plates. According to one aspect of the invention, two identical proof-masses are positioned on top of each piezoelectric plate in a symmetrical fashion. In advance of attaching the masses to the plates, electrical leads are attached to the masses by some suitable technique such as soldering. Each proof-mass is positioned on its respective piezoelectric plate as close to the free-end of the beam as practical, to keep the size of the mass reasonably small. The disclosed concept is useful for both series and parallel configurations of the piezoelectric plates, wherein the polarization vectors are in opposite directions for two plates connected in series and the polarization vectors are in the same direction for two plates connected in parallel.

A broad set of applications where they have been used include vibration monitoring of machinery, shock evaluation of structures, seismic sensing, and underwater acoustic surveillance. When low frequency applications are considered (e.g., frequencies below 10 kHz) flexural mode accelerometers are often used because they have excellent performance characteristics and can be fabricated in a reasonably straightforward manner. High frequency applications are better served with compression and shear mode accelerometers because the resonance frequency of such devices is typically in the ultrasonic frequency range and therefore facilitates a flat receiving sensitivity over a relatively large bandwidth. For a general discussion on the basic operating principles of accelerometers, refer to G. Gautschi, Piezoelectric Sensorics: Force, Strain, Pressure, Acceleration, and Acoustic Emission Sensors, Materials and Amplifiers (Springer, Berlin, 2006) pp. 167-197, incorporated by reference herein.","Historically speaking, the most pervasive flexural mode accelerometer design is the so-called trilaminar piezoelectric cantilever beam in which a sensing structure comprised of a fixed-free metal beam outfitted with a pair of piezoelectric plates is used to convert dynamic motion to an output voltage that can be processed and displayed to glean useful information about a measurement. Depending on the design, a proof-mass may optionally be included at the free end of the beam so that the operational bandwidth and sensitivity are tuned to specific values. Examples of devices that utilize cantilever beam accelerometers include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,722,614, 4,333,029, and 4,709,359, each incorporated by reference herein. In all cases it is important to note that the piezoelectric plates associated with these devices comprise a polycrystalline ceramic composition such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and the electrical signal is routed from the transducer to the processing electronics\/instrumentation using wires that are in intimate electrical contact (e.g., soldered) with the piezoelectric plates.","In the late 1990's, researchers discovered that relaxor-based piezoelectric single crystal materials had superior elasto-piezo-dielectric properties to those of polycrystalline ceramics. Initially, binary formulations comprised of lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) and lead zinc niobate-lead titanate (PZN-PT) were developed, but later on ternary compounds comprised of lead magnesium niobate-lead indium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PIN-PT) and lead magnesium niobate-lead zirconate-lead titanate (PMN-PZ-PT) were developed. Eventually, practical devices containing single crystal transduction elements were made and included a trilaminar cantilever beam accelerometer, such as the one disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,104,140 B2, incorporated by reference herein. Here it is noted that the accelerometer described in this patent contains <011> poled PMN-PT transduction elements and a proof-mass.","All of the research performed to date indicates that one of the main drawbacks of using single crystal materials concerns the undesirable change in the crystal structure and\/or depolarization that can occur at moderately elevated temperatures. For example, in binary formulations the rhombohedral-to-tetragonal transition temperature Tis typically less than 110\u00b0 C. and the Curie temperature Tis typically less than 150\u00b0 C. Moreover, in ternary formulations Tand Tmoderately exceed 110\u00b0 C. and 150\u00b0 C., respectively. So far, none of the research performed to date indicates that conventional soldering techniques can be used in connection with attaching electrical leads to single crystal transduction elements. This is because most solders need to be heated to over 250\u00b0 C. in order to form satisfactory electrical connections. In contrast, the Curie temperature for most piezoelectric ceramic materials is at least 300\u00b0 C., therefore conventional and advanced soldering techniques can be employed for ceramic-based transducers. For the case of single crystal transducers, special low temperature solder, conductive epoxy, or novel electroding techniques are required to resolve this issue. These steps are invariably cost-prohibitive and time-consuming.","For a discussion regarding the temperature characteristics associated with binary and ternary single crystal materials, see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 20090194732 A1 and C. H. Sherman and J. L. Butler, (Springer, New York, 2007), pp. 552-553, each incorporated by reference herein.","The object of the present invention is to illustrate a novel cantilever beam accelerometer design that obviates the need of attaching electrical leads directly to the piezoelectric plates. That is, in prior embodiments, such as that presented in U.S. Pat. No. 7,104,140 B2, the proof-mass has traditionally been located at the free-end of the beam. In the present invention two identical proof-masses are positioned on top of each piezoelectric plate in a symmetrical fashion. In advance of attaching the masses to the plates, electrical leads are attached to the masses by some suitable technique such as soldering. Here it is noted that each proof-mass is positioned on its respective piezoelectric plate as close to the free-end of the beam as practical. In this way the size of the mass can be kept reasonably small in order to achieve the same resonance frequency relative to the case of positioning the proof-mass at the free-end of the beam. This feature also keeps the beam from becoming overly stiff since most of the bending, and hence the strain energy responsible for generating the output voltage, occurs in the region close to the fixed-end of the beam. This concept is useful for both series and parallel configurations of the piezoelectric plates, wherein the polarization vectors are in opposite directions for two plates connected in series and the polarization vectors are in the same direction for two plates connected in parallel.","A more complete understanding of the present invention, as well as further features and advantages of the present invention, will be obtained by reference to the following detailed description and drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","101","102","103","104","105","110","100","130","130","140","150","102","103"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","210","220","201","202","203","204","205","210","200","230","240","250","240","202","203","260","270","250","201"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","301","302","303","304","305","320","330","302","303","310","300","340","340","350","360","302","303","320","330","320","330","302","303"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","410","401","402","403","404","405","420","430","402","403","410","400","440","450","460","450","402","403","420","430","470","480","460","401","402","403","401","402","403"]},"It is to be understood that the embodiments and variations shown and described herein are merely illustrative of the principles of this invention and that various modifications may be implemented by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
