The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by any one of the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","The invention generally relates to the field of portal websites.","Generally, a web site is an arrangement of content, e.g., text, images, and sound, on a set of web pages configured for presentation over a computer network in a predetermined way. The content appearing on a web page is generally stored in a centralized location, such as, e.g., a database or a set of files, that is local to a web server. Requests for web pages, which are typically transmitted by web browsers via the HTTP protocol, are processed by the web server. Centralizing the storage of the content found on web pages facilitates its transmission by the web server because the web content is in a known location that is readily available.","Web sites have become more complex as their application has spread. Web sites have proven to be a valuable means of communication both with the public (e.g., a corporate web site) and in private use (i.e., an Intranet site). In either case, it is advantageous to display content with as much breadth and depth as possible to maximize the utility of the web site to its users. However, as web content becomes more complex and diverse, the amount of time, money, and effort in obtaining, storing, and updating the web content has increased.","More recently, portal web sites have been used to deliver complex and diverse content over a computer network. A portal web site is a web site containing one or more portlets displayed on a web page. A portlet is a configurable content area displayable on a web page that provides content or performs one or more associated functions or both. Portlets may display content that is obtained from a source remotely to the web server. For example, a portal web site may use an arrangement of portlets to display web content on different subject areas. The web content for each of the subject areas need not be stored centrally to the web server, but rather may be stored in a plurality of locations geographically removed, but accessible to the portal web server. A portlet may be configured such that it may display the information it obtains to the web browser in a customized manner.","An existing problem with this approach is that developing portal web sites still requires a significant investment of time, money, and effort. This is due, in part, to the cost of supporting the hardware and software necessary to support a portal web site and the computer specialists required to manage the portal web site. Further, constructing a portal web site from scratch is a time and labor intensive process. These associated costs often prohibit those without significant resources from building or using a portal web site. Additionally, while collaborative functionality such as discussion forums and notice boards are desirable, current solutions often require client software to be installed and configured on personal computers associated with each user, adding to the cost and complexity in maintenance. Unfortunately, there is no current solution in the art to create and deploy portal web sites without incurring these costs.","Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved method for providing access to a discussion forum over a computer network. In an embodiment, the first step is to configure a web provider to support a discussion forum portlet. Thereafter, a request is received for a web page from a user. The web page may comprise the discussion forum portlet, and the discussion forum portlet may host at least one of the one or more discussion forums. Subsequently, content is obtained for the discussion forum portlet from the web provider. Next, the requested web page is assembled at a application server, wherein the application server retrieves information about the structure, appearance, and operation of the web page from a database and thereafter composes the web page with the information and the content from the web provider. Finally, the web page is transmitted to the user. Further details of aspects, objects, and advantages of the invention are described below in the detailed description, drawings, and claims.","In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","A user, as used within, refers to any person or computing entity that receives, views, or consumes content from the portal management system . In other words, a user may be a human being or a computer program. A group, as used herein, is a set of users who may be collectively assigned certain access permissions to portions of a portal web site. An administrator, as used herein, refers to any person that manages the operation of the portal management system . Content, or web content, refers to any information displayable on a web page, such as text, images, or sound files.","I. Functional Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","101","110","140","120","100","130"]},"A web browser  is any device capable of browsing content over a computer network, such as the Internet, and is operatively connected to the application server . While only one web browser  is shown in , multiple web browsers  may be operatively connected to the application server . The web browser  and the application server  may communicate over a computer network using well-known communication protocols, such as TCP\/IP, HTTP, and XML. An application server  is a well-known component that assembles and serves web pages to one or more web browsers . As such, an application server  may serve web pages containing one or more portlets. A portlet is a configurable content area displayable on a web page that displays content obtained from a source remotely to the web server, or performs one or more functions remotely to the web server. A portlet may be configured such that it may display customized information to a user. In an embodiment, an application server  is implemented using the 9iApplication Server available from Oracle Corporation, located in Redwood Shores, Calif.","A web provider  is a functional component that provides content for a portlet in response to requests from the application server . A web provider  may, although it need not, be embodiment in software operating on a separate hardware device other than that executing the application server . In some embodiments, the web provider  may be implemented using a cross-platform component architecture, e.g., the JavaBean\u2122 architecture from Sun Microsystems, Inc., located in Palo Alto, Calif. Such an embodiment is advantageous when deploying web providers  over multiple platforms.","A login server  is a software component which verifies and authorizes the identities of users. A user accessing the portal management system  may need to obtain authorization from the login server  prior to substantial use of the portal management system . In an embodiment, the user may obtain authorization from the login server  by transmitting information related to their identity to the application server , which is subsequently transmitted to the login server  for verification. Once a user is authenticated by the login server , a user identifier, which is information that uniquely identifies the user, may be assigned by the login server . The user identifier may accompany all transmissions from the user. As the identity of the user may be ascertained from his transmissions by his user identifier, the state of the portal management system  for that user may be preserved. For example, in an embodiment, as the state of the portal management system  is preserved for each user, a home page or default configuration for a user may, by default, be initially displayed by the application server . In an embodiment, the login server  may be implemented using the Single Sign-on Server, available from Oracle Corporation, located in Redwood Shores, Calif.","In embodiments of the invention, the application server , web provider , and the login server  may each be operatively connected to one or more databases  to enable the application server , web provider , and the login server  to store, manage, and retrieve data. A database is a software component for storing, managing, and retrieving data, and includes the plurality of databases known to those in the art, such as, e.g., the Oracle 8idatabase, available from Oracle Corporation, located in Redwood Shores, Calif. While those skilled in the art recognize that data stored in a single database may be stored across multiple database, and vice-versa, for ease of explanation the present invention shall be described such that the application server , web provider , and login server  are operatively connected to individual databases. However, the present invention is not limited to any particular arrangement of databases. Embodiments of the invention include the use of backup or failover databases or disc arrangements, such as in a RAID arrangement, to promote uninterrupted operability of the database.","In embodiments of the invention, the database  stores information about groups of related users in different database schemas. In other embodiments, the database  stores information about related groups of users using the same database schema. Access is restricted in the database schema such that users may only access information pertinent to their associated group. In some embodiments, this is performed using a virtual private database (\u201cVPD\u201d), which is a feature of the Oracle 8idatabase available from Oracle Corporation, located in Redwood Shores, Calif. This feature is described in patent application Ser. No. 09\/167,092, filed on Oct. 5, 1998, and in patent application Ser. No. 09\/812,896, filed on May 31, 2001, each of which are assigned to the assignee of the present application and each are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Other embodiments of the invention may perform the function of restricting access to rows in a database table by user through a variety of other methods, such as, e.g., using a database view or the use of a session table. In order to prevent unnecessarily obscuring the description of the present invention, embodiments of the invention shall store information about multiple users of the portal management system  in the same schema in the database, but will restrict access such that a user may only access information stored in the database  authorized to that user. Embodiments of the invention may use any of the aforementioned mechanisms to restrict access on the database schema by, for example, associating a subscriber identifier with each user. A subscriber identifier is a unique identifier for a set of users. For example, a company may be assigned the same subscriber identifier. All users of the company in the example may have a different user identifier, but may have the same subscriber identifier. By associating a subscriber identifier with each user, access to a database  may be restricted using the techniques discussed above.","For the sake of clarity and brevity, only one application server , web provider , and login server  are depicted. Those skilled in the art shall recognize that for a variety of reasons, including scalability and performance, multiple application servers , web providers , and login servers  may be used. Accordingly, the invention is not limited to any particular number or arrangement of functional components, such as applications servers , web providers , and login servers  within the portal management system .","The operational flow of requesting content through the portal management system  will be presented with reference to , which is a flow chart illustrating the same according to an embodiment of the invention. In an embodiment, initially, in step , the user transmits a request for a web page to the application server . The request may be sent by the user through a web browser  associated with the user. Subsequently, the application server  determines in step  if the user is recognized (i.e., \u201clogged in\u201d). This may be accomplished by examining an associated user identifier accompanying the user request. If the user is not recognized by the application server , then the application server  may provide authentication means to the user so that the user may authenticate him or herself in step . Such means may include a web page where the user may submit information regarding their identity, such as a username and password. Subsequently, the identifying information may be transmitted by the application server  to the login server  for verification. The login server  may, upon receiving the identifying information, verify the user's identity with information stored about the user in a database associated with the login server . Thereafter, the login server  may transmit the results of the verification to the application server . In embodiments, the user may be given a predetermined number of opportunities to authenticate him or herself before the portal management system  disables the user's account within the portal management system . If the user is recognized by the application server , then operation proceeds to step .","In an embodiment, in step , the application server  determines which, if any, web providers  are responsible for content in the requested web page. For example, if a requested web page has two portlets displayed on it, each web provider  that supports one of the two portlets on that requested web page may be identified. In an embodiment, after determining which web providers  are responsible for content, the application server  communicates with the one or more identified web providers  to obtain content for any portlets residing on the requested web page in step . Upon receiving the request, the web providers  parse the request, fulfill the request, and transmit the information satisfying the request to the application server . For example, a web provider  may provide functionality regarding formula management. If a request is received by that web provider  to retrieve a particular formula, then the web provider fulfills the request by retrieving the requested formula, and transmitting the formula to the application server . This example is described in further detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/071,260, filed on Feb. 7, 2002, assigned to Oracle Corporation of Redwood Shores, Calif., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","In an embodiment, subsequently, the application server  assembles the received content from the identified web providers  to form the requested web page . As discussed in further detailed below, the application server  assembles the content to form the requested web page by merging data received from web providers  and data stored in an associated central repository concerning the organization and presentation of the web page. Thereafter, in an embodiment, the application server  transmits the requested web page to the user in step . The user typically receives and renders the requested web page in an associated web browser . The process depicted in  may be repeated if the user requests an additional web page. In an embodiment, the application server  may periodically transmit updated information about a particular portlet to a web browser  without receiving an explicit user request to do so, if the application server  previously transmitted information to the web browser  about that portlet, and the application server  received notification that a more current set of information for that portlet is available. For example, if a user loaded a world news portlet in their web browser , the world news displayed in the portlet may be updated by the application server  when notification is received by the application server  that updated-information becomes available. Such notification regarding the relative freshness of the data may be stored in the application server , or may be received periodically from the web provider .","II. Assembling Content at Portal Web Server","In an embodiment, the application server  stores information regarding the composition of a web page in a central repository, such as a database. Aspects of the invention directed towards storing information in a central repository are detailed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/540,092, filed on Mar. 31, 2000, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/540,977, filed on Mar. 31, 2000, both of which are assigned to the assignee of the present invention and both of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The application server  assembles the requested web page using any content received from web providers  and data stored in an associated central repository concerning the organization and presentation of the web page. In an embodiment, the data stored in the central repository that the application server  uses in assembling the requested web page includes data concerning the following attributes of the web page: style, layout, content resident thereon, portlets displayed thereon, items displayed thereon, groups, folders, and user permissions for the web page. In other words, the application server  manages data concerning the appearance and operation of portal web sites in a central repository, such as a database, and uses that information to assemble the web page, along with content received from web providers . The data the application server  uses in rendering web pages may be directed towards visual aspects of the page, e.g., style or layout information, or it may be directed towards operational aspects of the page, e.g., what portlets are displayed, permissions regarding access to portions of the web page. Accordingly, in an embodiment, the application server  manages user permissions regarding the content displayed on the portal web site. Said differently, users may be assigned permission levels to restrict their access to content at multiple levels of granularity, e.g., web pages, folders, portlets, and individual items on a web page.","In embodiments of the invention, web pages are dynamically generated based upon data stored in tables in a database. In some embodiments, the structure of the web page, the content of the web page, and the permissions to access portions of the web page, are all stored in tables in a database, e.g, the database coupled to the application server . As the permissions, structure, and content all reside in a database, and the layout of the web page is dynamically generated, the layout and the permissions to access any portion of the web page may be defined to any level of granularity. In other words, as information about the web site is stored in tables, and the web site is dynamically rendered from the tables, the layout or permissions may be arbitrarily complex to accommodate any desired layout or permission level. If a new layout or permission level is desired, then it may be defined in the database to be applied by the application server .","III. Discussion Forum Portlet","According to embodiments of the invention, the portal management system  supports a plurality of portlets with diverse functionality. In an embodiment of the invention, the portal management system  supports one or more portlets that facilitate discussion forums. A discussion forum portlet  is a portlet that enables one to communicate and share ideas with others while making the communication publicly available. As such, a discussion forum portlet  advantageously allows one to collaborate and share ideas, thoughts, and comments with others through one or more discussion forums hosted by the discussion forum portlet .","In an embodiment of the invention, the portal management system  comprises an admin discussion forum portlet , such as the one depicted in . An admin discussion forum portlet  allows an administrator to create and manage discussion forum portlets . In the admin discussion forum portlet  shown in , by clicking the \u2018create new discussion forum\u2019 link , the \u2018create new discussion forum interface\u2019  is displayed, such as the one shown in .

The edit icon  presents a \u2018edit settings\u2019 interface  when it is selected, while the enable box  determines if the particular discussion forum portlet  is enabled or not. A discussion forum portlet  may be visible to non-administrators (users who are not administrators) when it is enabled, a discussion forum portlet  may not be visible to non-administrators if it is disabled. In other words, only when a discussion forum portlet  is enabled may a user add the discussion forum portlet  to their portlet for display and subsequent access. Selections made in the enable boxes  may be saved using the save button , as well as reset and cancelled using the reset button  and the cancel button .","In the embodiment of the admin discussion forum portlet  shown in , by specifying a particular discussion forum portlet  in the portlet settings field  and then selecting the \u2018edit discussion forum settings\u2019 link , the \u2018edit settings\u2019 interface  is presented to the administrator.  is a graphical depiction of an \u2018edit settings\u2019 interface  according to an embodiment of the invention. An \u2018edit settings\u2019 interface  is an interface that allows the administrator to configure a particular discussion forum portlet .

Received program code may be executed by the respective processor(s)  as it is received, and\/or stored in the storage device , or other associated non-volatile media, for later execution.","In an embodiment, the computer system  operates in conjunction with a data storage system , e.g., a data storage system  that contains a database  that is readily accessible by the computer system . The computer system  communicates with the data storage system  through a data interface . A data interface , which is coupled to the bus , transmits and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals, that include data streams representing various types of signal information, e.g., instructions, messages and data. In embodiments of the invention, the functions of the data interface  may be performed by the communication interface .","Computer system  includes a bus  or other communication mechanism for communicating instructions, messages and data, collectively, information, and one or more processors  coupled with the bus  for processing information. Computer system  also includes a main memory , such as a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, coupled to the bus  for storing dynamic data and instructions to be executed by the processor(s) . The main memory  also may be used for storing temporary data, i.e., variables, or other intermediate information during execution of instructions by the processor(s) .","The computer system  may further include a read only memory (ROM)  or other static storage device coupled to the bus  for storing static data and instructions for the processor(s) . A storage device , such as a magnetic disk or optical disk, may also be provided and coupled to the bus  for storing data and instructions for the processor(s) .","A computer system  may be coupled via the bus  to a display device , such as, but not limited to, a cathode ray tube (CRT), for displaying information to a user. An input device , e.g., alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to the bus  for communicating information and command selections to the processor(s) .","According to one embodiment of the invention, an individual computer system  performs specific operations by their respective processor(s)  executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in the main memory . Such instructions may be read into the main memory  from another computer-usable medium, such as the ROM  or the storage device . Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in the main memory  causes the processor(s)  to perform the processes described herein. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and\/or software.","The term \u201ccomputer-usable medium,\u201d as used herein, refers to any medium that provides information or is usable by the processor(s) . Such a medium may take many forms, including, but not limited to, non-volatile, volatile and transmission media. Non-volatile media, i.e., media that can retain information in the absence of power, includes the ROM , CD ROM, magnetic tape, and magnetic discs. Volatile media, i.e., media that can not retain information in the absence of power, includes the main memory . Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of carrier waves; i.e., electromagnetic waves that can be modulated, as in frequency, amplitude or phase, to transmit information signals. Additionally, transmission media can take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio wave and infrared data communications.","In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the reader is to understand that the specific ordering and combination of process actions shown in the process flow diagrams described herein is merely illustrative, and the invention can be performed using different or additional process actions, or a different combination or ordering of process actions. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than restrictive sense."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS(S)","p":["The present invention is illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings and in which like reference numerals refer to similar elements and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"300"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":"400"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":"400"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"500"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 6A","b":"600"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 6B","b":"600"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 7A","b":"700"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":"800"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["700","710"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 10A","b":["800","820"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 10B","b":"700"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIGS. 11A and 11B","b":"1100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":"1200"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":"1300"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":"1300"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":"1600"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":"1600"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":"1600"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":"1900"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
