title: Alignment of multiple editions of a signal collected from multiple sensors
abstract: Various embodiments associated with synchronization of signal editions from multiple sensors are described. A plurality of sensors can be deployed in an environment. Different copies of a desired signal can be present in the environment and there can be a desire to identify this signal even if the signal is unknown (and a demodulation scheme of the desired signal is not known). The plurality of sensors can sense weak editions of the desired signal and transfer those signals to a master sensor or to a separate location, such as a fusion center. The weak editions may be asynchronous due to the editions being captured at different locations, different channels, different devices, etc. At the master sensor or separate location, the weak editions can be post-synchronized together and then fused together into a strong signal. From the strong signal, a demodulation scheme can be determined and the signal can be demodulated.

In a singular environment, enemy combatants can each broadcast different signals. It may be possible for one combatant to intercept the signal of another combatant. The intercepting combatant may not know the modulation scheme of an intercepted signal. Without the modulation scheme, it may be difficult to put the intercepted signal to use.","A system is described comprising a processor and a non-transitory computer-readable medium is described. The non-transitory computer-readable medium is communicatively coupled to the processor and stores components executable by the processor to facilitate operation of components. The components comprise a find component configured to find an alignment point between a first signal edition of a signal and a second signal edition of the signal. The components also comprise an alignment component configured to use the alignment point to align the first signal edition and the second signal edition, where the alignment point is a point of greatest alignment between the first signal edition and the second signal edition. The first signal edition is different from the second signal edition, a first sensor collects the first signal edition, a second sensor collects the second signal edition, and the first sensor and second sensor are different sensors.","A method is described comprising executing instructions from a non-transitory computer readable medium. The instructions comprise aligning a first signal edition of a signal with a second signal edition of the signal, where the first signal edition is different from the second signal edition, where a first sensor collects the first signal edition, where a second sensor collects the second signal edition, where the first sensor and second sensor are different sensors. The instructions also comprise making a selection of a demodulation scheme for the signal, where the selection is based, at least in part, on mathematical analysis of the first signal edition and the second signal edition when aligned.","A non-transitory computer-readable medium is described that is configured to store computer-executable instructions that when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform a method. The method comprises collecting a first signal edition of a signal from a first sensor and collecting a second signal edition of the signal from a second sensor, where the first signal edition and the second signal edition are not synchronized with one another and where the first sensor and the second sensor are part of different networks. The method also comprises synchronizing the first signal edition with the second signal edition along with identifying a constellation of the signal through use of the first signal edition and the second signal edition. The method further comprises matching the constellation of the signal with a constellation of a known signal and establishing a modulation scheme associated with the known signal. In addition, the method comprises using the modulation scheme associated with the known signal to demodulate the signal and causing the signal to be outputted after being demodulated.","Asynchronous low-cost sensors can be used in distributed locations for sensing and classifying weak wireless signals. This weak signal may not be identifiable by using a single sensor alone, but can be detected and classified by fusing multiple weak signals (e.g., editions or editions of the weak signal) collected by individual sensors. The asynchronous signal copies can have unwanted offsets in time, frequency, and phase due to the diversities in local oscillators and unknown communication channels. A post-synchronization method can be employed to estimate and compensate for offsets without adjusting sensor parameters. Synchronized signals can be used together to form a combined signal and the combined signal can achieve a higher processing gain for reliable signal exploitation.","With rapid growth of wireless communication services and high performance electronic devices, wireless communications can benefit from more intensive and efficient use of spectrum and higher data rates. Dynamic spectrum access, adaptive modulation, low-power transmission, and sensor networks can have desired capabilities of cognitive radios which can freely hop through available spectrum and nodes, modify transmission characteristics and waveforms, and exploit opportunities of using the spectrum and power effectively. There can be a desire to sense an agile signal of interest (SOI) in a dynamic environment with unpredictable adaptations and low transmitting power. Spectrum sensing and classification conventionally are limited to using a single sensor\/receiver with sophisticated signal processing. The performance of such techniques can be significantly degraded by the location, channel quality, and signal strength of the receiving sensor. In a non-cooperative communication environment (e.g., no handshaking between transmitters and receivers), a transmitting signal and communication channels are usually not favorable to an ad-hoc receiver or sensing unit and the received signal at the sensor could be weak and distorted so that signal sensing and classification becomes extremely difficult and unreliable. To address the sensing and classification bottleneck, a sensor network can be employed. A network centric framework could include interfaces for connecting distributed devices as well as functionality used to search for unknown dimensions for new capabilities. Fusion of local signal decisions and a central decision of the fused signals can be employed. The former uses expensive distributed processors to make decisions locally and the latter combines the multiple signal copies from less-expensive sensors to make a central decision. However, the synchronization of time, frequency, and phase among sensors in making central decisions is costly and impractical in many operations. Aspects disclosed herein can be used on a central decision of the fused signals approach by using the low-cost sensors or leveraging existing networked sensors distributed at different scales throughout everyday life without the accurate synchronization. The asynchronous signal copies can be processed in the fusion center using post-synchronization before they are combined. The copy of the optimally combined signals can give more accurate description of the SOI than any one of the individual signal copies alone.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100"]},"The fusion center may be located at the same location as a sensor or elsewhere. The fusion center sends periodic requests to L distributed sensors, R, R, . . . , and Rto acquire the weak SOI. Upon the reception of the request, the distributed sensors take short time duration snapshots of the SOI. The distributed sensors may provide very limited signal processing capabilities such as RF reception and transmission, frequency tuning and down-conversion, filtering, and digitization to the different editions. Thus, the sensors are asynchronous and non-cooperative to one another and are used merely for communicating with, or relaying distributed snapshots to, the fusion center. The snapshots are very short and are taken periodically. Therefore, there is ample time between two snapshots for signal processing and analysis. This capture and processing is conducted in real-time.","In an asynchronous sensor scenario, magnitudes, phases, frequencies, and sampling clocks among sensors can be different. Consequently, the fusion center estimates the relative phase offset (RPO) induced by different local oscillators (LOs), channels and filters, relative time offset (RTO) induced by different propagation paths and sampling clocks, the relative frequency offset (RFO) induced by different LOs and the Doppler effect, and relative sampling frequency offset (RSO) caused by the drift and diversity of the sampling clocks before combining the signal copies coherently. The fusion center can be designed to have adequate signal processing power and time to estimate, analyze, and process the data delivered by the sensors to generate an enhanced signal for detection, classification and blind demodulation.","In one dumb sensor scenario embodiment, the sensors do not make local decisions but relay the snapshots, r(t), i=1, 2, . . . , L, to the fusion center, or store the short time-stamped digital data packets and forward them to the fusion center for processing. The packets can be transmitted to the fusion center using a communication method. Without loss of generality, Ris assumed to be the reference sensor, and R, R, . . . , and Rare compared to Rfor calculating offsets. Assuming offsets have no noticeable change within a very short collection time period and as such, calculations discussed herein are under this assumption. The signal packets received at the fusion center can be described as:\n\n()=\u0394\u03b1()+()\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere i=2, 3, . . . , L; \u0394\u03c9, \u0394\u03b2, and \u0394\u03c4are RFO, RPO, and RTO, respectively, and \u0394\u03b1is the relative magnitude offset (RMO), which does not need to be known in the post-synchronization. Relative offsets are referring to:\n\n()=\u0394\u03b1())+()\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere s(t)=as(t)eis the frequency down-converted copy of the SOI observed at R, s(t) is a sequence of pulse shaped information symbols, a, \u03c9, and \u03b2are gain, frequency, and phase offsets between the transmitter and R, respectively, and n\u02dcN(0,\u03c3), i=1, 2, . . . , L is i.i.d. circularly symmetric complex additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). If \u0394\u03c9and \u0394\u03c4can be estimated and eliminated, the signals can be combined to

Since r(t) has higher SNR compared to r(t), the former achieves a more reliable classification result. r(t) is not in general coherent to the SOI transmitter since it adopts the non-coherency from the distributed sensors. In other words, there are unknown magnitude, timing, carrier frequency and phase offsets between the SOI and r(t) although RTO, RFO, and RPO are eliminated after fusion. The non-coherence between the unknown transmitter and the combined signal is not an obstacle to signal sensing and modulation classification, since the practical automatic modulation classifier has been designed to address the offset problem for SISO RF\/IF signals.","Distributed signal exploitation benefits many research areas and applications, such as RF power detection, emitter geolocation and identification, spectrum survey and monitoring, etc. Proactive (e.g., automatic) modulation classification (AMC) is an example which has applications in both military and commercial systems. AMC is a tool to identify the modulation scheme of a transmitted signal with a high probability of success within a short observation time period. In general, the software operates with wideband signal sensing or detection hardware. The signal sensing equipment scans the specified wideband for an SOI defined by certain criteria such as carrier frequency, spectrum power, preamble, bandwidth, etc. The fusion of multiple asynchronous signal copies provides a higher probability of successful signal detection and classification.","Modulation classification can start with the band-limited, digitized, and unknown IF signal intercepted by the sensing unit as an input and ends with an estimated modulation scheme as an output. It can be described as a statistical process for estimating the modulation scheme of an unknown signal based on multiple matching templates or hypotheses. Confidence measurements are used to rate the estimation results and control the quality of the modulation classification decision. With high-confidence estimation, the decision of the modulation scheme can be reported as \u201csuccess\u201d, and with low-confidence estimation, the decision of the modulation scheme can be reported as \u201cunknown.\u201d","For modern communication waveforms, extra processing may be appropriate between spectrum power sensing and modulation classification by identifying antenna dimension and coding, extracting downlink\/uplink bursts, separating multiple users, removing unwanted headers and the cyclic-prefix, etc. After signal sensing and modulation classification, the resulting decision is used for post-processing with further signal analysis or message decoding.","The fused signal r(t) can be an input to the automatic modulation classifier for signal sensing and classification.

The demodulated symbols are not required in post-synchronization.","An advantage to using asynchronous and heterogonous sensors is to leverage the low-cost or existing communication devices and network without significant investment. Nonlinear offsets RTO and RFO can be estimated independently with the fast search, and the linear offsets RMO and RPO can be calculated directly after RTO and RFO estimation. The offset estimation does not require knowledge of the baseband signal information. That is, the symbol rate, carrier frequency, carrier phase, pulse-shaping filter, over-sampling rate, etc. are not known. The estimation is robust in the low SNR.
