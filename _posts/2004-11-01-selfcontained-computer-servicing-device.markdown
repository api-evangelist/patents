{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to the field of operating system servicing. In particular, embodiments of this invention relate to servicing operations of a computer using a bootable device having a built-in operating system and network connectivity.","A personal computer (PC) is a convenient tool to enhance and facilitate a user's experience with other technological advances, such as the Internet, word processing, or the like. Like many devices, a PC may occasionally experience a failure of operations of its operating system or may require periodic updates, upgrades, or the like. Unfortunately, this PC failure, commonly known as a crash, may be caused by software designed to disrupt operations of the operating system. For example, computer viruses, worms, adware, spyware, and the like are designed to disrupt and\/or corrupt functions of the operating system.","A missing driver for a particular piece of hardware may also cause a PC's operating system to crash. For example, in order to use a particular device, such as a multi-function printer, a software driver must be installed to enable the PC to work with the printer. Absent such software driver, the multi-function printer will likely be unusable and the operating system of the PC may crash.","Another type of operating system crash may result from some of the PC's hardware being inaccessible (e.g., the hard drive, the memory, or the like).","In the event of a crash, the user frequently resorts to using an external device to service, including restore or repair, the operating system. For example, in a case of recovery or repair for a stand-alone PC, the user (e.g., a PC technician) usually runs a recovery CD-ROM disk in the PC's CD-ROM drive. The basic input and output system (BIOS) of the PC will assist the user in booting the PC from the CD-ROM drive to restore or repair the crashed operating system in the PC.","In another example, in a case of recovery or repair of a PC for which a bootable image of the PC is desirable, a network administrator or PC technician needs to access the bootable image of the operating system of the PC before recovering or repairing the PC. Occasionally, the bootable image is stored on a network, and the user not only needs to boot the PC from the CD-ROM drive but must also install a suitable driver for a network adapter installed in the PC. However, the network administrator may not have the suitable driver for the network adapter readily available and, thus, the PC recovery and\/or repair cannot be completed until such driver is found.","Presently, some memory devices, including Universal Serial Bus (USB) flash memory drives and the like, provide relatively fast access to a PC. However, these devices lack a functional operating system to boot the PC. Common practices, such as booting from the CD-ROM drive, are reliable, but the CD-ROM drive has a relatively slow connection to the PC and lacks network connectivity for connecting the PC to a network","Accordingly, a self-contained computer servicing device is desired to address at least one or more of these and other disadvantages by servicing a computer from a device containing a functional operating system and providing network connectivity.","Embodiments of the present invention comprise a device including a wired or a wireless connection to, for example, a computer that requires servicing. The device in one embodiment also contains a memory, such as a flash hard disk or other non-volatile memory, which stores a functional operating system, independent of other devices, and contains device drivers for network adapters. In addition, this embodiment permits access to a bootable image of the operating system for recovery or other services of the crashed computer via the network adapter. As such, the computer boots from the device and its operations are serviced.","Additionally, embodiments of the invention comprise a device using a common computer interface, such as a USB connection or the like, to connect to a computer that provides relatively fast and reliable access to the operating system stored in the memory of the device. As such, the device provides a very compact tool for servicing, including deployment, recovery, repair, trouble-shooting, updating, or other functions or services to a computer. Embodiments of the invention permit original equipment manufacturers (OEM's), independent hardware vendors (IHV's), independent software vendors (ISV's), and\/or information technology professionals to efficiently service the operating systems of computers without knowing the hardware\/software configurations of each individual computer.","Advantageously, aspects of the invention involve a device that includes all functionality necessary to service (e.g., deploy, recover, or repair, or the like) a computer, regardless of the hardware or operating system installed on the computer. The device in this embodiment includes a self-contained boot device, operating environment, and networking device. The computer boots from the device by executing the operating system stored in its memory and operating a built-in networking module to access a bootable image on a network to service a damaged operating system of the computer.","In accordance with one aspect, a method services operations of a computer. An operation servicing device is connected to the computer via a first interface. The operation servicing device comprises a memory. The memory of the operation servicing device has an operating system stored therein. The operating system stored in the memory of the operation servicing device is executed to boot the computer when the operation servicing device is connected to the computer. The operation servicing device is connected to a network via a second interface. The memory of the operation servicing device also stores a driver for the second interface. A bootable image of the operations of the computer on the network is accessed via the second interface. The operations of the computer are serviced according to the bootable image.","In accordance with another aspect, an apparatus services operations in a computer. A means for connecting connects the apparatus to the computer. A means for storing stores an operating system, wherein the operating system boots the computer. A means for connecting connects the apparatus to a network to access a bootable image of the operations of the computer. The means of storing also stores a driver for the means for connecting to connect the apparatus to the network, wherein the operations of the computer are serviced according to the bootable image.","According to yet another aspect of the invention, a device services operations in a computer. A memory stores an operating system, wherein the operating system boots the computer. A computing interface connects the device to the computer. A network interface connects the device to a network to access a bootable image of the operations of the computer. The memory also stores a driver for the network interface. The operations of the computer are serviced according to the bootable image.","According to a further aspect of the invention, a computer-readable medium has computer-executable components for servicing operations of a computer. An operating system component stored in a memory of an operation servicing device connects to the computer via a first interface. The operating system component is responsive to a user selection to execute the operating system stored in the memory of the operation servicing device to boot the computer. A network driver component stored in the memory of the operation servicing device is associated with a second interface. The operation servicing device is connected to a network via the second interface. A bootable image component representative of the operations of the computer is accessed on the network via the second interface for servicing operations of the computer.","According to yet another aspect, a system services operations in a computer. The system includes a network and an operation servicing device. The operation servicing device comprises a first interface for connecting the operation servicing device to the computer. A memory stores an operating system, and the operating system boots the computer. A second interface connects the operation servicing device to the network to access a bootable image of the operations of the computer. The memory also stores a driver for the second interface, wherein the operations of the computer are serviced according to the bootable image.","Alternatively, the invention may comprise various other methods and apparatuses.","Other features will be in part apparent and in part pointed out hereinafter.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the drawings.","Referring first to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates a self-contained computer servicing device  according to one embodiment of the invention. The servicing device  includes a first interface , a second interface , and a memory . The servicing device  may be used to perform services, including deployment, recovery, repair, replace, trouble-shooting, maintaining, updating, and\/or other services or functions to service operations of a computer . It is to be understood that the servicing device  may be used by OEMs, IHVs, ISVs, BIOS vendors, information technology managers\/technicians\/administrators, or other hardware\/software manufacturers during various stages of servicing\/manufacturing of a computer. The first interface  may be an interface configured to connect the servicing device  to a computer . For example, the first interface  may be a bootable system bus, 1394 port, Universal Serial Bus (USB) port, or other bus or parallel system that connects or couples the servicing device  to the computer . The computer  may be any computing device having components including a processing unit, a memory, an input\/output interface, an operating system, and the like. In one embodiment, the computer  comprises a computer  as shown in .","The memory  of the servicing device  may be a memory capable of storing data, or it may be other non-volatile memory (see, for example, system memory  in ). The memory  stores an operating system (e.g., operating system  as shown in ) configured to boot the computer . The operating system may be any piece of software, program, or code that controls the allocation and usage of hardware resources, such as the memory , a central processing unit (CPU) time, disk space, and peripheral devices. In addition, the operating system stored in the memory  may be different from an operating system of the computer . In one embodiment, the memory  stores other software, program, application, software security patches, updates, or code to assist in servicing the operations of the computer . In another embodiment, the memory  also stores a bootable image of an operating system for replacing the operating system of the computer . For example, a bootable image may be a complete operating system, a functional operating system, a recovery operating system, file structures and systems, user settings, and\/or other configurations, or the like for servicing (e.g., repairing, restoring, or replacing) the operating system of the computer .","Initially, the computer  may be a computer incapable of properly starting or booting on its own due to a crash of its operating system or a computer requiring updated security patches or other updates. In other words, the operating system of the computer  is unable to adequately control and use the hardware resources of the computer , such as a hard drive, a memory, and\/or other input\/output devices, such that a user may not be able to use the computer  as desired or to recover data or operations contained on the computer . A computer technician, network administrator, or the like connects the servicing device  to the computer  via the first interface . It is to be understood that upon connecting the servicing device  to the computer , the computer  recognizes the first interface  and prepares the first interface  for use by the computer . In one embodiment, the basic input and output system (BIOS) of the computer  prompts the administrator and\/or technician whether to boot from the servicing device  or to boot from other devices. In another embodiment, the technician may be required to configure the BIOS to boot the servicing device  as the primary boot device for the computer .","Once the servicing device  is connected to the computer , the computer  executes the operating system stored in the memory . As such, the operating system stored in the memory  boots the computer .","In one embodiment, the computer  is one of many computers that requires servicing, including repair or restoration of operating systems. For example, the computer  may be a networked computer or one of many computers in a factory of an original equipment manufacture (OEM) of computers. When servicing (e.g., repairing, restoring, updating, deploying, replacing, or the like) operations of the computer , it may be time-consuming and laborious for the network administrator to manually and individually service the computer  to the same or default configuration, such as file system or the like. As such, the bootable image of the operations of the computer  may be stored on a network such that the network administrator does not need to remember the default or other configurations when servicing the computer .","Under the current practice, the network administrator is required to use the network connectivity in the computer , if any, to connect the computer  to a network to access the bootable image. Unfortunately, the network administrator frequently finds the booting operating system or the recovery\/repair disk does not contain the specific driver for the network adapter of the computer . Advantageously, the servicing device  overcomes these shortcomings by including the second interface  to enable the computer  to connect to a network . In addition, the memory  stores a device driver for the second interface . Hence, once the computer  is booted by using the operating system stored in the memory , the booted computer  can use the second interface  of the servicing device  to access the network . The interface  may be a network adapter that connects the servicing device  to the network  via a wired or wireless connection.","Next, the operating system of the servicing device  accesses the bootable image, which may be stored in a server , via the second interface . By accessing the bootable image, the computer  is serviced.","In one embodiment, by using the second interface  of the servicing device , the network administrator does not need to rely on searching for the appropriate device driver for the network adapter of the computer  to access the bootable image on the network. In addition, the servicing device  eliminates the reliance on knowing the hardware configuration of the computer  before servicing operations of the computer . In other words, with the servicing device , the network administrator has all the functional and adequate tools s\/he needs to service the operating system of the computer .","In yet another embodiment, the servicing device  can be used to remove software that is stored locally on the computer , access diagnostic software that is stored on the computer  or on the network , and\/or access a part of the bootable image on the network .","In other words, when connecting the servicing device  to the computer  via the first interface , the computer  recognizes or treats the servicing device  as another multifunctional device\u2014a device having the memory  and the second interface . As such, after being booted from the servicing device , the computer  can access the memory  the second interface . Also, because the memory  stores the device driver for the second interface , the computer  need not search for the device driver in its memory to use the second interface .","In operation, for example, after the computer  crashes, a network administrator connects the servicing device  to the computer via the first interface . The computer  uses the operating system stored in the memory  to boot the computer . The computer  also uses the second interface  of the servicing device  to connect to the network  to access the bootable image stored in the server . As a result, the network administrator services the operations of the computer  according to the bootable image.","In one embodiment, the memory  also stores a bootable image (e.g., an operating system image) of the operating system of computer  for servicing the computer . For example, the servicing device  contains in its memory  a full operating system image capable of replacing the failed operating system on computer . In this instance, the technician boots the computer  using servicing device  and prepares the hard drive or storage media in the computer  for acceptance of the full replacement operating system stored in the memory  of the servicing device . Upon completion of the operating system replacement, computer  is able to boot the newly replaced operating system and the user is back to a working state prior to the service of the computer .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","204","206","208","210","212"]},"In one embodiment, the administrator\/technician determines whether the operating system of the computer (e.g., computer ) is serviceable at . For example, after the operating system of the computer crashes, the operation servicing device is used to service\/repair the crashed operating system. If the technician\/administrator determines that the operating system of the computer is serviceable, the administrator\/technician uses the operating system in the operation servicing device to service the computer at . If, on the other hand, the operating system of the computer is not serviceable, a replacement operating system is desirable. As discussed above, the servicing device  may also contain a bootable image (e.g., a full operating system of the operating system of the computer) in the memory . As such, the administrator\/technician determines whether a replacement operating system image is available on the operation servicing device at . If the determination is positive, the computer is serviced according to the bootable image stored in the operation servicing device at .","If the determination is negative, the computer connects to a network via a second interface of the operation servicing device at . The memory of the operation servicing device stores a driver for the second interface. At , the computer, via the second interface of the operation servicing device, accesses a bootable image of the operations of the computer. As such, the computer at  is serviced.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["130","130","130","132","134","136","134","132","136"]},"The computer  typically has at least some form of computer readable media. Computer readable media, which include both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media, may be any available medium that may be accessed by computer . By way of example and not limitation, computer readable media comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. For example, computer storage media include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that may be used to store the desired information and that may be accessed by computer . Communication media typically embody computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and include any information delivery media. Those skilled in the art are familiar with the modulated data signal, which has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. Wired media, such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media, such as acoustic, RF, infrared, and other wireless media, are examples of communication media. Combinations of any of the above are also included within the scope of computer readable media.","The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of removable and\/or non-removable, volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory. In the illustrated embodiment, system memory  includes read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM . RAM  typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently being operated on by processing unit . By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data .","The computer  may also include other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media. For example,  illustrates a hard disk drive  that reads from or writes to non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic media.  also shows a magnetic disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk  such as a CD-ROM or other optical media. Other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media that may be used in the exemplary operating environment include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like. The hard disk drive , and magnetic disk drive  and optical disk drive  are typically connected to the system bus  by a non-volatile memory interface, such as interface .","The drives or other mass storage devices and their associated computer storage media discussed above and illustrated in , provide storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computer . In , for example, hard disk drive  is illustrated as storing operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Note that these components may either be the same as or different from operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data  are given different numbers here to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies.","A user may enter commands and information into computer  through input devices or user interface selection devices such as a keyboard  and a pointing device  (e.g., a mouse, trackball, pen, biometrics devices and\/or touch pad). Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are connected to processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to system bus , but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port,  or a Universal Serial Bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to system bus  via an interface, such as a video interface . In addition to the monitor , computers often include other peripheral output devices (not shown) such as a printer and speakers, which may be connected through an output peripheral interface (not shown).","The computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to computer . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) , but may also include other networks. LAN  and\/or WAN  may be a wired network, a wireless network, a combination thereof, and so on. Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets, and global computer networks (e.g., the Internet).","When used in a local area networking environment, computer  is connected to the LAN  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a wide area networking environment, computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the WAN , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, is connected to system bus  via the user interface  or other appropriate mechanism. Alternatively, the modem  may be connected to system bus  through a network interface or directly to an ISA or comparable bus. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in a remote memory storage device (not shown). By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates remote application programs  as residing on the memory device. The network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","Generally, the data processors of computer  are programmed by means of instructions stored at different times in the various computer-readable storage media of the computer. Programs and operating systems are typically distributed, for example, on floppy disks or CD-ROMs. From there, they are installed or loaded into the secondary memory of a computer. At execution, they are loaded at least partially into the computer's primary electronic memory. The invention described herein includes these and other various types of computer-readable storage media when such media contain instructions or programs for implementing the steps described below in conjunction with a microprocessor or other data processor. The invention also includes the computer itself when programmed according to the methods and techniques described herein.","For purposes of illustration, programs and other executable program components, such as the operating system, are illustrated herein as discrete blocks. It is recognized, however, that such programs and components reside at various times in different storage components of the computer, and are executed by the data processor(s) of the computer.","Although described in connection with an exemplary computing system environment, including computer , the invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations. The computing system environment is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of the invention. Moreover, the computing system environment should not be interpreted as having any dependency or requirement relating to any one or combination of components illustrated in the exemplary operating environment. Examples of well known computing systems, environments, and\/or configurations that may be suitable for use with the invention include, but are not limited to, personal computers, server computers, hand-held or laptop devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based systems, set top boxes, programmable consumer electronics, mobile telephones, digital cameras, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, distributed computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.","The invention may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, executed by one or more computers or other devices. Generally, program modules include, but are not limited to, routines, programs, objects, components, and data structures that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.","An interface in the context of a software architecture includes a software module, component, code portion, or other sequence of computer-executable instructions. The interface includes, for example, a first module accessing a second module to perform computing tasks on behalf of the first module. The first and second modules include, in one example, application programming interfaces (APIs) such as provided by operating systems, component object model (COM) interfaces (e.g., for peer-to-peer application communication), and extensible markup language metadata interchange format (XMI) interfaces (e.g., for communication between web services).","The interface may be a tightly coupled, synchronous implementation such as in Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE), COM, or distributed COM (DCOM) examples. Alternatively or in addition, the interface may be a loosely coupled, asynchronous implementation such as in a web service (e.g., using the simple object access protocol).
