{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 09\/565,655, filed on May 5, 2000, which claims priority to the provisional application bearing Ser. No. 60\/133,131 filed on May 7, 1999. Each of the aforementioned prior application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention relates generally to communication systems. More particularly, this invention relates to a programmable reconfigurable security processor for an electronic communication device.","Traditionally, electronic communication devices have been designed to perform a single function according to a single standard or application. As the sophistication of electronic communication devices increases, it is possible to design electronic devices that can perform multiple functions according to multiple standards or applications. The licensing or authorization of a product that performs according to a single standard is straightforward, since a license can be assigned to the product when it is sold. On the other hand, it is relatively difficult to provide a proper license or authorization to a device that operates according to multiple standards or applications.","In view of the foregoing, it would be highly desirable to provide a mechanism to operate an electronic communication device according to multiple standards or applications, wherein each standard is executed pursuant to proper authorization.","In one embodiment of the invention, a programmable reconfigurable security processor enables an electronic communication device to operate according to multiple standards, or to accommodate multiple applications, wherein each standard or application is executed pursuant to proper authorization. The programmable reconfigurable security processor can be exploited in any device in which different applications, algorithms, routines, or utilities may be loaded at or prior to run-time. For example, the security processor can be used to control licenses to intellectual property to enable new standards, applications, system upgrades, and trial periods. Furthermore, the security processor can perform real-time encryption and\/or decryption of information streams. This embodiment of the invention can be successfully exploited in multi-mode products, such as multi-mode wireless telephones, information terminals, encryption equipment, and image and multimedia manipulation devices.","In a second embodiment of the invention, a digital logic circuit comprises a programmable logic device and a programmable security circuit. The programmable security circuit stores a set of authorized configuration security keys. The programmable security circuit compares the authorized configuration security keys with an incoming configuration request, and selectively enables a new configuration for the programmable logic device in response to the configuration request.","In another exemplary embodiment, the programmable security circuit also stores a set of authorized operation security keys. The programmable security circuit compares the authorized operation security keys with an incoming operation request from the programmable logic device, and selectively enables an operation within the programmable logic device in response to the operation request.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["112","120","190","112","120","130","140","190","140","190","150","152"]},"The security algorithm's capabilities are categorized, for example, as open standard, manufacturer-specific, or proprietary.

During run-time, the sequence control signal  from the microsequencer  determines the micro-operation sequence. The reconfigurable data transformation unit  operations are optimized for computing encryption\/decryption rounds. Operations include, but are not limited to, XOR, shift right, shift left, rotate right, rotate left, bit-serial multiple, substitution, permutation, and signal swap.","The operand memory  accepts data input from signal set , which is a subset of the signal set  in . Data is fetched from memory  according to a signal  from the microsequencer . Fetched data is passed to the reconfigurable data transformation unit  via a bi-directional signal  to be transformed according to the current configuration and the programmed sequence. The transformed data is either returned to the operand memory  via the bi-directional signal  or transferred out of the reconfigurable data transformation unit  via a signal set , which is a subset of the signal set  in .","In an exemplary embodiment, the microsequencer  is programmed to perform multiple rounds, thus, increasing the number of transformations executable by a single kernel . In another exemplary embodiment, the microsequencer  is programmed to execute multiple cycles on an input wider than is provided by the signal set , thus, effectively increasing the encryption\/decryption word width. Alternatively, the same effect and benefit of programming a kernel to execute multiple cycles can be realized by concatenating adjacent kernels until the desired word width is obtained. Concatentaion consumes more resources but reduces the time to accomplish the same number of transformations.","In another exemplary embodiment, cascaded kernels can effectively implement consecutive rounds thereby decreasing overall latency.
