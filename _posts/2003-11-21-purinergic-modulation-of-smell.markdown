This application is hereby incorporated by this reference in its entirety for all of its teachings.","This invention was made with government support under federal grants DC04953 and DC02994 awarded by the NIH and NIDCD. The Government has certain rights to this invention.","A longstanding dogma, based on lack of efferent synapses, is that odor sensitivity is not modulated at the level of the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). The sensation of smell occurs in part by the activation of smell receptors present on the ORNs. This activation begins through contact of the chemical signature responsible for the odor with a smell receptor on the ORN. There is a need to be able to modulate sensitivity to smell, to for example, decrease sensitivity to smell in noxious environments and increase sensitivity to smell for environments in which it is desirable to smell the odors. Disclosed are methods and compositions which modulate the sensitivity to odor responsiveness.","As embodied and broadly described herein, the disclosed compositions and methods, in one aspect, relate to the modulation of smell. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive.","The present compositions and methods can be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description and the Examples included therein and to the Figures and their previous and following description.","Before the present compounds, compositions, articles, devices, and\/or methods are disclosed and described, it is to be understood that the compositions and methods are not limited to specific synthetic methods, specific recombinant biotechnology methods unless otherwise specified, or to particular reagents unless otherwise specified, as such can, of course, vary.

Compositions and Methods","Purinergic nucleotides are important neuromodulators of auditory and visual systems. Disclosed herein is the existence and activity of purinergic receptors in mammalian olfactory epithelium, such as mouse or human, determined through immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology and calcium imaging. P2X and P2Y receptors, such as P2Y2, P2X1 and P2X4 immunoreactivity (-IR) was present on the dendrites, soma and axons of olfactory marker protein (OMP) ORNs, and in the olfactory nerve, glomular and mitral cell layers of the olfactory bulb. In addition, P2Y2-IR was observed in the sustentacular cell layer of the epithelium. Application of ATP (10 \u03bcM) onto perforated patched mouse ORNs evoked inward currents with two distinct latent periods, indicating involvement of both rapidly activating ligand-gated P2X receptors and G-protein coupled P2Y receptors, which should have a slow onset of activation. Application of ATP (10 \u03bcM) evoked a rapid transient increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca]). In the absence of external Ca, ATP-evoked larger calcium transients than responses in the presence of Ca indicating that at least part of the signal results from release from intracellular Ca stores implicating P2Y receptor contribution to ATP-mediated Ca transients. An olfactory epithelial (OE) slice preparation and confocal imaging was used to measure changes in [Ca]in fluo4 acetoxymethyl ester (AM) loaded OE slices in response to odor and purinergic nucleotide application. Use of selective purinergic receptor agonists demonstrated that P2X and P2Y receptor agonists evoke increases in [Ca]in ORNs with equal frequency and that P2Y but not P2X receptor agonists evoke calcium transients in sustentacular cells. [Ca]levels were measured in response to odor, ATP, or odor+ATP. In most cells, ATP reduced the summed odor-induced changes in Ca however, some cells exhibited an increase in evoked [Ca]increase, indicating an increased effect. Collectively, the data indicates that P2X and P2Y receptor subtypes are expressed in the olfactory epithelium and that P2X and P2Y agonists and antagonists modulation of odor responses, such as the agonist ATP, can be dependent on the subtype(s) of purinergic receptors expressed.","Disclosed herein is direct evidence that ATP and ATP analogs modulate odor responses in olfactory receptor neurons. ATP released in the olfactory epithelium following noxious stimuli provides a physiological source for a neuromodulatory substance independent of efferent innervation. Peripheral ATP-mediated odor suppression is a mechanism for reduced olfactory sensitivity during exposure to olfactotoxins. Methods for modulating the sensitivity to smell of a subject are disclosed.","1. P2X and P2Y Purinergic Receptors","P2X receptors form Ca-permeable nonselective cation channels that allow Ca influx from the extracellular fluid. Most of the 8 functional P2Y receptors identified to date act via G-protein coupling to activate phospholipase C, leading to production of inositol triphosphates and mobilization of Ca from internal stores (Dubyak and el-Moatassim, 1993); however, a few P2Y receptors couple to adenylate cyclase (Ralevic and Burnstock, 1998). All of the components of both transduction pathways have been identified in ORNs (Schild and Restrepo, 1998).","Although purines are odorants for aquatic vertebrates (Kang and Caprio, 1995) and invertebrates (Carr, W. E., et al., Environ. Health Perspect. 71, 31-46 (1987)), disclosed herein, extracellular purinergic nucleotides and their receptors in mammalian, such as human, olfactory epithelium exist. Disclosed herein, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry and physiological studies, show that sustentacular support cells express P2Y receptors and that ORNs express both P2X and P2Y receptors. Regionally localized purinergic receptors are consistent with extracellular ATP having multiple roles in the peripheral olfactory system. Furthermore, it is shown herein that ATP differentially modulates the odor responsiveness of ORNs. This indicates that the complement of P2X and\/or P2Y receptor subtypes expressed in the ORN can determine whether the odor response is enhanced or inhibited in the presence of ATP.","There are two main families of purine receptors, adenosine or P1 receptors, and P2 receptors, recognizing primarily ATP, ADP, UTP, and UDP (Table 1). Adenosine\/P1 receptors couple to G proteins and have been further subdivided, based on molecular, biochemical, and pharmacological evidence into four subtypes, A, A, A, and A. In contrast, P2 receptors divide into two families of ligand-gated ion channels and G protein-coupled receptors termed P2X and P2Y receptors, respectively. For example, Table 1 sets forth seven mammalian P2X receptors (P2X) and five mammalian P2Y receptors (P2Y, P2Y, P2Y, P2Y, P2Y) which have been cloned and characterized.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Families of receptors for purines and pyrimidines"},{"entry":"(Modified from Ralevic V, Burnstock G.

They are typically found on excitable cells (smooth muscle cells, neurons, and glial cells) and mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission to ATP in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. This contrasts with the slower response (less than 100 ms) to ATP acting at metabotropic P2Y receptors, which involves coupling to G proteins and second-messenger systems. Seven functional P2X receptor proteins (P2Xto P2X) have been cloned and form homomeric ion channels with distinct pharmacological profiles when expressed in oocytes (Table 2). The P2Xreceptor is considered separately below, because it is functionally unique among P2X receptors in being able to act as a non-selective pore.","Functional cDNAs encoding the first two members of this family, P2Xand P2X, were isolated from vas deferens smooth muscle and PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, respectively, using an expression cloning strategy in oocytes (Brake et al 1994, Valera et al 1994). In each case, expression of a single cDNA clone in oocytes or transfected mammalian cells is sufficient to direct the synthesis of functional, presumably homomeric ATP-gated ion channel complexes on the surface of these cells. P2Xand P2Xreceptors are clearly related at the level of primary amino acid sequence and predicted secondary structure. Four additional members of this channel family have now been cloned using PCR-based screening strategies (Bo et al 1995, Chen et al 1995, Lewis et al 1995, Buell et al 1996, Collo et al 1996, Seguela et al 1996).

Pharmacol Rev 1998 Sep; 50(3): 413-92."}]}}]}}},"Based on the amino acid sequences of cloned P2X receptor subunits, structural features of P2X receptors have been predicted. The P2X proteins that have been cloned are receptor subunits, not actual receptors since a single 2 transmembrane subunit alone cannot form an ion channel. The proteins have 379 to 472 amino acids and are believed to insert into the cell membrane to form a pore comprising two hydrophobic transmembrane domains (M1 and M2), with much of the protein occurring extracellularly as an intervening hydrophilic loop (). It is presumed that both amino- and carboxyl-termini are located on the intracellular side of the membrane. Based on genetic studies in , the M2 domain of these channels forms an amphipathic \u03b1-helix whose hydrophilic face lines the pore (Hong & Driscoll 1994). Interestingly, helical wheel plots of M2 domains from each of the cloned P2X subunits show that they have similar potential to form amphipathic \u03b1-helices, despite the limited sequence homology in this region. In addition, some P2X subunits contain a region, that resembles the H5 pore loop domain of potassium channels, and it is possible that this segment (just amino-terminal to M2), also contributes to the pore of ATP-gated channels. However, there is considerable variability in the H5 domain consensus sequence, and its location relative to M2, among the six cloned P2X receptor subtypes. The overall structure of the receptor most closely resembles that of amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na channels. The putative extracellular loop of cloned receptors P2Xto P2Xhas 10 conserved cysteine residues, 14 conserved glycine residues and 2 to 6 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. It is believed that disulfide bridges may form the structural constraints needed to couple the ATP-binding site to the ion pore. Most of the conserved regions are in the extracellular loop, with the transmembrane domains being less well-conserved. As for other ligand-gated receptors, P2X receptors are believed to form a heterologous complex in biological tissues. Although their subunit stoichiometry is unknown, SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis estimates of the relative molecular mass of the recombinant P2Xand P2Xreceptors determined under non-denaturing conditions (Nicke et al., 1998) suggest a combination of three subunits (or multiples of three subunits).","Both cloned P2Xand endogenous P2X-like receptors are unique in that, under physiological conditions they are selectively permeable to small cations only, but in the presence of low divalent cation levels and ATP, the P2Xchannel can convert to a pore, permeable to small molecules as well as ions. The P2Xreceptor and its endogenous counterpart is structurally similar to other P2X receptors, except for the fact that it has a significantly longer intracellular C-terminal (240 amino acids) than other P2X receptors, of which at least the last 177 amino acids are crucial for the induction of the non-selective pore (Surprenant et al., 1996). Brief activation of the recombinant P2Xreceptor and its endogenous counterpart causes rapid membrane depolarization and cation influx and is a reversible process. However, sustained activation causes an increase in permeability by allowing bidirectional transport of a variety of ions including Na, K, and Ca and small molecules with a molecular weight of less than or equal to 900 daltons, except in lymphocytes where the limit is 200-300 daltons. This effect is associated with cytotoxicity. Although cation function of the receptor is retained in a truncated P2Xreceptor lacking the last 177 residues, the increased permeability is lost suggesting involvement of the cytoplasmic C terminus. The disclosed results indicate that the P2Xreceptor is not typically present in mammalian olfactory epithelium.","P2Y receptors are purine and pyrimidine nucleotide receptors that are coupled to G proteins. Most P2Y receptors act via G protein coupling to activate PLC leading to the formation of IPand mobilization of intracellular Ca. Coupling to adenylate cyclase by some P2Y receptors has also been described. The response time of P2Y receptors is longer than that of the rapid responses mediated by P2X receptors because it involves 5 second-messenger systems and\/or ionic conductances mediated by G protein coupling.

The tertiary structure of P2Y receptors is similar to that of other seven transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptors (). A model of the P2Y receptor, based on the primary sequence of the P2Y, receptor and using the structural homolog rhodopsin as a G protein-coupled receptor template, has identified positively charged amino acid residues in transmembrane regions 3, 6, and 7 that may be involved in ligand binding by electrostatic interactions with the phosphates of ATP (Van Rhee et al., 1995)(). Several of these amino acids are conserved in other G protein-coupled receptors. Site-directed mutagenesis of the P2Yreceptor to convert positively charged amino acids in transmembrane regions 6 and 7 to neutral amino acids causes a 100- to 850-fold decrease in the potency of ATP and UTP, which suggests a role for these amino acids in binding purines and pyrimidines (Erb et al., 1995). In contrast, in the human P2Y, receptor, the most important residues for ATP binding are in transmembrane regions 3 and 7 on the exofacial side of the receptor (Jiang et al., 1997).","2. ATP and ATP Analog Activity on Purinergic Receptors","Extracellular ATP plays an important role in cellular signaling and acts as a cotransmitter or neuromodulator in sensory systems (Thorne and Housley, 1996). In the olfactory system, ATP can be released from synaptic vesicles in trigeminal afferents that innervate the olfactory epithelium and detect noxious chemicals (Finger et al., 1990; Getchell and Getchell, 1992), or via plasma membrane nucleotide transport proteins (Roman et al., 1997). Furthermore, ischemic, stressed, and injured cells release ATP in large amounts. A recent toxicology study (Kilgour et al., 2000) showed that when the olfactory epithelium was damaged by noxious fumes [ATP]significantly decreased, whereas stimulation that did not damage the olfactory epithelium did not affect [ATP]. In addition to toxic chemicals, prolonged exposure to concentrated odors, such as peppermint, will damage olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and induce expression of stress indicators (heat shock proteins) in sustentacular support cells (Carr et al., 2001). Therefore, both trigeminal and odorous stimulation provide sources for extracellular ATP in olfactory epithelium.","Once released, ATP can have autocrine or paracrine effects. Very low concentrations of ATP activate the two subtypes (P2X and P2Y) of purinergic receptors (0.1-10 \u03bcM)(Ralevic and Burnstock, 1998; Schwiebert and Kishore, 2001). Through either of these receptor subtypes, ATP is able to stimulate an increase in [Ca](Illes et al., 2000; Koshimizu et al., 2000; Ralevic and Burnstock, 1998).","P2 receptors have broad natural ligand specificity, recognizing ATP, ADP, UTP, UDP, and the diadenosine polyphosphates (Table 1). The chemical structures of some principal P2 receptor agonists and antagonists are illustrated in . For example, P2X selective agonists are the stable ATP analogs \u03b1,\u03b2-meATP and \u03b2,\u03b3-meATP, which if effective, strongly imply actions at P2X receptors (typically at P2Xand P2Xsubtypes) and are generally inactive at P2Y receptors. Also useful are ADP, adenosine 5\u2032-O-(2-thiodiphosphate)(ADP\u03b2S,) and UTP, as these are agonists at some P2Y receptors, but are weak or inactive at P2X

Inhibiting Olfactory Response","As discussed herein if in an odor-ATP or analog assay, the calcium transient evoked by co-application is less than the sum of the calcium transients evoked by the individual components then there is an inhibiting effect on the olfactory response. Of the cells that responded to odor, 62% (21\/26 cells) exhibited a significant decrease in the summed [Ca]increase. The mean suppression of all cells was 57%\u00b15% (paired t-test, p=0.01, n=26). Thus, ATP reduced the expected combined effect of the ATP and the odor, and thus will act as an odor suppressant. Typically, activation of P2Y receptors reduced sensitivity to odors. For example, the P2Y selective agonists UTP and ADP-PS suppressed the co-application evoked calcium transient indicating they can act as odor suppressants. As discussed in the Examples, similar experiments were performed with P2X and P2Y selective agonists giving similar results.","Disclosed are compositions and methods for inhibiting the odor response of an ORN. Inhibition of the response can be determined by performing the transient calcium flux assays as discussed herein. Typically these assays can be performed in the presence or absence of the odor. Thus, compositions which inhibit the ORN response can be compositions which in a calcium transient flux assay, the presence of the composition and the odor together, produces a transient calcium flux that is less than the sum of the odor induced flux alone and the composition induced flux alone. For example, if the amount of calcium flux in the presence of a composition and an odor is A, and the amount of the calcium flux in the presence of the composition alone is B and the amount of the calcium flux in the presence of the odor alone is C then if A<B+C, the composition can be said to inhibit the ORN response and the composition can inhibit a smell response. Disclosed are compositions wherein the combined effect of the composition and odor (A) is less than or equal to 95%, 90%, 85%, 80%, 75%, 70%, 65%, 60%, 55%, 50%, 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, or 1% of the summed effect (B+C). It is understood that these numbers can be averages, with variances, and that these types of statistics can be employed, as discussed herein, to determine if the combined effect is less than the summed effect.","It is also understood that when the combined effect A, is less than the summed effect (B+C) that this can be expressed as a ratio of A\/(B+C) and that ratios less than 1 indicate compositions that inhibit the ORN effect. For example, disclosed are compositions that have a ratio of less than or equal to 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.52, 0.55, 0.6, 0.64, 0.65, 0.69, 0.7, 0.72, 0.75, 0.80, 0.83, 0.85, 0.87 0.90, 0.92, 0.95, 0.97, or 0.99. The ratio can be expressed in terms of a range of these individual ratios, such as 0.72 to 0.92, for example, or 0.52 to 0.64, or 0.69 to 0.83.","Thus, when an ORN is expressing the P2Y receptor and a P2Y selective agonist or a non-selective purinergic agonist is applied, odor response is suppressed. Likewise, when an ORN is expressing a P2X receptor and a P2X selective agonist is applied, the odor response is typically suppressed. Also, when both P2X and P2Y receptors are present on an ORN, and either a P2Y selective agonist, a P2X selective agonist, or a nonselective agonist is applied, the odor response is suppressed. Combinations of selective and non-selective agonists can be applied, and P2X and P2Y receptors can be suppressed depending on the combination of agonists in the mixture.","Disclosed are P2X selective agonists and P2Y selective agonists. Disclosed are P2X directed agonists and P2Y directed agonists. In certain embodiments, a P2X directed agonist is any agonist that has a greater effect on a P2X receptor than on a P2Y receptor. Likewise, in certain embodiments, a P2Y directed agonist is any agonist that has a greater effect on a P2Y receptor than on a P2X receptor. In other embodiments, P2X agonists and P2Y agonists can be determined by comparing the activity to known selective agonists, such as those discussed herein. It is understood that the level of activity of each selective agonist discussed herein, is disclosed. Also disclosed are P2 agonists that interact with any P2 receptor. It is understood that many P2X and P2Y agonists can be both a selective agonist as well as a directed agonist. For example, UTP can be a selective and a directed P2Y agonist.","Just as P2X and P2Y agonists inhibit ORN response to odor stimulants, so too, antagonists of P2X and P2Y receptors can lead to an enhancement of the smell response. P2X antagonists, such as those disclosed in Table 4, for example, act at P2X receptors and P2Y antagonists, such as those disclosed in Table 4, for example, act at P2Y receptors, and thus can be stimulators of odor responsiveness. It is understood that the assays, measurements, and functional limitations, as discussed, herein for agonists are applicable for antagonists as well. Thus, for example, antagonists can be assayed in a calcium flux assay, but an antagonist would be considered a composition (B) that does not evoke a response in the calcium flux assay alone, i.e., B=0. However, when a composition (B) is co-applied with an odor (C), the combined odor and composition effect (A), would be greater than the effect of odor alone (C), or composition alone (B) and thus, A>(B+C) or since B=0, A>C.","Typically, antagonists have an opposite effect on a receptor than an agonist, and application of the disclosed methods and limitations can be thus applied to antagonists, as they were for agonists.","Disclosed are P2X selective antagonists and P2Y selective antagonists. Disclosed are P2X directed antagonists and P2Y directed antagonists. In certain embodiments, a P2X directed antagonist is any antagonist that has a greater effect on a P2X receptor than on a P2Y receptor. Likewise, in certain embodiments, a P2Y directed antagonist is any antagonist that has a greater effect on a P2Y receptor than on a P2X receptor. In other embodiments, P2X antagonist and P2Y antagonist can be determined by comparing the activity to known selective antagonists, such as those discussed herein. It is understood that the level of activity of each selective antagonist discussed herein, is disclosed. Also disclosed are P2 antagonists that interact with any P2 receptor. It is understood that many P2X and P2Y antagonists can be both a selective antagonist as well as a directed antagonists.","Disclosed herein are methods of modulating odor sensitivity in a subject, comprising administering a composition to the subject, wherein the composition is an antagonist of a P2X or P2Y purinergic receptor. The antagonist can increase the odor sensitivity of the subject, which can be desirable to those with olfactory impairments. Increasing odor sensitivity is also desirable in conjunction with a pleasant smell. The antagonist can reduce basal Ca levels in olfactory receptor neurons which will make the neurons more excitable during subsequent odor stimulation thereby increasing the odor sensitivity of the subject. The antagonist can increase the ratio of observed coapplication-evoked calcium transient compared to the individual odor peak amplitudes in a cell activation assay, as discussed above.","C.

Nucleotide substitutes are molecules that will recognize nucleic acids in a Watson-Crick or Hoogsteen manner, but which are linked together through a moiety other than a phosphate moiety. Nucleotide substitutes are able to conform to a double helix type structure when interacting with the appropriate target nucleic acid.","Nucleotide substitutes are nucleotides or nucleotide analogs that have had the phosphate moiety and\/or sugar moieties replaced.

Furthermore, there are ATP selective agonists and ATP selective antagonists. For example, non-selective purinergic receptor agonists are ATP, ATP\u03b3S, and AMP (Table 4). For example, P2Y-\u2018selective\u2019 agonists are UTP, ADP, and MeS-ADP (Table 4). In addition, an example of a P2X-\u2018selective\u2019 agonist is \u03b2\u03b3-methylene ATP (Table 4). Suramin and pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2\u2032,4\u2032-disulfonic acid (PPADS) are examples of non-specific antagonists.","2. General Composition Information","a) Sequence Similarities","It is understood that as discussed herein the use of the terms homology and identity mean the same thing as similarity. Thus, for example, if the use of the word homology is used between two non-natural sequences it is understood that this is not necessarily indicating an evolutionary relationship between these two sequences, but rather is looking at the similarity or relatedness between their nucleic acid sequences. Many of the methods for determining homology between two evolutionarily related molecules are routinely applied to any two or more nucleic acids or proteins for the purpose of measuring sequence similarity regardless of whether they are evolutionarily related or not.","For example, SEQ ID NO:1 represents a version of a P2X receptor. All fragments of the P2X receptor, as well as the other proteins, such as receptors discussed herein, are considered disclosed.","In general, it is understood that one way to define any known variants and derivatives or those that might arise, of the disclosed genes and proteins herein, is through defining the variants and derivatives in terms of homology to specific known sequences. This identity of particular sequences disclosed herein is also discussed elsewhere herein. In general, variants of genes and proteins herein disclosed typically have at least, about 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99 percent homology to the stated sequence or the native sequence. Those of skill in the art readily understand how to determine the homology of two proteins or nucleic acids, such as genes. For example, the homology can be calculated after aligning the two sequences so that the homology is at its highest level.","Another way of calculating homology can be performed by published algorithms. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman Adv. Appl. Math. 2: 482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85: 2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by inspection.","The same types of homology can be obtained for nucleic acids by for example the algorithms disclosed in Zuker, M. 244:48-52, 1989, Jaeger et al. 86:7706-7710, 1989, Jaeger et al. 183:281-306, (1989) which are herein incorporated by reference for at least material related to nucleic acid alignment. It is understood that any of the methods typically can be used and that in certain instances the results of these various methods can differ, but the skilled artisan understands if identity is found with at least one of these methods, the sequences would be said to have the stated identity, and be disclosed herein.","For example, as used herein, a sequence recited as having a particular percent homology to another sequence refers to sequences that have the recited homology as calculated by any one or more of the calculation methods described above. For example, a first sequence has 80 percent homology, as defined herein, to a second sequence if the first sequence is calculated to have 80 percent homology to the second sequence using the Zuker calculation method even if the first sequence does not have 80 percent homology to the second sequence as calculated by any of the other calculation methods. As another example, a first sequence has 80 percent homology, as defined herein, to a second sequence if the first sequence is calculated to have 80 percent homology to the second sequence using both the Zuker calculation method and the Pearson and Lipman calculation method even if the first sequence does not have 80\u2032percent homology to the second sequence as calculated by the Smith and Waterman calculation method, the Needleman and Wunsch calculation method, the Jaeger calculation methods, or any of the other calculation methods. As yet another example, a first sequence has 80 percent homology, as defined herein, to a second sequence if the first sequence is calculated to have 80 percent homology to the second sequence using each of calculation methods (although, in practice, the different calculation methods will often result in different calculated homology percentages).","b) Hybridization","The term hybridization typically means a sequence driven interaction between at least two nucleic acid molecules, such as a primer or a probe and a gene. Sequence driven interaction means an interaction that occurs between two nucleotides or nucleotide analogs or nucleotide derivatives in a nucleotide specific manner. For example, G interacting with C or A interacting with T are sequence driven interactions. Typically sequence driven interactions occur on the Watson-Crick face or Hoogsteen face of the nucleotide. The hybridization of two nucleic acids is affected by a number of conditions and parameters known to those of skill in the art. For example, the salt concentrations, pH, and temperature of the reaction all affect whether two nucleic acid molecules will hybridize.","Parameters for selective hybridization between two nucleic acid molecules are well known to those of skill in the art. For example, in some embodiments selective hybridization conditions can be defined as stringent hybridization conditions. For example, stringency of hybridization is controlled by both temperature and salt concentration of either or both of the hybridization and washing steps. For example, the conditions of hybridization to achieve selective hybridization can involve hybridization in high ionic strength solution (6\u00d7SSC or 6\u00d7SSPE) at a temperature that is about 12-25\u00b0 C. below the Tm (the melting temperature at which half of the molecules dissociate from their hybridization partners) followed by washing at a combination of temperature and salt concentration chosen so that the washing temperature is about 5\u00b0 C. to 20\u00b0 C. below the Tm. The temperature and salt conditions are readily determined empirically in preliminary experiments in which samples of reference DNA immobilized on filters are hybridized to a labeled nucleic acid of interest and then washed under conditions of different stringencies. Hybridization temperatures are typically higher for DNA-RNA and RNA-RNA hybridizations. The conditions can be used as described above to achieve stringency, or as is known in the art. (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989; Kunkel et al. Methods Enzymol. 1987:154:367, 1987 which is herein incorporated by reference for material at least related to hybridization of nucleic acids). A preferable stringent hybridization condition for a DNA:DNA hybridization can be at about 68\u00b0 C. (in aqueous solution) in 6\u00d7SSC or 6\u00d7SSPE followed by washing at 68\u00b0 C. Stringency of hybridization and washing, if desired, can be reduced accordingly as the degree of complementarity desired is decreased, and further, depending upon the G-C or A-T richness of any area wherein variability is searched for. Likewise, stringency of hybridization and washing, if desired, can be increased accordingly as homology desired is increased, and further, depending upon the G-C or A-T richness of any area wherein high homology is desired, all as known in the art.","Another way to define selective hybridization is by looking at the amount (percentage) of one of the nucleic acids bound to the other nucleic acid. For example, in some embodiments selective hybridization conditions would be when at least about, 60, 65, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 percent of the limiting nucleic acid is bound to the non-limiting nucleic acid. Typically, the non-limiting primer is in for example, 10 or 100 or 1000 fold excess. This type of assay can be performed at under conditions where both the limiting and non-limiting primer are for example, 10 fold or 100 fold or 1000 fold below their K, or where only one of the nucleic acid molecules is 10 fold or 100 fold or 1000 fold or where one or both nucleic acid molecules are above their K.","Another way to define selective hybridization is by looking at the percentage of primer that gets enzymatically manipulated under conditions where hybridization is required to promote the desired enzymatic manipulation. For example, in some embodiments selective hybridization conditions would be when at least about, 60, 65, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 percent of the primer is enzymatically manipulated under conditions which promote the enzymatic manipulation, for example if the enzymatic manipulation is DNA extension, then selective hybridization conditions would be when at least about 60, 65, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 percent of the primer molecules are extended. Preferred conditions also include those indicated by the manufacturer or indicated in the art as being appropriate for the enzyme performing the manipulation.","Just as with homology, it is understood that there are a variety of methods herein disclosed for determining the level of hybridization between two nucleic acid molecules. It is understood that these methods and conditions can provide different percentages of hybridization between two nucleic acid molecules, but unless otherwise indicated meeting the parameters of any of the methods would be sufficient. For example if 80% hybridization was required and as long as hybridization occurs within the required parameters in any one of these methods it is considered disclosed herein.","It is understood that those of skill in the art understand that if a composition or method meets any one of these criteria for determining hybridization either collectively or singly it is a composition or method that is disclosed herein.","c) Nucleic Acids","There are a variety of molecules disclosed herein that are nucleic acid based, including for example the nucleic acids that encode, for example the purinergic receptors, as well as various functional nucleic acids. The disclosed nucleic acids are made up of, for example, nucleotides, nucleotide analogs, or nucleotide substitutes. Non-limiting examples of these and other molecules are discussed herein. It is understood that for example, when a vector is expressed in a cell that the expressed mRNA will typically be made up of A, C, G, and U. Likewise, it is understood that if, for example, an antisense molecule is introduced into a cell or cell environment through for example exogenous delivery, it is advantageous that the antisense molecule be made up of nucleotide analogs that reduce the degradation of the antisense molecule in the cellular environment.","A nucleotide is a molecule that contains a base moiety, a sugar moiety and a phosphate moiety. Nucleotides can be linked together through their phosphate moieties and sugar moieties creating an internucleoside linkage. The base moiety of a nucleotide can be adenin-9-yl (A), cytosin-1-yl (C), guanin-9-yl (G), uracil-1-yl (U), and thymin-1-yl (T). The sugar moiety of a nucleotide is a ribose or a deoxyribose. The phosphate moiety of a nucleotide is pentavalent phosphate. A non-limiting example of a nucleotide would be 3\u2032-AMP (3\u2032-adenosine monophosphate) or 5\u2032-GMP (5\u2032-guanosine monophosphate).","A nucleotide analog is a nucleotide, which contains some type of modification to the base, sugar, or phosphate moieties. Modifications to nucleotides are well known in the art and would include for example, 5-methylcytosine (5-me-C), 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, and 2-aminoadenine as well as modifications at the sugar or phosphate moieties.","Nucleotide substitutes are molecules having similar functional properties to nucleotides, but which do not contain a phosphate moiety, such as peptide nucleic acid (PNA). Nucleotide substitutes are molecules that will recognize nucleic acids in a Watson-Crick or Hoogsteen manner, but which are linked together through a moiety other than a phosphate moiety. Nucleotide substitutes are able to conform to a double helix type structure when interacting with the appropriate target nucleic acid.","It is also possible to link other types of molecules (conjugates) to nucleotides or nucleotide analogs to enhance for example, cellular uptake. Conjugates can be chemically linked to the nucleotide or nucleotide analogs. Such conjugates include but are not limited to lipid moieties such as a cholesterol moiety. (Letsinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1989, 86, 6553-6556),","A Watson-Crick interaction is at least one interaction with the Watson-Crick face of a nucleotide, nucleotide analog, or nucleotide substitute. The Watson-Crick face of a nucleotide, nucleotide analog, or nucleotide substitute includes the C2, N1, and C6 positions of a purine based nucleotide, nucleotide analog, or nucleotide substitute and the C2, N3, C4 positions of a pyrimidine based nucleotide, nucleotide analog, or nucleotide substitute.","A Hoogsteen interaction is the interaction that takes place on the Hoogsteen face of a nucleotide or nucleotide analog, which is exposed in the major groove of duplex DNA. The Hoogsteen face includes the N7 position and reactive groups (NH2 or O) at the C6 position of purine nucleotides.","A nucleotide analog is a nucleotide, which contains some type of modification to the base, sugar, or phosphate moieties. Modifications to the base moiety would include natural and synthetic modifications of A, C, G, and T\/U as well as different purine or pyrimidine bases, such as uracil-5-yl (.psi.), hypoxanthin-9-yl (I), and 2-aminoadenin-9-yl. A modified base includes but is not limited to 5-methylcytosine (5-me-C), 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, 2-aminoadenine, 6-methyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-propyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-thiouracil, 2-thiothymine and 2-thiocytosine, 5-halouracil and cytosine, 5-propynyl uracil and cytosine, 6-azo uracil, cytosine and thymine, 5-uracil (pseudouracil), 4-thiouracil, 8-halo, 8-amino, 8-thiol, 8-thioalkyl, 8-hydroxyl and other 8-substituted adenines and guanines, 5-halo particularly 5-bromo, 5-trifluoromethyl and other 5-substituted uracils and cytosines, 7-methylguanine and 7-methyladenine, 8-azaguanine and 8-azaadenine, 7-deazaguanine and 7-deazaadenine and 3-deazaguanine and 3-deazaadenine. Additional base modifications can be found for example in U.S. Pat. No. 3,687,808, Englisch et al., Angewandte Chemie, International Edition, 1991, 30, 613, and Sanghvi, Y. S., Chapter 15, Antisense Research and Applications, pages 289-302, Crooke, S. T. and Lebleu, B. ed., CRC Press, 1993. Certain nucleotide analogs, such as 5-substituted pyrimidines, 6-azapyrimidines and N-2, N-6 and O-6 substituted purines, including 2-aminopropyladenine, 5-propynyluracil and 5-propynylcytosine. 5-methylcytosine can increase the stability of duplex formation. Often time base modifications can be combined with for example a sugar modification, such as 2\u2032-O-methoxyethyl, to achieve unique properties such as increased duplex stability.

It is understood that the description related to this sequence is applicable to any sequence related to purinergic receptors, for example, unless specifically indicated otherwise. Those of skill in the art understand how to resolve sequence discrepancies and differences and to adjust the compositions and methods relating to a particular sequence to other related sequences. Primers and\/or probes can be designed for any of the purinergic receptor sequences given the information disclosed herein and known in the art.","Disclosed are compositions including primers and probes, which are capable of interacting with the purinergic receptors as disclosed herein. In certain embodiments the primers are used to support DNA amplification reactions. Typically the primers will be capable of being extended in a sequence specific manner. Extension of a primer in a sequence specific manner includes any methods wherein the sequence and\/or composition of the nucleic acid molecule to which the primer is hybridized or otherwise associated directs or influences the composition or sequence of the product produced by the extension of the primer. Extension of the primer in a sequence specific manner therefore includes, but is not limited to, PCR, DNA sequencing, DNA extension, DNA polymerization, RNA transcription, or reverse transcription. Techniques and conditions that amplify the primer in a sequence specific manner are preferred. In certain embodiments the primers are used for the DNA amplification reactions, such as PCR or direct sequencing. It is understood that in certain embodiments the primers can also be extended using non-enzymatic techniques, where for example, the nucleotides or oligonucleotides used to extend the primer are modified such that they will chemically react to extend the primer in a sequence specific manner. Typically the disclosed primers hybridize with a purinergic receptor nucleic acid or region of the purinergic receptor nucleic acid or they hybridize with the complement of the purinergic receptor nucleic acid or complement of a region of the purinergic receptor nucleic acid.","d) Delivery of the Compositions to Cells","There are a number of compositions and methods which can be used to deliver nucleic acids to cells, either in vitro or in vivo. These methods and compositions can largely be broken down into two classes: viral based delivery systems and non-viral based delivery systems. For example, the nucleic acids can be delivered through a number of direct delivery systems such as, electroporation, lipofection, calcium phosphate precipitation, plasmids, viral vectors, viral nucleic acids, phage nucleic acids, phages, cosmids, or via transfer of genetic material in cells or carriers such as cationic liposomes. Appropriate means for transfection, including viral vectors, chemical transfectants, or physico-mechanical methods such as electroporation and direct diffusion of DNA, are described by, for example, Wolff, J. A., et al., Science, 247, 1465-1468, (1990); and Wolff, J. A. Nature, 352, 815-818, (1991). Such methods are well known in the art and readily adaptable for use with the compositions and methods described herein. In certain cases, the methods will be modified to specifically function with large DNA molecules. Further, these methods can be used to target certain diseases and cell populations by using the targeting characteristics of the carrier.","In the methods described herein, which include the administration and uptake of exogenous DNA into the cells of a subject (i.e., gene transduction or transfection), the disclosed nucleic acids can be in the form of naked DNA or RNA, or the nucleic acids can be in a vector for delivering the nucleic acids to the cells, whereby the encoding DNA or DNA or fragment is under the transcriptional regulation of a promoter, as would be well understood by one of ordinary skill in the art as well as enhancers. The vector can be a commercially available preparation, such as an adenovirus vector (Quantum Biotechnologies, Inc. (Laval, Quebec, Canada).","As one example, vector delivery can be via a viral system, such as a retroviral vector system which can package a recombinant retroviral genome (see e.g., Pastan et al., 85:4486, 1988; Miller et al., 6:2895, 1986). The recombinant retrovirus can then be used to infect and thereby deliver to the infected cells nucleic acid encoding a broadly neutralizing antibody (or active fragment thereof). The exact method of introducing the altered nucleic acid into mammalian cells is, of course, not limited to the use of retroviral vectors. Other techniques are widely available for this procedure including the use of adenoviral vectors (Mitani et al., 5:941-948, 1994), adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors (Goodman et al., 84:1492-1500, 1994), lentiviral vectors (Naidini et al., 272:263-267, 1996), pseudotyped retroviral vectors (Agrawal et al., 24:738-747, 1996). Physical transduction techniques can also be used, such as liposome delivery and receptor-mediated and other endocytosis mechanisms (see, for example, Schwartzenberger et al., 87:472-478, 1996). The disclosed compositions and methods can be used in conjunction with any of these or other commonly used gene transfer methods.","As one example, if the antibody-encoding nucleic acid or some other nucleic acid encoding a purinergic receptor interactions is delivered to the cells of a subject in an adenovirus vector, the dosage for administration of adenovirus to humans can range from about 10to 10plaque forming units (pfu) per injection but can be as high as 10pfu per injection (Crystal, 8:985-1001, 1997; Alvarez and Curiel, 8:597-613, 1997). A subject can receive a single injection, or, if additional injections are necessary, they can be repeated at six-month intervals (or other appropriate time intervals, as determined by the skilled practitioner) for an indefinite period and\/or until the efficacy of the treatment has been established.","Parenteral administration of the nucleic acid or vector, if used, is generally characterized by injection. Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution of suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions. A more recently revised approach for parenteral administration involves use of a slow release or sustained release system such that a constant dosage is maintained. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 3,610,795, which is incorporated by reference herein. For additional discussion of suitable formulations and various routes of administration of therapeutic compounds, see, e.g., (19th ed.) ed. A. R. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. 1995.","Nucleic acids that are delivered to cells which are to be integrated into the host cell genome, typically contain integration sequences. These sequences are often viral related sequences, particularly when viral based systems are used. These viral integration systems can also be incorporated into nucleic acids which are to be delivered using a non-nucleic acid based system of deliver, such as a liposome, so that the nucleic acid contained in the delivery system can be come integrated into the host genome.","Other general techniques for integration into the host genome include, for example, systems designed to promote homologous recombination with the host genome. These systems typically rely on sequence flanking the nucleic acid to be expressed that has enough homology with a target sequence within the host cell genome that recombination between the vector nucleic acid and the target nucleic acid takes place, causing the delivered nucleic acid to be integrated into the host genome. These systems and the methods necessary to promote homologous recombination are known to those of skill in the art.","The disclosed compositions can be delivered to the target cells in a variety of ways. For example, the compositions can be delivered through electroporation, or through lipofection, or through calcium phosphate precipitation. The delivery mechanism chosen will depend in part on the type of cell targeted and whether the delivery is occurring for example in vivo or in vitro.","Thus, the compositions can comprise, in addition to the disclosed compositions or vectors for example, lipids such as liposomes, such as cationic liposomes (e.g., DOTMA, DOPE, DC-cholesterol) or anionic liposomes. Liposomes can further comprise proteins to facilitate targeting a particular cell, if desired. Administration of a composition comprising a compound and a cationic liposome can be administered to the blood afferent to a target organ or inhaled into the respiratory tract to target cells of the respiratory tract. Regarding liposomes, see, e.g., Brigham et al. 1:95-100 (1989); Felgner et al. 84:7413-7417 (1987); U.S. Pat. No. 4,897,355. Furthermore, the compound can be administered as a component of a microcapsule that can be targeted to specific cell types, such as macrophages, or where the diffusion of the compound or delivery of the compound from the microcapsule is designed for a specific rate or dosage.","In the methods described above which include the administration and uptake of exogenous DNA into the cells of a subject (i.e., gene transduction or transfection), delivery of the compositions to cells can be via a variety of mechanisms. As one example, delivery can be via a liposome, using commercially available liposome preparations such as LIPOFECTIN, LIPOFECTAMINE (GIBCO-BRL, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.), SUPERFECT (Qiagen, Inc. Hilden, Germany) and TRANSFECTAM (Promega Biotec, Inc., Madison, Wis.), as well as other liposomes developed according to procedures standard in the art. In addition, the nucleic acid or vector can be delivered in vivo by electroporation, the technology for which is available from Genetronics, Inc. (San Diego, Calif.) as well as by means of a SONOPORATION machine (ImaRx Pharmaceutical Corp., Tucson, Ariz.).","The materials can be in solution, suspension (for example, incorporated into microparticles, liposomes, or cells). These can be targeted to a particular cell type via antibodies, receptors, or receptor ligands. The following references are examples of the use of this technology to target specific proteins to tumor tissue (Senter, et al., 2:447-451, (1991); Bagshawe, K. D., 60:275-281, (1989); Bagshawe, et al., 58:700-703, (1988); Senter, et al., 4:3-9, (1993); Battelli, et al., 35:421-425, (1992); Pietersz and McKenzie, 129:57-80, (1992); and Roffler, et al., 42:2062-2065, (1991)). These techniques can be used for a variety of other specific cell types. Vehicles such as \u201cstealth\u201d and other antibody conjugated liposomes (including lipid mediated drug targeting to colonic carcinoma), receptor mediated targeting of DNA through cell specific ligands, lymphocyte directed tumor targeting, and highly specific therapeutic retroviral targeting of murine glioma cells in viva. The following references are examples of the use of this technology to target specific proteins to tumor tissue (Hughes et al., 49:6214-6220, (1989); and Litzinger and Huang, 1104:179-187, (1992)). In general, receptors are involved in pathways of endocytosis, either constitutive or ligand induced. These receptors cluster in clathrin-coated pits, enter the cell via clathrin-coated vesicles, pass through an acidified endosome in which the receptors are sorted, and then either recycle to the cell surface, become stored intracellularly, or are degraded in lysosomes. The internalization pathways serve a variety of functions, such as nutrient uptake, removal of activated proteins, clearance of macromolecules, opportunistic entry of viruses and toxins, dissociation and degradation of ligand, and receptor-level regulation. Many receptors follow more than one intracellular pathway, depending on the cell type, receptor concentration, type of ligand, ligand valency, and ligand concentration. Molecular and cellular mechanisms of receptor-mediated endocytosis have been reviewed (Brown and Greene, 10:6, 399-409 (1991)).","As described above, the compositions can be administered in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and can be delivered to the subject's cells in vivo and\/or ex vivo by a variety of mechanisms well known in the art (e.g., uptake of naked DNA, liposome fusion, intramuscular injection of DNA via a gene gun, endocytosis and the like).","If ex vivo methods are employed, cells or tissues can be removed and maintained outside the body according to standard protocols well known in the art. The compositions can be introduced into the cells via any gene transfer mechanism, such as, for example, calcium phosphate mediated gene delivery, electroporation, microinjection or proteoliposomes. The transduced cells can then be infused (e.g., in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier) or homotopically transplanted back into the subject per standard methods for the cell or tissue type. Standard methods are known for transplantation or infusion of various cells into a subject.","e) Expression Systems","The nucleic acids that are delivered to cells typically contain expression-controlling systems. For example, the inserted genes in viral and retroviral systems usually contain promoters, and\/or enhancers to help control the expression of the desired gene product. A promoter is generally a sequence or sequences of DNA that function when in a relatively fixed location in regard to the transcription start site. A promoter contains core elements required for basic interaction of RNA polymerase and transcription factors, and can contain upstream elements and response elements.","Preferred promoters controlling transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells can be obtained from various sources, for example, the genomes of viruses such as: polyoma, Simian Virus 40 (SV40), adenovirus, retroviruses, hepatitis-B virus and most preferably cytomegalovirus, or from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g. beta actin promoter. The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment which also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication (Fiers et al., 273: 113 (1978)). The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment (Greenway, P. J. et al., 18: 355-360 (1982)). Of course, promoters from the host cell or related species also are useful herein.","Enhancer generally refers to a sequence of DNA that functions at no fixed distance from the transcription start site and can be either 5\u2032 (Laimins, L. et al., 78: 993 (1981)) or 3\u2032 (Lusky, M. L., et al., 3:1108 (1983)) to the transcription unit. Furthermore, enhancers can be within an intron (Baneiji, J. L. et al., 33:729 (1983)) as well as within the coding sequence itself (Osborne, T. F., et al., 4:1293 (1984)). They are usually between 10 and 300 bp in length, and they function in cis. Enhancers function to increase transcription from nearby promoters. Enhancers also often contain response elements that mediate the regulation of transcription. Promoters can also contain response elements that mediate the regulation of transcription. Enhancers often determine the regulation of expression of a gene. While many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, -fetoprotein and insulin), typically one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus for general expression. Examples are the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers.","The promoter and\/or enhancer can be specifically activated either by light or specific chemical events which trigger their function. Systems can be regulated by reagents such as tetracycline and dexamethasone. There are also ways to enhance viral vector gene expression by exposure to irradiation, such as gamma irradiation, or alkylating chemotherapy drugs.","In certain embodiments the promoter and\/or enhancer regions can act as a constitutive promoter and\/or enhancer to maximize expression of the region of the transcription unit to be transcribed. In certain constructs the promoter and\/or enhancer region be active in all eukaryotic cell types, even if it is only expressed in a particular type of cell at a particular time. A preferred promoter of this type is the CMV promoter (650 bases). Other preferred promoters are SV40 promoters, cytomegalovirus (full length promoter), and retroviral vector LTF.","It has been shown that all specific regulatory elements can be cloned and used to construct expression vectors that are selectively expressed in specific cell types such as melanoma cells. The glial fibrillary acetic protein (GFAP) promoter has been used to selectively express genes in cells of glial origin.","Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human or nucleated cells) can also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription which can affect mRNA expression. These regions are transcribed as polyadenylated segments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding tissue factor protein. The 3\u2032 untranslated regions also include transcription termination sites. It is preferred that the transcription unit also contains a polyadenylation region. One benefit of this region is that it increases the likelihood that the transcribed unit will be processed and transported like mRNA.","The identification and use of polyadenylation signals in expression constructs is well established. It is preferred that homologous polyadenylation signals be used in the transgene constructs. In certain transcription units, the polyadenylation region is derived from the SV40 early polyadenylation signal and consists of about 400 bases. It is also preferred that the transcribed units contain other standard sequences alone or in combination with the above sequences improve expression from, or stability of, the construct.","The vectors can include nucleic acid sequence encoding a marker product. This marker product is used to determine if the gene has been delivered to the cell and once delivered is being expressed. Preferred marker genes are the lacZ gene, which encodes \u03b2-galactosidase, and green fluorescent protein.","In some embodiments the marker can be a selectable marker. Examples of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), thymidine kinase, neomycin, neomycin analog G418, hydromycin, and puromycin. When such selectable markers are successfully transferred into a mammalian host cell, the transformed mammalian host cell can survive if placed under selective pressure. There are two widely used distinct categories of selective regimes. The first category is based on a cell's metabolism and the use of a mutant cell line which lacks the ability to grow independent of a supplemented media. Two examples are: CHO DHFR-cells and mouse LTK-cells. These cells lack the ability to grow without the addition of such nutrients as thymidine or hypoxanthine. Because these cells lack certain genes necessary for a complete nucleotide synthesis pathway, they cannot survive unless the missing nucleotides are provided in a supplemented media. An alternative to supplementing the media is to introduce an intact DHFR or TK gene into cells lacking the respective genes, thus altering their growth requirements. Individual cells which were not transformed with the DHFR or TK gene will not be capable of survival in non-supplemented media.","The second category is dominant selection which refers to a selection scheme used in any cell type and does not require the use of a mutant cell line. These schemes typically use a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells which have a novel gene would express a protein conveying drug resistance and would survive the selection. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin, (Southern P. and Berg, P., 1:327 (1982)), mycophenolic acid, (Mulligan, R. C. and Berg, P. 209:1422 (1980)) or hygromycin, (Sugden, B. et al., 5:410-413 (1985)). The three examples employ bacterial genes under eukaryotic control to convey resistance to the appropriate drug G418 or neomycin (geneticin), xgpt (mycophenolic acid) or hygromycin, respectively. Others include the neomycin analog G418 and puromycin.","1) Peptides","As discussed herein there are numerous variants of the purinergic receptor proteins and that are known and herein contemplated. In addition, to the known functional purinergic receptor species variants there are derivatives of the purinergic receptor proteins which also function in the disclosed methods and compositions. Protein variants and derivatives are well understood to those of skill in the art and in can involve amino acid sequence modifications. For example, amino acid sequence modifications typically fall into one or more of three classes: substitutional, insertional or deletional variants. Insertions include amino and\/or carboxyl terminal fusions as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Insertions ordinarily will be smaller insertions than those of amino or carboxyl terminal fusions, for example, on the order of one to four residues. Immunogenic fusion protein derivatives, such as those described in the examples, are made by fusing a polypeptide sufficiently large to confer immunogenicity to the target sequence by cross-linking in vitro or by recombinant cell culture transformed with DNA encoding the fusion. Deletions are characterized by the removal of one or more amino acid residues from the protein sequence. Typically, no more than about from 2 to 6 residues are deleted at any one site within the protein molecule. These variants ordinarily are prepared by site-specific mutagenesis of nucleotides in the DNA encoding the protein, thereby producing DNA encoding the variant, and thereafter expressing the DNA in recombinant cell culture.","Techniques for making substitution mutations at predetermined sites in DNA having a known sequence are well known, for example M13 primer mutagenesis and PCR mutagenesis. Amino acid substitutions are typically of single residues, but can occur at a number of different locations at once; insertions usually will be on the order of about from 1 to 10 amino acid residues; and deletions will range about from 1 to 30 residues.","Deletions or insertions preferably are made in adjacent pairs, i.e. a deletion of 2 residues or insertion of 2 residues. Substitutions, deletions, insertions or any combination thereof can be combined to arrive at a final construct. The mutations must not place the sequence out of reading frame and preferably will not create complementary regions that could produce secondary mRNA structure.

The substitutions which in general are expected to produce the greatest changes in the protein properties will be those in which (a) a hydrophilic residue, e.g. seryl or threonyl, is substituted for (or by) a hydrophobic residue, e.g. leucyl, isoleucyl, phenylalanyl, valyl or alanyl; (b) a cysteine or proline is substituted for (or by) any other residue; (c) a residue having an electropositive side chain, e.g., lysyl, arginyl, or histidyl, is substituted for (or by) an electronegative residue, e.g., glutamyl or aspartyl; or (d) a residue having a bulky side chain, e.g., phenylalanine, is substituted for (or by) one not having a side chain, e.g., glycine, in this case, (e) by increasing the number of sites for sulfation and\/or glycosylation.","For example, the replacement of one amino acid residue with another that is biologically and\/or chemically similar is known to those skilled in the art as a conservative substitution. For example, a conservative substitution would be replacing one hydrophobic residue for another, or one polar residue for another. The substitutions include combinations such as, for example, Gly, Ala; Val, Ile, Leu; Asp, Glu; Asn, Gin; Ser, Thr; Lys, Arg; and Phe, Tyr. Such conservatively substituted variations of each explicitly disclosed sequence are included within the mosaic polypeptides provided herein.","Substitutional or deletional mutagenesis can be employed to insert sites for N-glycosylation (Asn-X-Thr\/Ser) or O-glycosylation (Ser or Thr). Deletions of cysteine or other labile residues also can be desirable. Deletions or substitutions of potential proteolysis sites, e.g. Arg, is accomplished for example by deleting one of the basic residues or substituting one by glutaminyl or histidyl residues.","Certain post-translational derivatizations are the result of the action of recombinant host cells on the expressed polypeptide. Glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues are frequently post-translationally deamidated to the corresponding glutamyl and asparyl residues. Alternatively, these residues are deamidated under mildly acidic conditions. Other post-translational modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the o-amino groups of lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains (T.E. Creighton, Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties, W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco pp 79-86 [1983]), acetylation of the N-terminal amine and, in some instances, amidation of the C-terminal carboxyl.","It is understood that one way to define the variants and derivatives of the disclosed proteins herein is through defining the variants and derivatives in terms of homology\/identity to specific known sequences. For example, SEQ ID NO:1 sets forth a particular sequence of a P2X receptor. Specifically disclosed are variants of these and other proteins herein disclosed which have at least, 70% or 75% or 80% or 85% or 90% or 95% homology to the stated sequence. Those of skill in the art readily understand how to determine the homology of two proteins. For example, the homology can be calculated after aligning the two sequences so that the homology is at its highest level.","Another way of calculating homology can be performed by published algorithms. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman Adv. Appl. Math. 2: 482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85: 2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by inspection.","The same types of homology can be obtained for nucleic acids by for example the algorithms disclosed in Zuker, M. 244:48-52, 1989, Jaeger et al. 86:7706-7710, 1989, Jaeger et al. 183:281-306, 1989 which are herein incorporated by reference for at least material related to nucleic acid alignment.","It is understood that the description of conservative mutations and homology can be combined together in any combination, such as embodiments that have at least 70% homology to a particular sequence wherein the variants are conservative mutations.","As this specification discusses various proteins and protein sequences it is understood that the nucleic acids that can encode those protein sequences are also disclosed. This would include all degenerate sequences related to a specific protein sequence, i.e. all nucleic acids having a sequence that encodes one particular protein sequence as well as all nucleic acids, including degenerate nucleic acids, encoding the disclosed variants and derivatives of the protein sequences. Thus, while each particular nucleic acid sequence cannot be written out herein, it is understood that each and every sequence is in fact disclosed and described herein through the disclosed protein sequence. It is also understood that while no amino acid sequence indicates what particular DNA sequence encodes that protein within an organism, where particular variants of a disclosed protein are disclosed herein, the known nucleic acid sequence that encodes that protein in the particular organism from which that protein arises is also known and herein disclosed and described.","g) Pharmaceutical Carriers\/Delivery of Pharmaceutical Products","As described herein, the compositions, such as the ATP and ATP analogs, can also be administered in vivo in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. By \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d is meant a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., the material can be administered to a subject, along with the nucleic acid or vector, without causing any undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the pharmaceutical composition in which it is contained. The carrier would naturally be selected to minimize any degradation of the active ingredient and to minimize any adverse side effects in the subject, as would be well known to one of skill in the art.","The compositions can be administered orally, parenterally (e.g., intravenously), by intramuscular injection, by intraperitoneal injection, transdermally, extracorporeally, topically or the like, including topical intranasal administration or administration by inhalant. As used herein, \u201ctopical intranasal administration\u201d means delivery of the compositions into the nose and nasal passages through one or both of the nares and can comprise delivery by a spraying mechanism or droplet mechanism, or through aerosolization of the composition. Administration of the compositions by inhalant can be through the nose or mouth via delivery by a spraying or droplet mechanism. Delivery can also be directly to any area of the respiratory system (e.g., lungs) via intubation. The exact amount of the compositions required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, weight and general condition of the subject, the severity of the allergic disorder being treated, the particular nucleic acid or vector used, its mode of administration and the like. Thus, it is not possible to specify an exact amount for every composition. However, an appropriate amount can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation given the teachings herein.","Parenteral administration of the composition, if used, is generally characterized by injection. Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution of suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions. A more recently revised approach for parenteral administration involves use of a slow release or sustained release system such that a constant dosage is maintained. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 3,610,795, which is incorporated by reference herein.","The materials can be in solution, suspension (for example, incorporated into microparticles, liposomes, or cells). These can be targeted to a particular cell type via antibodies, receptors, or receptor ligands. The following references are examples of the use of this technology to target specific proteins to tumor tissue (Senter, et al., 2:447-451, (1991); Bagshawe, K. D., 60:275-281, (1989); Bagshawe, et al., 58:700-703, (1988); Senter, et al., 4:3-9, (1993); Battelli, et al., 35:421-425, (1992); Pietersz and McKenzie, 129:57-80, (1992); and Roffler, et al., 42:2062-2065, (1991)). Vehicles such as \u201cstealth\u201d and other antibody conjugated liposomes (including lipid mediated drug targeting to colonic carcinoma), receptor mediated targeting of DNA through cell specific ligands, lymphocyte directed tumor targeting, and highly specific therapeutic retroviral targeting of murine glioma cells in viva. The following references are examples of the use of this technology to target specific proteins to tumor tissue (Hughes et al., 49:6214-6220, (1989); and Litzinger and Huang, 1104:179-187, (1992)). In general, receptors are involved in pathways of endocytosis, either constitutive or ligand induced. These receptors cluster in clathrin-coated pits, enter the cell via clathrin-coated vesicles, pass through an acidified endosome in which the receptors are sorted, and then either recycle to the cell surface, become stored intracellularly, or are degraded in lysosomes. The internalization pathways serve a variety of functions, such as nutrient uptake, removal of activated proteins, clearance of macromolecules, opportunistic entry of viruses and toxins, dissociation and degradation of ligand, and receptor-level regulation. Many receptors follow more than one intracellular pathway, depending on the cell type, receptor concentration, type of ligand, ligand valency, and ligand concentration. Molecular and cellular mechanisms of receptor-mediated endocytosis have been reviewed (Brown and Greene, 10:6, 399-409 (1991)).","Suitable carriers and their formulations are described in (19th ed.) ed. A. R. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. 1995. Typically, an appropriate amount of a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt is used in the formulation to render the formulation isotonic. Examples of the pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier include, but are not limited to, saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. The pH of the solution is preferably from about 5 to about 8, and more preferably from about 7 to about 7.5. Further carriers include sustained release preparations such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, liposomes or microparticles. It will be apparent to those persons skilled in the art that certain carriers can be more preferable depending upon, for instance, the route of administration and concentration of composition being administered.","Pharmaceutical carriers are known to those skilled in the art. These most typically would be standard carriers for administration of drugs to humans, including solutions such as sterile water, saline, and buffered solutions at physiological pH. The compositions can be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Other compounds will be administered according to standard procedures used by those skilled in the art.","Pharmaceutical compositions can include carriers, thickeners, diluents, buffers, preservatives, surface-active agents and the like in addition to the molecule of choice. Pharmaceutical compositions can also include one or more active ingredients such as antimicrobial agents, antiinflammatory agents, anesthetics, and the like.","The pharmaceutical composition can be administered in a number of ways depending on whether local or systemic treatment is desired, and on the area to be treated. Administration can be topically (including ophthalmically, vaginally, rectally, intranasally), orally, by inhalation, or parenterally, for example by intravenous drip, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection. The disclosed antibodies can be administered intravenously, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intracavity, or transdermally.","Preparations for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic\/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's, or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers (such as those based on Ringer's dextrose), and the like. Preservatives and other additives can also be present such as, for example, antimicrobials, anti-oxidants, chelating agents, and inert gases and the like.","Formulations for topical administration can include ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like can be necessary or desirable.","Compositions for oral administration include powders or granules, suspensions or solutions in water or non-aqueous media, capsules, sachets, or tablets. Thickeners, flavorings, diluents, emulsifiers, dispersing aids or binders can be desirable.","Some of the compositions can potentially be administered as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid- or base-addition salt, formed by reaction with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, perchloric acid, nitric acid, thiocyanic acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid, and organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, and fumaric acid, or by reaction with an inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and organic bases such as mono-, di-, trialkyl and aryl amines and substituted ethanolamines.","Effective dosages and schedules for administering the compositions can be determined empirically, and making such determinations is within the skill in the art. The dosage ranges for the administration of the compositions are those large enough to produce the desired effect in which the symptoms of the disorder are affected. The dosage should not be so large as to cause adverse side effects, such as unwanted cross-reactions, anaphylactic reactions, and the like. Generally, the dosage will vary with the age, condition, sex and extent of the disease in the patient, route of administration, or whether other drugs are included in the regimen, and can be determined by one of skill in the art. The dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any counterindications. Dosage can vary, and can be administered in one or more dose administrations hourly or daily, for one or several days. Guidance can be found in the literature for appropriate dosages for given classes of pharmaceutical products. For example, guidance in selecting appropriate doses for antibodies can be found in the literature on therapeutic uses of antibodies, e.g., Handbook of Monoclonal Antibodies, Ferrone et al., eds., Noges Publications, Park Ridge, N.J., (1985) ch. 22 and pp. 303-357; Smith et al., Antibodies in Human Diagnosis and Therapy, Haber et al., eds., Raven Press, New York (1977) pp. 365-389. A typical daily dosage of the ATP or ATP analogs used alone might range from about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to up to 100 mg\/kg of body weight or more per day, depending on the factors mentioned above. For example, based on the similarities of ECconcentrations for P2 receptors across many species an effective dose to modulate smell in a human would be similar to our mouse model, i.e., 10-200 \u03bcm.","Following administration of a disclosed composition, such as an ATP analog, for the modulation of smell, the efficacy of the therapeutic composition can be assessed in various ways well known to the skilled practitioner. For instance, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the compositions disclosed herein are efficacious in modulating, such as enhancing or reducing the sensation of smell in a subject, by observing that the composition reduces or enhances the sensation of smell to a particular or general odor stimulant. Smell sensation can be measured by methods that are known in the art, for example, and in vitro methods using an ORN calcium imaging assay as discussed herein, can also be used.","The compositions that modulate smell disclosed herein can be administered prophylactically to patients or subjects who are at risk for being exposed to severe or damaging odor stimulation or who have a desire to have either an increased or decreased sensitivity to an odor. For example, elderly people can increase sensitivity to odor to compensate for loss during aging. Conversely, those on chemotherapy drugs may need decreased odor sensitivity to reduce nausea.","Other molecules that modulate odor sensitivity, but do not have a particular pharmaceutical function can be used for tracking changes within ORNs.","h) Computer Readable Mediums","It is understood that the disclosed nucleic acids and proteins and compositions can be represented as a sequence consisting of the nucleotides of amino acids. There are a variety of ways to display these sequences, for example the nucleotide guanosine can be represented by G or g. Likewise the amino acid valine can be represented by Val or V. Those of skill in the art understand how to display and express any nucleic acid or protein sequence in any of the variety of ways that exist, each of which is considered herein disclosed. Specifically contemplated herein is the display of these sequences and ATP or ATP analogs on computer readable mediums, such as, commercially available floppy disks, tapes, chips, hard drives, compact disks, and videodisks, or other computer readable mediums. Also disclosed are the binary code representations of the disclosed sequences and ATP or ATP analogs. Those of skill in the art understand what computer readable mediums. Thus, computer readable mediums on which the nucleic acids or protein sequences are recorded, stored, or saved","i) Chips and Micro Arrays","Disclosed are chips where at least one address is the sequences or part of the sequences set forth in any of the nucleic acid sequences disclosed herein. Also disclosed are chips where at least one address is the sequences or portion of sequences set forth in any of the peptide sequences disclosed herein. Disclosed are chips where at least one address is the composition, such as an ATP analog, disclosed herein.","Also disclosed are chips where at least one address is a variant of the sequences or part of the sequences set forth in any of the nucleic acid sequences disclosed herein. Also disclosed are chips where at least one address is a variant of the sequences or portion of sequences set forth in any of the peptide sequences disclosed herein.","j) Kits","Disclosed herein are kits that are drawn to reagents that can be used in practicing the methods disclosed herein. The kits can include any reagent or combination of reagent discussed herein or that would be understood to be required or beneficial in the practice of the disclosed methods. For example, the kits could include an ATP analog in a formulation for delivery to an ORN. For example, disclosed is a kit for modulating odor sensitivity comprising ATP in a formulation for delivery to an ORN.","D. Methods of Making the Compositions","The compositions disclosed herein and the compositions necessary to perform the disclosed methods can be made using any method known to those of skill in the art for that particular reagent or compound unless otherwise specifically noted.","1. ATP Analog Generation","The disclosed ATP analogs can be made using a variety of synthetic procedures. Often the analogs can be purchased. For example, the following analogs can be purchased from Sigma Inc., 2-(Methylthio)adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate, 2-Chloroadenosine 5\u2032 triphosphate, 2\u2032,5\u2032-Dideoxyadenosine 3\u2032-triphosphate, 2\u2032-3\u2032-O-(4-Benzoylbenzoyl)adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate, 2\u2032-Monophosphoadenosine 5\u2032-diphosphoribose, ATP-Ribose, 8-Bromoadenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate, Adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate P3-[1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl ester] (Caged ATP\u2032NPE caged ATP), Adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate, Adenosine 5\u2032-(\u03b2,\u03b3-imido)triphosphate, Adenosine 5\u2032-[\u03b3-thio]triphosphate, Adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate g-(1-[2-nitrophenyl]ethyl) ester (Caged ATP), 125229-58-5 minimum 95%, and 2\u2032,3\u2032-O-(2,4,6-Trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate. It is understood that these compositions and others come as salts, such as lithium, or sodium salts, as well as, for example, triethylammonium salts, and that they can also be formulated in appropriate pharmaceutical salts.","2. Nucleic Acid Synthesis","For example, the nucleic acids, such as, the oligonucleotides to be used as primers can be made using standard chemical synthesis methods or can be produced using enzymatic methods or any other known method. Such methods can range from standard enzymatic digestion followed by nucleotide fragment isolation (see for example, Sambrook et al., 2nd Edition (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989) Chapters 5, 6) to purely synthetic methods, for example, by the cyanoethyl phosphoramidite method using a Milligen or Beckman System 1Plus DNA synthesizer (for example, Model 8700 automated synthesizer of Milligen-Biosearch, Burlington, Mass. or ABI Model 380B). Synthetic methods useful for making oligonucleotides are also described by Ikuta et al., 53:323-356 (1984), (phosphotriester and phosphite-triester methods), and Narang et al., 65:610-620 (1980), (phosphotriester method). Protein nucleic acid molecules can be made using known methods such as those described by Nielsen et al., 5:3-7 (1994).","1. Methods of Using the Compositions as Research Tools","The disclosed compositions can be used in a variety of ways as research tools. For example, the disclosed compositions, such as ATP and analogs, can be used to study the signal transduction pathways related to olfactory signaling.","The disclosed compositions can be used as discussed herein as either reagents in micro arrays or as reagents to probe or analyze existing microarrays. The compositions can also be used in any known method of screening assays, related to chip\/micro arrays. The compositions can also be used in any known way of using the computer readable embodiments of the disclosed compositions, for example, to study relatedness or to perform molecular modeling analysis related to the disclosed compositions.","a) Screening Assays","Provided are methods of screening for an agonist or an antagonist of purinergic receptor of the olfactory system, comprising contacting a purinergic receptor with a test compound; detecting intracellular calcium levels; and screening for a change in calcium levels as compared to a control level, a change indicating the compound is an agonist or an antagonist of the olfactory system.","Screening optionally takes place in multi-well plates. Multi-well plates are standard in the art and come in a variety of sizes and shapes. For example, the multi-well plate can be 24, 48, or 96 well plates. Such screening assays can be automated or further modified for high throughput analysis. For high throughput screening, each well can include numerous test components. If a positive reaction is detected in a well, the screening is repeated with one of the test compounds contained in a single well.","An \u201celevation in calcium\u201d is defined as an increase in calcium levels greater than 1 nM above basal levels. The change in calcium levels can be between 5 nM and 10 nM, for example. The elevation in calcium can also be greater than 100 nM above basal levels. A \u201ctransient reduction in calcium\u201d is defined as decrease in calcium levels greater than 1 nM below basal levels. The reduction in calcium can also be greater than 100 nM below basal levels.","The time defined as \u201ctransient\u201d means not permanent. Thus, transient can be less than 10 seconds, less than 30 seconds, less than 1 minute, less than 5 minutes, less than 10 minutes, or less than 20 minutes, for example.","The term \u201csustained\u201d means that the effect continues for a period of time. For example, sustained can be greater than 1 minute, greater than 5 minutes, greater than 10 minutes, greater than an hour, greater than 24 hours, or greater than 1 year.","Also disclosed is a method of screening for an agonist or an antagonist of a purinergic receptor of the olfactory system, comprising contacting a first purinergic receptor expressing cell with a set of test compounds; detecting calcium levels in the first purinergic receptor cell; and selecting each compound in the set that contacted the first purinergic receptor cell, wherein the first purinergic receptor cell showed a transient change in calcium as compared to a control level, indicating the compound is an agonist or an antagonist of a purinergic receptor of the olfactory system. The method can further comprise the steps of contacting a second purinergic receptor cell with one test compound selected above, and detecting calcium levels in the second purinergic receptor cell, wherein a transient change in calcium as compared to a control level indicates the compound is an agonist or an antagonist of a purinergic receptor of the olfactory system.","Also disclosed is a method of screening for an agonist or an antagonist of a purinergic receptor of the olfactory system, comprising contacting a test compound with a cell that expresses a heterologous nucleic acid that encodes a purinergic receptor; and detecting calcium levels in the cell; a transient change in calcium as compared to a control level, indicating an agonist or an antagonist of a purinergic receptor of the olfactory system.","Also contemplated are agents identified by the screening methods described herein, as well as methods of making those agents. An example of a method of making an agent includes identifying the agent using the methods provided herein, and manufacturing the agent or manufacturing the agent in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","Preferably, the cell is a cell that lacks the receptor prior to introduction of the heterologous nucleic acid. The cell can be transiently transfected with the heterologous nucleic acid or a stable cell line containing the expressed receptor can be made using standard techniques in the art. By \u201cheterologous nucleic acid\u201d is meant that any heterologous or exogenous nucleic acid can be inserted into a vector for transfer into a cell, tissue or organism. The nucleic acid can encode a polypeptide or protein or an antisense RNA, for example. The nucleic acid can be functionally linked to a promoter. By \u201cfunctionally linked\u201d is meant such that the promoter can promote expression of the heterologous nucleic acid, as is known in the art, such as appropriate orientation of the promoter relative to the heterologous nucleic acid. Furthermore, the heterologous nucleic acid preferably has all appropriate sequences for expression of the nucleic acid, as known in the art, to functionally encode, i.e., allow the nucleic acid to be expressed. The nucleic acid can include, for example, expression control sequences, such as an enhancer, and necessary information processing sites, such as ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites, and transcriptional terminator sequences.","Calcium levels and changes in calcium levels can be detected using a calcium indicator such as the cell-permeable methyl ester form of Fura-2, which is Fura-2\/AM. In another example, a fluorescence plate reader is used that detects a single wavelength, such as Ca indicator dyes Fluo 3, Fluo 4 AM, Quin 2, Indo-1 and Indo-4.","Optionally, the compound being screened can augment the effects of other compounds such as ATP, for example. In this case, the compound being screened can be tested in the presence of another compound that stimulates the purinergic receptor. For example, the purinergic receptor expressing cell can be in a solution containing an effective amount of ATP. An \u201ceffective amount of ATP\u201d is defined as about 300 nM to about 1 mM of ATP.","Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers (e.g., amounts, temperature, etc.), but some errors and deviations should be accounted for. Unless indicated otherwise, parts are parts by weight, temperature is in \u00b0 C. or is at ambient temperature, and pressure is at or near atmospheric.","a) Results","Using RT-PCR and immunohistochemical methods ionotropic P2Xand G-protein-coupled P2Yreceptor expression were found in both olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb. RT-PCR analysis revealed mRNA expression for the P2Yreceptor and two isoforms of the P2Xreceptor; P2X(Brake, A. J., et al., Nature 371, 519-523 (1994)) and P2X(Brandle et al., 1997)(). To identify the cell type and subcellular distribution of purinergic receptors in olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb, antibodies against P2X, P2X, P2Xand P2Yreceptors, and olfactory marker protein (OMP), which is found in mature olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) were used. OMP-positive ORNs showed punctate immunoreactivity (IR) to P2Xand P2Xantibodies on cell somas and axons (, C) and P2Y-IR on the dendrites, somas and axons (). Both P2X- and P2Y-IR was absent from dendritic knobs and cilia of ORNs. OMP-negative ORNs and basal cells (olfactory stem cells) showed P2X- and P2Y-IR. Sustentacular cells and Bowman's glands showed only P2Y2-IR (). In the olfactory bulb, there was P2X, P2X, P2Xand P2Yreceptor IR in the olfactory nerve layer, the glomerular layer and the mitral cell layer. There was no P2X-IR in the olfactory neuroepithelium; however, there was punctate P2X-IR on blood vessels just below the basal cells. Thus, the underlying blood vessels are the likely source of P2XmRNA identified by the RT-PCR studies of the olfactory epithelium. Preabsorption of the primary antibody with peptide antigen () or omission of the primary antibody blocked the purinergic receptor staining. Identification of regionally localized purinergic receptors in mammalian olfactory epithelium is consistent with extracellular ATP playing multiple roles in the peripheral olfactory system.","The physiological activation of purinergic receptors in cultured mouse ORNs (Vargas and Lucero, 1999a) were examined using both electrophysiology (Danaceau and Lucero, 1998)(), and calcium imaging (). ATP (10 \u03bcM) evoked inward currents in 39% (27\/69 ORNs) of the perforated-patched mouse ORNs during brief (1-10 s) applications (). Some cells exhibited a distinct, long latent period consistent with slowly activating G-protein coupled P2Y receptors (cell 1,  inset)(13\/27 cells; latency=1140\u00b1236 ms; I=\u221229\u00b18 pA). Rapid activation of inward current that closely followed the ATP stimulus profile with little or no desensitization was also observed, indicating involvement of non-desensitizing ionotropic P2X receptors [P2X4 and\/or P2X] (Ralevic and Burnstock, 1998)(, cell 2) (14\/27 cells; latency=81\u00b115 ms, I=\u2212235\u00b174 pA). These electrophysiological results support the immunohistochemical evidence of expression of both purinergic receptor subtypes in ORNs.","Extracellularly applied ATP evoked a rapid transient increase in [Ca ](, C; 76\/84 ORNs). On average, ATP (10 \u03bcM) induced a 151\u00b112% A fluorescence (F)\/F increase in [Ca](n=76; range 13-398%). Averaged dose-response relations for ATP-induced [Ca]increases in cultured mouse ORNs gave half-maximally effective concentrations (EC) of 1.6 \u03bcM (n=58), comparable to previous reports for brain P2X receptors (FIG. D)(North and Barnard, 1997; North and Surprenant, 2000; Ralevic and Burnstock, 1998). In the absence of external Ca, the ATP-induced rise in [Ca]was 31\u00b111% larger than calcium transients in the presence of Ca, although in a few ORNs (3\/19), the ATP-evoked increases were smaller, but never absent, in Ca -free solution (). The increase in fluorescence intensity in the absence of Ca indicates that (1) part of the signal results from release from intracellular Ca stores, implicating P2Y receptor activation, and (2) Ca can reduce the concentration of free ATP or modulate the purinergic receptor (Honore et al., 1989; North and Surprenant, 2000). Thus, electrophysiology and Ca imaging show that purinergic receptors are functional in primary cultures of mouse ORNs.","To study the effects of ATP on odor responses, acutely prepared slices of mouse olfactory epithelium were used. Confocal imaging of fluo-4 AM-loaded olfactory epithelium slices allows simultaneous recording from identified structures within the olfactory epithelium, i.e., both ORNs and sustentacular cells. Reproducible odor-evoked calcium transients were obtained when imaging ORNs >100 \u03bcM below the surface of the slice (FIGS. A-A). Odor-evoked calcium transients rapidly activated and returned to basal levels within 125.7\u00b111.1 s (, n=11 ORNs). Superfusion of ATP (10 \u03bcM) onto this slice evoked calcium transients from all 11 ORNs previously identified by their response to odors, although the responses to ATP (FIGS. B-B) are less obvious than the odor responses (FIG. B). The difference in robustness can be due to poor access to the ATP stimulus: odorant receptors are on the cilia of the ORNs, which extend beyond the outer edge of the olfactory epithelium, whereas purinergic receptors are located deeper within the olfactory epithelium. ATP also evoked calcium transients from sustentacular cells, identified by their location, morphology, and lack of response to odor (FIG. B). The latency of activation for the ATP-evoked calcium transient was shorter in the ORN (FIG. B, solid up arrowhead) than in sustentacular cells (FIG. B, open down arrowhead). Collectively, this was consistent with ORNs expressing the faster P2X receptors, and the sustentacular cells expressing the slower G-protein coupled P2Y receptors.","To further test whether functional purinergic receptor subtypes are differentially expressed in olfactory epithelium cell types, purinergic receptor agonists were used. As there are no completely specific purinergic receptor agonists (Ralevic and Burnstock, 1998), the selectivity was determined as discussed herein. The P2X \u2018selective\u2019 agonist \u03b2\u03b3-methylene ATP was superfused onto the slice (). Only the ORNs, and not the sustentacular cells, responded to \u03b2\u03b3-methylene ATP with an increase in [Ca](FIG. C). The P2Y \u2018selective\u2019 agonist UTP evoked calcium transients in both ORNs and sustentacular cells (). However, compared to the non-selective agonist ATP, the peak amplitudes were smaller in the ORNs and the latency of activation in the ORNs was longer and equivalent to the latency of activation in the sustentacular cells (compare FIGS. D, to B,). These data indicated that the ORN expressed P2X and, to a lesser extent, P2Y receptors, and that the sustentacular cells expressed only P2Y receptors. It further confirms the immunohistochemical and electrophysiological evidence for differential expression of purinergic receptors in mammalian olfactory epithelium.","A variety of non-selective purinergic receptor agonists (ATP, ATP\u03b3S, AMP), P2Y-\u2018selective\u2019 agonists (UTP, ADP, MeS-ADP), P2X-\u2018selective\u2019 agonists (\u03b2\u03b3-methylene ATP)(, B), and an adenosine receptor \u2018selective\u2019 agonist (adenosine) were superfused onto olfactory epithelial slices and the change in [Ca]was measured. Adenosine- or AMP-evoked calcium transients were never observed. ORNs responded with approximately equal frequency to P2Y and P2X receptor agonists whereas sustentacular cells responded primarily to P2Y receptor agonists. The general non-specific purinergic receptor antagonists Suramin and pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2\u2032,4\u2032-disulfonic acid (PPADS) were used to further confirm that purinergic-evoked calcium transients were mediated via purinergic receptors. In ORNs previously shown to respond to both ATP and UTP, Suramin (100 \u03bcM) reversibly blocked both ATP- and UTP-evoked calcium transients by 88\u00b12 and 72\u00b16% (n=9). PPADS (25 \u03bcm) also reversibly blocked the ATP- and UTP-evoked calcium transients by 87\u00b15 and 92\u00b13% (n=5). Purinergic receptor antagonists also reversibly blocked purinergic nucleotide-evoked calcium transients in sustentacular cells. Suramin blocked ATP- and UTP-evoked Ca transients by 90\u00b11 and 89\u00b11% (n=37) and PPADS blocked the transients by 82\u00b12 and 76\u00b12%, respectively (n=30). Collectively, the data show that the ATP-evoked calcium transients were mediated by P2X and P2Y receptors.","Calcium is an important intracellular messenger during odor transduction affecting signal amplification (Lowe and Gold, 1993) and adaptation (Zufall et al., 1991). The data indicate that purinergic nucleotides evoke robust increases in intracellular calcium. Odors were sequentially superfused, ATP and the combination of odors and ATP onto olfactory epithelium slice preparation. It was found that ATP could (1) have no effect, (2) cause suppression (), where the calcium transient evoked by co-application is less than the sum of the calcium transients evoked by the individual components, or (3) cause enhancement (), in which the calcium transient due to co-application is larger than the sum of the individual components.","The increases in Ca elicited from co-application of ATP and odor from two cells (, B) have been expressed as a proportion of the sum of the individual responses (). Of the cells that responded to odor, 62% exhibited a significant decrease in the summed [Ca]increase (mean suppression=57\u00b15%; paired t-test, p=0.01, n=26). The observed decrease due to co-application was not the result of run-down because post-co-application responses both to ATP and to odors were +10% of pre-co-application (). Of the odor-responsive ORNs, only two exhibited a >20% increase in evoked [Ca]increase (mean enhancement=157\u00b134%), indicating a combined effect. Thus, ATP significantly reduced odor-induced calcium responses in the majority of ORNs.","The observation of both suppressive and combined responses indicates that ATP can modulate odor responses via activation of different purinergic receptor subtypes. This hypothesis was tested by sequentially superfusing odors, various selective purinergic receptor agonists and the combination of odors and purinergic receptor agonists onto the olfactory epithelium slice preparation. We found that co-application of the P2X agonist \u03b2\u03b3-methylene ATP (10 \u03bcM) and odor (1) enhanced the calcium transient amplitude by 168\u00b144% (2\/16 cells; ), (2) had no effect on amplitude (15\u00b11%; 2\/16 cells; data not shown), or (3) suppressed the amplitude of Ca transient by 42\u00b15% (2\/16 cells; ). Overall, there is a statistically significant 25\u00b111% reduction in the average amplitude of the Ca transient by co-application of odors and \u03b2\u03b3-methylene ATP (16\/16 cells; p<0.04, paired Student's t-test), even when including the 2 cells that did not show a significant change and the 2 cells that had an enhanced response. In contrast, co-application of the P2Y agonist ADP\u03b2S (100 \u03bcM) and odor suppressed the Ca transient amplitude by 41\u00b14% (15\/15 cells; p<0.001, paired Student's t-test; ). Thus, the P2Y agonist ADP\u03b2S reduced the odor responsiveness of ORNs in all cells tested. In contrast, \u03b2\u03b3-methylene ATP, like ATP, enhanced the odor responsiveness due to the activation of P2X receptors in a few cells. However, in the majority of ORNs, the P2X specific agonist significantly reduced odor-induced Ca transients.","Disclosed herein, purinergic receptor subtypes are differentially expressed in ORNs and sustentacular cells, and ORNs express multiple purinergic receptor subtypes. In other cell types, expression of more than one type of purinergic receptor allows for regulation of multiple effectors and modification of agonist-evoked responses, and provides a mechanism for rapid and local fine tuning at the cellular level (Ralevic and Burnstock, 1998). Disclosed immunohistochemical studies showed a notable absence of purinergic receptors in the dendritic knobs and cilia, the site of odor transduction, whereas both P2X and P2Y receptors are located on cell somas and other regions. This indicates that purinergic receptor activation is unlikely to affect initial odor-induced receptor potentials, but can shape the final integrated output of the cell. Extracellular purine nucleotides have been reported to exert multiple trophic actions in the central nervous system (Neary et al., 1996). Because the olfactory neuroepithelium is constantly exposed to airborne pollutants and microbes, it continuously regenerates; different populations of neurons are in various stages of development, including birth, maturation, and programmed cell death or apoptosis (Graziadei and Monti-Graziadei, 1978). Thus, ATP released by acutely injured cells could act as an early signal of cell and tissue damage, and, due to the mitogenic and growth-promoting effects of purinergic receptor activation, stimulate regeneration. Growth promotion can be mediated by P2Y receptors, which, like other growth factor receptors, induce a cascade of intracellular events that trigger cell proliferation (Neary et al., 1996).","A longstanding dogma, that odor sensitivity is not modulated at the level of the olfactory epithelium, is based on anatomical studies showing absence of efferent synapses on ORNs (Getchell, 1986; Graziadei, 1971). A recent study showing release of ATP in the olfactory epithelium following noxious stimuli (Kilgour et al., 2000) provides a physiological source for a neuromodulatory substance that does not require efferent innervation.","b) Experimental Procedures","Total RNA was isolated from rat olfactory epithelium using Trizol (GIBCO BRL). Polyadenylated mRNA was selected using a cellulose oligo(dT) matrix (QuickPrep\u00ae Micro mRNA purification kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). First-strand cDNA was prepared from 40 ng mRNA using SuperScript\u2122 II RNase H-RT according to GIBCO BRL procedures. A control reaction omitting the reverse transcriptase was included to confirm absence of genomic contamination. First strand cDNA was amplified using Platinum\u00aeTaq DNA polymerase (Gibco BRL). Primers for detection of P2Xtranscripts were 756-775 sense and 1537-1558 antisense oligonucleotides (accession #U14414)(Brake et al., 1994), primers for P2Ytranscripts were 1288-1307 sense and 1931-1950 antisense oligonucleotides (accession #U09402), primers for \u03b2-actin transcripts (Lopez-Candales et al., 1995) were 1038-1067 sense and 1875-1905 antisense oligonucleotides and primers for neuron specific enolase were 348-368 sense and 1101-1123 antisense oligonucleotides (accession #M11931). All the primer pairs (100 \u03bcM) were used with a 30-cycle profile performed as follows: 94\u00b0 C. denaturation (2 min), 96\u00b0 C. denaturation (45 s), 60\u00b0 C. annealing (1 min) and 72\u00b0 C. extension (1.5 min). PCR products were separated and visualized using ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels (1%). A semi-nested PCR protocol was used for detection of the P2Xreceptor transcript. PCR products were excised from the gel and reamplified for 28 cycles using the same antisense primer and a sense primer corresponding to position 1059-1078. PCR products were sequenced at the University of Utah Sequencing Center.","All animal procedures were approved by the University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Commnittee, and all applicable guidelines from the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals were followed. Olfactory epithelium from post-natal day 4 mice was dissected and post-fixed for 2 hours and then cryoprotected, oriented in Tissue Tek OCT and quickly frozen. Cryostat sections (14 \u03bcm) were permeabilized with 0.3% triton X-100 in PBS, blocked with 10% normal donkey serum. Double-labeling was performed by simultaneously incubating slices in goat anti-OMP (1:10K; generous gift from F. Margolis) and either rabbit anti-P2X, P2X, P2X, P2Y(all 1:100; Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel), or P2X(3 mg\/ml; Oncogene Research Products, Boston, Mass.) overnight followed by a 30 min. incubation in TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-goat immunoglobin secondary antibody plus FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobin secondary antibody (1:100)(both from Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, West Grove, Pa.). For pre-absorption controls, P2 antibodies were incubated with a saturating amount of peptide immunogen (10\u00d7) for 1-2 hours and visualized as above.","To prepare olfactory epithelium slices, neonatal mice (postnatal day 0-6) were quickly decapitated, and the skin and lower jaw were removed. Tissue was mounted in ice cold Ringers onto a vibratome-cutting block and 300 \u03bcm slices were made. Primary cultures of mouse ORNs were made using the same protocol and culture conditions as described for rat olfactory receptor neurons (Vargas and Lucero, 1999a). Briefly, tissue was placed in divalent cation-free Ringers containing 10 mg\/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mg\/ml deoxyribonuclease II and 44 U\/ml dispase, incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 45 min. The tissue was washed, triturated, and filtered through a 53 mm mesh and 200 ml cells were plated onto concanavalin A-coated coverslips and allowed to settle for 20 min. An additional 1.5 ml of culture medium was added (DMEM supplemented with 100 mM ascorbic acid, 1X insulin-transferrin-seleniumX (GIBCO BRL), 2 mM glutamine, 100 U\/ml penicillin G and 100 mg\/ml streptomycin).","The nystatin perforated-patch technique (Horn and Marty, 1988) was used to examine cells under voltage-clamp. Electrodes (2-5 M\u03a9) were filled with TMA-oxide internal solution (in mM: 62.5 TMA oxide, 62.5 KHPO, 15 KCl, 5 MgCl, 11 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 1 glutathione, 5 TEA, 0.03% pluronic acid F-127, 0.3% DMSO, 150 mg\/ml nystatin, pH 7.2, 330 mOsm).","Electro-olfactogram and on-cell recordings: Slices of P0-P6 mouse OE were prepared as described above and mounted in a perfusion chamber with a bath flow of 3 min\/min. Test chemicals were introduced using a rotary injection valve (Rheodyne, Cotati, Calif.). The electro-olfactogram (EOG) recording electrode (3 M NaCl in 1% agar; tip diameter, 5-10 um) was positioned along the dorsal portion of the nasal septum. The differential electrode (identical to the recording electrode) was positioned over skull cartilage and an Ag\/AgClground electrode was connected to the bath solution via a 3 M KCl agar bridge. Responses to test agents were amplified (5000\u00d7 gain) and filtered (2 kHz) by a low-noise differential DC amplifier. Data was digitized (100 Hz) using Axoscope 8.0 software (Axon Instruments).","For the noninvasive on-cell recordings (Chiu et al., 1997), the same electronics were used as described for nystatin-patch experiments. The recording electrode (5-8 M_resistance) contained Ringer's solution. Test solutions were selected using a rotary valve and delivered for 30 sec using gravity flow. The time course of solution delivery was determined by placing an electrode in a slice and switching from Ringer's solution to distilled water. There was a 3 sec delay to initial electrical response, which peaked at 10 sec. The shaded region in  shows the 30 sec window of when the valve was switched on and off. During a recording, the electrode was lowered into the dorsal septal region of the slice and a seal (0.5-1 Gohms) was made in voltage-clamp before switching to currentclamp with zero applied current. Only cells with a stable baseline were used. There was a 7 min wash between each test application. Experiments were conducted on 65 cells in 42 slices obtained from 14 P0-P6 mice from three litters. Only three cells survived long enough to complete the recovery portion of the >27 min protocol.","[Ca]was determined using confocal imaging of fluo-4 AM (18 \u03bcM; Molecular Probes) loaded cells and slices. Cells or slices were placed in a laminar flow chamber (Warner Instruments) and perfused continuously with Ringers solution at a flow rate of 1.5-2.0 ml\/min. Ringers contained (mM): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl, 2 CaCl, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 500 probenicid and 400 nM tetrodotoxin. Test solutions were applied using bath exchange and a small volume loop injector (200 \u03bcl). A Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning system was used for data collection and analysis. Time series experiments were performed collecting 1400\u00d7700 pixel images at 0.2-0.4 Hz. The fluorometric signals obtained are expressed as relative fluorescence change, \u0394F\/F\u2550(F\u2212F0)\/F, where Fis the basal fluorescence level. Increases in F greater than 10% above baseline noise were considered responses.","If the predominate role of endogenous ATP is to reduce odor sensitivity then addition of purinergic receptor antagonists should potentiate odor responses. Control experiments in which we applied odors at 5-8 min intervals revealed a small linear increase in the peak amplitude of the odor-induced Ca transient ( & C). A linear regression between the first and last odor application was performed and the predicted amplitude of the middle response was calculated. Based on linear regressions, the actual amplitude of the middle odor application was not significantly different from the predicted amplitude, both in the single cell shown in  and in the average of 30 cells in  (n=30; \u22123\u00b14% difference; paired Student's t-test, p=0.47). In contrast, when the middle odor application was preceded by and concomitant with perfusion of purinergic receptor antagonists (100 \u03bcM suramin+25 \u03bcM PPADS), a significant increase in the Ca transient amplitude such that the mean observed response was 14\u00b15% larger than the predicted (n=22; paired Student's t-test, p=0.024). The differences between predicted and observed were statistically different when the control group was compared to the purinergic receptor agonist-treated group (independent Students t-test, p=0.012). Application of purinergic receptor antagonists alone did not evoke calcium transients ( second trace). The elevated odor-evoked calcium transients would be expected if basal extracellular ATP were habitually reducing ORN sensitivity. Thus, the data shows that both endogenous and exogenous ATP reduces the amplitude of odor-evoked calcium transients through purinergic receptors, suggesting that ATP modulates ORN sensitivity.","Odor activation of G-protein-coupled receptors results in increased cAMP production, opening of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, influx of Ca and Na, depolarization of the membrane, and activation of voltage- and Ca-gated ion channels (Schild and Restrepo, 1998). Based on calcium imaging data, purinergics can reduce the odor-evoked electrical activity of ORNs. Recording odor-evoked membrane responses from single ORNs has a low probability of success because each ORN expresses only one or a few odorant receptors (Buck and Axel, 1991). Thus, a mixture of cyclic nucleotide modulators were used to record membrane responses: IBMX (100 \u03bcM), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that prevents the breakdown of cAMP, CPT-cAMP (50 M), and 8-Br-cGMP (50 \u03bcM), both membrane-permeant analogs of cAMP and cGMP, respectively. This cyclic nucleotide mixture was tested initially to verify that it evoked membrane potential changes in the OE slice preparation. The EOG measures field potential changes across the OE after stimulation. Similar EOG responses were obtained from both odor (10 \u03bcM) and the cyclic nucleotide mixture (), validating the replacement of odor with the mixture in subsequent recordings. Next on-cell current-clamp recordings of ORNs were performed from neonatal mouse slices. The cyclic nucleotide mixture, the mixture+ATP, a second application of the mixture, and ATP was sequentially superfused onto a slice preparation and membrane potential changes were measured (). The coapplication of ATP and the cyclic nucleotide mixture suppressed the cyclic nucleotide-induced electrical responses. The membrane response from each ORN was integrated from baseline and normalized to the initial cyclic nucleotide mixture response. The presence of ATP reduced the electrical activity of the ORN by 67\u00b12% (FIG. C)(n=3 cells; p<0.01, Newman-Keuls post hoc test). These data show that ATP modulates odor sensitivity in mammalian olfactory neurons.","G. Sequences","1.
