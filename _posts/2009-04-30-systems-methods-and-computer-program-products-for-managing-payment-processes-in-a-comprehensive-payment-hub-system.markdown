{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO CO-PENDING APPLICATION FOR PATENT","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/370,943, entitled, \u201cSystems, Methods and Computer Program Products for Optimizing Routing of Financial Payments,\u201d filed on Feb. 13, 2009, assigned to the assignee of the present application, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","In general, embodiments herein disclosed relate to systems, methods, and computer program products for managing the processing of financial payments and, more specifically, dynamically choosing and arranging the payment process in a comprehensive payment hub environment.","Currently, in the United States market, financial payment processing follows traditional product based routing. This means that payment is destined for a specific product silo prior to being received by a financial institution. Silo payment processing occurs prior to image capture and involves a series of linearly processed steps, in which the form of the received payment input is, in many instances, the same as the payment remittance\/settlement. For example, if the payment is inputted electronically, the product silo outputs payment, in many instances, electronically. Thus, each payment type, such as paper, image, electronic, wire, Automated Clearing House (ACH) and the like, has its own product silo and the channel, and thus silo, is chosen prior to transaction submission. These individual product silos are not fully integrated and as such, operate autonomously as separate systems. In this regard, specific product silos require specific logic processing and processing hardware based on which payment type\/product the silo is set-up to accommodate.","International payment systems differ somewhat in that the payments are destined for low value channels or high value channels but, similar to Unites States payment processing, payments are pre-dispositioned prior to transmission.","Neither domestic nor international payment systems account for the customer\/payor and, in some instances, the payment-processing financial institution, in terms of cost efficiency, timeliness of payment or other payment factors. For example, while a customer may be unconcerned with how a payment is routed, they are typically concerned with the speed of which the payment is received by the payee. In most instances, the customer\/payor will desire payment to be received by the payee as soon as possible, however, in some instances the payor may desire a lag-time in payment receipt by the payor to insure that sufficient funds exist in the designated payment account. In addition to timeliness, the customer\/payor may be concerned with the quality or risk of the payment transaction, i.e., insuring that the payment is made at the designated time and destination and\/or the costs incurred by the customer\/payor in making the payment. From the financial institution standpoint, the financial institution is concerned with making the payment in the most cost-efficient manner, so to maximize their profitability, while taking into account the customer's needs in terms of timeliness and payment risk.","Therefore, a need exists to develop systems, method, computer program products and the like for processing financial payments more effectively and cost efficiently. The desired systems, methods, computer program products and the like should allow for processing all types of payment requests in a comprehensive payment processing system. Additionally, the desired systems, methods and computer program products should process payment requests in a highly efficient manner that cost effective to both the financial institution and the customer (i.e., payor and\/or payee). Additionally, the desired systems, methods, computer program products and the like should allow for customers\/payors to either predefine payment configuration or dynamically define payment configuration on a per-payment or per-payment file basis, so as to address the needs of the customer\/payor in terms of payment timeliness, payment cost, payment quality and the like. In addition, desired systems, methods, computer program products and the like should allow for financial institution to make payment routing decisions that not only take into account the customer's\/payor's needs and concerns, but also take into account the financial institutions concern of minimizing the costs related to each transaction. Moreover, by providing for methods, computer program products and the like that allow the customer\/payor greater options in predetermined payment configuration and\/or dynamically configuring payment on a per-payment basis, the financial institution can implement different price points in the payment process.","The following presents a simplified summary of one or more embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of such embodiments. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated embodiments, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all embodiments nor delineate the scope of any or all embodiments. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","Methods, devices, systems and computer program products are described herein that provide for managing the processing of a payment and, more specifically managing the processing of a payment in a comprehensive payment hub environment that provides for payment processing irrespective of the payment input channel.

The arrangement, as described herein, may otherwise be the configuration, flow or order of the payment processes. Thus, the payment processes may be arranged to occur serially, in parallel or in any combination of serial and parallel processing. The determination of the payment processes and the arrangement of the processes may be dynamically determined on a per-payment request basis based on payment input channel, payment\/clearing type and\/or payment attributes, such payor-defined attributes, payee-defined attributes and\/or financial institution defined attributes. The dynamic nature of the determination of the payment processes and the arrangement allows for the payment processes to change, either by addition or deletion of payment processes or the arrangement to change during the processing of a payment based on the outcome of a preceding process or an attribute defined while payment processing is ongoing.

Thus, memory  may include, or the payment module may be in communication with another auxiliary device's memory (not shown in ) that includes, payor-profile database , payee-profile database  and\/or financial institution\/bank database  operable for storing payment attributes\/criteria. Thus, payor-profile database  may include a plurality of payor\/customer profiles  and each profile  includes payment attributes\/criteria  associated with the payor. Payee-profile database  may include a plurality of payee profiles  and each profile  includes payment attributes\/criteria  associated with the payee. The financial institution\/bank database  may include payment attributes\/criteria  associated with an input payment request type or any other relevant association.","As previously noted, the payment routing determination sub-module  may determine any appropriate payment route  type from among more than one alternative. The payment route\/type may include check\/paper , credit\/debit card , electronic\/ACH , wire , SWIFT , merchant , account transfer  or ant other  remittance\/settlement payment route\/type. An alternative payment route comprises two or more of the payment route-types. For example, check\/paper  or credit\/debit  comprises one alternative payment route, SWIFT  or account transfer  comprises another alternative payment route and wire  or SWIFT  or merchant  comprises another alternative payment route.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["400","410","500","500","500","510","530","510","530"]},"The customer payment input channels are user interface's and may include, but are not limited to, Open Financial Exchange(OFX)\/Mobile payment input channel , generally operable on handheld devices and the like; web-based payment input channel , such as the Internet or a corporate website that is generally operable to receive Automated Clearing House (ACH) requests, wire payment requests, bill payment and the like; telephone\/Interactive Voice Response (IVR) payment input channel ; banking center payment input channel (in person) ; and Automated Teller Machine (ATM) payment input channel .","The business\/front end input channels  include, but are not limited to, point-of-sale payment input channel , such as credit\/debit card swipe or the like; image exchange payment input channel ; remote deposit payment input channel ; bulk file messaging payment input channel ; and straight back office integration input channel , in which a business application directly calls\/accesses a financial institution payment engine to originate a transaction.","Referring again to the method  of , at Event , payment arrangement attributes\/criteria are established. The payment arrangement attributes\/criteria are configurable data that is associated with a consumer payor\/payee or a corporate payor\/payee and is subsequently used by the payment processing hub to process various aspects of the payment request.  provides a block diagram of various examples of payment arrangement criteria\/attribute sources . The sources  may include, but are not limited to, payee profile\/set-up . Payee profile\/set-up  may be a dynamic set-up for a specific payment that the payee is to receive. For example, the payee receives notification that a payment is forthcoming and through an appropriate designated channel, such as a website or the like, the payee configures payment attributes\/criteria, such as the time requirements for the payment or the like. Alternatively, the payee may have a predetermined payment profile, which may be stored in an accessible payee profile database that predefines payment attributes\/criteria.","The payment arrangement criteria\/attribute sources  may additionally include invoicing and payment statements  issued by the payor and\/or payee that define payment arrangement attributes\/criteria for a specific payment or a series of payments, such as payment risk\/quality, payment destination and the like. Sources  may additionally include payment alerts and\/or payment notifications  that are generally associated with a specific payment or a series of payments and define payment arrangement criteria specifically designated by the payor, the payee or the financial institution handing the payment transaction.","The payment arrangement criteria\/attribute sources  may include payor profile\/set-up . Payor profile\/set-up  may be a dynamic set-up for a specific payment that the payor has requested. Alternatively, the payor may have a predetermined payment profile, which may be stored in an accessible payor profile database that predefines payment attributes\/criteria.","Referring again to the method  of , at Event , the payment request is transformed, otherwise referred to as normalized, to a standard format to allow for processing of all different payments regardless of input channels. As previously noted, according to specific embodiments, the standardized format may be in accordance with ISO 20022 Universal Financial Industry Message Scheme format. In conventional, known payment processing each payment input channel requires a dedicated silo for processing the payment. In accordance with present embodiments, transformation to a standard format allows for comprehensive payment processing to occur generically regardless of the type of payment input channel.","At Event , payment processing occurs at what is referred to herein as the payment processing module or payment hub. Based on the transformation\/normalization of the payment request, the payment hub is capable of processing all types of payment input requests. It should be noted that while the events (Events ,  and ) shown in payment processing block occur in sequential order, according to present embodiments, the events may occur in any sequential or serially order, as determined by the payment hub, in order to optimize the payment process.","It should be noted that the routines, modules, applications and functions shown in relation to Event  and described herein as occurring in the payment engine may be accessed and implemented by other applications, such as other payment processing applications that do not implement the payment engine or the like. In this regard, other applications may access the specific routines, modules, applications and functions on an as-needed basis. For example, if another payment processing application requires payment validation in the form of compliance to anti-money laundering laws, the application can access and implement that specific portion of the payment hub as opposed to implementing the multiple applications in the payment hub or the payment hub in its entirety.","Payment processing may include, at Event , receiving the payment instructions, such as payment attributes\/criteria, invoicing\/statements, alerts, notifications and the like, which are used to make payment processing decisions.","At Event , payment processes and arrangement are determined. As previously noted, payment processes and arrangement may be based on payment input channel, payment type and\/or payment attributes. The payment attributes may be payee-defined attributes, payor-defined attributes and\/or financial institution-defined attributes. The attributes may be pre-defined attributes associated with a payee or payor profile or the attributes may be dynamic attributes defined during or in close proximity to the payment process. It should be noted that in instances in which the payment processes and arrangement are based, at least in part, on payment type, the determination of payment routing (Event ) may precede the determination of subsequent payment processes and the arrangement of subsequent payment processes. In this regard and as previously noted, the determination of payment processes and the arrangement of payment processes are not limited to occurring at the onset of payment processing within the payment hub, but, instead, may occur at any stage or point in time within the process.","At Event , specific payment processing occurs within one or sub-modules based on the payment type being made.  is a block diagram detailing various exemplary specific payment process sub-module  that may be implemented at the payment hub, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. It should be noted that the specific payment process sub-modules  highlighted in  are by way of example only and are not intended to be limiting. In addition, the ordering of the payment processing may be determined at the payment hub, in some embodiments on a per-payment basis, to increase the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the payment processing model.","Specific payment process sub-modules  may include scheduled and recurring payment sub-module . The scheduled and recurring payment sub-module  manages the initiation of future dated and recurring payments, including the use of predefined custom templates set-up for the scheduled\/recurring payments. Additionally, specific payment process sub-modules  may include debit\/credit correlation sub-module  that includes timing and sequencing processing to insure the relationship of the original payment association. In this regard, individual credits are associated and balanced to original debit when processed at a payment item level.","The specific payment process sub-modules  may also include verification sub-module  operable to verify the payment and associated account attributes to insure positive clearing of the payment. Additionally, specific payment process sub-modules  may include bulk payment sub-module  that is operable to aggregate and optimize communications to external systems for large payment files having multiple individual payment items with multiple payment items having the same posting accounts. Also, specific payment process sub-module  may include payment warehouse\/database  that is operable to store future dated payments, payment history, recurring payment models and the like.","Referring again to the method  of , at optional Event , based on an outcome of payment process conducted at Event , payment processing adjustments may be made that may include adding or deleting a payment process or modifying\/re-arranging the order or flow of the payment processes.","Payment processing (Event ) may also include validation processing  of the payment.  is a block diagram detailing various exemplary validation process sub-modules  that may be implemented at the payment hub, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. It should be noted that the specific validation process sub-modules  highlighted in  are by way of example only and are not intended to be limiting. In addition, the ordering of the validation processing may be determined at the payment hub, in some embodiments on a per-payment basis, to increase the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the payment processing model.","Validation process sub-modules  may include compliance process sub-module  operable to insure anti-money laundering of the payment. Compliance processing may include a security check of Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) listing of known individuals, corporations or the like associated with illegal payment processing. Additionally, validation process sub-modules  may include foreign exchange\/Single European Payments Area (SEPA) sub-module  operable to maximize foreign currency exchange rates, provide for multi-currency support and insure compliance with SEPA rules and regulations.","In addition, validation process sub-modules  may include financial risk assessment sub-module  operable to provide credit and risk management for the overall payment process. In this regard, the financial risk assessment process may provide for liability risk assessment scores and the like that are subsequently used by the rules-based routing determination to limit or mandate the type of remittance\/settlement route that may be implemented. For example, if the financial risk is determined to be high, route determination may exclude wire payments as a remittance\/settlement payment option.","Also, validation process sub-modules  may include exception handling sub-module  operable to provide centralized exception processing and management of all payment types. Exception processing takes into account errors in the payment processing, such as formatting error or the like and may implement an auto repair for common exceptions\/errors. Auto repair of exceptions provides for less need for manual intervention and improves straight-through payment processing rates.","Referring again to the method  of , at optional Event , based on an outcome of payment process conducted at Event , payment processing adjustments may be made that may include adding or deleting a payment process or modifying\/re-arranging the order or flow of the payment processes.","Payment processing (Event ) may also include rules-based route determination processing .  provides a block diagram of exemplary routing rules  that may be implemented in a payment route determination process, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The routing rules illustrated are by way of example only. It should be noted that for any one route determination process one or more of the routing rules may be applied. Priority given to one or more of the rules may be based on payor profile data, payee profile data, notifications, alerts, financial institution rules, and the like. The routing rules  may be related to payment routing factors such as, but not limited to, price\/cost of processing payment, time requirements for processing the payment, the quality\/risk requirements or allowances for processing the payment (i.e., the guarantee of remittance and settlement, the ability to stop payment and the like), the destination of the payment and the like. Thus, the routing rules  may include one or more time-related rules , cost\/price-related routing rules , one or more risk\/quality-related routing rules , one or more destination-related routing rules  or other payor\/payee defined routing rules .","As previously noted, time-related routing rules  may define which remittance\/settlement type  is chosen based on the payor's, payee's and\/or the financial institution's acceptable time for completing the payment transaction. In most instances, the payor and\/or payee has a desire to complete the payment as timely as possible, while the financial institution handling the payment has a desire to delay the remittance\/settlement for as long a time period as possible. Cost\/price-related routing rules  may define which remittance\/settlement type  is chosen based on the price that the payor and\/or payee is willing to bear for the payment or the cost that the financial institution is willing to bear or likely to charge the payor for handling the payment.","Risk\/quality-related routing rules  may define which remittance\/settlement type  is chosen based on the ability to insure or guarantee that the payment will be made, in other words, the service level afforded to the payment or the number of acceptable failure opportunities associated with different payment remittance\/settlement types. Other risk\/quality routing rules  may define the ability to return or stop payment during the payment process, data reconciliation capabilities, such as how funds are balanced, or any other routing rule associated with a quality or risk attribute as defined by the payor, the payee and\/or the financial institution handling the payment process. Destination-related routing rules  may define which remittance\/settlement type  is chosen based the destination of the payment. For example, domestic payment may dictate certain types of remittance\/settlement, while international payment may dictate other types of remittance\/settlement.","Payor\/payee-defined rules  may additionally define other criteria for choosing the remittance\/settlement type. Payor\/payee-defined routing rules  may be dynamically defined proximate to the time of the payment request or may be predefined in the payor or payee profile. In most instances, payor or payee-defined routing rules will override any other routing rules.","Referring once again to the method  of , payment processing may include other processing (not shown in ) such as remittance reporting, Business Process Management (BPM) orchestration, transaction tracking\/visibility and the like. Remittance reporting provides electronic reporting of the remittance to associated services; examples of remittance reporting include, but are not limited to, Demand Deposit Account (DDA) statements, account reconciliation reporting, balance and transaction reporting and the like. BPM orchestration is operable to determine the order in which processes are taken up in the payment hub, determine and manage the delivery of information to the payment warehouse and the like. The order in which processes are taken up may be determined based on payment input channel, payment attributes\/criteria or the determined payment route. Thus, BPM orchestration provides a set of tools for efficiently aligning payment processing. Transaction\/tracking visibility allows the payor, payee or any other individual or corporate entity with designated access to view where the payment currently resides in the overall process payment flow. Transaction\/tracking visibility is typically implemented through an online user interface, such as a web-based interface or the like.","At Event , in accordance with present embodiments, the normalized and processed payment is transformed to the remittance\/settlement target clearing format. Transformation to the target clearing format is dictated by the initial normalization of the payment request to a standardized format. In addition, transformation to the target clearing format provides for payment remittance via the payment channel determined at payment route determination processing.","At Event , payment is remitted and settled according to the determined payment route.  provides a block diagram of exemplary remittance\/settlement payment channels , in accordance with embodiment of the present invention. The remittance payment channels  may include, but are not limited to, check payment , Automated Clearing House (i.e., electronic) payment , wire payment , Society for Worldwide International Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) payment , debit\/credit card payment , merchant payment , and account transfer payment  and settlement channels may include collections  or the like. Additionally, other remittance\/settlement payment channel options  may be implemented, such as to take into account future known settlement and remittance options.","Referring to  a flow diagram is illustrated of a method  for financial payment processing including determination of payment processes and arrangement in accordance with embodiment of the present invention. At Event , a financial payment transaction request is received from a payor. The payor may input the financial transaction request using any known or future known payment input channel. Examples of payment input channels include, but are not limited to, Open Financial Exchange (OFX)\/mobile, web-based, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)\/telephone, banking center, Automated Teller Machine (ATM), debit\/credit card, merchant, check, image, wire, Automated Clearing House (ACH) or the like.","At Event , a plurality of payment processes associated with the payment request are determined. The payment processes may be determined based on the payment input channel, the payment route or payment type and payment attributes. As previously noted the payment attributes may be payor-defined attributes, payee-defined attributes or financial institution-defined attributes. Additionally, the attributes may be pre-defined attributed that are stored in database or the attributes may be dynamically defined at the inception of the payment request or during the payment process.","At Event , the arrangement or order of the payment process is determined. Similar to the determination of the payment processes, the determination of the arrangement of the process may be based on the payment input channel, the payment route or payment type and payment attributes. As previously noted the payment attributes may be payor-defined attributes, payee-defined attributes or financial institution-defined attributes. Additionally, the attributes may be pre-defined attributed that are stored in database or the attributes may be dynamically defined at the inception of the payment request or during the payment process.","At Event , the determined payment processes are performed according to the determined arrangement. In one embodiment, processing occurs in a payment hub that provides for numerous payment processes to occur based on payment type. For example, payment processing may include, but is not limited to, payment route determination processing, scheduled and\/or reoccurring payment processing, debit and credit correlation processing, payment verification processing, bulk payment processing, payment compliance processing, foreign exchange processing, financial risk assessment processing, and\/or payment exception handling processing. As previously noted, modifications to the payment process and\/or arrangement may occur during the performance of the payment process based on an outcome of one or more of the payment processes.","At Event , the financial payment is provided to the payee via the determined payment route.","Thus, methods, devices, systems and computer program products have been described herein that provide for managing the processing of a financial payment and, more specifically managing the processing of a financial payment in a comprehensive payment hub environment that provides for payment processing, including payment route determination, irrespective of the payment input channel.
