title: Method to reduce corrosion of aluminum alloys exposed to seawater
abstract: A method is taught to alleviate some of the expected seawater corrosion of aluminum alloy fuel tanks originating from the chlorides present in seawater through the use of a dicarboxylic acid additive that is added to the aluminum alloy fuel tank when seawater enters the tank.

This issue is originated when residual seawater makes its way inside the fuel tank that has been partially fuel depleted. Presently the aluminum alloys are anodized and protected with an inert solid organic epoxy coating. In many instances this coating is partially lost due to handling\/abuse of the fuel tank. As fuel tanks age the exposure of seawater to the aluminum alloy results in corrosion of the aluminum. Chlorides from seawater are corrosive to aluminum and its alloys at all temperatures and all chloride concentrations. There is a need to alleviate the chloride corrosion of fuel tanks due to the cost of fuel tank replacement.","It is a general purpose and object of the present invention to alleviate some of the expected seawater corrosion of aluminum alloy fuel tanks originating from the chlorides present in seawater.","This object is accomplished through the use of a dicarboxylic acid based chemical additive that can either be added to Otto fuel or can be applied to the interior of the tank. The dicarboxylic acid additive serves as a buffer to the aluminum alloy fuel tank when seawater enters the tank.","The main ingredient of the chemical additive of the present invention is a dicarboxylic organic acid HOOC\u2014R\u2014COOH, where R may be an alkyl, alkenyl, akynyl, or aryl group. In a preferred embodiment sebacic acid HOOC\u2014(CH)\u2014COOH is used, although azelaic acid HOOC\u2014(CH)\u2014COOH is also an option. An advantage of using sebacic acid is that dibutyl sebacate is one of the components (22.5% by weight) of Otto fuel. The first step is to partially react the sebacic acid to make either a salt of sebacic acid such as zinc monohydrate sebacate or aluminum monohydrate sebacate, or an ester such as butyl monohydrate sebacate. When making the salt of the sebacic acid, the reaction with zinc or aluminum must occur at precise thermal conditions. The next step is to add 2-nitrodiphenylamine at a percentage of 6.25% to the salt or ester of sebacic acid, as a further and final component of the chemical additive of the present invention. The 2-nitrodiphenylamine is used in the same ratio as in the formulation of Otto fuel to avoid contamination. The completed chemical additive of the present invention results in one of the acids still being active.","The next step is to combine the chemical additive of the present invention with Otto fuel or in the alternative to a delivery medium or mechanism that will allow it to be applied to the interior surface of the aluminum alloy fuel tank. In one embodiment, the additive is combined with a chemically neutral grease that is applied to the interior of the fuel tanks. In another embodiment, the additive is sprayed as a liquid on to the interior of the fuel tanks. In a further embodiment, the additive is applied to the interior of the fuel tanks through cathodic application.","The advantages of the present invention over the prior art is that the HOOC chain of the acid will attach to the aluminum alloy surface, which is what serves as a buffer (constant pH=5.9) to the seawater and protects the metal. In addition, a salt or ester of the sebacic acid will not contaminate (i.e. alter or react chemically with) the Otto fuel. Contamination of Otto fuel with organic materials, for example, could lead to serious mishaps.","In light of the above, it is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
