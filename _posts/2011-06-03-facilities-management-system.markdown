title: Facilities management system
abstract: Long-term facility maintenance may be more efficient when data from multiple sources are combined onto an easily navigable display. In particular, building model data from a three-dimensional computer assisted design (CAD) file may be combined with maintenance information from a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) and other data sources such as user's manuals and repair guides. The combined data may be accessible through a three-dimensional display of the building on a mobile device. The mobile device allows a user to navigate through the building and select components to view additional maintenance information for the selected components. The display may interact with location sensing devices, such as GPS, in the mobile device to automatically display model data near the user's location. Additionally, a user may modify component information on the mobile device, which is transmitted to the CMMS to update the stored component information.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Integration Process","Integration System"],"p":["The present application is directed to methods and apparatuses for improved facilities management. Specifically, the present application is directed towards software applications for use by a facilities management staff in viewing and managing building components.","The lifecycle of a commercial building typical spans three phases\u2014design, construction, and operation. In recent years, engineering firms involved in the first two phases\u2014design and construction\u2014have begun to use advanced tools to capture and present information about the building. As an example, one or more Building Information Models (BIMs) may be developed by various project participants. A BIM is a three-dimensional (3D) computer assisted design (CAD) model of the building integrated with information about various building components represented in the model. Separate BIMs may be developed for various design aspects of the building such as, for example, structural, civil, architectural, and MEP (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing). Examples of conventional software for developing BIMs include Revit, Civil3D, AutoDesk, Tekla, Pipe3D, Catia, Digital Project, Bentley Project, AutoCad 3D, SketchUp, Rhino, NavisWorks, and Grasshopper.","In a typical project, not all useful information is included in one BIM. For example, a BIM generated by an MEP contractor during the design phase is unlikely to contain complete information on all mechanical, electrical, and plumbing components that will eventually be included in the building. Rather, that BIM likely will simply reserve space for such components. During the construction phase, as purchase decisions are made for various building components, additional BIMs may be created by contractors with additional information on the actually purchased components. As an example, a BIM created in the design phase may designate a space for a chiller, but contain no further information. A separate BIM created by a different company during the construction phase may include additional information about the chiller actually purchased and installed, such as the model and serial number. Additionally, neither of these BIMs may include architectural elements, which are instead included in a separate BIM.","During the third phase of the building, the operations phase, a facilities management (FM) group oversees maintenance and repair of the building. To manage these tasks, FM groups typically utilize a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS). Examples of conventional CMMSs include Mainsaver, Maximo, and FM Desktop. The CMMS may include information to assist FM staff such as scheduled and unscheduled maintenance tasks and completed and repair request tickets. A CMMS typically includes a textual listing of building components, with each typically assigned a serial number or other unique identifier and a textual designation of location within the building. To locate a component within the building, a facilities management employee must manually cross-reference the textual location of the component listed in the CMMS with 2D CAD drawings. Such drawings are typically provided to the FM staff for reference at the completion of construction. An illustration of a conventional 2D CAD drawing is shown in .","2D CAD drawings are not an efficient tool for FM because they generally do not include much data. Thus, the FM staff may be required to locate an identifier for a component on the 2D CAD drawing and search additional documents to locate information about the component. For example, in addition to manually cross-referencing location information with 2D CAD drawings, a facilities management employee may also need to manually access additional paper and electronic repositories to learn more information about the component, such as through a user's manuals. Additionally, 2D CAD drawings are not updated as the building is updated. Building configuration changes, building additions, and building removals are not entered into the original 2D CAD drawings. Instead, these changes may be reflected in additional 2D CAD drawings. These additional 2D CAD drawing may only reflect the updated portions and may require the FM staff to reference those drawings in combination with the original 2D CAD drawings and other reference materials.","Currently, the wealth of information created during the design and construction phases of a building and captured in various BIMs remain unavailable to a FM staff during the operations phase. Even if a contractor were to provide a BIM file to the FM group, a typical facilities management group does not have access to or experience with the advanced 3D modeling software necessary to view and utilize a BIM. Additionally, because relevant information is typically spread across several different BIMs created by different contractors in various phases of the project, there is no one single source of useful information.","A BIM viewing application would also not be able to replace all functions of a legacy CMMS system such as, for example, logging and scheduling maintenance activities and managing help tickets. It would also be costly and disruptive for a FM group to replace an existing legacy CMMS system.","Therefore a solution is needed to provide FM groups the benefit of the information and visualization available in a BIM in a user-friendly package and to integrate with the existing information and functionality of a legacy CMMS system with the BIM information.","According to one embodiment, a method includes retrieving from a first data source data representing an environment in a building and at least one component in the environment. The method also includes displaying a three-dimensional model illustrating data from the first data source, including the at least one component. The method further includes receiving a request for information regarding a component selected from the at least one component. The method also includes retrieving information regarding the selected component from a second data source different from the first data source. The method further includes displaying the information regarding the selected component. The first data source and the second data source each contain a record for the selected component and the record of the first data source and the record of the second data source include an identifier identifying the selected component.","According to another embodiment, a computer program product includes a non-transitory computer readable medium having code to retrieve from a first data source data representing an environment in a building and at least one component in the environment. The medium also includes code to display a three-dimensional model illustrating data from the first data source, including the at least one component. The medium further includes code to receive a request for information regarding a component selected from the environment. The medium also includes code to retrieve information regarding the selected component from a second data source different from the first data source. The medium further includes code to display the information regarding the selected component.","According to a further embodiment, a method includes providing a three dimensional computer assisted design (3D CAD) model to a client. The method also includes providing an interface for the 3D CAD model to the client including access to a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS). The method further includes providing updates to the 3D CAD model to the client on a subscription basis.","The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims of the invention. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the conception and specific embodiment disclosed may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or designing other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. It should also be realized by those skilled in the art that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. The novel features which are believed to be characteristic of the invention, both as to its organization and method of operation, together with further objects and advantages will be better understood from the following description when considered in connection with the accompanying figures. It is to be expressly understood, however, that each of the figures is provided for the purpose of illustration and description only and is not intended as a definition of the limits of the present invention.","As discussed above, at the conclusion of the construction phase of a building lifecycle, various contractors may have developed numerous separate BIMs. To make those BIMs useful to an FM group, it may be necessary to combine these BIMs into a single virtual model. Such a process is called \u201ccoordination\u201d and may consist of stacking the models, identifying clashes, identifying other coordination issues, and resolving all clashes and coordination issues. NavisWorks is a software package that may be used to assist in this process. The aggregated virtual model may take any appropriate form, such as a single BIM file, or multiple files aggregated using appropriate software. Some engineering firms may provide coordination services as part of project management during the design phase of the project to, for example, integrate BIMs from structural, civil, architectural, and\/or MEP engineers as part of a multi-disciplinary review process. The same techniques applied in those situations would be applicable to this task. In some projects, it may not be necessary to perform coordination as a single BIM may include sufficient information.","According to one embodiment, aggregating information from multiple BIMs may include adapting information from multiple platforms and having one sub-contractor build upon another sub-contractor's BIM. For example, a civil engineering firm may plan a steel structure for a building. Then, a steel fabrication sub-contractor may use the civil engineering firm's steel model and input fabrication information such as steel manufacturing information or CNC layouts. Thus, the civil engineering model includes both structural information and component information aggregated together. Previously, this information would not be saved or would not be locatable within a single model. Instead, when FM required information FM would search through many poorly indexed document collections. Similar collections of data may be obtained from, for example, electrical engineering firms and electricians. NavisWorks, a commercial software package, is one example of software that may be used for \u201cstacking\u201d multiple BIMs and creating a single aggregate model.","Once information is aggregated into a single virtual model, building components in the BIM must be linked to the corresponding records for those same components in the CMMS. Methods for accomplishing this linking may depend on the stage of the project. In some embodiments, a unique key may be used to identify each component. In some CMMS systems, each component is assigned an asset number. For projects where a CMMS database has not yet been established, the BIM file may be used to generate original CMMS database records, insuring that components in the BIM file and the CMMS file share the same identifying asset number or other identifier, which FM may provide. For projects where a CMMS database is already in operation, a link table may be created to link each component number or other identifier in the BIM file with the corresponding component number or other identifier for that component in the CMMS database. Other techniques for linking BIM data and CMMS data may also be used. For example, a database containing a single entry for each component including all information needed for both BIM and CMMS purposes may be created. As another example, asset numbers assigned to components in CMMS records may be added to the corresponding component record in the virtual model using any appropriate technique.","Once BIM and CMMS information have been linked, either by use of a common key, linking table, or any other manner, the FM staff may use the integration system described below. Over the lifetime of the building, construction and repairs may necessitate updating of the CMMS and BIM data. For example, a component may be replaced or moved. In some instances, the facilities management staff may update the relevant information through the CMMS system or the integration system discussed below. In other instances, it may be appropriate for an engineering firm or other group familiar with the virtual model creation and modification process to update the virtual model.","Using an integration system, model data and maintenance data for a building may be combined and viewed through an interactive user display to improve access to maintenance information. A three-dimensional (3D) model may be presented to a user having a similar appearance to the building. The user may navigate through the model to identify components for maintenance. According to one embodiment, the user's location may be determined and the model for the user's location displayed. When the model data and maintenance data are stored in separate databases, an identifier for a component in the model data may be correlated with an identifier for the component in the maintenance information to allow automated access to maintenance information from a view of the model data. The identifier may be the same in the model data and the maintenance information (e.g., the same asset number) or the identifier may be different in the model data and the maintenance information. When the identifiers are different, a table stored to correlate identifiers between the model data and the maintenance information. The interactive user display may display information from the model data and the maintenance data such as previously-performed maintenance, future scheduled maintenance, component capabilities, component manufacturer, component warranty information, manufacturer contact information, work orders, repair guides, and user's manuals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","204","202","206","204","200","204"]},"According to one embodiment, the building view  may be manipulated by turning on and off certain filters (not shown). For example, a filter may be activated to only display even or odd floors of the building in the building view . In another example, a filter may be activated to only display garage levels or commercial levels in the building view . In yet another example, a filter may be activated to not display walls within the building view . Filters and other controls may be controlled through a toolbar . The toolbar  may also change view and perspective information for the building view . For example, the toolbar  may include zoom and rotate buttons.","Alternatively, a user may navigate through the building view  by clicking and dragging within the building view . After navigating to a particular floor the building view  may be updated as shown in .  is a drawing illustrating an exemplary facilities management information display of a single floor of a high-rise tower according to one embodiment of the disclosure. According to one embodiment, a user may add bookmarks designating certain locations within the building view  to allow quick recall to a particular location. For example, a bookmark may define \u201coffice 38S\u201d or \u201cfloor 38 south elevator bank.\u201d According to another embodiment, the bookmarks may be pre-populated views or system-designed views.","A user may also navigate through the building view  by clicking on a location in a two-dimensional (2D) view  displayed in the building view . The 2D view  may be displayed on or hidden from the building view  by selecting an icon in the toolbar  or pressing a hotkey or hotkey combination. Selecting a location on the 2D view  may update the building view  to display an environment near the selected region of the 2D view . According to one embodiment, the 2D view  responds to the user by highlighting a region  of the 2D view  when a user selects the region  or places a mouse cursor over the region .","A display  of  may also include the information view , which displays information about one or more components selected in the building view . For example, when no component is selected the information view  may display information about the 3D CAD file displayed in the building view .

The computer system  may utilize RAM  to store the various data structures used by a software application such as databases, tables, and\/or records. The computer system  may also include read only memory (ROM)  which may be PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, optical storage, or the like. The ROM may store configuration information for booting the computer system . The RAM  and the ROM  hold user and system data.","The computer system  may also include an input\/output (I\/O) adapter , a communications adapter , a user interface adapter , and a display adapter . The I\/O adapter  and\/or the user interface adapter  may, in certain embodiments, enable a user to interact with the computer system . For example, the user interface adapter  may couple the computing system  to input devices such as a mouse, a keyboard, a track pad, and\/or a touch screen. In a further embodiment, the display adapter  may display a graphical user interface associated with a software or web-based application.","The I\/O adapter  may connect one or more storage devices , such as one or more of a hard drive, a compact disk (CD) drive, a floppy disk drive, and a tape drive, to the computer system .

For example, the adapter  may be coupled to a global positioning system (GPS) receiver for determining a longitude, latitude, and\/or elevation of the computer system . In another example, the communications adapter  may be coupled to a radio frequency identification (RFID) receiver, or any other near field communication (NFC) device. The adapter  may receive from the RFID receiver a scan code, which may be used to locate location information. For example, an RFID tag may be scanned by the RFID receiver when entering a room, floor, and\/or access space of a building, then the received code matched to the RFID tag's location in the building. Alternatively, RFID tags may be placed on components within the building and the tag may be scanned by an RFID scanner to identify a particular component identification for searching a 3D CAD model or CMMS. In yet another example, the adapter  is coupled to a barcode reader. The adapter  may receive from the bar code reader a scan code, which may be used to locate location information from a reference table. In another example, the adapter  is coupled to a camera, which may take pictures of a user's surrounding and determine the user's location to allow display of an appropriate environment from a model. In a further example, the adapter  is coupled to inertial sensors such as a compass and\/or accelerometer to determine a user's movement from a base location and determine an environment for display. In yet another example, the adapter  is coupled to a wireless network hotspot (such as WiFi), and the network identifier of the network hotspot has a known location, which the computer system  identifies as its location.","A user operating a mobile device as illustrated in  and  may interact with the building view  by physically moving the mobile device . For example, the mobile device  may determine a user's current position through one of the systems described above such as GPS, RFID, barcodes, and\/or camera pictures. Once the users initial position is determined the building view  is updated with the environment of the user's current position. The user may then physically point the mobile device  up at the ceiling and the building view  is updated with a view of the ceiling and\/or components in the ceiling above the user's position. Movement of the mobile device  may be determined through one of the positioning systems described above. Alternatively, movement of the mobile device  may be determined by inertial sensors by measuring an accelerometer, magnetometer, digital compass, or the like and computing the user's position and viewing angle from the user's original position determined by the position system. For example, after the user's original position is determined if the user rotates 180 degrees to view the other direction down a hallway, a digital compass in the mobile device  may detect the user's rotation and update the building view  to display the hallway in the direction the user is now facing.","According to one embodiment, the communications adapter  may allow the computer system  to communicate with an equipment management system. For example, the communications adapter  may allow the computer system  to alter temperature and\/or humidity settings in a building, activate and\/or deactivate alarm systems, and operate door locks in the building.
