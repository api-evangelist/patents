abstract: A target analysis method that includes the steps of: illuminating a target with acoustic waves; positioning a device at multiple acoustic vector sensing positions about the target in a scattered acoustic field of reflected waves to simultaneously measure acoustic pressure and particle velocity at each vector sensing position; converting using a Hilbert transform the measured acoustic pressures and particle velocities into a complex signal having active real and reactive imaginary vector component; computing respective active and reactive acoustic intensities at each vector components; and mapping field structure nulls being zero crossings of the active and reactive intensities to a bitmap representation of decomposed scattered target acoustic intensities of the target.

The passive towed array, in conjunction with sound receiving and signal processing electronics, can detect sound in the water that may indicate the presence of an underwater target. In other arrangements, the ship can tow both the passive towed array and a towed acoustic projector, which together form a bi-static active sonar system. With this arrangement, the towed acoustic projector emits sound pulses.","Each sound pulse travels through the water, striking an object or target in the water, which in turn produces echoes. The echoes are received by the towed array of receiving hydrophones. Therefore, an echo indicates the presence of an underwater object and the direction from which the echo came; subsequently, indicating the direction of the underwater object.","In conventional bi-static active sonar systems, the towed acoustic projector is often deployed and towed separately from the towed array sound receiving hydrophones. A conventional towed acoustic projector typically includes a sound source mounted within a large rigid tow body. The conventional towed acoustic projector is large and heavy.","The towed acoustic projector is typically used to detect objects in deep water and at long ranges. Therefore, the acoustic projector is capable of generating sound having a high pressure level in order to enable the system to receive echoes from and to detect objects in the deep water at long ranges.","The towed array of receiving hydrophones are often deployed and recovered through a hull penetrator below the ship water line. In contrast, in part due to size and weight, the towed acoustic projector is deployed and recovered over the gunwale of the ship with winch and boom equipment.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,438,552 discloses a sonar system for identifying objects including a technique for providing a two-dimensional array of pixels, each one of the pixels representing the intensity of a signal at a predetermined range position and a predetermined cross-range position from a reference position and quantizing the intensity of each one of the pixels into one of a plurality of levels. The technique further includes comparing a distribution of the levels of pixels over a range scan at a cross-range position with the distribution of levels of pixels over a range scan at a different cross-range position to identify the existence of a foreign object such as a mine.","Accordingly it is a primary object and general purpose of the present invention to provide a sonar system and method capable of more precise target analysis through the use of vector components of sonar waves.","The target analysis method of the present invention comprises the steps of: illuminating a target with acoustic waves; positioning a device at multiple acoustic vector sensing positions about the target in a scattered acoustic field of reflected waves in order to simultaneously measure acoustic pressure and particle velocity at each vector sensing position; converting by using a Hilbert transform the measured acoustic pressures and particle velocities into a complex signal having active real and active imaginary vector components; computing active and reactive acoustic intensities at each vector component; and mapping field structure nulls being zero crossings of the active and reactive intensities to a bitmap representation of decomposed scattered target acoustic intensities of the target.","A sonar tracking system  is shown in  to include a sonar transmission or sending system  which transmits a signal  of infinite-extent sonar waveform planes  toward a target  (a rigid sphere with a radius ). From the \u03b8=\u2212\u03c4\u03b3 direction. A radius  (in meters) is a distance measured from the center of the target  and \u03b8 is the conical angle relative to the normal to the direction of plane wave propagation. The signal  illuminates the target sphere  and is reflected from the sphere to a back-scattered region  and a forward-scattered region .","A plurality of acoustic vector sonar sensors or receivers  at different vector sensing positions receive a signal  from the reflection action. The sensors  then simultaneously measure acoustic pressure and particle velocity at each vector sensing position. The measured acoustic pressures and particle velocities are sent via sensing lines  to a computer  for signal analysis.","The steps of the method are shown in the block diagram of  where the target  is illuminated by acoustic wave forms in step . The acoustic vector sonar sensors  are positioned and measure the acoustic pressures and particle velocities at each vector sensing position in step . The measured acoustic pressures and particle velocities are converted into a complex signal in step . The active and reactive acoustic intensities are computed at each vector component in step . A bitmap representation of decomposed scattered target acoustic intensities is created to include mapping field structure nulls in step .","A representative bitmap structure of nulls is depicted in . Null mapping is the process of analyzing null structures in a scattered intensity field by a set of logical operations on sparse matrices constructed from separated real and imaginary components of pressure and particle velocity fields.","The details below describe the structure of a scattered acoustic field by using a separation of the complex intensity field into active and reactive components. Utilizing the dimensionless constant relating an incident (or illuminating) wave to a radius of a sphere 2\u03a0a\/\u03bb (or ka); a particular scattered region of interest is in the region of interest is in the resonance range (ka\u02dc3) where the scattered diameter is approximately equal to 1\u03bb and creeping waves are diffracted around the scatterer and combine with pressure scattered by the illuminated surface.","The phase differences caused by the acoustic path lengths of the diffracted waves cause interference patterns that vary with frequency and scattered characteristics which include geometry and material properties. Through a power mapping of the real (active) and imaginary (reactive) complex acoustic intensity; the effects of the illuminated target characteristics on the total acoustic energy fields are characterized.","Of further interest is the understanding of how the scattered vector field characterization extends and transitions into the far-field. In the preferred embodiment, fully-developed scattered intensity fields from simple rigid spheres are examined. Numerical and measured results have been studied and modeling will extend to elastic and fluid-filled boundary conditions.","The following embodiment is a simple scattering case for the rigid target sphere  of a radius  as shown in . However, the method is not limited to a rigid spherical shape target. This description includes derivations for fluid-filled thin wall spheres and evacuated spherical shells.","Cylinder mapping is another example. The target only need be on the size order proportional to approximately one wavelength of the illumination frequency such as in the resonance region, where the acoustic wavelength of the illumination field and scatterer size (2*pi\/lambda)*(radius of target) is on the order of two or three.","The target sphere  illuminated by infinite-extent plan waves  from the \u2212\u03c0 direction.
