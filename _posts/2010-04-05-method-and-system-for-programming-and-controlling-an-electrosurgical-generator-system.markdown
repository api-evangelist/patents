No. 60\/466,954, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","1. Technical Field","The present disclosure is directed to electrosurgery and, in particular, to a method and system for programming and controlling an electrosurgical generator system.","2. Description of the Related Art","Electrosurgery entails the use of electrosurgical energy to cut or coagulate tissue, or perform some other type of surgical procedure. An electrosurgical generator system is used for generating the electrosurgical energy and delivering the same to an electrode connected to the generator. The electrode is then brought into contact with tissue and depending on the frequency and other parameters of the electrosurgical energy, the tissue is either cut, coagulated, sealed, etc.","In order to achieve desired surgical results when operating the electrosurgical generator system in one of several control modes, e.g., cut, coagulate and blend, the electrosurgical generator system needs to be programmed to generate electrosurgical energy having output parameters with predetermined values. These desired output parameters typically include the frequency, power (amplitude), duty cycle, and waveform-type of the electrosurgical energy, as well as the output current and output voltage of the electrosurgical generator system.","It is evident that by programming the electrosurgical generator system, one can control various parameters, including other factors, such as the maximum allowable temperature of the tissue during electrosurgery, rate of change of impedance, etc., prior to initiating the electrosurgical procedure.","Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a method and system capable of enabling an individual to quickly create new electrosurgical applications without major re-programming of the software system of an electrosurgical generator system.","A method and system are disclosed capable of enabling an individual to quickly create new electrosurgical applications without major re-programming of the software system of an electrosurgical generator system. In one embodiment, an electrosurgical generator system includes an RF stage to output at least one waveform of electrosurgical energy; a sensor module having at least one sensor to sense electrical or physical properties related to the output electrosurgical energy and generate sensor data; and at least one control module executable on at least one processor that controls at least one parameter of the output electrosurgical energy. The at least one control module includes an outer loop controller to generate a control signal in accordance with at least a first subset of the sensor data and an inner loop controller to generate a setpoint control signal and provide the setpoint control signal to the RF stage for controlling at least an amplitude of the energy output by the RF stage.","A control loop system is chiefly responsible for the operation of the electrosurgical generator system and it is composed of three basic components: an inner loop system which is responsible for changing and sculpting basic RF output; an outer loop system which is responsible for setting the output target of the inner loop based on a variety of algorithms such as the control of temperature; and a configuration control system which is responsible for reprogramming the inner and outer loop systems \u201con-the-fly\u201d or in virtual real-time for the inner and outer loop systems to change operation.","All user programming is preferably accomplished using at least one input device, such as a keyboard, touch-screen display, etc., while the software programming may be based on a file-based programming language to input programming commands to the electrosurgical generator system. The combination of the two inputted programming commands are stored into command files and define all aspects and parameters of the electrosurgical generator system.","The simple input and storage of the programming commands according to the present disclosure allows for easy creation and modification of new electrosurgical generator modes. For example, a mode can be created by inputting programming commands and storing the same in a command file, subsequent modes can easily be created by modifying associated parameters and storing them as a new command file.","Further features of the above embodiments will become more readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the drawings.","Reference should be made to the drawings where like reference numerals refer to similar elements. Referring to , there is shown a block diagram of an embodiment of a control loop system for an electrosurgical generator system in accordance with the present disclosure. The control loop system is designated generally by reference numeral  and it is designed to enable a software developer to efficiently program and control the operation of the electrosurgical generator system . The electrosurgical generator system  is particularly designed for the easy creation of multiple different electrosurgical systems. The method and system of the present disclosure enables an individual to efficiently create new application modes by creating configuration or command files for downloading or programming these new modes into the electrosurgical generator system for creating new surgical applications without changing the underlying software system.","The control loop system  is chiefly responsible for the operation of the electrosurgical generator system  and it is composed of three basic components: an inner loop system  which is responsible for changing and sculpting basic RF output (e.g., current, power, or voltage output, duty cycle, frequency), and inner loop control system dynamics of an RF output stage  based on user and\/or sensor inputs from various sensors  and\/or user input devices (not shown); an outer loop system  which is responsible for controlling the inner loop setpoint based on a variety of algorithms (e.g., temperature control, impedance control, pulse control, vessel sealing, etc.) based on user and\/or sensor inputs from the various sensors  and time and\/or user input devices (not shown); and a configuration control system  which is responsible for changing the programming of the inner and outer loop systems ,  \u201con-the-fly\u201d or in virtual real-time based on user or sensor inputs received from various sensors  and\/or user input devices (not shown).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2D","FIG. 2A"],"b":["200","200","102","104","112"]},"With reference to , the electrosurgical generator system  is also able to maintain the output constant.  shows the output current being maintained at a constant level over a load impedance range.  shows the output power being maintained at a constant level over a load impedance range.  shows the output voltage being maintained at a constant level over a load impedance range.","As shown by , the inner loop system  is controlled by an inner loop controller , the outer loop system  is controlled by an outer loop controller , and the configuration control system  is controlled by a configuration controller . The controllers ,  perform their various functions by the execution of a set of programmable instructions by at least one microprocessor and\/or at least one digital signal processor (DSP), e.g., DSPs , , respectively.","The configuration controller  performs its various functions by the execution of a set of programmable instructions executed by at least one microprocessor and\/or a DSP, e.g., DSP . The controllers , ,  are configured for receiving inputted programming commands for operating the electrosurgical generator system .","All programming is preferably accomplished using at least one input device, such as a keyboard, touch-screen display, remote computer system, etc., to input the programming commands to the electrosurgical generator system . The inputted programming commands are stored into command files within at least one memory module, such as a RAM module, and define all aspects and parameters of the electrosurgical generator system .","The simple input or download and storage of the programming commands according to the present disclosure allows for easy creation and modification of new electrosurgical generator modes. For example, one mode can be created by inputting programming commands and storing the same in a command file. A new mode can be created based on the original programming.","A description will now be presented with reference to programming the at least one microprocessor by way of a programming language in a preferred embodiment for controlling and programming the electrosurgical generator system  of the present disclosure.","I. Configuration Control System","The set of programmable instructions for operating the electrosurgical generator system  in accordance with the present disclosure has been designed to enable two analog inputs to the configuration controller  to control the mode (outer and inner loop programming) and the desired output (current (I), power (P), voltage (V), etc. depending on the control mode selected) of the electrosurgical generator system ,","In an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, the method of mode control is accomplished by making a data structure, e.g., Local_Cfg[ ], an array, When a mode switch is desired, a host variable, e.g., Config_Index, is adjusted and then copied to a processing file, e.g., Out_Local_IO.Config_Index, where it switches an active command file, e.g., Local_Cfg[Local_IO.Config_Index].","The method of desired output programming is accomplished by adjusting a host variable, e.g., OutLocal_IO.Desired_Amplitude_Multiplier, where Desired_Amplitude_Multiplier represents a multiplier value for adjusting the output curves of the outer loop system  when enabled or is passed directly to the inner loop system  as a current\/power\/voltage level if the outer loop system  is disabled.","I.a. Configuration Selection Control","The configuration selection is programmed by filling the variable, e.g., Local_Cfg[ ], with the data from the sets of command files. The configuration index is first specified, then the data is read from the command files, then the next index is specified, etc.","I.a.1. Command File Programming","The programming of the configuration control system  is controlled by a Meta command file. This command file loads the Local_Cfg[ ] array with each configuration and specifies how the configuration and Desired_Amplitude_Multiplier is controlled.","To specify which location in the Local_Cfg[ ] array is to be filled, the following command is used:","#CONFIG_INDEX x, where x specifies the location to be filled (0-7).","To specify which configuration is to be loaded in the memory module, the following command is used:","#INCLUDE_FILE xxx, where xxx is a valid path and filename of outer and inner loop command files which define the configuration to be loaded in the memory module.","An example is provided below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\/\/ Load Config Index Location 0"]},{"entry":[{},"#CONFIG_INDEX \u20030"]},{"entry":[{},"\/\/ Inner Loop definition"]},{"entry":[{},"#INCLUDE_FILE"]},{"entry":[{},"C:\\LRT_TRT\\Code\\Cmd_Files\\CP_472k_Inner_Loop.cmd"]},{"entry":[{},"\/\/ Load Outer Loop definition"]},{"entry":[{},"#INCLUDE_FILE"]},{"entry":[{},"C:\\LRT_TRT\\Code\\Cmd_Files\\Temp_Outer_Loop.cmd"]},{"entry":[{},"\/\/ Load Config Index location 1"]},{"entry":[{},"#CONFIG_INDEX \u20031"]},{"entry":[{},"\/\/ Inner Loop definition"]},{"entry":[{},"#INCLUDE_FILE"]},{"entry":[{},"C:\\LRT_TRT\\Code\\Cmd_Files\\CP_250k_Inner_Loop.cmd"]},{"entry":[{},"\/\/ Load Outer Loop definition"]},{"entry":[{},"#INCLUDE_FILE"]},{"entry":[{},"C:\\LRT_TRT\\Code\\Cmd_Files\\DZ_Outer_Loop.cmd"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},"Mode selection can be programmed to be selected by one of three inputs: a user input device (e.g., a keyboard), AD7 or AD8, where AD7 and AD8 are sensor modules.

DSP_Shared_Data.RF_Desired_Output) for the inner loop system . The concept of temperature control will be used to describe how this is accomplished, however other control methods may be used, such as but not limited to rate of change of temperature control, impedance control and rate of change of impedance control. In temperature control mode, the outer loop system  is programmed to follow a specific temperature vs. time curve. The outer loop system  uses the temperature versus time curve to retrieve its target temperature after lapse of a specified time, e.g., after a procedure has started. If the temperature is low, then the outer loop system  raises the inner loop setpoint. If the temperature is high, then the outer loop system  lowers the inner loop setpoint. The inner loop system  then attempts to deliver RF as specified by the inner loop setpoint, and thus raise or lower the temperature.","The user is given control of the amplitude multiplier and\/or the time multiplier which adjust the temperature versus time curves. The curves are specified as normalized values from 0.0 to 1.0. Thus, the temperature curve can be increased by increasing the amplitude multiplier:\n\nTarget Temperature=Temperature_Curve(Time)*Amplitude Multiplier;\n","The time scale in which the curve is executed may also be adjusted by modifying the time multiplier in a similar fashion to the target temperature, thus:\n\nTime=Time Curve*Time Multiplier;\n","The outer loop system  operates in selectable modes for controlling temperature, rate of change of impedance and work (in Joules). The source code enables the addition of other modes, if desired.","The outer loop system  can also be turned off. In this case, the amplitude multiplier is passed directly to the inner loop system  as the setpoint and the time multiplier is not used.","Sitting on top of all the outer loop modes and algorithms is a pulsing control system. This pulsing control system allows the user to specify pulsing waveform pattern parameters, such as the number of pulses in a burst of pulses, the duty cycle (e.g., ratio of on time to off time), delay time (e.g., time between bursts of pulses), frequency (e.g., 1\/time between rising edges of \u2018on time\u2019), and on\/off amplitude envelope (e.g., amplitude pattern of a burst of pulses) for pulses to be delivered.","II.a.

The disabled elements pass the input directly to the output of the module, thus allowing the enabled elements to operate with no change from the disabled units. The inner loop controller  processes sensor data received from the sensor module  in accordance with configuration data received from the configuration controller , updated configuration data received from the HLA module , and the inner loop multiplier control signal received from the outer loop controller , and generates a supply setpoint control signal which is provided to the RF stage , where an amplitude of an aspect of the RF energy output by the RF stage  is controlled in accordance with the supply setpoint. In the example provided in , the supply setpoint is an HV supply setpoint which controls amplitude of the voltage output by the RF stage .","The ILTG  receives configuration data including at least one algorithm selected from algorithms including a sculpted curve (including sculpted current, sculpted voltage and sculpted power) and RF limit algorithms, pulse parameters (pulse enable (for enabling or disabling pulsing function), pulse on (length of \u201chigh\u201d pulse), pulse off (length of \u201clow\u201d pulse), pulse min (amplitude of \u201clow\u201d pulse), an inner loop gain curve, maximum RF limits, a control curve and Zlow, Zhigh, Zentl values (where Zentl indicates when to switch the control variable, e.g., from current to voltage, or vice versa); sensor data from the sensor module ; and the inner loop multiplier from the outer loop controller . The ILTG  generates a target signal to the ILCM  based on the inner loop control curve provided via the configuration data from the configuration controller  and updatable by the configuration update data from the HLA module ; the inner loop multiplier from the outer loop controller ; and impedance and actual RF current and voltage from the sensor module . The target signal preferably represents voltage, but it can also represent the HV supply setpoint in the case when the ILCM is bypassed and\/or disabled.","The ILTG  further includes modules for performing the following functions: performing a sculpted curve algorithm including, for example, but not limited to converting a sculpted current or power control curve into a voltage control curve; limiting the control curve to the maximum values (e.g., for current, voltage and power) allowed for the hardware; calculating and generating the inner loop target based on the sensor data, the control curve and the inner loop multiplier; controlling the inner loop control module gains based on impedance sensor data and the gain curve which specifies changes in gain due to changes in impedance for generating the gain multiplier; pulsing the inner loop target; and selecting a mode based on the sensed load impedance and the impedance breakpoints Zlow, Zhigh and Zentl, and generating a control mode signal in accordance with the selected mode.","Mode selection determines which sensor data is to be used by the ILCM  and which variable is to be controlled, e.g., sensor data that corresponds to current, voltage or power for controlling current, voltage or power, respectively. referably, current control is to be used for impedances less than Zlow, power or voltage control is used for impedance values between Zlow and Zhigh, and voltage control is used for the remaining impedance values. To avoid inaccuracy and prevent unnecessary control mode switching when the impedance is near a breakpoint, hysteresis is used when the impedance is close to a breakpoint.","The RF limit algorithm causes the ILTG  and the ILCM  to operate in an open loop mode in which there is minimal software control of the HV supply setpoint output in response to sensor data. The open loop mode is generally used for calibration and service functions, but is not limited thereto. Preferably, in the open loop mode the amplitude activation setting determines the percentage of full scale output that the RF stage  will deliver. The RF limit algorithm protects the RF stage  from user actions, such as setting the activation amplitude setting to a level that could cause the HV supply setpoint to be set to a level that could damage the RF stage . The HV supply setpoint is kept within predetermined limits, where the limits are determined by the control curve,","The inner loop control curve is interpreted to represent the maximum allowed HV supply setpoint at the specified impedance (Z). As long as the maximum HV supply setpoint allowed is not exceeded, as defined by the inner loop control curve, control of the HV supply setpoint is based on the inner loop multiplier. If the control curve is exceeded, then the output HV supply setpoint is held at the maximum allowed HV supply setpoint for providing protection to the electrosurgical unit receiving the energy generated by the RF stage . The HV supply setpoint is set to equal the inner loop multiplier after the ITV supply setpoint is less than the maximum RF limit value, with some possible hysteresis.","The max RF limits parameter provides another layer of control layered on top of the control curve for use with any algorithm by providing maximum limits for current, voltage and\/or power levels of the HV supply setpoint. The control layer which uses the max RF limits parameter further provides protection to the RF stage unit  and the electrosurgical unit (ESU) receiving the energy generated by the RF stage , including protection from changes to the software. Furthermore, the control system may use the minimum of the limits described by the control curve and the max RF limit for limiting the HV supply setpoint,","The pulsing function may run in parallel with other ILTG  algorithms. The duration of the \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d pulses, the time between leading edges, the level for the \u201clow\u201d pulse, etc., are specified by the pulse parameters. The level for the \u201chigh\u201d pulse is defined by the control curve, the impedance data from the sensor data and the inner loop multiplier for closed loop control, or by the inner loop multiplier for open loop control, such as when the RF limit algorithm is performed. The pulsing of the inner loop target may contribute to providing sharp edged pulses of the HV supply setpoint, if desired.","The inner loop control curve received via the configuration data specifies the inner loop desired output values versus sensed impedance values obtained from sensor data. The desired output values of the received inner loop control curve represent current, voltage or power, as determined by the algorithm received via the configuration data (e.g., the sculpted current, voltage or power algorithm, respectively). The received inner loop control curve may be converted into a voltage, current or power curve, in accordance with the mode selected, in which the desired output values represent voltage, current or power, respectively. The control curve (or converted control curve) may be structured, for example, as a multi-dimensional array. One column of the array specifies impedance values, and another column specifies desired output values, where the desired output values represent current, power or voltage in accordance with the control mode. Preferably the desired output values are normalized between 0 and 1.0. A desired output value which is output as the inner loop target is generated by obtaining a normalized desired output value via linear interpolation based on the actual impedance, and multiplying the normalized desired output value by the inner loop multiplier.","Control of the inner loop control module gains (herein referred to as inner loop gain control) includes generating the gain multiplier in response to a constant control voltage as impedance changes. System gain (e.g., RF voltage\/HV supply set-point, where the RF voltage is measured RF voltage output by the RF stage ) varies with patient load impedance. The inner loop gain control objective is to stabilize the system gain to keep it close to constant as the load impedance changes. The inner loop gain curve is theoretically a set of points of a gain multiplier plotted versus impedance derived from the design of the hardware, which is designed to adjust the gains due to the response of the electrosurgical generator system .","The gain curve preferably holds a normalized voltage response versus impedance. By using a normalized voltage response, the voltage is converted into the variable that we are controlling (current, power, or voltage). The gain multiplier is computed by taking the inverse of the voltage response that corresponds to the sensed impedance. The gain multiplier is used to adjust the inner loop PID values of the ILCM  so that the control system gain is close to constant. Accordingly, the PID values should be calculated assuming a system gain of 1.0, as the PID values are adjusted as described above.","To compute the gain multiplier, for voltage control, the interpolated value of the gain curve is inverted. For power control, the gain multiplier is Z\/V(where V is the interpolated value from the gain curve). For current control, the gain multiplier is Z\/V. Accordingly, the ILSM  can use a single set of PID gain values for the inner loop voltage, current or power control, and the gain multiplier is used to modify the PID gains during the procedure in virtual real-time.","The ILCM  receives configuration data including control parameters, such as PID parameters; sensor data from the sensor module  and the inner loop target, the gain multiplier and the control mode (Inns, Vrms, Pavg or Bypass) from the ILTG . The ILCM  adjusts the HV supply setpoint in accordance with the received data so that the inner loop target is reached.","The ILCM  preferably uses a control algorithm, such as a PID algorithm, which is able to switch between control modes such as current control, voltage control, power control and a bypass mode (e.g., minimal control, where received data is provided as the output) without large disturbances when switching control modes. When the ILTG  is performing the RF limit algorithm, the ILCM  is preferably in bypass mode. When switching between control modes, the PID loop algorithm (if active) pre-loads the integral term for minimum disturbance.","With respect to the outer loop controller , the OLTG  receives configuration data including the outer loop target curve, the target slew rate, the time multiplier and an algorithm selectable from algorithms including time control or bypass algorithms; the amplitude multiplier from the HLA module ; and time signals. Other than when performing the bypass algorithm, the OLTG  generates a time varying outer loop target in accordance with the received data which is provided to the OLCM , where the outer loop target may represent a property such as, but not limited to, temperature, current, power, voltage or impedance. Preferably, the outer loop target is generated by a linear interpolation of the adjusted outer loop target curve, where the target curve provided via the OLTG configuration data is adjusted in accordance with the amplitude multiplier, the time multiplier and\/or time.","The outer loop target slew rate parameter allows the system to have a programmable slew rate of the outer loop target, so that regardless of how quickly the amplitude multiplier changes, the outer loop target will not change faster than the programmed slew rate. The outer loop target slew rate control function is typically used in systems in which the user may have direct control of a parameter, such as the activation amplitude setting, and it is desired to limit the rate at which the activation amplitude setting can be changed.","The OLCM  receives configuration data including control parameters, such as PID parameters, inner loop multiplier maximum and minimum limit values, pulse parameters, at least one algorithm selectable from algorithms such as temperature, temperature limit, impedance (Z), or bypass algorithms, algorithm parameters, such as temperature limits and an outer loop gain curve; sensor data from the sensor module  and the outer loop target from the OLTG . Preferably, the OLCM  uses a control algorithm, such as a PID algorithm which operates in accordance with the PID parameters. The OLCM  adjusts the inner loop multiplier in accordance with the received data in order to reach the outer loop target.","The OLCM  is capable of pulsing the inner loop multiplier. When the pulse is \u201con\u201d, the output value is the computed inner loop multiplier. When the pulse is \u201coff\u201d, the output is set to a predetermined value.","The OLCM  controls outer loop gain. The outer loop gain curve describes a plot of gain multiplier versus impedance derived from the inner loop control curve, and thus the programming of the inner loop by way of the configuration parameters. The outer loop gain curve may be structured, for example, as a two-dimensional array. When outer loop gain control is enabled, the outer loop gain is multiplied by the gain multiplier that corresponds to the received impedance sensor data. The outer loop gain control stabilizes the system gain to maintain system gain that is close to constant. From the perspective of the outer loop controller , the system gain varies with patient load impedance due to the inner loop control curve programming. Conceptually, the outer loop gain is multiplied by the inverse of the normalized inner loop control curve, thus keeping the system gain close to constant. The outer loop gain curve specifies the inverse of the normalized inner loop control curve, where the outer loop gain curve may be further adjusted for keeping the system stable.","The HLA module  receives configuration data including at least one procedural algorithm selectable from algorithms for controlling the electrosurgical generator system  during specific types of procedures, or procedures performed under specific conditions, such as on specific organs. The procedural algorithms include algorithms, such as, vessel sealing (e.g., LigaSure\u2122 (standard and precise)), rate of change of impedance (dZ\/dt), lung, bowel, ablation, etc., and bypass algorithms, and a combination thereof; algorithm specific data for adjusting at least one specified procedural algorithm; sensor data from the sensor module ; time signals; user entered settings; and the activation amplitude setting from the configuration controller .","Preferably, the HLA module  uses a state based control algorithm. The HLA module  performs top level RF delivery algorithms which are primarily state based. The HLA module  has the capability of changing the configuration data of the lower level modules, including the ILTG , the ILCM , the OLTG  and the OLCM  and the waveform controller (). The HLA module  sets up the lower level modules in accordance with the received data by adjusting the corresponding configuration data as determined necessary. Furthermore, during a procedure the HLA module  reprograms the lower level modules in accordance with the received data by adjusting the corresponding configuration data in accordance with the algorithm selected, and in response to measured properties as indicated by the received sensor data, where the reprogramming may be performed in virtual real-time.","The user entered settings may be used in conjunction with any of the algorithms selected. Furthermore, the user entered settings may control the activation amplitude setting for one or more electrical or physical properties (e.g., power, current, voltage or temperature) without directly identifying the particular property and target setting. For example, the user may select from a variety of generic settings, where each generic setting includes a predetermined setting for one or more properties.","The waveform controller  receives configuration data including \u201con\u201d time, dead time, number of pulses per burst of pulses, and delay time between bursts of pulses. It is contemplated that the waveform controller  may be programmed by the HLA module  if determined necessary, and\/or by the configuration file via download from the configuration controller . The waveform controller  controls the hardware which generates a wave pattern (such as a square wave pattern) which drives FETs in the RF stage. Parameters of the waveform pattern that may be controlled by the waveform controller  include at least, \u201con\u201d time (pulse width of a single pulse), dead time (delay to next pulse), number of pulses per group of pulses, and delay time between groups of pulses.","The waveform generator  may receive an amplitude envelope parameter with the configuration parameters, and may further include circuitry, such as analog and\/or logic circuitry for adjusting amplitude of pulses within a burst of pulses. The amplitude envelope parameter may describe the amplitude setting for individual pulses of groups (or bursts) of pulses. The amplitude adjustments may be performed at a rate that is faster than the rate at which the software, such as the inner loop controller , is capable of providing control, so that the amplitude adjustments may be provided for individual pulses of groups of pulses. The waveform generator may receive a control signal, such as a control signal from the ILCM , indicative of the HV supply setpoint, for synchronizing the amplitude adjustments with the HV supply setpoint or with the signals output by the RF stage .","Preferably, the configuration controller  is a system which selects the required configuration files based on user input and download them to the rest of the system. It is contemplated that the configuration controller  may be removable and replaceable. The configuration controller receives configuration sensor data from the configuration sensor module  and\/or user input devices (not shown) for direct user input. The configuration controller  generates the configuration data and the activation amplitude setting in accordance with the received data. The configuration controller  selects the algorithm to be used by the ILTG , OLTG , OLCM  and the HLA . The configuration data is provided to the appropriate modules as described above, and the activation amplitude setting is provided to the HLA module .","The configuration controller may configure itself (or alternatively be configured by another processor) in accordance with conditions, such as the ESU and\/or the user interface to the electrosurgical generator system being used.","The configuration sensor module  includes sensors for sensing user actions, (including user actions not intentionally related to providing input to the configuration controller ), environmental conditions, patient conditions or other properties or conditions.

The information or additional information may be retrieved from a database accessible by the control system of the electrosurgical generator system .","The appropriate configuration files are selected or generated by the configuration controller . It is contemplated that at least a portion of the configuration files are stored by the configuration controller  and\/or associated memory. Accordingly, selected configuration files not stored by the configuration controller  may be downloaded to the configuration controller  through various methods. Upon activation of the electrosurgical generator system  the configuration controller  downloads the configuration files into the respective modules of the control system.","The control system for the electrosurgical generator system  provides a high degree of flexibility for performing a wide variety of different types of control for controlling the output of electrosurgical energy for use in a wide variety of types of procedures which may be performed under a wide variety of circumstances. Furthermore, the control system provides a wide variety of different types of control during a procedure, where the control and selection of the type of control is provided on the fly, or in virtual real time in response to properties associated with sensed properties and\/or user input or actions. The type of control provided may be selected in response to a variety of factors, such as sensed or input tissue response, type of electrosurgical instrument being used, patient profile, the type of procedure being performed, environmental conditions, the type of tissue being treated and the condition of the tissue being treated.","Although this disclosure has been described with respect to preferred embodiments, it will be readily apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art to which it appertains that changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the claims appended hereto."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Various embodiments will be described herein below with reference to the drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
