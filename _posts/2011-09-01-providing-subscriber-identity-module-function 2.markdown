{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention relates to apparatuses and methods relating to a user removable memory, particularly, though not exclusively, a Secure Digital (SD) memory card, providing a SIM function.","A SIM is an integrated circuit that securely stores information relating to a subscriber-based communications system, e.g. cellular telephony. The SIM stores, amongst other data, the service-subscriber key (International Subscriber Identity Module or ISMI) that is used to identify a subscriber on mobile telephony services such as on mobile phones and computers.","Typically, the SIM is held on a removable card (SIM card) provided by the subscriber's network operator, although it can be provided as a fixed, in-situ component or in theory as a file or program stored on internal memory. The removable form of SIM card is preferred as it allows subscribers to keep the same information, including telephone number, when changing portable device. For this purpose, portable devices are required to provide a dedicated hardware connector for the SIM card.","The use of dual SIM handsets is becoming common. Dual SIM handsets allow different users to share a particular handset without the first user having to remove their SIM card. Also, a single user may wish to make selected calls or use data services using different numbers or mobile networks. A typical example is where a first SIM is used for local calls and a second SIM is used for international calls.","There is a small number of handsets that currently provide two SIM connectors; these require additional hardware and, consequently, increase the size of handset. Existing handsets require users to manually change SIM cards. Further, the use of traditional SIM cards and their associated interfaces are limited in terms of the transmission rate, storage capacity and processing capacity that can be offered. Mobile network operators are therefore limited in terms of how they may customise complex services within SIM cards.","Many mobile handsets, data tablets and computers include an expansion card slot, e.g. a secure digital (SD) card slot, which allows users to expand storage capacity. SD cards are available in standard, mini or micro formats. Files in SD memory cards can be directly operated by heterogeneous platforms. In terms of expanding the hardware functionality of a handset, a number of existing standards exist, including the Secure Digital Input Output (SDIO) standard, although this standard requires specific hardware support at the host device and cannot be directly operated by heterogeneous platforms.","A first aspect of the invention provides apparatus comprising:\n\n","The apparatus may comprise means

write file access functions for communication to the user removable memory via the connector.","The apparatus may comprise means for converting a first SIM-related request signal to a write file access function and subsequently to transfer the write file access function and a first data parameter contained in the SIM-related request signal to the user removable memory.","The apparatus may

file access function and subsequently transferring the write file access function and a first data parameter contained in the SIM-related request signal to the user removable memory.","The method may further comprise, after a predetermined time period subsequent to the step of transferring the first data parameter, transferring a read access signal to the user removable memory and subsequently receiving a second data parameter from, and generated by, the user removable memory.","The method may further comprise opening on the apparatus a different file which is mapped by the apparatus to at least one different location associated with the SIM function on the user removable memory, transferring the mapping and the read access signal to the user removable memory, and receiving from the user removable memory the second data parameter for storage in the opened, different file.","The method may further comprise transferring, as the first data parameter, a parameter generated by a service provider and receiving, as the second data parameter, authentication data generated at the user removable memory using the service provider's parameter.","The method may further comprise providing the SIM-related request signals responsive to external requests received from a mobile communications service provider.","A third aspect provides a computer program comprising instructions that when executed by computer apparatus control it to perform the above method.","A fourth aspect of the invention provides a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having stored thereon

A system comprising a host processing apparatus and a user removable memory module which, in use, is connected to a connector of the host processing apparatus, and in which:\n\n","Embodiments described herein relate to a user removable memory card with in-built SIM functionality and a host apparatus configured to communicate with the memory card to achieve SIM functionality through a standard memory card hardware interface.","Specifically, embodiments relate to a SD memory card apparatus with an in-built SIM function (SD-SIM) enabling a host apparatus with a SD slot to utilise SIM functions through an existing SD slot without requiring a change in hardware. All that is required is appropriate software which can be provided on the host or by means of a software update which can be downloaded from a network or the on-board memory of the SD-SIM itself.","Communication between the host apparatus and the SD-SIM is performed using read\/write signaling in accordance with SD standards. No change is required to the host apparatus's hardware to achieve this function, thereby enabling devices with existing SD hardware to achieve SIM functionality, for example dual or further SIM functionality; without requiring further, SIM-specific hardware, on the handset.","Embodiments described herein also provide a SD-SIM which includes flash memory, as is the norm with SD cards, in addition to the SIM functionality. This memory can be used by the host apparatus for memory expansion purposes in the conventional manner, and provides a way in which updated software required by the host to access the SD-SIM can be acquired. Therefore, the SD-SIM can be provided as a true plug-and-play apparatus.","To achieve this, use of a so-called Universal Sensor Data (uSD) method is employed. uSD has been developed by the Applicant and further details can be found in uSD: Universal Sensor Data Entry Card, by Chunxiao Jiang et al in IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, Vol. 56, No. 3, August 2010, and US Patent Publication No. US20090287636, the entire contents of both of which are incorporated herein by reference. In brief, uSD is a platform independent hardware expansion method based on the SD standard, using the known SD card slot profile, transport protocol and File Allocation Table (FAT) file system. Compared with known card-based expansion systems, such as the known Secure Digital Input Output (SDIO) system, uSD requires no extra hardware such as SDIO host controllers, or software such as SDIO adapters, bus and client drivers, at the host. Accordingly, host devices having the hardware and software for memory expansion using a removable SD card can, using the embodiments described herein, achieve SIM functionality without specialised hardware and across heterogeneous platforms.","For the sake of convenience, and as introduced above, the following discussion will focus on SD card memories, which can be any of the standard, mini or micro formats, but the discussed implementations could be applied to other user removable memory. Examples include the multimedia card format, the compact flash (CF) format and the personal computer memory cards international association (PCMCIA) format.","To assist understanding of the embodiments, a brief description of a SIM and its function will now be described.","A SIM is usually an integrated circuit provided on a removable card. SIM cards store network-specific information used to authenticate and identify subscribers on a given mobile network. This information includes, among other data, the service-subscriber key or International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) which is used to identify a subscriber on a mobile telephony device, the integrated circuit card identifier (ICCID) which is unique to the card, an authentication key Ki, and an encryption key Kc. The authentication key Ki is a 128-bit value used in authenticating the SIM on the mobile network Each SIM holds a unique Ki assigned to it by the operator during the personalization process. The Ki is also stored in a database on the carrier's network.","The authentication process performed between the host device, to which the SIM is connected, and the network (mobile operator) is generally as follows.","Initially, when the host device is switched on, the IMSI is read from the SIM card and passed to the mobile operator over the network for requesting access and authentication. The operator searches its database and acquires the Ki corresponding to the received IMSI. The operator then generates a random number (RAND) and signs it with the acquired Ki to compute a signed response SRES_1. The operator then sends RAND over the network back to the host, which transfers RAND to the SIM. The SIM signs RAND with its own version of Ki, to compute a further response SRES_2. SRES_2 and the encryption key is then provided to the host which transmits SRES_2 back to the operator over the network. The operator then compares SRES_1 with SRES_2; if the two numbers match, the SIM is authenticated and the host device is granted communications access to the operator's network with Kc being used to encrypt subsequent communications between the host and the network.","Referring now to the Figures,  shows a portable communications terminal . The exterior of the terminal  has a touch sensitive display , hardware keys , a speaker  and a headphone port . Also provided on a peripheral edge of the terminal  is a SD card slot  (or SD host connector to give it its more proper term) into which a SD card can be inserted. Within the SD card slot  are provided connectors which, when a SD card is fully inserted into the slot, make electrical communication with corresponding connectors of the SD card. Further SD card slots can also be provided on the edge of the terminal , as indicated by the dotted line and referenced by numeral .","The above-described terminal  will hereafter be referred to as the \u2018host terminal\u2019 .","Referring now to , as further background, there is shown a generalised platform-independent SD memory card architecture  which is known in the art.","At the top level is\/are one or more SD memory card applications (Apps)  which can communicate with the SD memory card  through Application Programming Interfaces APIs. A file system  is provided by the relevant operating system, as is conventional, for example for providing the relevant \u2018open\u2019, \u2018read\u2019 and \u2018write\u2019 commands as and when required. The SD memory card driver , in the downwards direction, makes signaling interactions with the SD memory card  through the host connector. The SD memory card driver  provides access to files in the SD memory card , via the file system  in the operating system, such that the memory card applications  can realise application-layer functions by the file access functions. The SD host controller  is hardware which, in the downwards direction, makes signaling interactions with the SD memory card  through the SD host connector  (which is the mechanical card slot) and, in the upwards direction, provides a register interface.","Referring to , a uSD architecture  according to a preferred embodiment is shown. In the host terminal  are provided one or more applications (Apps) , a library (LIB) , an operating system (OS) , a SD host controller  and a SD host connector . It will therefore be appreciated that the only host-side component that is new is LIB , which is embodied in software; there is no change in host-side hardware. A more detailed description of the LIB  will, follow. Also shown in  is a uSD-SIM card  which includes flash memory (not shown) for providing memory expansion to the host , as well as a SIM  for providing SIM functionality as described previously. The uSD-SIM card  has the same physical form as a conventional SD card.","Referring to , a more detailed architecture of the uSD-SIM  is shown according to an exemplary embodiment. The connectors which make electrical contact with the host's SD host connector  are represented a SD bus . There are three main modules within the uSD-SIM , namely a FPGA , NAND flash  and the SIM function, comprising a microcontroller unit (MCU)  and the actual SIM .","Within the FPGA  is a SD interface  which offers the basic SD protocol, including analysing and translating commands from the host terminal , and transferring responses and data. When the host terminal  wishes to access files on the uSD-SIM card , the SD interface  acts as a data path selector depending on the address or addresses indicated by the host terminal. As indicated, a first data path  is shown, at the logical level, connecting the SD bus  to the NAND flash  via a conventional flash controller . This NAND flash  represents memory that is used to expand the host's own memory capabilities in the normal manner, A second data path  is shown, at the logical level, connecting the SD bus  to the SIM function (MCU  and SIM ) via a FIFO buffer . This data path  is therefore selected when the host terminal  indicates a different predetermined range of values.","At this stage, it is useful to explain the uSD addressing and so-called \u201cspecial file\u201d method. With reference to , there are shown (at the software level) file access interactions between the host operating system  and the uSD-SIM card . The uSD-SIM  is configured with the FAT file system but some files are specially organised, There are provided some virtual files , where \u2018virtual\u2019 means that these files are only registered in the FAT region of memory with names and addresses but without any concrete content. Although they are virtualised, the host terminal , when connected, can see the virtual files  and can access them like normal files using for example open, read and write commands. The access addresses of the virtual files are specific and predetermined; when the host terminal  accesses the virtual files , they can be translated into operations, in this case SIM functions. Accordingly, in the preferred embodiment, the addresses of the virtual files  are associated with SIM functions (commands) and accordingly if the host terminal  requests access to one or more of such virtual files, the relevant command and data is mapped by the SD interface  to the MCU  which processes the command\/data to perform the required function using the SIM .","The other, normal, files are associated with the NAND flash  and hence if the host terminal  addresses these files, conventional file read\/write signaling can be performed.","SIM operations are performed in a request (from the host terminal ) and response (to the host terminal) manner. When the host terminal  makes a request, it sends information to the SIM , which may for example be a compute\/calculate SRES_2 command with a RAND parameter (the command is the operator and the parameter is the operand), which command tells the SIM what to do. This request involves making a write operation to a virtual file . The SD interface  in the uSD-SIM  detects the write operation using the special address provided, and maps this address to the MCU  rather than the NAND flash . The parameter or command is then applied to the SIM , e.g. by executing the \u201ccomputer\/calculate SRES_2\u201d command. A subsequent read operation is performed by the host terminal  to collect the expected data, e.g. the SRES_2. When the host terminal  wants to receive information from the SIM , it reads a virtual file . The SD interface  in the uSD-SIM  detects this read operation using the \u2018special\u2019 address provided, and maps this address to the MCU  rather than the NAND flash . The MCU  executes the relevant command to acquire data from the SIM  and puts the data into the FIFO , The host terminal  will be responded to with this FIFO data, and from the host terminal's point of view, the data is the contents of the virtual file it accessed.","Therefore, data interactions between the host terminal  and the uSD-SIM  are based on conventional SD standard file operations, these being truly platform independent and plug-and-play as in a conventional SD card.","Referring now to , a more detailed architecture of the host terminal  architecture is shown. At the upper level is\/are one or more APP(s) which are application programs one or more of which may need to access SIM functionality, e.g. an APP for initiating a connection to a cellular network.","The LIB  comprises a number of components. Conventional APIs are provided, including SIM APIs, for handling signals received from the APP(s) . Functional logic  and a file system interface  within the LIB  is configured to translate the API calls from APPs into file operations, such as open, read and\/or write functions, which are of course standard functions in the SD protocol. As mentioned previously, the LIB  components can be provided in a software update with no hardware change being required.","The operating system (OS)  comprises a file system for performing for example the requested open, read and\/or write functions, and the SD host controller driver  are conventional, as is the SD host controller  and connector  (both hardware).","Referring now to , there is shown a sequence\/collaboration diagram which indicates the sequence of operations performed between the host terminal  and the uSD-SIM card  in sending data (\u201cSIM REQUEST\u201d) to the SIM  in order to obtain a new result or return value (\u201cSIM RESPONSE\u201d) generated by the SIM .","On the left hand side of the diagram, the LIB  actually refers to the file system interface component , and the operating system  and SD host controller  are combined as OS+HW for convenience.","Initially, when an APP initiates access to the uSD-SIM card , LIB  translates the APP's \u201cSIM access signal\u201d to one or more file access signal(s) in a form suitable for the OS . More particularly in this example embodiment, the LIB  causes the OS  to perform a file open (fopen(SPECIAL FILE in uSD)) action and a file write (fwrite(SIM REQUEST)) action, both of which are acknowledged back to the LIB in the conventional manner. The SPECIAL FILE in uSD comprises a physical address that is mapped to the MCU  by the uSD-SIM's SD interface .","For most of the OS , the write operation writes data to a file buffer on RAM instead of the uSD-SIM  and so, as will be understood, the LIB  may use a \u2018file flush\u2019 or fflush operation in order to instruct the OS  to move data to the uSD-SIM .","The OS+HW ,  transfers the address in \u201cSPECIAL FILE\u201d in uSD-SIM  to the SD interface  using the standard SD write command CMD24\/CMD25, waits for the acknowledgement response, and then transfers the SIM REQUEST data, which is again acknowledged.","At the uSD-SIM card , the SD interface  interprets the \u201cSPECIAL FILE in uSD\u201d address which is a virtual file mapped to the MCU , and which corresponds to a particular SIM function. The MCU  then decodes the received command and passes the SIM REQUEST data to the SIM . The response from the SIM  can be buffered at this stage.","In the host terminal , the LIB  can close the file with a fclose( ) command, if required.","In order for the host terminal  to retrieve the SIM Response from the uSD-SIM , the LIB  first waits for a predetermined time period. Next, the LIB  causes the OS  to perform a file open (fopen(SPECIAL FILE in uSD)) action and a file read (fread(SIM RESPONSE)) action. The SPECIAL FILE in uSD usually comprises a different physical address than that mentioned above, although it is also mapped to the MW  by the uSD-SIM's SD interface .","The OS+HW ,  transfers the \u201cSPECIAL FILE in uSD\u201d address to the SD interface  using the standard SD read command CMD17\/CMD18 and waits for the acknowledgement response.","At the uSD-SIM card , the SD interface  interprets the \u201cSPECIAL FILE in uSD\u201d address which is a virtual file mapped to the MCU , and which corresponds to a particular SIM function. The MCU  then decodes the received \u2018read\u2019 command to get the previously buffered SIM RESPONSE data which is buffered to the SD interface . The SD interface  returns the response to the host's OS+HW ,  as data. The OS+HW ,  fills the data into the buffer specified by the file read operation and returns. The LIB  receives the response and forwards to the APP  through its API.","The above write and read process is applicable to the previously-described SIM function, whereby the host apparatus  authenticates itself to the network by means of using the RAND parameter, which is applied to the uSD-SIM  in a write operation and the resulting SRES-2 parameter is read by the host apparatus  for transmission to the network operator.","It will be appreciated that the above principle of operation using SD standard file open, read and\/or write functions can be used in any number, order and combination.","It will also be appreciated that the term SIM equally applies to equivalent subscriber modules, for example the Universal Integrated Circuit Card UICC which runs on UMTS handsets and the Removable User Identity Module R-UIM which is popular in CDMA-based devices.","To summarise, a SD Memory Card Interface  is provided on a SD memory card  in order to transform the SD Memory Card file access command signaling, which had originated from the host terminal  (via SD Host Controller  and the SD Host Connector ) into an appropriate format of signaling which can be used by the SIM  to perform the SIM expansion. The SD Memory Card's Interface  then returns the results of the operation to the host in the form of file access results\/responses.","Given that the host apparatus  at least supports the expansion of storage capacity using the SD card format, the modified SD card  provides both a memory and SIM expansion of the SD memory card without the host apparatus  having to use signaling which is only appropriate for the particular SIM functionality provided by the memory card. Read\/write commands can be used, at least from the perspective of the host apparatus  to control the expanded operation provided by the SD memory card .","In this way, the SIM  is identified to the host apparatus  as a SD Memory Card, and hence addresses the \u201cplatform heterogeneity\u201d issue, and achieves a more platform independence capability.","All programs (e.g. special applications which are OS&CPU independent, normal applications and special drivers which are OS\/CPU dependent) can be saved in the SD storage card , in order to realize the \u201cplug-and-play\u201d capability.","The additional time required to implement this method is now considered.
