Firing temperatures in modern gas turbine engines continue to increase in response to the demand for higher efficiency engines. Superalloy materials have been developed to withstand the corrosive high temperature environment that exists within a gas turbine engine. However, even superalloy materials are not able to withstand extended exposure to the hot combustion gas of a current generation gas turbine engine without some form of cooling and\/or thermal insulation.","The instrumentation of a component such as a blade or vane within a gas turbine typically includes placing wire leads on the balance wheel, which continue on to the blade airfoil. The wire leads are typically held together by an epoxy. These wires are routed from within the component to the turbine casing. The pressure boundary of a component may be breached to introduce a sensor such as a thermocouple and a braze is back filled to hold the thermocouple in place. Each thermocouple sensor has wire leads coming out of the component that are connected back to a diagnostic unit. Instrumenting a plurality of components in this manner results in an extensive network of wires just for monitoring the single operating condition of temperature.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","10","12","14","16","12","14","16","10","16","18","20","22","18","22","18","18","22","26","12","19","23"]},"In use, air is drawn in through compressor , where it is compressed and driven towards combustor . Combustor  mixes the air with fuel and ignites it thereby forming a working gas. This working gas temperature will typically be above about 1300\u00b0 C. This gas expands through turbine , being guided across blades  by vanes . As the gas passes through turbine , it rotates blades  and shaft , thereby transmitting usable mechanical work through shaft . Combustion turbine  may also include a cooling system (not shown), dimensioned and configured to supply a coolant, for example steam or compressed air, to blades  and vanes .","The environment within which turbine blades  and vanes  operate is particularly harsh, being subject to high operating temperatures and corrosive atmosphere, which may result in serious deterioration of blades  and vanes . This is especially likely if the thermal barrier coating  should spall or otherwise deteriorate. Embodiments of the invention are advantageous because components may transmit data indicative of a component's condition during operation of combustion turbine .","U.S. Pat. No. 6,576,861, which is specifically incorporated herein by reference, discloses a method and apparatus that may be used to deposit embodiments of sensors and sensor connectors with transmitters in accordance with aspects of the present invention. In this respect, methods and apparatus disclosed therein may be used for the patterning of fine sensor and\/or connector features of between about 100 microns and 500 microns without the need of using masks. Multilayer electrical circuits and sensors may be formed by depositing features using conductive materials, resistive materials, dielectric materials, insulative materials and other application specific materials. Alternate methods may be used to deposit multilayer electrical circuits and sensors in accordance with aspects of the invention. For example, thermal spraying, vapor deposition, laser sintering and curing deposits of material sprayed at lower temperatures may be used as well as other suitable techniques.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["23","12","23","50","52","50","54","56","52","50","54","52","50","54"]},"Transmitters  may be multi-channel and have various specifications depending on their location within a casing of combustion turbine . Transmitters  may be configured to function within the early stages of compressor , which are subject to operating temperatures of between about 80\u00b0 C. to 120\u00b0 C. Transmitters  may be configured to function within later stages of compressor  and\/or stages of turbine  subject to operating temperatures of greater than about 120\u00b0 C. and up to about 300\u00b0 C. Transmitters  may be fabricated using silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology and other materials capable of operating in regions with temperatures greater than about 120\u00b0 C.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["23","50","52","50","54","51","54","54","50","52","56","56","58","12","56","54","54"]},"One or more sensors  may be connected with one or more compressor vanes  by fabricating or depositing sensor  and connector  directly onto a surface of vane . Connector  may extend from sensor  to a termination location, such as the peripheral edge of vane  so that a distal end  of connector  is exposed for connection to transmitter . Sensor  and connector  may be positioned on vane  to minimize any adverse affect on the aerodynamics of vane . Embodiments allow for a distal end  of connectors  to be exposed at a termination location, which may be proximate a peripheral edge of a component or other suitable location. This allows a field technician to quickly and easily connect connector  to a transmitter  regardless of its location.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["61","60","60","62","64","64","16","18","61","66","10"]},"Type K thermocouple materials NiCr or NiAl may be used in sections of compressor  having an operating environment up to approximately 800\u00b0 C. For example, NiCr(20) may be used to deposit a strain gage in compressor . Type N thermocouple material, such as alloys of NiCrSi and NiSi, for example, may be used for depositing sensors in sections of turbine  having an operating environment between approximately 800\u00b0 C. to 1150\u00b0 C.","Type S, B and R thermocouple materials may be used for depositing sensors in sections of turbine  having an operating environment between approximately 1150\u00b0 C. to 1350\u00b0 C. For example, Pt\u2014Rh, Pt\u2014Rh(10) and Pt\u2014Rh(13) may be deposited to form sensors  within turbine  provided that the material generates an acceptable thermoelectric voltage for a particular application within combustion turbine . Ni alloys, for example NiCr, NiCrSi, NiSi and other oxidation-resistant Ni-based alloys such as MCrAlX, where M may be Fe, Ni or Co, and X may be Y, Ta, Si, Hf, Ti, and combinations thereof, may be used as sensing materials for high temperature applications in deeper sections of compressor  and throughout turbine . These alloys may be used as sensing material deposited in various sensing configurations to form sensors such as heat flux sensors, strain sensors and wear sensors.","Components within combustion turbine , such as blades ,  and\/or vanes ,  may have application specific sensors  deposited to conform to a component's surface and\/or embedded within a barrier or other coating deposited within combustion turbine . For example,  shows an exemplary turbine blade , which may be a blade from row  of turbine , having high temperature resistant lead wires, such as connectors  deposited to connect an embedded or surface mounted sensor  with a wireless telemetry device . Device  may be mounted in a location where the telemetry components are exposed to relatively lower temperatures, such as proximate the root  of blade  where the operating temperature is typically about 150\u00b0 C.-250\u00b0 C. and higher.","Silicon-based electronic semiconductors, such as those that may be used for transmitting data may have limited applications due to their operational temperature constraints. Temperature and performance properties of silicon and silicon-on-insulator (SOI) electronic chip technologies may limit their applications to operating environments of less than about 200\u00b0 C. Aspects of the invention allow for such electronic systems to be deployed for wireless telemetry device  within compressor , which typically has an operating temperature of about 100-150\u00b0 C.","Embodiments of wireless telemetry sensor systems may be configured to operate within higher temperature regions present in later stages of compressor , and within turbine . These regions may have operating temperatures of about 150-250\u00b0 C. and higher. Materials having temperature and electrical properties capable of operation in these higher temperature regions may be used for depositing sensors , , connectors ,  and fabricating wireless telemetry devices .","Sensors  and high temperature interconnect lines or connectors  may be deposited using known deposition processes such as plasma spraying, EB PVD, CVD, pulsed laser deposition, mini-plasma, direct-write, mini-HVOF or solution plasma spraying. Typically, dynamic pressure measurements, dynamic and static strain, and dynamic acceleration measurements are desired on both stationary and rotating components of combustion turbine  together with component surface temperature and heat flux measurements. Thus, embedded or surface mounted sensors  may be configured as strain gages, thermocouples, heat-flux sensors, pressure transducers, micro-accelerometers as well as other desired sensors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["76","76","76","12","16"]},"Wireless telemetry device  may include a board , an electronic circuit , an operational amplifier , a modulator  and an RF oscillator\/transmitter  electrically connected with each other via interconnects .

For example, transmitter  may be affixed to a transition area, or platform, above the fir tree portion of root  and antenna  may be affixed to a face of root . Alternately, recesses may be formed within the platform and face so that all or a portion of transmitter  and\/or antenna  are seated below the surface of the outer mold line of blade root . Transmitter  and antenna  may be secured within respective recesses using an epoxy or adhesive and a backfill material may be place over them for protection from high temperatures or particulates.","With respect to , wireless telemetry device  may be affixed to blade root  externally or embedded in such a way so that an outer mold line of the blade root is not significantly altered. Device  may be affixed proximate blade root  so that it is contained within a cavity that is created between the blade root  and a rotor disk of turbine  when blade root  is inserted within the rotor disk. This enables a turbine blade  instrumented with sensor , connectors  and device  to be installed into a mating segment of a rotor disk of turbine  in the same manner as a turbine blade that is not instrumented. In this respect, instrumented blade  may be manufactured having all components necessary for wirelessly extracting data indicative of various operating parameters or conditions of blade  and\/or a barrier coating deposited thereon and transmitting that data to a receiving device.","For example, one or more recesses or trenches may be formed into a portion of the substrate of blade , such as blade root , within which one or more wireless telemetry devices  may be contained. Trenches may be formed by milling out desired regions of blade root  and securing device  within the trench with an epoxy or other suitable binder.
