As such, any description herein making reference to any particular medical device is not to be taken as a limitation of the type of medical device which can benefit from and which can employ the EMI protection as described herein.","Further, although the EMI protection may be beneficial for implantable medical devices, such protection is no manner limited to such applications. For example, such protection may be beneficial for many different types of circuitry (e.g., whether for medical use or not, whether for an implantable medical device or not). For example, one or more types of circuits that may benefit from such EMI protection may include circuits such as sensor circuits, pacing circuits, timing circuits, telemetry circuits, etc.","The apparatus , as shown generally in the exploded views of , includes a first Faraday cage portion  and a second Faraday cage portion . The first Faraday cage portion  includes a first conductive portion  and the second Faraday cage portion  includes a second conductive portion . When assembled and\/or bonded together, the first and second Faraday cage portions ,  provide the Faraday cage enclosure  surrounding the at least one circuit device . In other words, at least in one embodiment, the first conductive portion and the second conductive portion are in electrical connection so as to provide the Faraday cage enclosure  (e.g., such as the Faraday cage enclosure  as shown in  or the Faraday cage enclosure  as shown in ).","Wafer scale fabrication techniques may be used to form each of the first and second Faraday cage portions , . Generally, in one or more embodiments, each of the first Faraday cage portion  and the second Faraday cage portion  include a substrate provided from or as a part of a wafer (e.g., a portion of any size and shape of substrate usable in wafer scale fabrication processes, such as a circular silicon wafer, a glass substrate, etc.). In other words, multiple cage portions may be fabricated on a wafer (e.g., the first Faraday cage portions on a first wafer and the second Faraday cage portions on a second wafer). As such, the fabrication of each of the Faraday cage portions may be initiated with use of a wafer substrate (e.g., a semiconductor substrate wafer). In one or more embodiments, the wafer substrate is a doped semiconductor wafer substrate (e.g., doped to either a bulk n-type or p-type wafer), such as those used as the base substrate for microelectronic devices (e.g., substrates built in and over using one or more microfabrication process steps such as doping, ion implantation, etching, deposition of various materials, and photolithographic patterning processes). In one or more embodiments, the semiconductor wafer is a silicon wafer. However, other available types of semiconductor wafers may be used, such as, for example, a gallium arsenide wafer, a germanium wafer, a silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer, etc. Further, for example, in one or more embodiments, the substrate may be formed of one or more materials other than semiconductor material, such as a glass substrate, wherein the substrate includes a metal film.

In one or more other embodiments, the one or more layers  may also provide the circuit device that is to be connected to a location outside of the Faraday cage enclosure  by the electrical interconnect  (e.g., the circuit device would not be provided separately for positioning on the connection surface ).","Still further, in one or more embodiments, the apparatus  (e.g., the first Faraday cage portion  and\/or the second Faraday cage portion ) may not include interconnects or vias connecting the circuit device  to contact pads outside of the Faraday cage enclosure  and\/or apparatus . For example, in at least one embodiment, the apparatus  may include various apparatus and\/or structures to wirelessly communicate to other devices\/apparatus outside of the Faraday cage enclosure  and\/or apparatus .","At least in one embodiment, connection surface  defined at least partly by the one or more layers  may include oxide material (e.g., in surface regions apart from one or more conductive portions of the connection surface , such as the one or more via contacts , interconnect conductive pads , etc.). For example, such oxide material may be oxide material formed, deposited or grown as part of one or more processing steps (e.g., oxides such as BPSG, silicon oxide, native oxide, etc.).","In one or more embodiments, a plurality of conductive vias represented generally by reference numeral  are formed in the one or more layers  to provide another part of the first conductive portion  of the Faraday cage enclosure  (e.g., to provide at least portions of one or more side walls of the Faraday cage enclosure). Each of the plurality of conductive vias  are in electrical contact with the bottom part of the Faraday cage enclosure (e.g., in contact with the patterned metal layer formed on the substrate in one or more embodiments, or in contact with the conductive substrate in other embodiments). Further, the plurality of conductive vias  terminate in via contacts  at the connection surface  of the first Faraday cage portion .","Further, for example, in one or more embodiments, the first Faraday cage portion  includes one or more interconnect vias  outside of the Faraday cage enclosure . The one or more interconnect vias , for example, terminate with one or more conductive pads  at the connection surface  (e.g., for use in providing accessible surface contacts, such as surface contacts  at a surface of at least one of the first and second Faraday cage portions , ). In one or more embodiments, the electrical interconnect  passes through one or more insulated locations  of the Faraday cage enclosure  to connect to the one or more interconnect vias .","The formation of the interconnect , the conductive vias , interconnect vias , and one or more of the various conductive pads or contacts of the first Faraday cage  (as well as those of the second Faraday cage ) may be formed using standard microelectronic fabrication processing techniques (e.g., such as etching of materials, deposition of materials, and photolithographic patterning process steps, etc.). Various portions of first and second Faraday cages ,  may be formed during the same or different processing steps. For example, a portion of a stacked via that may be used to provided a portion of an interconnect via  may be formed with an interconnect layer within the Faraday cage enclosure  used to provide a portion of the interconnect . Further, for example, portions of a circuit device may be formed with the stacked via and\/or with an interconnect layer within the Faraday cage enclosure  used to provide a portion of the interconnect . Still further, for example, process steps to form the vias may be completely separate therefrom, such as in the formation of a through silicon via after other layer processing is completed. The present disclosure is not limited to any particular processing, or timing or order, of such process steps. However, some types of processing and order thereof may be beneficial over other types.","The one or more vias described herein may be constructed in one or more suitable forms for providing the functionality thereof in accordance to the disclosure provided herein. For example, the interconnect vias  of the first Faraday cage portion  may be formed as stacked interconnect vias formed as the one or more layers  are constructed. Further, for example, other vias described herein may be formed as through silicon vias. For example, as described further herein, in one or more embodiments, the interconnect vias  of the second Faraday cage enclosure  or the conductive vias  thereof may be advantageously formed using through silicon vias. Further, other types of vias, such as trench vias or the like, may be used.","The plurality of conductive vias, such as vias  of the first Faraday cage portion  or vias  of the second Faraday cage portion , may be provided in one or more configurations suitable for reducing EMI. For example, any configuration suitable for shielding the interior of the cage enclosure  from external electromagnetic radiation may be used (e.g., the conductive portions  and  are thick enough and any holes in the enclosure are significantly smaller than the radiation's wavelength). One or more different via configurations are shown and described with reference to . However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto as various configurations of conductive vias may be used to provide the conductive functionality of such vias in the formation of the Faraday cage enclosure .","For example, in one or more embodiments, conductive vias  may be fowled in a side by side configuration (e.g., one or more rows of vias) to form the perimeter of the Faraday cage enclosure (e.g., the side walls or portion thereof) as shown in . The spacing between such side by side vias in the configuration shown in  would be smaller than the wavelength of the radiation to be prevented from affecting the circuit device's performance. Further, for example, in one or more embodiments, the vias may be formed in multiple rows of side by side vias  to form the perimeter of the Faraday cage enclosure as shown in . The vias of such rows are offset from one another such that the spacing between vias in the rows need not be as close together to effectively block radiation. Still further, for example, in one or more embodiments, the plurality of vias may be provided by one or more trenches  (e.g., trench vias) formed about the perimeter of the Faraday cage enclosure (e.g., as the side wall of the enclosure) as shown in . In other words, as used herein, a plurality of conductive vias refers to any type of via, including trenches formed to perform the same functionality.","In one or more embodiments, the conductive materials used to form the Faraday cage enclosure may be any suitable material effective for use in mitigating the effects of EMI on the circuit device . For example, in one or more embodiments, conductive materials such as one or more metals (e.g., aluminum, copper, etc.) may be used for forming the top and bottom portions of the Faraday cage enclosure . Further, for example, in one or more embodiments, the conductive vias may be lined and\/or filled with conductive materials including, for example, one or more metals (e.g., tungsten, titanium, copper, etc.).","In one or more embodiments, the second Faraday cage portion  provides the second conductive portion  of the Faraday cage enclosure  surrounding the at least one circuit device . For example, in one or more embodiments, the second Faraday cage portion  includes the substrate  provided from or as a part of a wafer. In one or more embodiments, a conductive semiconductor substrate  itself provides the second conductive portion  (see ), while in one or more other embodiments, one or more other features are provided (e.g., conductive vias and metallization layers such as shown in ) to provide parts of the conductive portion  of the Faraday cage enclosure .","For example, in one or more embodiments, a plurality of conductive vias (shown generally by lines ) are formed in the substrate  corresponding to the plurality of conductive vias  of the first Faraday cage portion . The plurality of conductive vias  provide a part of the second conductive portion  of the Faraday cage enclosure  (e.g., such as forming the side walls of the Faraday enclosure ). For example, each of the plurality of conductive vias  of the second Faraday cage portion  may extend between a connection surface  of the substrate  and a surface  of the substrate opposite the connection surface .","At least in one embodiment, to form the remainder of the conductive portion  when conductive vias  are used to form a part of the Faraday cage enclosure , at least one patterned metal layer (represented generally by reference numeral ) may be formed on the surface  of the substrate  opposite the connection surface  and in electrical contact with the plurality of conductive vias  of the second Faraday cage  (e.g., forming a top portion of the Faraday enclosure ). However, in one or more other embodiments, the substrate itself (e.g., a doped conductive semiconductor substrate from or part of a semiconductor wafer) provides the conductive portion  of the second Faraday cage portion  (e.g., both the side walls represented generally by reference numeral  and the top of the Faraday enclosure  as represented generally by reference numeral ).","At least in one embodiment, connection surface  may include oxide material (e.g., in surface regions apart from one or more conductive portions of the connection surface , such as the one or more vias , interconnect conductive vias , etc.). For example, such oxide material may be oxide material deposited or grown as part of one or more processing steps (e.g., oxides such as BPSG, silicon oxide, native oxide, etc.).","In one or more embodiments, the second Faraday cage portion  includes the one or more interconnect vias  extending therein from connection surface  and terminating at one or more surface contacts  at surface  of the second Faraday cage portion .

Surface contacts  may be located at any outer surface of the apparatus  with appropriate connection routing. However, some locations may be more beneficial than others. The surface contacts are configured for connection to one or more other conductive components, such as, without limitation, pads on a target board, lead conductors, etc.","In one or more embodiments where vias are formed in the substrate, such vias may be formed as through vias (e.g., such as through silicon vias formed in a silicon substrate) extending through the substrate (and even one or more layers formed thereon). For example, the interconnect vias  may be constructed using through via techniques (e.g., through silicon via techniques), as well as the other conductive vias (represented generally by reference numeral ). For example, in one or more embodiments, without limitation, the vias may be formed by defining a hole (e.g., using a dry or wet etch) through a silicon substrate (e.g., may be etched through overlying layers of metal and dielectric formed thereon or therein using deep reactive ion etching process). Further, such holes may be formed by laser drilling or sand blasting. The hole may be lined with a dielectric (e.g., native oxide formation, the growing of oxide material (e.g., silicon oxide), or deposition of a dielectric material), and thereafter filled or lined with one or more conductive materials.","In one or more embodiments, a cavity  may be defined in the connection surface ,  of at least one of the first and second Faraday cage portions ,  (e.g., the cavity may be defined in either one of the surfaces or a portion of the cavity defined in both). The cavity  is surrounded by the Faraday cage enclosure  (e.g., by the first conductive portion and the second conductive portion when the cage portions ,  are, for example, bonded together). In one or more embodiments, the cavity  is defined in the connection surface  (e.g., to a depth within the substrate) of the second Faraday cage portion  and is sized to receive the circuit device  for connection of the one or more device contacts  thereof to the one or more of conductive contact pads  of the first Faraday cage portion . In one or more other embodiments, a cavity need not be defined. For example, one or more circuit devices may be formed as part of the first and\/or second Faraday cage portions ,  (e.g., one or more circuit devices may be formed in one or more layers of one of the cage portions, formed in each cage portion with the devices being separately connected to a location outside of the Faraday cage enclosure, formed in each cage portion with the devices being electrically connected to one another via conductive pads such as at the connection surfaces of the cage portions, or formed in one or more of cage portions and electrically connected in any other suitable manner).","To form the apparatus , the first Faraday cage portion  and the second Faraday cage portion  are coupled together (e.g., the circuit device  positioned in the cavity  is surrounded by the Faraday cage enclosure  formed by the Faraday cage portions  and ; the enclosure  formed by the first conductive portion  and the second conductive portion  being electrically coupled). For example, in one or more embodiments, the connection surfaces ,  of first Faraday cage portion  and the second Faraday cage portion  may be bonded together to assemble the apparatus . In such a manner, in one or more embodiments, the plurality of conductive vias  of the first Faraday cage portion  and the plurality of conductive vias  of the second Faraday cage portion  are electrically connected when the connection surface  of the first Faraday cage portion  is bonded to the connection surface  of the second Faraday cage portion ; thus, completing the formation of the Faraday cage enclosure .

For example, use of oxide bonding permits oxide surfaces (e.g., portions of the connection surfaces ,  of the first and second Faraday cage portions ,  including an oxide material, such as silicon oxide) to be bonded together. Further, for example, in one or more embodiments, the connection surfaces may be chemical mechanically polished or planarized to expose any conductive portions thereof (e.g., the via contacts  at connection surface , or conductive pads  at connection surface ) to be exposed. For example, when the oxide portions and the conductive portions at the connection surface  (e.g., a planar surface) are aligned with the oxide portions and the conductive portions of the connection surface  (e.g., a planar surface), oxide bonding may be performed. For example, oxide bonding processes may form a bond between oxide portions of the connection surfaces ,  of the first and second Faraday cage portions ,  without the need for adhesives or other intermediate layers may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["210","200","290","210","290","290","291","228","292"]},"The apparatus  further includes a first Faraday cage portion  that provides a first conductive portion  and a second Faraday cage portion  that provides a second conductive portion  of the Faraday cage enclosure  surrounding the at least one circuit device .
