Field of the Invention","The embodiments herein generally relate to numerical methods, and, more particularly, to numerical methods for forest meteorology and acoustic computations and applications.","2. Description of the Related Art","Acoustic sensors are emerging as a key technology for providing battlefield situational awareness necessary to protect ground combat troops. Advantages of acoustic sensors include low cost, compactness, passive operation, low power consumption, and non-line-of-sight capability. Many new systems use acoustical arrays to detect, classify, estimate bearing, and cue narrow field-of-view (FOV) optics. Some new systems use multiple, networked arrays to track targets by bearing estimation and triangulation. At the same time, acoustic sensor performance is strongly affected by the atmospheric environment. It is anticipated therefore, that improved physics-based theory and computer models for meteorology coupled to acoustics (in and around forests) will contribute important information on the performance of advanced combat sensors, systems, and communications as well as the effectiveness of battlefield computer aids to increase situational awareness.","Some of the conventional techniques related to numerical models for forest meteorology include exponential or extinction profile models, which are formulated to predict one-dimensional (1D) wind speeds primarily in the mid-to-upper portion of the forest canopy. Unfortunately, these exponential or extinction profile models tend to be difficult to combine to observed or estimated wind speeds above the treetops or below the layer of leaves and branches. In addition, extinction profile models are typically not formulated to predict temperatures within and above forests, which are needed to compute sound speed.","Prior art related to the development of numerical model codes for forest meteorology were generally formulated to predict one-dimensional wind speeds and turbulence within and above uniform forest canopies. In these models, radiation and energy budget algorithms were not included to predict the heat source (temperatures and sound speed). In contrast, the three-dimensional Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model described by Albertson et al., \u201cRelative Importance of Local and Regional Controls on Coupled Water,\u201d (2001), did consider energy budget effects, however, this as well as other LES models are quite computationally intensive and are not within a computational framework that is most efficient for a rapid and reliable prediction of acoustic propagation in forest environments. In one further case, the prior art, as described by Meyers and Paw U, \u201cModeling the Plant Canopy Micrometeorology with Higher Order Closure Principles,\u201d Agric. For. Meteorol., Agric. For Meteorol., 41, 143-63 (1987) and Pyles et al., \u201cThe UCD Advanced Canopy-Atmosphere-soil Algorithm:\n\n","Prior art related to ray path model codes for acoustic propagation and transmission loss generally assume homogeneous sound and wind speed fields (e.g., Moler CB and Solomon LP, \u201cUse of splines and numerical integration in geometrical acoustics.\u201d J Acoust Soc Am 48: 739-744, 1970; Hallberg B, Larsson C and Israelsson S \u201cNumerical ray tracing in the atmospheric surface layer\u201d J Acoust Soc Am 83: 2059-2068, 1988; Huisman W H T \u201cSound propagation over vegetation-covered ground,\u201d Dissertation, Univ.

The advantage of the invention described herein is that the acoustic models are based on the principles and theory for geometrical acoustics for an inhomogeneous moving medium. Ray paths are thus computed as a function of range dependent wind and sound speed fields. These data are provided independently from 1D and 2D, physics-based, meteorological model for forests (Tunick A (2003a) \u201cCalculating the micrometeorological influences on the speed of sound through the atmosphere in forests,\u201d J Acoust Soc Am 114: 1796-1806, Tunick, A.

(2004a): Toward improving the efficiency and realism of coupled meteorological-acoustic computer models for the forest canopy. ARL-MR-586, April, U.S. Army Research Laboratory, 2004). In addition, acoustic intensity due to geometrical divergence (i.e., energy loss due to spherical spreading) is computed as an inverse function of range and the height difference between two adjacent rays. At the same time, acoustic intensity gain (or loss) due to frequency-dependent ground effects are included in the model calculation. Note that while the acoustic numerical models embedded in this invention are much simpler than parabolic equation or fast field acoustic programs (West et al., 1991, 1992; Noble J M (2003) User's manual for the Microsoft window edition of the scanning fast-field program (SCAFFIP) version 3.0. ARL-TR-2696, US Army Research Laboratory, 2800 Powder Mill Rd, Adelphi, Md. 20783-1197. [Available from the DTIC at http:\/\/stinet.dtic.mil\/str\/]), ray path models have nevertheless been shown to be a practical and useful tool for analyzing and interpreting refraction effects on sound waves.","Other conventional models include first-order closure, physics-based models, which are formulated to predict two-dimensional (2D) wind speeds and turbulence within and above forest canopies. Here, radiation and energy budget methodologies are generally not included to predict the heat source (temperatures and sound speed). Additionally, second-order closure, physics-based models have been developed to predict one-dimensional (1D) wind speeds and turbulence within and above forest canopies. Again, radiation and energy budget methodologies are not included to predict the heat source (temperatures and sound speed). Furthermore, higher-order closure, physics-based models such as three-dimensional (3D) Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models have been formulated to predict 3D wind speeds, temperatures, humidity, and turbulence within and above forest canopies. Here, radiation and energy budget algorithms are sometimes incorporated to predict the heat and moisture sources. However, these models tend to be quite computationally intensive, especially with regard to turbulence and advection scheme methodologies. Also, they can offer much more information related to soil and plant physics than is necessary for the rapid and reliable prediction of sound speed in and around forest canopies.","Conventional techniques related to ray path model codes for acoustic propagation and transmission loss generally assume homogeneous sound and wind speed fields. However, forest stands are typically inhomogeneous, containing non-uniform distributions of canopy height and leaf area density. In addition, open fields, roadways, and buildings often border forests. Generally, the conventional techniques primarily show the development of forest canopy wind flow and turbulence models only. However, there remains a need for a forest meteorology and acoustic computation technique that takes into account horizontally non-uniform sound speed information.","Furthermore, an advantage of this invention over the prior art is that it combines the inventors' existing numerical models developed in accordance with the invention and those still in development into a comprehensive process, which includes input, memory and computing devices, numerical codes, and graphics display. The invention necessarily addresses both the thermodynamic and mechanical influences on sound speed within and above forest canopies. Numerical models are executed in a computationally efficient framework. Hence, the invention is a novel process to obtain rapid and reliable predictions of useful acoustic and meteorological information, which can be applied to the study of meteorological aspects of acoustic propagation within and above forests.","In view of the foregoing, the embodiments herein provide a method of predicting multi-dimensional meteorological and acoustic effects within and above a forest environment, and a program storage device readable by computer, tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by the computer to perform a method of predicting multi-dimensional meteorological and acoustic effects within and above a forest environment, wherein the method comprises collecting input data comprising meteorological and forest canopy characterization data for a specified forest environment; inputting the input data into program meteorology modules comprising an embedded radiative transfer and energy budget methodology module adapted to predict a heat source within and above the forest environment for any location at any time; calculating an incoming total radiation at a top of the forest environment; outputting multi-dimensional acoustics and meteorology numerical codes based on the program meteorology modules and the calculated total radiation; and formulating sound speeds within and above the forest environment based on the numerical codes. Preferably, the input data further comprises site location data, cloud cover data, wind speed data, temperature data, humidity data, time of day data, day of year characteristics data, and environment characterization data for the forest environment.","Additionally, the environment characterization data preferably comprises tree height data, leaf area density data, and drag coefficient data affecting the forest environment. Moreover, the embedded radiative transfer and energy budget methodology preferably predicts a heat source within and above the forest environment. Preferably, the calculating of the incoming total radiation at the top of the forest environment allows for calculations of a transmission, reflection, absorption, and emission of a solar flux within the forest environment. Also, the program meteorology modules may comprise acoustic transmission loss modules, acoustic ray path modules, one-dimensional meteorological modules for the forest environments, and two-dimensional meteorological modules for forest environments. Preferably, the two-dimensional meteorological modules for the forest environments comprises variable grid modules, and wherein the method further comprises applying the variable grid modules to the acoustic transmission loss modules and the acoustic ray path modules.","The invention described herein is a method that inputs readily available meteorological and forest characterization data to a computer. On the computer reside numerical model codes for acoustics and meteorology within and above forests. The embodiments for meteorology are steady-state, second-order turbulence closure models, with an embedded radiative transfer and energy budget algorithm to predict the heat source for any location at any time of day. Formulations co-developed by the inventors are used to calculate the incoming total radiation at the canopy top, which is necessary in order to calculate the transmission, reflection, absorption, and emission of the solar flux through the forest. The computer then executes meteorological and acoustics numerical models and provides as output (to a graphics display device) a rapid and reliable prediction of sound speed and transmission loss information in uniform and complex wooded areas.  presents a schematic of the process.","A key element in determining point-to-point acoustic transmission in forests is modeling the variation (with height above ground) of the wind and sound speed. Sound speed is readily derived from estimates of air temperature and relative humidity (albeit, variations in sound speed caused by changes in relative humidity are comparatively small). The invention discussed herein is a method that uses meteorological and acoustics numerical models embedded into a computing device to predict and graphically display rapid and reliable meteorology and acoustic transmission loss information within and above forest canopies. This process can be important in assessing the performance of advanced acoustic sensors and communications as well as determining the effectiveness of battlefield computer aids to increase situational awareness. Potential uses include studying the effects of forest meteorology on sound blast propagation for noise abatement studies at military training sites. The invention may also be utilized by the EPA in noise abatement studies; i.e., investigating the effectiveness of forests to reduce traffic and\/or airport noise and the like.","Another embodiment provides a system of predicting multi-dimensional meteorological and acoustic effects within and above a forest environment, wherein the system comprises a computer memory device comprising input data corresponding to meteorological and forest canopy characterization data for a specified forest environment; a processor operatively connected to the computer memory device, wherein the processor is adapted to input the input data into program meteorology modules comprising an embedded radiative transfer and energy budget methodology module to predict a heat source within and above the forest environment for any location at any time; a calculating device operatively connected to the processor, wherein the calculating device is adapted to calculate an incoming total radiation at a top of the forest environment; a computing device operatively connected to the calculating device, wherein the computing device is adapted to output multi-dimensional acoustics and meteorology numerical codes based on the program meteorology modules and the calculated total radiation; and formulate sound speeds within and above the forest environment based on the numerical codes; and a graphic user interface operatively connected to the computing device, wherein the graphic user interface is adapted to display the acoustic speeds within and above the forest environment. Preferably, the input data further comprises site location data, cloud cover data, wind speed data, temperature data, humidity data, time of day data, day of year characteristics data, and environment characterization data for the forest environment.","Additionally, the environment characterization data preferably comprises tree height data, leaf area density data, and drag coefficient data affecting the forest environment. Moreover, the embedded radiative transfer and energy budget methodology module is preferably adapted to predict a heat source within and above the forest environment.

It should be understood, however, that the following descriptions, while indicating preferred embodiments and numerous specific details thereof, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments herein without departing from the spirit thereof, and the embodiments herein include all such modifications.","The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments herein. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments herein may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the embodiments herein. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein.","In a previous study (Tunick, 2003a), it was found that a useful mathematical representation of the wind flow, temperatures, and turbulence inside and above a uniform, continuous forest stand could be obtained by means of a one-dimensional (1-D), steady-state, second-order turbulence closure model, with an embedded radiative transfer and energy budget algorithm to predict the heat source. Development of this 1-D model made it possible to generate realistic profiles for the winds and sound speed inside and above a forest canopy. As a result, it was shown that acoustic transmission loss and ducting of acoustic waves in and around forests is significantly influenced by local meteorological profile structure.","However, forest stands are typically inhomogeneous, containing non-uniform distributions of canopy height and leaf area density (e.g., Albertson et al., 2001). In addition, open fields, roadways, and buildings often border forests. Hence, to begin to address non-uniform forests and forest edges, Tunick (2003b) expanded the earlier 1-D equation set and developed a new model to calculate calculate the 2-D, steady state, canopy wind flow, temperatures, turbulent variances, Reynolds stress, and heat flux. In the 2-D model, a set of simultaneous, second-order, ordinary differential equations for each of eleven computed variables is solved iteratively using the Thomas algorithm, a tri-diagonal matrix solver (Press et al., 1992). The computed variables now include the mean flow\u2014vertical w. Additionally, kinematic (fluctuation) pressure p is determined by taking the divergence of the mean flow equations, which, after some rearranging and cancellation of terms due to continuity, yields Poisson's equation for pressure-velocity coupling (Ferziger and Peri\u0107, 2002). Vertical derivatives are solved by central differencing and horizontal derivatives are solved by upwind differencing. Finally, Newton-Cotes formulas for numerical integration are applied to derive wind flow streamlines.","As mentioned, there remains a need for a forest meteorology and acoustic computation technique that takes into account horizontally non-uniform sound speed information. The embodiments herein achieve this by providing a physics-based computerized technique to calculate one- and two-dimensional forest canopy meteorology and turbulence for acoustic application research that considers both the mechanical and thermodynamic influences on the speed of sound in a forest environment, which can be applied in stable, unstable, and neutral atmospheric conditions. Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , where similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures, there are shown preferred embodiments.","An important element in determining point-to-point acoustic transmission in forests is modeling the variation (with height above ground) of the winds and sound speed. Sound speed is readily derived from estimates of air temperature and relative humidity (albeit, variations in sound speed caused by changes in relative humidity are comparatively small). A preferred embodiment herein provides a method that uses meteorological and acoustics numerical models embedded into a computing device to predict and graphically display rapid meteorology and acoustic transmission loss information within and above forest canopies.","Moreover, the embodiments herein provide a methodology to predict one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) wind speeds, temperatures, and turbulence within and above forest canopies. Accordingly, radiation and energy budget methodologies are incorporated to predict the heat source. In most cases, to include some LES formulations, a relatively simple extinction profile for the heat source is assumed.  illustrates a methodology according to an embodiment herein, where, in step  data is provided for input; i.e., meteorological data, cloud cover, site location, time of day, and day of year characteristics, and canopy characterization data; e.g., tree height, leaf area density information, and drag coefficient. The input data is stored in a memory device in step . Here, the stored input data is transferred from the memory device to a computer, on which numerical model codes for acoustics and meteorology reside. The models for meteorology are steady-state, second-order turbulence closure models, with an embedded radiative transfer and energy budget algorithm to predict the heat source for any location at any time (i.e., any time of the day or night). Formulations are used to calculate the incoming total radiation at the canopy top, which is necessary in order to calculate the transmission, reflection, absorption, and emission of the solar flux through the forest. Next, in step , a computing device executes numerical model codes for acoustics and meteorology and provides model output to a memory device. In steps  and  numerical model output data is stored in memory and made available for analysis and graphics display. Thereafter, in step  acoustic and meteorological model output is transferred to a graphics device for display, analysis, and interpretation of a rapid and reliable prediction of sound speed and transmission loss information in uniform and complex wooded areas.","Useful mathematical representations of the wind flow, temperatures, and turbulence inside and above a uniform, continuous forest stand can be obtained by means of a 1D, steady-state, second-order turbulence closure model, with an embedded radiative transfer and energy budget methodology to predict the heat source. Development of this 1D model makes it possible to generate realistic profiles for the winds and sound speed inside and above a forest canopy. As a result, it is known that the acoustic transmission loss and ducting of acoustic waves in and around forests is significantly influenced by a local meteorological profile structure.","The 1D model includes the steady state, and horizontally homogeneous conservation (simplified Navier-Stokes) equations for the turbulent fluxes and mean variances of the winds inside and above the forest canopy.

As a result, it is established that acoustic transmission loss and ducting of acoustic waves in and around forests is significantly influenced by local meteorological profile structure. Hence, to begin to address non-uniform forests and forest edges, the earlier 1D models are further developed to create a model to calculate the 2D, steady state, canopy wind flow, temperatures, turbulent variances, Reynolds stress, and heat flux.","An acoustic ray path method is applied to the atmospheric surface layer for both uniform and non-uniform meteorology and turbulence conditions within and above uniform and non-uniform forests. Based on the principles and theory for geometrical acoustics for an inhomogeneous moving medium the ray path methodology predicts the general propagation paths of acoustic waves for a source as they are affected by refraction. Ray paths are computed as a function of range dependent wind and sound speed fields. The Appendix describes the manner in which the ray path method is applied.","Furthermore, the acoustic intensity may be due to geometrical divergence (i.e., energy loss due to spherical spreading) as an inverse function of range and the height difference between two adjacent rays. Also, acoustic intensity gain (or loss) due to frequency-dependent ground effects is included in the model calculation. Additionally, it is possible to improve the efficiency and realism of the 2D meteorological computer model by introducing a variable grid. A variable grid allows for better distribution of grid points and enables one to extend calculations higher into the boundary layer above the forest. A finer grid inside the forest and a coarser grid above the forest help to resolve important meteorological (and acoustic) scales and processes. The Appendix describes the manner in which the variable grid technique is applied.","The energy budget for the forest canopy can be calculated as follows.\n\n0\u2003\u2003(14)\n\nwhere\n\nRis the absorbed radiative flux,\n\nR is the upward long-wave (emitted) flux (=\u03b5\u03c3T),\n\n\u03b5is the canopy surface emissivity (=0.98),\n\n\u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (=5.67\u00d710WmK),\n\nTis the leaf (or tree) surface temperature,\n\nH is the sensible heat flux, and\n\nL\u2032E is the latent heat (moisture) flux.\n\nThe absorbed radiative flux, R; i.e., that which will determine the heating of the leaves, branches, and the ambient air through the canopy, can be written as:\n\n=[(1\u2212\u03c4)\u03c4+(1\u2212\u03c4)\u03c4](1\u2212\u03c1)+[(1\u2212\u03c4)\u03c4+(1\u2212\u03c4)\u03c4](1\u2212\u03c1)+\u03b1\u2003\u2003(15)\n\nwhere Sis a constant; i.e., the total direct beam visible flux at the canopy top. Similarly, Sis the total direct beam near-infrared flux, Sis the total diffuse visible flux, and Sis the total diffuse near-infrared flux (at the canopy top). In Equation (15), \u03c4Sis the remaining (available) radiative flux at a given level of the canopy. It follows that the coefficient (1\u2212\u03c4) defines the fraction of available radiation intercepted by the leaves (at each level). Also in Equation (15), \u03b1is the long-wave absorptivity (=1.0) and R is the downward long-wave flux as a function of ambient air temperature, T. The transmission functions for direct beam visible, \u03c4, and direct beam near-infrared, \u03c4, as a function of distance from the canopy top, can be determined from the following expression:\n\n\u03c4=exp(\u221a{square root over (\u03b1)}),\u2003\u2003(16)\n\nwhere the mean leaf absorptivity (\u03b1) for visible light is approximately 0.8 and for near infrared is approximately 0.2. Also in Equation (16), the extinction coefficient is K=(2 cos \u03b8). The leaf-clumping factor, \u03a9, describes heterogeneous (non-uniform) distributions of leaves on tree branches.
