{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/775,974, filed May 7, 2010, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/731,115, filed Dec. 6, 2000 (now abandoned), which claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60\/170,060, filed Dec. 10, 1999, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This invention relates to passive and interactive advertising and merchandising systems and methods and, more particularly, television products for performing the same.","Cable, satellite, and broadcast television systems provide viewers with a large number of television channels. Viewers have traditionally consulted printed television program schedules to determine the programs being broadcast at a particular time. More recently, passive and interactive electronic television program guides have been developed that allow television program information to be displayed on a viewer's television. Promotional channels such as barker channels have also been developed that advertise various premium channel and pay-per-view promotions.","Passive electronic television program guides typically provide a scrolling or paging list of program listings on a dedicated television channel. The TV Guide Channel is a passive program guide in which viewers are presented with promotional videos or trailers in one portion of the screen and program listings in another.","Interactive television program guides are typically implemented on set-top boxes and allow users to navigate through television program listings using a remote control. In a typical program guide, various groups of television program listings are displayed in predefined or user-selected categories. Program listings are typically displayed in a grid or table. Some interactive guides are client-server based and some others are on-line. In client-server based guides, program guide data is typically provided to the set-top in response to requests from the guide that are processed by a server at a cable system head-end. In on-line guides, users may access a web site with their Personal computer or Internet enabled set-top box to obtain program listings and other program related information.","Another type of program guide is the hybrid passive\/interactive television program guide. A hybrid guide may be based on a passive guide channel containing a listings portion over which an interactive guide portion has been overlaid.","As suggested above, barker channels are typically promotional channels that display full screen promotions of pay-per-view programs. A barker channel may overlay price, ordering, event code, and time information over such promotions and even instruct the user on how to order the promoted pay-per-view program.","Such systems have been limited in their abilities to integrate sponsorship, advertising, and merchandising opportunities among passive video products such as barker channels, passive guides, and interactive guides.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide enhanced advertising and merchandising opportunities within passive and interactive programming and applications such as, for example, program guides.","This and other objects of the present invention are accomplished in accordance with the principles of the present invention by providing systems and methods in which passive programming, such as, for example, television programming, pay-per-view programming, commercials, one or more passive video products (e.g., barker channels, passive program guides, or other video products), or any other suitable passive program, and an interactive television program guide, or other interactive software, are provided. The interactive guide, or other interactive software (e.g., a web browser, operating system software, home shopping application, or any other suitable type of software any of which may sometimes be referred to herein as \u201cinteractive applications\u201d), may integrate interactive program sponsorship, advertising, merchandising opportunities, or any suitable combination thereof, with the video content of the passive programming. Some features of such a system are described, for example, in Reichardt et al. U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60\/170,060, filed Dec. 10, 1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","In accordance with the present invention, a main facility (e.g., a satellite uplink facility) may provide data from a data source to any number of distribution facilities (e.g., cable system headends, broadcast distribution facilities, a satellite distribution facilities, or any other suitable distribution facilities). There may be multiple data sources, some of which may be located at different facilities, which provide data to the main facility for localization and distribution. The data transmitted by the main facility to the distribution facilities may include data suitable for the interactive application. For example, the data may include television programming data (e.g., titles, channels, content information, rating information, advertising information, or any other information associated with television programming), and may also include other data for additional services other than television program listings (e.g., weather information, associated Internet web links, computer software, video clips, non-television advertisements etc.). Any suitable combination of programming data and other data may sometimes be referred to herein as \u201cprogram guide data.\u201d","The main facility may also provide one or more videos for passive video products to the distribution facilities. The videos may be transmitted in real-time by the main facility to the distribution facilities for real-time distribution to user television equipment of any number of viewers. Alternatively, the main facility may transmit videos to the distribution facilities where the videos may be stored. The distribution facilities may later distribute the videos to the user television equipment of any number of viewers in real-time. This approach may be referred to as a \u201cstore-and-forward\u201d video distribution scheme. If desired, a combination of the two approaches may be used. In still another suitable store-and-forward approach, passive guide videos may be provided on storage media (e.g., laser disks, digital versatile discs (DVDs), etc.), that are provided to the distribution facilities via the mail.","The distribution facilities may generate and distribute passive video product display screens, such as passive electronic program guide display screens or barker channel display screens, over dedicated television channels. Passive guide channel display screens may contain, for example, television programming data (e.g., program listings), other data, videos, or any suitable combination thereof.","The distribution facilities may distribute the program guide data for use by an interactive program guide. The interactive program guide may run wholly on a user's television equipment or partially on the television equipment and partially on a program guide server.","Program sponsorship and interactive advertising between one or more passive video products, or other television programming, may be integrated with interactive advertising within an interactive application such as, for example, interactive television program guide or any other interactive software (e.g., a web browser, operating system software, or any other suitable type of software). The interactive application may include, for example, one or more graphic advertisements. The graphic advertisements may promote any suitable product or service, including, but not limited to, passive programming. When a promotion is aired on the passive video product or other type of television channel, the system may display an interactive advertisement indicating the promotion and, if applicable, its sponsor. In response to a viewer selecting the interactive advertisement, the system may tune the viewer's equipment to the passive video product or other channel.","In another aspect of the invention, passive video products or other television programming may be branded (i.e., have an ad inserted from a source of products or services). In response to a viewer indicating a desire to access interactive content, the system may provide the interactive content with an advertisement for the advertiser associated with the brand.","The interactive application may be programmed to display a linked interactive advertisement using any suitable synchronization approach. For example, in a timing-based synchronization approach, program guide data may include a schedule (i.e., a timing synch) that indicates to the interactive guide scheduled times for linked interactive advertisements. In another communications-based synchronization approach, a passive video product may include, for example, a flag in its header (e.g., in its vertical blanking interval (VBI)) that alerts the interactive guide (or other hardware or software running in the user's equipment) to find and retrieve interactive content for a particular advertiser. If desired, this communications-based synchronization approach may be combined with the aforementioned timing-based synchronization approach. For example, interactive graphics may be downloaded to the interactive guide at the same time (or substantially the same time) as the promotions are provided to distribution facilities. These and other approaches may facilitate collection of advertisement revenues for time blocks across multiple platforms. For example, time blocks may be sold for time on two products\u2014a passive video product and an interactive program guide. As another example, time blocks may be sold for time on a regular television channel and an interactive program guide.","Conventional television programming or passive video product promotions may be combined with interactive impulse-purchase features. The purchasing features may be provided by an interactive guide, or may be provided by non-program guide software. For example, a passive video product segment, promotion, or conventional television program may promote or otherwise include information about particular products or services. When interactive content is available for a product or service, an alert icon may be overlaid onto a video signal associated with the segment, promotion, or program to alert a user that interactive content is available.","When a user selects such an icon, a point-of-purchase window may be displayed in which purchase information for the product or service may be displayed. When a user completes a purchase, a full-screen display of the passive video product or conventional program may be redisplayed. Alternatively, a user may be provided with an opportunity to order other merchandise from, for example, a TV Guide Store.","Advertiser sponsorship may also be combined with interactive impulse-purchase fulfillment. When a conventional television or passive video product feature or segment is sponsored by a sponsor, an icon may be overlaid on a viewed screen that alerts the user to additional information concerning, for example, the subject of the feature or segment. In response to a user selecting the icon, interactive content, such as, for example, a point-of-purchase window, may be displayed. The products or services offered in the point-of-purchase window may be from the sponsor of the segment or feature, from a featured source, or from any other source.","Further features of the invention, its nature and various advantages will be more apparent from the accompanying drawings and the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.","An illustrative system  in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown in . For purposes of clarity, and not by way of limitation, system  is described herein as providing an interactive television program guide. In practice, and as described herein, system  may be any suitable system for providing passive programming and interactive applications. For example, data sources  may provide data for, for example, home shopping applications, operating system software, or any other application.","As shown in , main facility  may provide program guide or other application data from data source  within main facility  to application equipment  via communications link . There may be multiple data sources  but only one has been shown to avoid over complicating . If desired, program guide data sources  may also be located at facilities separate from main facility , such as at local information services , and may provide data to main facility  for localization and distribution. Data sources  may be any suitable computer or computer based system for obtaining data (e.g., manually from an operator, electronically via a computer network or other connection, or via storage media) and for putting the data into electronic form for distribution by main facility . Link  may be a satellite link, a telephone network link, a cable or fiber optic link, a microwave link, an Internet link, a combination of such links, or any other suitable communications link. If desired, one or more data sources  may provide data for both a passive and an interactive guide. Alternatively, data may be provided by one or more separate data sources  for each guide.","Local information service  may be any suitable facility for obtaining data particular to a localized region and for providing the data to main facility  over communications link . Local information service  may be, for example, a local weather station that measures weather data, a local newspaper that obtains local high school and college sporting information, or any other suitable provider of information. Local information service  may be a local business with a computer for providing main facility  with, for example, local ski reports, fishing conditions, menus, etc., or any other suitable provider of information. Link  may be a satellite link, a telephone network link, a cable or fiber optic link, a microwave link, an Internet link, a combination of such links, or any other suitable communications link.","The program guide data transmitted by main facility  to application equipment  may include television programming data (e.g., program identifiers, times, channels, titles, and descriptions) and other data for services other than television program listings (e.g., help text, pay-per-view information, weather information, sports information, music channel information, associated Internet web links, associated software, etc.). There are preferably numerous pieces or installations of application equipment , although only one is shown in  to avoid over-complicating .","Program guide data may be transmitted by main facility  to application equipment  using any suitable approach. Data files may, for example, be encapsulated as objects and transmitted using a suitable Internet based addressing scheme and protocol stack (e.g., a stack which uses the user datagram protocol (UDP) and Internet protocol (IP)). Systems in which program guide data is transmitted from a main facility using such protocols are described, for example, in Gollahon et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/332,624, filed Jun. 11, 1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Main facility  may also provide videos for passive video products to application equipment . Videos for the passive video products may be transmitted in real-time by main facility  to application equipment  for real-time distribution to the user television equipment of any number of users. Alternatively, main facility  may transmit or otherwise provide (e.g., on portable storage media) videos to application equipment  for storage. Portions of application equipment  may later distribute the videos to user television equipment of any number of users in real-time. This approach may be referred to as a \u201cstore-and-forward\u201d video distribution scheme. If desired, a combination of the two approaches may be used. Systems in which videos are both distributed directly in real-time and stored-and-forwarded in real-time are described, for example, in Kern et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/332,448, filed Jun. 11, 1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The application of such an approach in a hybrid guide system is described, for example, in Knudson et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/357,941, filed Jul. 16, 1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Main facility  may distribute videos in real-time or for store-and-forwarding by portions of application equipment  using any suitable approach. As described, for example, in above-mentioned Kern et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/332,448, main facility  may schedule videos for distribution according to a promotional philosophy. As taught therein, promotional philosophies are selection algorithms that attempt to maximize the effectiveness of promotions by selecting promotions for distribution during times in which expected audiences will view the promotions. An operator at main facility  may, for example, generate one or more promotional philosophy templates that are used by main facility  to generate a national playlist of promotional events. The promotional philosophy templates and national playlist may be provided to application equipment  as part of the program guide data.","In approaches where alternative sources of videos are provided by main facility  to application equipment , such as in the store-and-forward approach described in above-mentioned Kern et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/332,448, equipment at application equipment  may generate a local playlist of promotional events according to the promotional philosophy templates. If the promotional events scheduled by the national playlist are unavailable or undesirable to the application equipment , the local playlist may schedule alternative videos instead of the undesirable ones scheduled by the national playlist. The application equipment  may generate program guide display screens with the nationally selected or alternative videos and program guide data according to the local playlist. The display screens are distributed to viewers for viewing on their televisions.","The videos supplied by main facility  may include promotional videos such as short videos (i.e., videos less than three minutes in length), video trailers promoting a television program, or the like. The videos may be supplied by video source . Video source  may be based, for example, on a library of video clips stored on a video juke box (a multiple-compact disc or digital video disc storage system) or any other suitable combination of hardware and software for storing such videos. Videos may be provided in any suitable format. For example, video signals may be provided in an analog signal format using the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) signal format or in a digital signal format such as a Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) format.","If desired, data source  and video source  may be combined into a single information source. This information source may provide program guide data, videos, or any suitable combination thereof. The data provided by such an information source may be used by application equipment  to provide a passive guide, an interactive guide, or both. The videos may be used for whole screen or partial screen displays.","Program guide or other application data and videos may be transmitted by transmission system  to application equipment  via link . Transmission system  may include any equipment suitable for encoding the program guide data and videos and providing the encoded data and videos to transmitter . Transmitter  is preferably a digital satellite uplink transmitter, but may be any suitable analog, digital, radio frequency, optical, microwave, terrestrial, or other type of transmitter. Transmission system  may encode the data as, for example, component object model (COM) objects that are transmitted using an Internet based addressing scheme and Internet based transport and network protocols such as the user datagram protocol (UDP) and the Internet protocol (IP). Electronic program guide systems that transfer UDP packets and COM objects using a UDP\/IP protocol stack are described in above-mentioned Gollahon et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/332,624, filed Jun. 11, 1999.","An interactive television program guide or other interactive software (e.g., a web browser, operating system software, or any other suitable software) is implemented on application equipment . Various architectures for interactive television program guide systems and various interactive guide features are described, for example, in above-mentioned Knudson et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/357,941, filed Jul. 16, 1999. Five illustrative arrangements for application equipment  are shown in -. As shown in -, application equipment  may include user television equipment  and equipment located at distribution facility .","The interactive television program guide or other software may run totally on user television equipment  as shown in and , or may run partially on user television equipment  and partially on distribution facility  using a suitable client-server or distributed processing approach as shown in and ","As shown in -, distribution facility  may be any suitable distribution facility (e.g., a cable system headend, a broadcast distribution facility, a satellite distribution facility, or any other suitable type of distribution facility). As illustrated in -, distribution facility  may have reception system  for receiving videos, data, or a suitable combination thereof from transmitter  using receiver . Receiver  is preferably a digital satellite downlink receiver, but may be any suitable analog, digital, radio-frequency, optical, microwave, terrestrial, or other type of receiver.","Distribution facility  may have screen generator  for generating passive video product display screens containing videos and data Screen generator  may be implemented using any suitable hardware, software, or combination thereof. Screen generator , may be, for example, a Windows NT process running on a personal computer with a Pentium II microprocessor.","Screen generator  may use an object-oriented approach to generate video product display screens. The use of COM objects, for example, may allow changes to be made to the format and functionality of some of the features of system  without requiring changes to other system components.","Such an approach may allow one main facility  to provide and manage a number of different passive guides and other video products from a central location. Screen generators that may be used to create video product display screens using an object-oriented approach are described, for example, in Kern et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/332,539, filed Jun. 11, 1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Distribution equipment  may distribute passive video product display screens on a dedicated channel and, if desired, television programming on multiple analog or digital channels, to multiple users via communications paths . Distribution equipment  may include, for example, a cable headend modulator, and any other or additional equipment suitable for transmitting television programming and passive guide display screens over communications paths . Alternatively, distribution equipment  may include suitable hardware and software for delivering videos in real-time or substantially real-time via the Internet (e.g., using the M-bone). If desired, television programming and video products may be provided over separate communications paths.","Distribution equipment  of -may also include suitable hardware for providing program guide or other application data to user television equipment  over communications path . Distribution equipment  may include, for example, suitable transmission hardware for distributing program guide data on a television channel sideband, in the vertical blanking interval of a television channel, using an in-band digital signal, using an out-of-band digital signal, or by any other suitable data transmission technique. The data may, for example, be provided over a phone line when communications path  include separate paths for data and television signals.","Communications path  may be any communications path or paths suitable for distributing program guide or other application data. Communications path  may include, for example, a satellite link, a telephone network link, a cable or fiber optic link, a microwave link, an Internet link, a data-over-cable service interface specification (DCCSIS) link, a digital subscriber line (DSL) link, a combination of such links, or any other suitable communications link. Communications path  may allow distribution facility  to distribute television programming to user television equipment . There are typically multiple pieces of user television equipment  and multiple associated communications paths , although only one piece of user television equipment  and communications path  are shown in -to avoid over complicating the figures. If desired, television programming may be provided over separate communications paths (not shown).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"i":["b ","b ","b"],"b":["17","21","25","25","25","22","25","25","12"]},"A program guide or other application client running on user television equipment  may retrieve program guide data, passive guide characteristics, or any suitable combination thereof, from application server  using any suitable client-server based approach. The program guide client may, for example, pass SQL requests as messages to application server . In another suitable approach, the program guide or other application may invoke remote procedures that reside on application server  using one or more remote procedure calls. Application server  may execute SQL statements for such invoked remote procedures. In still another suitable approach, client objects executed by the program guide may communicate with server objects executed by application server  using, for example, an object request broker (ORB). This may involve using, for example, Microsoft's Distributed Component Object Model (DOOM) approach.","In another approach, program guide display pages may be generated at distribution facility  using a graphics engine or video production equipment. The display pages are then encoded into an MPEG or other suitable digital format for distribution. The program guide display pages may be decoded by a thin program guide client running on user television equipment  to produce program guide display screens seen by the user. Client-server based program guides of this type are described, for example, in Marshall et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/330,501, filed Jun. 11, 1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","The program guide or other application client may communicate with application server  over communications path  using any suitable network and transport layer protocols, if desired. A protocol stack may be used which includes, for example, Sequenced Packet Exchange\/Internetwork Packet Exchange (SPX\/IPX) layers, Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) layers, AppleTalk Transaction Protocol\/Datagram Delivery Protocol (ATP\/DDP) layers, or any other suitable network and transport layer protocols. If desired DOCSIS may also be used. A suitable client-server based approach may also be used for providing non-program guide software, if desired.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIGS. 2","i":["c ","d "],"b":["2","16","61","61","61","16"]},"If the program guide or other application is implemented on user television equipment  of application equipment  as shown in , Internet service system  (or other suitable equipment at program guide distribution facility  that is connected to Internet service system ) may provide program guide or other application data, to user television equipment  via the Internet, or via distribution equipment  using any suitable Internet-based approach (e.g., using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) over a Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) type link). If the program guide or other application implemented on application equipment  is a client-server application as shown in , application server  may obtain program guide or other application data from Internet service system . Alternatively, the data may be provided by main facility  to distribution facility  via the Internet and Internet service system . The program guide data may be distributed by distribution equipment  to the guide using any suitable distribution scheme.","In still another embodiment, distribution equipment  may include suitable hardware (not shown) on which a first portion or version of the interactive television program guide or other software may be implemented. A second portion or version of the program guide or other software may be implemented on user television equipment . The two versions or portions of the interactive program guide or other software may communicate using any suitable peer-to-peer communications scheme (e.g., messaging, remote procedure calls, etc.) and perform interactive program guide or other functions distributively between distribution facility  and user television equipment .","Another suitable arrangement in which an on-line program guide or other software may be implemented on application equipment  is shown in . On-line program guide systems are described, for example, in Boyer et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/938,028, filed Sep. 18, 1997, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The user may have personal computer (PC)  on which a program guide client or web browser is implemented. Personal computer  may be connected to Internet service system  via Internet link . Internet service system  may use any suitable combination of computer hardware and software capable of providing an on-line program guide or other server application or web site.","An illustrative arrangement for user television equipment  is shown in . As shown, user television equipment  may receive video signals and data from distribution facility  or application server  at input . During normal television viewing, a viewer may tune set-top box  to a desired television channel. The signal for that television channel may then be provided at video output . The signal supplied at output  may be a radio-frequency (RF) signal on a predefined channel (e.g., channel  or ), an analog demodulated video signal, a digital signal provided to television  on an appropriate digital bus (e.g., a bus using the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1394 standard, (not shown)), or any other suitable output. The video signal at output  is received by optional secondary storage device .","The interactive television program guide or other software may run on set-top box , on television  (if television  has suitable processing circuitry and memory), on a suitable analog or digital receiver connected to television , or on digital storage device  if digital storage device  has suitable processing circuitry and memory. The interactive television program guide or other software may also run cooperatively on a suitable combination of these devices. Interactive television application systems in which a cooperative interactive television program guide application runs on multiple devices are described, for example, in Ellis U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/186,598, filed Nov. 5, 1998, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Secondary storage device  can be any suitable type of analog or digital program storage device or player (e.g., a videocassette recorder, a digital versatile disc (DVD) player, etc.). Program recording and other features may be controlled by set-top box  using control path . If secondary storage device  is a videocassette recorder, for example, a typical control path  involves the use of an infrared transmitter coupled to an infrared receiver in the videocassette recorder that normally accepts commands from a remote control such as remote control . Remote control  may be used to control set-top box , secondary storage device , and television .","If desired, a user may record programs, program guide data, passive guide videos, or a combination thereof in digital form on optional digital storage device .

To access the functions of the program guide or other software, a user may instruct the program guide or other software implemented on application equipment  to generate a main menu or other desired display screen for display on display device .","For purposes of clarity, and not by way of limitation, suitable displays for an interactive program guide are now described herein below. These displays and their approaches for providing advertisements and merchandising opportunities are only illustrative and similar displays, display elements, and approaches may be used for other applications. For example, panel advertisements and other display elements may be incorporated into other applications.","Turning first to , a main menu screen  is shown. Main menu screen  may be accessed by pressing a \u201cguide\u201d key on remote control . As illustrated, screen  may include menu  of selectable program guide features . If desired, program guide features  may be organized according to feature type. In menu , for example, program guide features  have been organized into three columns. The interactive television program guide may generate a display screen for a particular program guide feature when a user selects that feature from menu  with, for example, highlight region .","Main menu screen  may include one or more selectable advertisements . Selectable advertisements  may, for example, include text and graphics advertising pay-per-view programs or other programs, channels, or products. When a user selects a selectable advertisement  with, for example, highlight region , the program guide may display information (e.g., pay-per-view information) or take other actions related to the content of the advertisement. Pure text advertisements may be presented, if desired, as illustrated by selectable advertisement banner .","Main menu screen  may also include other screen elements. The brand of the program guide product may be indicated, for example, using a product brand logo graphic such as product brand logo graphic . The identity of the television service provider may be presented, for example, using a service provider logo graphic such as service provider logo graphic . The logos may be included in the program guide data allowing for on-the-fly configurability of the display screens. Video window  may include video from a currently tuned channel.","The user may access a passive video product from an interactive guide or other software. If desired, the interactive guide or other software may include one or more branded screen elements, such as illustrative branded menu feature , to provide the user with an opportunity to access a passive video product. In this example, the user is provided with an opportunity to access the TV Guide Channel, a passive guide, directly from menu . In response to the user selecting branded feature , the interactive guide or other software may tune the user's equipment (e.g., television  or personal computer ) to the channel on which the passive guide is carried.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["601","601","607","603","605","605"]},"Passive guide display screen  is only illustrative of one suitable passive video product. Passive video product display screens may include any suitable combination of videos, listings, text, graphics and other content. For example, passive video products may include a near-full-screen video of a promoted program, plus a small text area with ordering details for the promoted program (e.g., a barker channel). Alternatively, they may include a quarter-screen video, accompanied by quarter screen text with ordering or viewing instructions, and a half-screen of scrolling program listings. These examples are merely illustrative, and other passive video product approaches may be used.","If desired, program listings area  may be replaced or overlaid with interactive program listings to provide the user with a hybrid passive\/interactive television program guide. The hybrid guide may be generated by the interactive guide using any suitable technique to overlay program listings display areas, text display areas, graphic display areas, video display areas, or interactive feature areas onto the passive guide display screen, or to otherwise replace passive guide content. Interactive feature areas may include any suitable interactive program guide feature and may replace or supplement a passive feature of the passive guide. The interactive guide may also generate the hybrid guide immediately when a user tunes to the passive guide channel. Hybrid passive\/interactive television program guides are described, for example, in Reynolds et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/400,391, filed Sep. 21, 1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. An illustrative hybrid passive\/interactive program guide is shown in .","The interactive guide may, for example, overlay a passive listings display area (e.g., program listings area  of ) with an interactive listings area in response to a user indicating a desire to select a program listing by, for example, pressing an arrow key on remote control . The interactive guide may determine the first program listing displayed and may display the interactive listings starting with that first program listing. The interactive guide may determine the current time slot and channel that are being displayed by the passive guide based, for example, on passive guide characteristics (e.g., currently displayed screen components, size and location of screen components, current listings, etc.). Systems in which passive guide characteristics are used to synchronize passive and interactive program listings are described, for example, in above-mentioned Reynolds et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/400,391, filed Sep. 21, 1999. In still another suitable approach, the interactive guide may determine the type of listings displayed (e.g., whether they are movie listings, spots listings, etc.), and display interactive listings for the same type.","The interactive guide may indicate to a user that a hybrid guide is active by, for example, displaying a highlight region.  shows an illustrative hybrid guide having interactive grid  and highlight region . The operation of grid  may be similar to full-screen television listings displays as described, for example, in above-mentioned Knudsen et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/357,941, filed Jul. 16, 1999. The user may position highlight region  by entering appropriate commands with user input device . For example, if user input device  has a keypad, the user can position highlight region  using \u201cup,\u201d \u201cdown,\u201d \u201cleft,\u201d and \u201cright\u201d using, for example, cursor keys on user input device . Alternatively, a touch sensitive screen, trackball, voice commands, or other suitable device may be used to move highlight region  or to select program listings without the use of highlight region . In still another approach, the user may speak the title of a television program listing into a voice request recognition system which will issue an appropriate command or request to the interactive guide. Any other suitable approach may also be used. In response to the user positioning highlight region , the guide may display interactive listings for additional channels (e.g., when the user positions highlight region  up or down), or for additional time slots (e.g., when the user positions highlight region  left or right)","The user may indicate a desire to access additional information for a program by, for example, pressing an info key on remote control . In response, the interactive guide may display an additional information screen for the currently highlighted program listing.  shows illustrative information screen . Information screen  may include, for example, an area  that displays the title, channel, rating, and air time of the program. Information screen  may also include other information, such as a description of the program, in window . Video window  may display the currently tuned channel. When the user accesses information screen  from a hybrid guide or from the passive video product, video window  may display the passive video product. Information screen  may also provide selectable features  for providing users with access to other interactive guide features. Interactive program guide systems in which additional information screens provide users with access to interactive guide features are described, for example, in Rudnick et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/356,268, filed Jul. 16, 1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","The system may integrate program sponsorship and interactive advertising between conventional programming or one or more video products and interactive software such as an interactive television program guide. The interactive television program guide or other software may include, for example, one or more graphic advertisements, such as selectable graphics  (). Selectable graphics  may promote any suitable product or service. When a promotion is aired on the passive video product or within other programming, the interactive guide or other software may display an interactive advertisement indicating the promotion and, if applicable, its sponsor. In response to the user selecting the interactive advertisement, the interactive guide may tune the user's equipment to the passive video product or other channel.","The interactive guide may be programmed to display a linked interactive advertisement using any suitable approach. For example, the program guide data may include a schedule (i.e., a timing synch) that indicates to the interactive guide scheduled times for linked interactive advertisements. In another suitable approach, a passive video product may include, for example, a flag in its header (e.g., in its vertical blanking interval (VBI)) that alerts the interactive guide (or other hardware or software running in the user's equipment) to find and retrieve interactive content for a particular advertiser. If desired, this communications-based synchronization approach may be combined with the aforementioned timing-based synchronization approach. For example, interactive graphics may be downloaded to an interactive guide at the same time (or substantially the same time) that the promotions are provided to distribution facilities within the system. Such an approach may provide the system provider or some other interested entity with an opportunity to collect advertisement revenues for time blocks across multiple platforms. For example, time blocks may be sold for time on two products\u2014a passive video product and an interactive program guide.","In one suitable approach, the interactive guide may be provided with playlists that schedule the passive guide promotions, and with passive guide characteristics. Passive guide characteristics include information that indicates what content is displayed by the passive video product, as well as how the content is being displayed. Systems in which playlists and passive video product characteristics are provided to an interactive guide to integrate passive video product and interactive guide content and functionality are described, for example, in above-mentioned Reynolds et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/400,391, filed Sep. 21, 1999.","Screen generator  (-) may track passive guide characteristics such as the currently displayed screen components of the passive video product display screen (e.g., videos, program listings grid, etc.), the size and location of the components, the listings that are being displayed, the period with which listings are paged or the speed with which listings are scrolled, which program segment is currently active in the video portion of the passive video product, the content of the videos (e.g., programs or products that are promoted by a video), the channel and call letters of the passive video product, a source identifier or other identifier of the passive video product, or any other suitable information. If desired, local or national playlists may also be provided to the interactive guide as part of the passive video product characteristics. The passive video product characteristics may be provided to distribution equipment  or application server  for use by the interactive television program guide. The passive video product characteristics may be provided to the guide or a guide client periodically, continuously, on-demand, or with any other suitable frequency based on the system architecture underlying the guide.","Comparing -illustrates how combining program sponsorship and interactive advertising between a passive guide and an interactive television program guide may be performed. In , selectable advertisement graphic  of main menu screen  includes an advertisement for Faith Hill on Insider. The segment is sponsored by Miller Lite. This graphic is displayed in the interactive guide when the passive guide provides the sponsored segment. In response to the user selecting advertisement graphic , the interactive guide may tune the user's television or personal computer to the passive guide channel, where the sponsor identifier may appear on the video (). In this example, the identifier may appear at the beginning of the segment. The segment may then air (), and be followed by or interrupted by an advertisement for the sponsor (). This approach may allow the provider of the interactive software (e.g., the interactive guide) and the passive video product (e.g., the passive guide) to sell time-blocks across multiple platforms. If desired, selectable advertisement graphic  may be provided by non-program guide software (e.g., a web browser, computer operating system, etc.).","Conventional television programming or passive video product promotions may be combined with interactive impulse-purchase features. The purchasing features may be provided by an interactive guide or by non-program guide software. For example, a passive video product segment or promotion (or a conventional television program) may promote or otherwise include information about particular products or services. When interactive content is available for the product or service, the interactive guide may overlay an alert icon onto the video signal to alert the user that interactive content is available. The interactive guide or other software may determine that there is related interactive content using any suitable approach. The programming may, for example, include a suitable header in its vertical blanking interval (VBI). Alternatively, the interactive software may be provided with characteristics of the programming and, if applicable, a playlist for the channel. Any other suitable approach may be used.","When the user selects such an icon, an interactive guide or other software may display a point-of-purchase window in which purchase information for the product or service is displayed. When the user completes the purchase, the guide or other software may return to full-screen display of the passive video product or conventional program. Alternatively, the user may be provided with an opportunity to order other merchandise from, for example, a TV Guide Store.","Comparing -illustrates how conventional television programming or passive video product promotions may be combined with interactive impulse-purchase features. As shown in and , a passive video product channel includes a TV Music News segment. At some point in the segment, interactive content related to the content of the segment may be available. In this example, there may be interactive content available for 'N Sync (). The interactive software may display an icon, such as alert icon . In response to the user selecting alert icon , the interactive software may display an interactive window. In this example, the additional information may be available merchandise (the Star Profile CD), and a point-of-purchase window  may be displayed (). If desired, the passive programming may be resized (as shown), and additional advertisements or other graphics may be displayed.","The user may return to full-screen video if the user does not want to order the original product or any additional products. If the user indicates a desire to order the product by, for example, selecting \u201cYes\u201d, the interactive software may prompt the user to add the product to a shopping cart (e.g., by selecting \u201cNo\u201d in ). If desired, a suitable one-click ordering approach may be used. If the user wants to order additional products (e.g., by selecting \u201cYes\u201d in ), the interactive software may provide the user with access to a virtual store. The store may be provided via the Internet, a private network, programmed into the interactive software, or provided using any other suitable approach. shows an illustrative virtual store display screen . The store may display related items for sale (e.g., other CDs by 'N Sync, other CDs by similar artists, other CDs, for the same record label, etc.) that the user may select and purchase. The store may also provide options that the user may select to view other available products.","The system may combine advertiser sponsorship with interactive impulse-purchase fulfillment. When a passive video product feature or segment is sponsored by a particular sponsor, the system may overlay an icon that alerts the user to additional information concerning, for example, the subject of the feature or segment. In response to a user selecting the icon, the system may display interactive content such as, for example, a point-of-purchase window. The products or services offered in the point-of-purchase window may be from the sponsor of the segment or feature, from a featured source, or from some other source.","Comparing -illustrates how advertiser sponsorship may be combined with interactive impulse-purchase fulfillment. A passive video product segment may be sponsored, for example, by DiGiorno and feature an interview with Papa John's Pizza (). If interactive content is available for the segment, interactive software may display an alert icon  (). In response to a user selecting alert icon , the interactive software may display the interactive content. In this example, the interactive content may be a recipe for Papa John's Pizza (). Point-of-purchase window  may be displayed to allow the user to order products associated with the interactive content, in this example, ingredients for the recipe. Window  may include an advertisement for the provider of the ingredients, in this example, Peapod Grocery Delivery Service. This approach may provide for a three-way sale of advertisements. DiGiorno, Papa John's, and Pea Pod may each advertise in connection with impulse-purchase fulfillment. Moreover, as in this example, the advertisers may be selected to be complimentary to one another and may interact synergistically, thereby enhancing the advertising value of the individual advertisements.","If desired, integrating conventional television advertising or sponsorship, interactive advertising, and impulse-purchase fulfillment may be performed using Intent-based technologies. Conventional television programming and passive video products may be augmented or otherwise coordinated with an interactive guide or other software using markup language documents, such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) documents. Systems in which passive video products and interactive guide content and functionality are augmented and coordinated using Intent-delivered data are described, for example, in Allison et al.
