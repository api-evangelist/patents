{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention relates distributing project workloads among a multitude of distributed devices and more particularly to techniques and related methods for managing, facilitating and implementing distributed processing in a network environment.","Prior processing systems have included the technique of multiple users within a company sharing processing time available on a mainframe or central processing system. Using small segments of mainframe processing time, departments within the company would often incur costs associated with using the processing time, which in turn was billed back to each department from the central information technology (IT) organization for the company. In other instances, a company could pay for and utilize processing time made available by third-party companies who possessed an over-capacity of mainframe processing power. These third-party companies would, in effect, create a market for the mainframe processing time that went unused by the internal organizations of that third-party company.","Prior processing techniques have also included distributed processing projects that have utilized the Internet or World Wide Web. These distributed processing research projects have used a multitude of personal computers (PCs) connected to the Internet to provide processing power to accomplish research project goals. Research project goals have been, for example, identifying large prime numbers, analyzing radio telescope data, and analyzing code keys in an encryption deciphering contest.","One example of a distributed processing project on the Internet is a research project housed at the University of California at Berkeley to analyze sky recording data gathered by SETI (the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence). This sky recording data has been gathered for some time from the large Arecibo Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico. The processing power needed to analyze these data recordings was very large. At the peak of SETI's capture activities, SETI had accumulated over 100,000 years of signals to process, as measured by the compute power necessary to process all the signals. To analyze this data, software was developed that could be downloaded to Internet connected PCs so that these PCs could process small slices of these sky recordings. In under a year, this project, called SETI@home (URL in March 2000\u2014www.setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu) has completely processed this backlog of data and is now returning to the sky recording dataset for further processing tasks. This massively parallel distributed system currently has a processing throughput of over 10 TFLOPs (terraFLOPS or 10floating point operations per second) running on about 1.8 million Internet connected machines.","Another example of a distributed processing technique was developed and implemented by Distributed.net (URL in March 2000\u2014www.distributed.net) to compete in encryption breaking contests. Distributed.net created and distributed a client software program which may be downloaded by client systems connected to the Internet. This client software then acts as part of a large distributed processing system specifically designed to break encrypted messages on the Internet. Using this processing technique, Distributed.net has won encryption breaking contests sponsored by RSA Labs, which is an Internet security company. In these contests, RSA Labs has offered a monetary prize to the winner of the encryption contest. In organizing its efforts, Distributed.net has offered a share of this monetary prize to the client system that actually breaks the encryption code. In addition, Distributed.net keeps track of overall project statistics, as well as statistics concerning the efforts of its client systems through individual and team rankings by amount of processing completed.","Entropia.com (URL in March 2000\u2014www.entropia.com) has utilized an Internet distributed processing system to compete in contests directed to identifying the largest prime number. Entropia.com also offers its computing power to other research projects. Users may sign on to be part of the distributed processing for free. For the largest prime number contest, Entropia.com, like Distributed.net, offers a monetary prize to the Internet connected PC that comes up with the first prime number achieved in a new order of magnitude. For other research projects, the incentive is simply to be a part of the research project.","Another distributing processing web site is provided by Process Tree Network (URL in March 2000\u2014www.processtree.com). This web site is attempting to sign-up Internet connected computer systems to provide processing power for paying projects. For a project, each partner system, when connected to the Internet, will have client software that downloads a job unit and processes that job unit. The incentive offered by the Process Tree Network are \u201cmicro-payments\u201d for the amount of work completed by any given system. These micro-payments are apparently small amounts of some total project value based upon the amount of the project completed by the given system through the jobs it has processed. In addition, each partner is given a bonus percentage of payments made to persons they sign-up as new partners.","In completely unrelated Internet activities outside the distributed processing arena, there have been a number of sites that have utilized a sweepstakes model as an incentive for consumer behavior. One of the most popular (currently, as of March 2000) sweepstakes sites is IWON.COM (www.iwon.com) IWON.COM is a standard Internet search and content portal that provides an incentive to users by giving them entries to a sweepstakes when the users use the portal. The more the users use the portal, the more entries the user generates, up to a limit, for example, up to 100\/day. Currently (as of March 2000), at the end of each day, IWON.COM has chosen a $10,000 winner from among the entries. At the end of each month, IWON.COM has chosen a $1,000,000 winner. And, at the end of the current sweeps period (as of March 2000), IWON.COM plans to draw a single winner for a $10,000,000 grand prize. IWON.COM has created this sweepstakes model to introduce an Internet portal in late 1999 and make it a web site that has as a comparable number of people using it as does Internet portals that have existed for many years, such as, for example. Yahoo.com (URL in March 2000\u2014www.yahoo.com).","Significantly, these prior distributed processing projects have failed to fully utilize the capabilities of connected distributed devices.","The present invention provides a method for network site testing with a distributed parallel processing system that identifies the capabilities of distributed devices connected together through a wide variety of communication systems and networks and utilizes those capabilities to provide incentives to the distributed devices and to organize, manage and distribute project workloads to the distributed devices.","In one broad respect, the present invention is a method of testing a network site that is coupled to a network, including providing a server system, coupling the server system to a network, the network being configured to be coupled to distributed devices, and utilizing the server system to distribute and schedule site testing workloads for a plurality of the distributed devices to test content delivery from a network site.","In another broad respect, the present invention is a network site testing distributed processing system, including a first system coupled to a network configured to be coupled to distributed devices, and a workload database coupled to the server system storing workloads for site testing, the first system scheduling the site testing workloads for the distributed devices to test content delivery for a network site.","The present invention contemplates the identification of the capabilities of distributed devices connected together through a wide variety of communication systems and networks and the aggregation of these capabilities to accomplish processing, storage, broadcasting or any other desired project objective. For example, distributed devices connected to each other through the Internet, an intranet network, a wireless network, or any other network may provide any of a number of useful capabilities to third parties once their respective capabilities are identified, organized, and managed for a desired task. These distributed devices may be connected personal computer systems (PCs), internet appliances, notebook computers, servers, storage devices, network attached storage (NAS) devices, wireless devices, hand-held devices, or any other computing device that has useful capabilities and is connected to a network in any manner. The present invention further contemplates providing an incentive, which may be based in part upon capabilities of the distributed devices, to encourage users and owners of the distributed devices to allow the capabilities of the distributed devices to be utilized in the distributed parallel processing system of the present invention.","The number of usable distributed devices contemplated by the present invention is preferably very large. Unlike a small local network environment, for example, as may be used by an Internet Service Provider (ISP), which may include less than 100 interconnected computers systems to perform the tasks required by the ISP, the present invention preferably utilizes a multitude of widely distributed devices to provide a massively distributed processing system. With respect to the present invention, a multitude of distributed devices refers to greater than 1,000 different distributed devices. With respect to the present invention, widely distributed devices refers to a group of interconnected devices of which at least two are physically located at least 100 miles apart. With respect to the present invention, a massively distributed processing system is one that utilizes a multitude of widely distributed devices. The Internet is an example of a interconnected system that includes a multitude of widely distributed devices. An intranet system at a large corporation is an example of an interconnected system that includes multitude of distributed devices, and if multiple corporate sites are involved, may include a multitude of widely distributed devices. A distributed processing system according to the present invention that utilizes such a multitude of widely distributed devices, as are available on the Internet or in a large corporate intranet, is a massively distributed processing system according to the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","102","102","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["108","110","112","102","118","120","122","104","106","152","102","114","116","119","124","104","108","110","112","126","104","108","110","112","108","110","112","100","108","110","112","104","104"]},"The incentives provided by the incentives block  may be any desired incentive. For example, the incentive may be a sweepstakes in which entries are given to client systems ,  . . .  that are signed up to be utilized by the distributed processing system . Other example incentives are reward systems, such as airline frequent-flyer miles, purchase credits and vouchers, payments of money, monetary prizes, property prizes, free trips, time-share rentals, cruises, or any other desired incentive or reward.","As indicated above, any number of other systems may also be connected to the network . The element , therefore, represents any number of a variety of other systems that may be connected to the network . The other systems  may include ISPs, web servers, university computer systems, and any other distributed device connected to the network , for example, personal computer systems (PCs), internet appliances, notebook computers, servers, storage devices, network attached storage (NAS) devices, wireless devices, hand-held devices, or any other connected computing device that has useful capabilities and is connected to a network in any manner. The customer systems  represents customers that have projects for the distributed processing system, as further described with respect to FIG. B. The customer systems  connect to the network  through the communication link .","It is noted that the communication links , , , ,  and  may allow for communication to occur, if desired, between any of the systems connected to the network . For example, client systems ,  . . .  may communicate directly with each other in peer-to-peer type communications. It is further noted that the communication links , , , ,  and  may be any desired technique for connecting into any portion of the network , such as, Ethernet connections, wireless connections, ISDN connections, DSL connections, modem dial-up connections, cable modem connections, direct T1 or T3 connections, routers, portal computers, as well as any other network or communication connection. It is also noted that there are any number of possible configurations for the connections for network , according to the present invention. The client system  may be, for example, an individual personal computer located in someone's home and may be connected to the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP). Client system  may also be a personal computer located on an employee's desk at a company, may be connected to an intranet through a network router, and may be connected to the Internet through a second router or portal computer. Client system  may further be personal computers connected to a company's intranet, and the server systems  may also be connected to that same intranet. In short, a wide variety of network environments are contemplated by the present invention on which a large number of potential client systems are connected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["150","152","104","134","104","124","126","104","130","134","134"]},"Client systems , as discussed above, may be any number of different systems that are connected to the server systems  through a network , such as client systems ,  . . .  in FIG. A. The client systems  send results  back to the server systems  after the client systems  complete processing any given workload. Depending upon the workload project, the server systems  may then provide results  to customer systems . The customer systems  may be, for example, an entity that desires a given project to be undertaken, and if so, provides the project details and data  to the server systems .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["108","204","208","206","204","104","204","104","102","108","118","108","204","212","202","210","206","206","104","118","102"]},"It is noted that the workload received by client system  and the processing or activity performed may depend up a variety of factors, as discussed further below. In part, this workload allocated by the server system  to each client system ,  and  may depend upon the capabilities of the client system, such as the processing power, disk storage capacity, communications types, and other capabilities available from the various components of the systems within the client system .","The server systems  can select the workloads for the client system  and may control when these workloads are performed, through an operational code (i.e., an agent) residing and installed on the client system . Alternatively, the owner or user of the client system  may determine when workloads are procured or obtained from the server systems , as well as when these workloads are performed, for example, by accessing the server systems  through the network . For example, the sever system  may download to the client system  upon request one or more workloads. At the same time, an agent residing on the client system  may operate to process the workload or multiple workloads downloaded to the client system . It is noted, therefore, that the agent may be simultaneously managing more than one workload for any number of projects. When the workload is complete, the agent may inform the owner or user of the client system  the results are ready to be communicated back. The client system  may then upload results to the server system  and download new workloads, if desired. Alternatively, these logistical and operational interactions may take place automatically through control of the agent and\/or the server systems .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["108","108","260","250","260","252","254","258","264","262"]},"It is noted, therefore, that the capabilities for client systems ,  . . .  may span the entire range of possible computing, processing, storage and other subsystems or devices that are connected to a system connected to the network . For example, these subsystems or devices may include: central processing units (CPUs), digital signal processors (DSPs), graphics processing engines (GPEs), hard drives (HDs), memory (MEM), audio subsystems (ASs), communications subsystems (CSs), removable media types (RMs), and other accessories with potentially useful unused capabilities (OAs). In short, for any given computer system connected to a network , there exists a variety of capabilities that may be utilized by that system to accomplish its direct tasks. At any given time, however, only a fraction of these capabilities are typically used on the client systems ,  . . . . The present invention can take advantage of these unused capabilities.","It is also noted that along with receiving the workload, the client system  will also receive an agent that manages the completion of the workload. This agent may be software that is customized for the particular computer system and processing capabilities of the client system . For example, if the client system is a personal computer as shown in , the agent may be a program that operates in the background of the computer's operating system. When the agent determines that there is unused processing or other capabilities, the agent may take advantage of it. For example, if the user is using a word processing application to create a document, little processing power is being utilized by the word processing program, leaving the computer's CPU and video processor underutilized. Thus, the agent could execute commands to these processors during dead cycles. In this way, the agent may facilitate the completion of workload processing in a reduced time. In addition, this agent may be self-updating upon connecting to the server systems , so that the agent may be kept up to date with current software revisions and workload activities. It is also noted that the agent may manage work on multiple workloads at the same time, so that any given distributed device connected to the network  may be working on a plurality of workloads at any given time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 2C","b":["270","270","272","108","270","272","108","272","108","108","272","130","132"]},"The clients system agent  may also include a workload engine , a statistics\/user interface\/incentive advertising block , and a workload package and update processing block . In the example shown in , workloads  pass through the security subsystem  and along line  to the workload package and update processing block . In this block , the agent  may be updated by the server systems . Alternatively, the agent  may determine, when connected to the server systems , whether it needs to be updated and then accomplish that updating automatically. Once the workload package is processed, the workload engine  may receive the workload following line . The workload engine  works on the workload, ultimately completing the workload. The results or status of the workload may then be sent through the security subsystem  following line . The results  may then be provided back to the server systems .","The statistics\/user interface\/incentive advertising block  may provide workload, incentive and other statistics, as well as any other desired interface features, to the user of the client system. For example, the block  may show a user the expected amount of processing time it will take for the client system to complete a workload task based upon the capabilities of the system. As also shown, the block  may receive information following lines  and  from the workload package and update processing block  and from the workload engine . If desired, security information from the security subsystem  could also be displayed to the user of the client system. It is noted that the information displayed to the user of the client system may be modified and selected as desired without departing from the present invention.","With respect to incentive advertising, the block  may also show the user of the client system how this processing time might change depending upon various possible upgrades to the capabilities of the client system, such as a faster microprocessor, more memory, more disk storage space, etc. Furthermore, the client system capabilities may be shown correlated to the incentives provided to the client system for participation. Thus, the user may be provided information as to how the user's incentives would increase or change depending upon other computer systems or upgraded capabilities the user could acquire. This incentive value increase may also be tied to upgrades to particular vendor's devices. For example, if the user's device is a computer system having an ABC microprocessor, the block  may provide the user information as to increased incentive values based upon an upgrade to a more powerful ABC microprocessor. Similarly, if the user's device is a computer system obtained from ABC, the block  may provide the user information as to increased incentive values based upon an upgrade to a more powerful ABC computer system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 2D","FIG. 2D"],"b":["276","276","230","230","104","276","221","222","224","226","228","244","246","248","230","221","222","224","226","228","244","246","248","276"]},"In , the processor values interface tab  is the one currently selected by the user. This tab  (Processor Values) includes example information that may be displayed to the user. Assuming that a workload is being processed by the agent client manager, the user may select the button  (Show My Incentive Values) to show the user's current incentive values associated with the workload being performed. The personal incentive values chart  (My Personal Incentive Values) may then be displayed to the user. As shown, the incentive values are provided in a relative scale from 1 to 10. The key designation  represents the incentives associated with the users current central processing unit (CPU) or microprocessor.","As indicated above, this incentive information may also be tied to the specific vendor of the user's CPU, for example, ABC Company's CPU. Thus, as shown, the key designation  (My current processor) and the corresponding bar graph portion  represent incentives for the user's current CPU (e.g., a 166 MHz processor). The key designation  represents the incentives that the user is projected to have if the user were to upgrade the CPU. Again, this upgrade incentive information may be tied to the specific vendor of the user's CPU or to any other vendor, if desired. Thus, as shown, the key designation  (NEW ABC 1 GHz processor!) and the corresponding bar graph portion  represent incentives for an upgrade to a new ABC CPU (e.g., a new ABC 1 GHz processor). In this manner, a user may be provided an incentive to increase the capabilities of the distributed device, and a vendor may be provided advertising so that the user is also directed to a particular upgrade.","Looking further to , other similar incentive related information tabs may be provided for any desired capability of the distributed device. For example, tab  (Memory Values) represents information that may be provided for the memory capabilities of the distributed device. Tab  (Graphics Values) represents information that may be provided for the graphics capabilities of the distributed device. Tab  (Communications Values) represents information that may be provided for the communication capabilities of the distributed device. Tab  (Storage Values) represents information that may be provided for the storage capabilities of the distributed device. Tab  (System Values) represents information that may be provided for the system capabilities as a whole for the distributed device.","In addition to these incentive related information tabs, other tabs may be included to provide information and control for any desired features of the agent client manager. For example, the tab  (Current: Prime Search) represents information that may be displayed to the user about the current workload being performed by the agent client manager, for example, a search for large prime numbers. The tab  (Settings) represents information that may be displayed to the user about various settings for the client agent manager. In particular, the tab  may provide the user the ability to control any desired aspect of the operation of the agent client manager. For example, the user may be able to select a portion of the capabilities that may be utilized (e.g., a maximum of 20% of the system memory), the types of workloads that may be performed (e.g., only scientific research projects), the times when the agent may utilize system resources (e.g., only between 12 to 6 am, or only when the system is idle), or any other desired operational feature. It is noted that in addition to upgrade incentive information indicated above, the user may also be provided information as to how incentives would increase if the user allocated or changed the settings for the agent client manager.","Now looking to , the server systems  may be one or more computer systems that operate to identify client system capabilities, organize workloads, and utilize client systems to accomplish a desired task. The server systems  includes a control system  a workload database , and a sweepstakes system , as discussed more below. The workload database  stores any desired project task, which may be broken up into discrete workload tasks WL, WL . . . WLN, as represented by elements ,  . . . . The workload database may also store one or more benchmark workloads (BWL)  that may be utilized to determine client system capabilities in response to a standard workload. Through line , the workload database  communicates with control system . Control system , for example, receives original workload  and transfers it to the interface  through line . The interface  then transfers the workload  to the network  through line . This workload  is ultimately received as workload  by client system ,  or , as shown in FIG. A. The result  is ultimately received by the control system  through interface  and line .","In allocating workloads, the control system  may consider the capabilities of the client systems ,  and  to which the control system  is sending workloads. For example, if client  has more processing power than client , the control system  may allocate and send more difficult or larger workloads. Thus, client  may receive WL and WL, while client  would only receive WL. Alternatively, the workload database  could be organized with differing levels of processing power or capability requirements for each workload. In this way, WL may represent a greater processing or system capability requirement than WL. It should be noted that workload may be a processing task, a data storage task, or tied to any other of a variety of capabilities that may be utilized on the client systems ,  . . . .","As indicated above, to encourage owners or users of client systems to allow their system capabilities to be utilized by control system , an incentive system may be utilized. This incentive system may be designed as desired. Incentives may be provided to the user or owner of the clients systems when the client system is signed-up to participate in the distributed processing system, when the client system completes a workload for the distributed processing system, or any other time during the process. In addition, incentives may be based upon the capabilities of the client systems, based upon a benchmark workload that provides a standardized assessment of the capabilities of the client systems, or based upon any other desired criteria.","One example use of a benchmark workload is to use the benchmark workload to determine incentive values. For example, the server systems  may be designed to send out a standard benchmark workload once an hour to each client system ,  . . . . If a client system is not available at that time for any reason, the workload would not be completed by the client system, and there would be no incentive value generated for that client system. In this example, the benchmark workload may be a timed work-set that would exercise each subsystem with capabilities within the client system that was desired to be measured. A more capable client system would then generate greater incentive values from executing the benchmark workload, as compared to a lesser capable client system. These incentive values may be utilized as desired to determine what the client system should get in return for its efforts. For example, if the incentive were a sweepstakes as discussed further below, the number of entries in the sweepstakes may be tied to the system's performance of the benchmark workload. Thus, the faster or better the client system performs the benchmark workload, the more entries the client system would receive.","In the embodiment shown in , the server systems  includes a sweepstakes system  that functions with control system  to provide incentives for the users or owners of client systems ,  and  to allow their system capabilities to be used by the server systems . The control system  may determine a sweepstakes entry value  that is sent along line  to the sweepstakes system . The sweepstakes system  may then receive sweepstakes entry  and provide it to the sweepstakes engine  through line . The sweepstakes engine  may process the entries and determine a winner, when desired. In the embodiment shown, therefore, entries to the sweepstakes may be generated each time a unit of work is accomplished by one or more of the subsystems within a client system ,  or  via an agent installed on the device for the purposes of managing and completing units of work. The total entries for any period of time would, therefore, be dynamic depending on how many are received. Odds of winning would then be determined by the total number of entries received and the total number of entries contributable to any given entrant.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["300","104","152","134","340","104","346","344","342","243","245","245","2","243","134","104","134"]},"The customer systems , which represent customers that have projects that they desired to be processed by the distributed processing system, may be connected to the project pre-processing subsystem  to provide projects to the servers systems . These projects are processed by the project pre-processing subsystem  and passed to the results\/workloads production subsystem , which produces and sends out workloads  and receives back results . The analytic system  then takes the results and processes them as desired. Completed project information may then be provided from the analytic system  to the customer systems . In this manner, the projects of the customer systems  may be processed and project results reported by the distributed processing system of the present invention.","Also, as shown, the workloads  and the results , or other tasks of the server systems , may be processed and handled by out-sourced host systems , if desired. Thus, some or all of the workloads  may be sent first to out-sourced host systems . Out-sourced host systems  then send workloads A to the client systems  and receive back results A. The out-sourced host systems  then send the results  back to the server systems . It is noted that this out-sourcing of server system tasks may be implemented as desired for any given task that the server systems  may have. It is further noted that, if desired, the server systems  may perform all of the desired functions of the server systems  so that no out-sourced host systems  would be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 3C","b":["350","360","130","132","354","360","352","356","356","352","558","350"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 3D","b":["350","356","360","352","358","354"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","104","402","104","402","418","104","404","420","406","104","108","110","112","406","104","108","110","112","104","408"]},"At this point, control passes along line  to the \u201cdetermine sweepstakes entries\u201d block . In this block , the server system  determines the entry value for the workload completed or for a standard benchmark or entry workload completed. This entry value may be weighted upon a variety of factors including factors such as the amount of work completed, the difficulty level of the processing required, and the accuracy of the results. It is noted that any desired weighting may be utilized. Thus, it is understood that a wide variety of considerations may be utilized to determine the entry value weighting for the sweepstakes.","Although the weighting determination is shown in block  in , the entry value may also be determined, in whole or in part, when a client system signs on to the distributed processing distributed system of the present invention. For example, if a client system has state-of-the-art CPU, video processor, DSP engine, memory, and large amounts of free disk storage space, a high entry value may be allocated to this client system up-front. In contrast, a client system that has a slow CPU, a weak video processor, no DSP engine, little memory, and little free disk storage space may be allocated a small entry value. In this way, the owners or users of the client systems may be provided immediate feedback as to the potential sweepstakes entry value of their computer systems, devices and system capabilities.","It is further noted that the entry value may take any desired form and may be, for example, a multiplier that will be used for each unit of workload completed. In this way, the owner or user will readily be cognizant that a state-of-the-art system will yield a high multiplier, where as an older system, system capability or device will yield a low multiplier. Such feedback, whether communicated to the owner or user immediately upon signing up or upon completion of each workload, will create an incentive for owners and\/or users to acquire state-of-the-art systems, thereby further increasing the potential processing power of the distributed processing system of the present invention.","In addition, different workload projects may be designated with different entry values, as well. For example, some workload projects may require particular hardware or software processing systems within a client system or device. Thus, the number of client systems that are capable of performing the task would be limited. To further encourage participation by those owners or users with capable systems, the entry value for taking on particular workloads and\/or systems with the desired features may be allocated higher entry values.","Referring back to , control passes along line  to the \u201cprocess entries\u201d block .

The client systems ,  . . .  process these workloads and produce indexing results. The resulting index may be stored at a centrally managed site, such as central index storage block , or may itself be distributed over the possibly millions of indexing clients ,  . . . , as shown by remote index storage blocks ,  . . . . If remote index storage is utilized, a master database content index may be stored locally, for example, in the central index storage block . This content index may then direct relevant searches to the distributed massively parallel engine for search queries.","Referring now to , a functional block diagram is shown for a network site indexing operation  according to the present invention. As described in  with respect to other systems , there may be any number of computer and processing systems connected to the network . Any one of these others systems  may publish information on the network  for access by any other system connected to the network . This information to be indexed may take a wide variety of forms, including, for example, text, images, audio streams, video streams, databases, spreadsheets, PDF files, Shockwave data, Flash data, applications, data files, chat streams, or any other information, data or data streams that may be accessible on a network site. The distributed processing system of the present invention may have as a workload the task of indexing this potentially massive amount of information.","For example, where the network  is the Internet or a large intranet, a large amount of processing power and time is needed to create an accurate, complete and up-to-date index of the information. The Internet uses an IP (Internet Protocol) address protocol to direct traffic around the Internet. The IP address is the address of a computer attached to a TCP\/IP (Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol) network. Every system on the network must have a unique IP address. IP addresses are typically written as four sets of numbers separated by periods. The TCP\/IP packet uses 32 bits to contain the IP address, which is made up of a network and host address (NETID and HOSTID). The more bits used for network address, the fewer remain for hosts. Web pages within a particular web site with a unique address may be addressed through URLs (Uniform Resource Locator) associated with that web site. In short, there is a limited, but very large, number of possible IP addresses for uniquely identifiable Internet sites that may be accessed and analyzed to generate an index of Internet sites and web pages via URLs.","The operation diagram of  starts with the \u201cclients receive indexing workloads\u201d block . In this block, the system server  provides the clients systems ,  . . .  with a workload task to index a portion of the information accessible on the network . For example, with the Internet, each workload may be single IP address or groups of URLs or, in some cases, large data types contained on single sites or pages. Following line , the \u201cclients interact with other systems\u201d block  represents the operation of the agent installed on the client systems ,  . . .  to access the network sites, according to the assigned workload, and index the information accessible on that site. This indexing may include all types of information accessible on that site, including text, audio, image, video, etc.","Next, following lines  and , the client systems ,  and  complete the workload tasks, get the results ready for transmission, and sends those results back to the system server  in \u201cclients complete workload\u201d block  and \u201cindexing results sent to server system\u201d block . Control passes along line  to \u201cindex compiled for use\u201d block  where the server system formats and\/or compiles the results for use. For example, the index results may be utilized for accurate, complete and up-to-date search information for the network . As indicated with respect to , the resulting index may be stored remotely or locally following line . Thus, element  represents remote storage of the index, and element  represents central storage of the index. It is noted that the index may also be stored with a mixture of central and remote storage, as desired.

WLN within the workload database  may require widely varying processing requirements. Thus, in order to better direct resources to workload projects, the server system may access various system vectors when a client system signs up to provide processing time and other system or device capabilities to the server system.

In this respect, the capability vector database  keeps track of any desired feature of client systems or devices in capability vectors CBV, CBV . . .

Quality of service (QoS) testing refers to testing a user's experience accessing a network site under normal usability situations. Load testing refers to testing what a particular network site's infrastructure can handle in user interactions.
