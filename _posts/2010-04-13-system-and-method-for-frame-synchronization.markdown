title: System and method for frame synchronization
abstract: A system and method for calculating and applying a metric that is calculated over a binary interval that corresponds in length to a preamble. The value of the metric reflects the likelihood that the interval is the preamble. A lower value for the metric suggests that the interval is more likely to be the preamble. In an embodiment, the metric is calculated beginning at an initial location in the bitstream, and then recalculated beginning at each of several successive locations in the bitstream. This results in a set of calculated metrics. The start of the preamble is considered likely to be the initial location of the interval that corresponds to the metric having the lowest value.

The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention described herein relates to communications systems, and in particular relates to frame synchronization.","2. Description of Related Art","Free-space optical communications benefit from the advances in photonics that have enabled fiber-based optical systems to achieve a prominent role in wired backbone networks. Despite this success, however, physical layer and link layer protocols developed for fiber optics systems may not translate successfully to free-space optical applications.","This is seen in the frame synchronization process for packet communications over free-space optical links. Generally, a transmitter sends binary data to a receiver. The binary data is organized into frames of N bits. The receiver sees a continuous stream of bits and must determine the frame structure of the received data. In particular, the receiver needs to determine where each frame starts. This is required for a number of processes, including but not limited to forward error correction. The process of determining the starting point of frames is fundamental to frame synchronization.","One mechanism by which frame synchronization may be achieved involves the insertion of a known preamble into each frame. A transmitter may, for example, add a known preamble that is L bits long at the beginning of each frame. If the entire frame is N bits long, then the preamble will be followed by N\u2212L data bits. The receiver must therefore find the preamble in each frame in order to determine the starting point of the frame. Finding the preamble is therefore required in order to attain frame synchronization.","This poses a processing problem for packet communications over a noisy channel as is the case for wireless radio and free space optical systems. The receiver must identify a bit pattern that matches the known preamble despite the fact that the received signal contains random user data and each bit signal may be corrupted by noise. Note that the communications receiver must compare the received noisy signal to a threshold in order to determine whether a 0 is present or a 1 is present. Such a determination may only be probabilistic in a noisy environment. The possibly noise-corrupted random user data further complicates the preamble identification because it might match or partially match parts of the preamble.","What is needed, therefore, is a system and method by which preamble identification may take place with a relatively high probability of accuracy by minimizing errors caused by noise or random user data.","The system and method described herein applies a metric that is calculated in a sliding window of consecutive bits in the received data. The metric calculation examines all possible locations of the preamble within the data frame, each window consisting of a set of consecutive bit positions whose length is equal to that of the known preamble. The value of the metric reflects the likelihood that the window is the preamble. In certain embodiments of the invention, smaller values for the metric suggest that the window is more likely to be the preamble Thus, in such embodiments, the metric is calculated beginning at an initial location in the bitstream, and then recalculated beginning at each of several successive locations in the bitstream. The metric calculations are therefore performed starting at each of several successive initial locations. This results in a set of calculated metrics. The start of the preamble is considered to be the initial location of the interval that corresponds to the metric having the lowest value. The metric can therefore be viewed as a decision metric, in that its value enables a decision as to whether the window likely represents the preamble.","It should be noted, however, that transformations can be applied to a given decision metric to produce an equally useful new decision metric for which the decision rule might be the same (i.e., choose the window that generates the smallest value of the decision metric) or the opposite (i.e., choose the window that generates the largest value). For example, creating new metrics from old metrics by adding a constant or multiplying by a positive scalar will not change the frame start decisions. More generally, applying any increasing function to the metrics (e.g. logarithm) will not change the frame start decisions under the same minimum-value decision rule. On the other hand, creating new metrics by multiplying the original metric by \u22121 requires that the decisions be made instead based on the maximum, rather than minimum, value of the new metrics. In general, applying any decreasing function of the original (minimum-value decision rule) metrics yields equally useful new metrics for which the maximum-value decision rule produces the same frame start decisions. The choice of specific transformations to apply to a given set of metrics is a matter of convenience or preference. For reasons of brevity and clarity, the invention will be presented in terms embodiments of the decision metrics. Transformations of the metrics described below represent additional embodiments of the invention.","The system and method described herein may be applied in a frame-based communications system that operates in a noisy environment. One example of such a system is a free-space optical system using on-off keying (OOK) modulation that is detected via an optically amplified p-i-n photodiode receiver. For such systems, the channel is a quasi-static fading channel with additive white Gaussian noise having the property that the noise variance is higher for a received 1 than for a received 0. Channel fading may be due to atmospheric turbulence and may be a slowly-changing stochastic process with time constants on the order of milliseconds or longer. As the turbulence becomes more severe, signal fades may become deep and persistent. The synchronization process and system described herein presumes the prepending of the data payload with a unique word sequence or preamble that identifies the start of a frame. The preamble and packet durations are usually much smaller than the coherence time of the channel, so that as far as frame synchronization is concerned, the channel may be modeled as an additive white Gaussian noise channel with signal-dependent noise variance. Should the coherence time of the channel be comparable to or smaller than the frame duration, so that the fading causes significant amplitude distortion in the received signal associated with the bit stream, the distortion could be estimated and corrected prior to or as part of the frame synchronization function.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention is now described with reference to the figures, where like reference numbers indicate identical or functionally similar elements. Also in the figures, the leftmost digit of each reference number corresponds to the figure in which the reference number is first used. While specific configurations and arrangements are discussed, it should be understood that this is done for illustrative purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other configurations and arrangements can be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the relevant art that this invention can also be employed in a variety of other systems and applications.","The description that follows presents the invention in the context of a free-space optical (FSO) packet communications system. This is not meant to limit the applicability of the invention. Embodiments of the invention may be implemented in a variety of frame-based digital communications systems where noise may be an issue.","In a FSO transceiver system, a direct detection optical receiver may be used, containing an optical pre-amplifier and p-i-n photodiode photodetector that is AC-coupled to a trans-impedance current amplifier (TIA). The modulation format may be on-off keying (OOK) with equally likely signals. Individual received bit decisions are made by comparing signal levels, output by the TIA, to a threshold that may be fixed at a constant (often set to zero for low-cost receivers) or an optimal threshold which depends on received signal levels.","The overall processing of the invention is illustrated in , according to an embodiment. At , an initial location in the received bitstream is chosen. At , the decision metric is calculated beginning at the chosen initial location. The metric is calculated as a function of L consecutive bits, where L is equal to the length of the preamble. In an embodiment, L may be equal to 32 bits for example.","The decision metric may take any of several forms. Generally, the decision metric includes a first term indicative of the difference between the signal levels of the received detected bits and the corresponding bit signal levels expected if the preamble were present at position \u03bc, and a second term indicative of the difference between the signal levels of the received detected bits and the corresponding bit signal levels expected for the received detected bits. The first and second terms are dependent on noise variances associated with the expected signal levels.","The decision metric S(\u03bc) is defined as follows in an embodiment of the invention:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"S","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03bc"}},{"mrow":[{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","munder":{"mrow":[{"mn":"0","mo":["\u2264","<"],"mi":["i","L"]},{"msub":[{"mi":["s","i"]},{"mi":"\u03c1","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u03bc","i"],"mo":"+"},"mo":",","mi":"HD"}}],"mo":"\u2260"}]}},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"\u03c1","mrow":{"mo":"\u2063","mrow":{"mi":["\u03bc","i"],"mo":"+"}}},{"mi":["As","i"]}],"mo":"-"},"msub":{"mi":"\u03c3","msub":{"mi":["s","i"]}}}},"mn":"2"}},{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","munder":{"mrow":[{"mn":"0","mo":["\u2264","<"],"mi":["i","L"]},{"msub":[{"mi":["s","i"]},{"mi":"\u03c1","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u03bc","i"],"mo":"+"},"mo":",","mi":"HD"}}],"mo":"\u2260"}]}},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03c1","mrow":{"mi":["\u03bc","i"],"mo":"+"}},"mo":"-","mrow":{"mi":"A","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":"\u03c1","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u03bc","i"],"mo":"+"},"mo":",","mi":"HD"}}}},"msub":{"mi":"\u03c3","msub":{"mi":"\u03c1","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u03bc","i"],"mo":"+"},"mo":",","mi":"HD"}}}}},"mn":"2"}},{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","munder":{"mrow":[{"mn":"0","mo":["\u2264","<"],"mi":["i","L"]},{"msub":[{"mi":["s","i"]},{"mi":"\u03c1","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u03bc","i"],"mo":"+"},"mo":",","mi":"HD"}}],"mo":"\u2260"}]}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mi":"log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":"\u03c3","msub":{"mi":["s","i"]}},{"mi":"\u03c3","msub":{"mi":"\u03c1","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u03bc","i"],"mo":"+"},"mo":",","mi":"HD"}}}]}}},"mn":"2"},"mo":"."}}],"mo":["-","+"]}],"mo":"="}}}},"In this expression,","L=length of the preamble,","i is a bit index,","\u03c1=signal level (referred to herein as a soft decision value) of received detected bit at position \u03bc+i,","\u03c1=binary value (referred to herein as a hard decision value) produced by bit detector for received detected bit at position \u03bc+i,","s=ibit of the preamble, equal to 0 or 1,","A=amplitude corresponding to the difference between the expected signal level of a received detected bit of binary value 1 and the expected signal level of a received detected bit of binary value 0, and","\u03c3=standard deviation of noise associated with a received detected bit having binary value equal to the subscript of this variable.","As would be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, in other embodiments of the invention, various transformations of the above decision metric may be used instead, as noted above.","Returning to , at  the initial location is advanced by one position.

In an embodiment, N may be equal to 512 bits, for example. The process iterates through -, with a new decision metric generated each time. Each new decision metric is therefore calculated based on an L-long window of bits, where the window advances by one position after each calculation. The next metric calculation is then based on the L bits in the new window.","If, at , the new initial location is now N bits away from the originally chosen initial location, then the process continues at . Here, the likely start of the preamble (and the start of the frame) is identified as the initial location for the L consecutive bits that yield the minimal decision metric.

In either case, it is an extremal value of the decision metric that is used to identify the start of the preamble.","In some embodiments, it may be appropriate to restate the above metric calculation by applying one or more assumptions. The above decision metric requires knowledge of the average signal level and signal-dependent noise variances as well as soft information (analog values) from the bit detector. In a practical implementation, the average signal level and noise variances could be estimated directly from average optical power measurements for a calibrated receiver, and the detector output could be quantized by analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion with negligible loss if the number of bits in the A\/D converter is not small.","Typically, however, the detectors used in FSO receivers for OOK modulation provide only one bit of precision\u2014that is, hard-decision estimates.
