The owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by any one of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyrights whatsoever.","Certain marks referenced herein may be common law or registered trademarks of third parties affiliated or unaffiliated with the applicant or the assignee. Use of these marks is for providing an enabling disclosure by way of example and shall not be construed to limit the scope of this invention to material associated with such marks.","1. Field of Art","The subject matter relates generally to providing media content services in a networked environment and, more particularly, to visualization of media content navigation with unified media devices controlling in a networked environment.","2. Description of the Related Art","One of the emerging technologies is multimedia home networking. Multimedia home networking enables consumers to share audio, video, and data across multiple media devices (such as televisions, portable media players, cell phones, and computers) using a secure home network. Several media devices associated with playback of media content can be connected in a home network. Media content can be delivered to the home network via a variety of networks, such as wired and wireless networks and the Internet. Cable, satellite, optical network set-top boxes (STBs), television (TV) receivers, radio receivers, computers, and other content receivers or players can receive media content from various media content sources which are local or remote to the home network.","Remote sources include a media server connected to the World Wide Web, or a broadcast system supporting, for example, cable TV, satellite TV, digital TV, or other sources of audiovisual (AV) content. Local sources include DVD recorders and players, compact disc (CD) recorders and players, analog phonograph record players, analog VCRs, digital video recorders (DVRs), analog and digital camcorders, digital cameras, computers, MP3 players, and other storage devices that store media content for playback. Receivers or players can be coupled to plasma monitors, liquid crystal display (LCD) monitors, analog TV monitors, digital picture frames, surround sound systems, speakers, and other playback devices to decode and play media content.","Some or all the above systems may be connected in a network environment, such as a home network. For example, in a home network, several TVs, DVD players or computers may be connected through a local network that receives media content delivered from a remote source. Controlling or scheduling the playback of content on different devices in the network can provide a challenge to an end user. Particularly, each device is implemented to be responsive to control signals generated by a specific control device which is generally provided by the manufacturer of that device. Thus, an end user may have to use several control devices (e.g., remote controls) to operate and use each receiver or player.","Searching of content in different remote or local sources in the network can provide another challenge to an end user. Particularly, some of the playback devices are very inconvenient for content search (e.g. an Internet content search on a TV screen), lacking a proper input device, while others are being used for content playback. Searching in parallel to content play and view disturbs and interrupts other end users. Thus, an end user may have to use several other devices (e.g., a desk top PC) to search for a specific content while juggling with several control devices for content display.","Currently existing solutions to the above described challenges are partial and limited. For example, the existing solutions require end users to partially operate multiple media devices in one control flow. An end user may define media services on a TV, starts a content search on a PC, moves the search result (e.g., a streaming video) to a set-up-box connected to the TV, and watches the streaming video on the TV. The limited control for multiple media devices for content search, content preview and content management is impossible, and in other cases inconvenient, because the user generally has to press several different buttons to control each device. Further, such control devices are not configurable to control the flow of content received by different receivers to different players in the network.","Hence, there is, inter alia, a lack of a system and method that efficiently visualizes media content navigation with unified media devices controlling in a networked environment.","The disclosed embodiments beneficially allow for a user interface device and methods that efficiently enhance consumer experience of media content on a variety of playback devices. A graphical user interface (GUI)-based media controller provides an intuitive visualization of media content navigation with unified media devices controlling. The GUI-based controller allows a user to access the variety of media content from heterogeneous media content providers and to allow the user to navigate the media content via a wide set of media devices.","In accordance with one embodiment, a method is disclosed for controlling a plurality of media objects connected to a network. The method displays a subset of a group of predefined functional interfaces. A functional interface comprises one or more user menus and each user menus is associated with at least one media object. The method forwards a user request to a control server and to receive a response to the user request from the control server. A user request comprises one or more user interactions with the subset of the functional interfaces. The method further comprises updating the subset of the functional interfaces on the display screen.","In accordance with another embodiment, a computing system (and method) is configured for controlling a plurality of media objects connected to a network through a control point is disclosed. The system is further configured for displaying a subset of a group of predefined functional interfaces on a display screen of the control point according to a configuration (e.g., linear, two-dimensional or three-dimensional). The system is also configured for forwarding a user request to a control server. In response to a response to a user request from the control server, the system updates the subset of the functional interfaces on the display screen of the control point based on the response. Thus, a user can navigate media content, search for media resources, discover media playback devices and perform other operations which are offered on a variety of electronic devices through a single control point.","In accordance with another embodiment, a computing system (and method) is configured for facilitating controlling of a plurality of electronic devices connected to a network through a control server is disclosed. The computing system allows the control server to receive a user request from a control point, construct a response to the user request based on the type of the user action and forward the response to the control point.","The features and advantages described in the specification are not all inclusive and, in particular, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and may not have been selected to delineate or circumscribe the disclosed subject matter.","Where feasible, features, elements, and aspects of the invention that are referenced by the same numerals in different figures represent the same, equivalent, or similar features, elements, or aspects, in accordance with one or more embodiments.","Reference will now be made in detail to several embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying figures.

The environment  comprises a Media over Coax (MOCA) network , an Ethernet over power lines network , a wired local area network (WLAN) , and a wireless network  (e.g., a Wi-Fi network that conforms to the IEEE 802.11 standard). For ease of discussion, the WLAN  will be referenced as an Ethernet connection. The environment  also comprises a connection to the Internet . Coupled to the Internet  may be one or more servers  comprising one or more databases for storing media content.","The environment  comprises media devices such as a set-top box (STB) and a digital video recorder (DVR) combination  that is coupled via cable to a cable headend and to the MOCA network . The STB\/DVR player  is capable of playback of media content and is also a source for media content, and may act as a media server in a Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) context. In one embodiment, media devices in the network environment  conform to the UPnP standard. An example of a role of each media device under the UPnP standard is shown in parentheses in .","The environment  also comprises a first STB  and a second STB  that are coupled to the MOCA network . Each of these is a media player in the UPnP context and is coupled to a monitor for viewing media content. The MOCA network  is coupled to the Ethernet . Coupled to the Ethernet  is a network attached storage device (NAS)  for storing media content. The NAS device  can be used as a media server in the UPnP context, and can be configured to send content for playback to a playback device in the out-of-band channel.","In one embodiment, the NAS device  comprises logic  that when executed implements an embodiment of a control server. A control server, for example, may be any device or module for controlling media devices in network environment . A control point, for example, may be any device or module connected to a control server that implements a user interface for controlling media devices in network environment . In some embodiments, the control server and the control point may be the same device.","Also coupled to the Ethernet  is a personal computer (PC)  that may be configured in the UPnP context to act as at least one of a media server, a media store source configurable to send media content to a media player, a media player to play content, a control server, or a control point, in accordance with one embodiment. The PC  may also comprise logic  that when executed on a processor of the PC  implements the control server and the control point connected to the control server.","The Ethernet  is also coupled to the Internet  and the Ethernet over powerlines network . A speaker system , which acts as a media player in the UPnP context, is coupled to the Ethernet over powerlines network . Also coupled to the Ethernet  is a wireless network access point  for the wireless network . In one embodiment, the wireless network access point  also acts as a switch, router, or gateway for other networks.","The wireless network access point  may also be operable as a wireless control server that acts as a control point in the UPnP context. A wireless control device  may communicate with the wireless media adapter  to control one or more of the devices and locate content in one or another media server. In one embodiment, the wireless media adapter  includes a processor and a memory for storing logic code  that when executed on the processor of the wireless media adapter  implements a control server.","Several portable devices are coupled to the wireless network , as shown in . A laptop PC  and a wireless portable media player  (e.g., an audio or video player) are operable to be coupled to the WLAN . Each of these may act as a media server, a media player, or a control point in the UPnP context. Also coupled to the wireless network  are portable devices that may be used as control devices. Each of the portable devices may be operable to communicate with a control server to provide remote control functionality to one or more media server or media player devices or locate and play content. It is noted that although the examples herein are described in the context of a wireless portable media player , in alternate embodiments the media player may be a wired media player.","The portable devices may comprise a voice-over-IP (VoIP) phone , a touch screen mobile (or cellular) phone , or a hand-held computer  (e.g., a mobile Internet device (MID)), each including a processing system and software to implement media control interface functionality, and other optional components to store and play media content, so that the devices , , and  may be operable as at least one or more of a control point, media server, or a media player, in the context of UPnP. In some embodiments, remote control functionality may be provided in conjunction with services provided by a control server (e.g., software running on the media center PC ).","In one or more embodiments, the network environment  may not include all the above components or may comprise other components. Also, it should be understood that the systems and methods provided herein are equally applicable to devices that do not conform to the UPnP standard. As provided earlier, a control server may be any device or module for controlling media devices in network environment , and a control point may be any device or module connected to a control server that implements a user interface for controlling media devices in network environment .","Efficiently controlling the variety of media devices as described above in the network environment needs an intuitive and flexible mechanism. The disclosed configuration includes a method and a system for efficiently controlling a variety of media objects. Examples of a media object includes media devices and media content processed by the media devices. In one embodiment, media content processing by a media device comprises displaying the media content on the media device, controlling interactions with the media content through one or more applications operational on the media device, and enabling media content navigation in an intuitive and flexible way. Other embodiments can include other media content processing operations. The disclosed configuration describes a \u201cgraphical world\u201d which consists of functional interface blocks to implement functionalities such as searching for desired content in one device, deciding when and where to play the content and adding new media devices to the network environment .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"],"b":["200","200","150"]},"\u201cService\u201d interface allows a user to configure his or her service provider's preferences. \u201cPackages\u201d interface describes the predefined properties of a media source. \u201cSource\u201d interface provides a list of accessible media sources in the network environment . \u201cSearch\u201d interface describes search filters and search criteria (such as tags or keywords) for the items in the package of a media source. \u201cMedia\u201d interface displays the relevant media content items affected by performing a search according to the filters and the criteria upon the selected media sources. An item in the \u201cMedia\u201d interface can be a simple item, such as a picture or a song, or a compound item, such as a playlist of pictures or a music album. \u201cPreview\u201d interface allows a user to preview the media content of a selected media item. \u201cPick\u201d interface provides a list of selected media items, each of which is from an accessible media source. \u201cPlug\u201d interface provides a list of playable media items. \u201cPlug\u201d interface may include playlists from different media sources, of different types and\/or in different formats. \u201cPlay\u201d interface provides a list of available playback devices and their corresponding controls. \u201cSet\u201d interface allows a user to configure settings for media playback devices. \u201cDiscovered\u201d interface allows the user to navigate through a list of all automatically discovered playback devices.","The functional interfaces are defined on one or more control servers and include internal logic, predefined relations to other functional interfaces and a graphical user interface representation that can be displayed as blocks, for example. The functional interfaces are arranged in a predefined linear configuration according to one or more pre-defined logical relationships between the functional interfaces such that a subset of the functional interfaces are displayed on a virtual porthole of the control device in a predefined order (e.g., adjacent to each other). A user action on a user selected functional interface transmits a signal to a server that causes the server to perform user requested action on the selected functional interface. The action can be done within the server and the results transmitted back to the interface or a signal can be sent to the selected functional interface to have the processing configuration where the selected functional interface is operationally perform the action. The user action on the selected functional interface also affects immediate neighboring functional interfaces in various dimensions due to the pre-defined logical relationships between the functional interfaces. An immediate neighboring functional interface of a selected functional interface refers to the functional interfaces immediately adjacent to the selected functional interface in a same plane or in two different planes (e.g., sharing at least one common axis in an x-y-z coordinate system). The pre-defined logical relationships between the functional interfaces are further described with references to , B, C, D and E.","Depending on implementation, a control server can be configured to allow a user or a programmer to add additional functional interfaces to the exemplary functional interfaces  shown in ,  and . For example, additional functional interfaces can be added to an edge of the predefined configuration or between two existing functional interfaces or in a different plane. In one embodiment, the predefined configuration may be one-dimensional and implemented in a linear arrangement. In another embodiment, the predefined configuration can be defined as a two- or three-dimensional object, suspended in a predefined plane or space subject to user manipulation.","A virtual porthole can be configured to display one or more functional interfaces for controlling media devices in the network environment , where different sets of the functional interfaces  are configured for controlling different functions of media sources or devices in the network environment . The virtual porthole provides a displayable area (view area) of the one or more functional interfaces rendered on a screen of a device (e.g., a control point). For example, the virtual porthole can be rendered on a display screen of a control device, desirably in form of a graphical user interface (GUI). A virtual porthole may be sized to fit in a portion of the display screen or the entire display screen. That is, depending on implementation, the virtual porthole may be rendered on display screens of various configurations (e.g., linear, two-dimensional and three-dimensional) and sizes (length, width and height). In the following, exemplary virtual portholes are disclosed in association with a pure GUI implementation. It is noteworthy, however, that virtual porthole configurations utilizing hardware or a combination of hardware and software (e.g., having hard keypads, spin wheels, or pointing devices) are also possible. For ease of discussion, the terms of \u201cvirtual porthole\u201d and \u201cporthole\u201d are used interchangeably from herein and throughout the entire specification.","Referring now to ,  illustrates two virtual portholes (i.e.,  and ) configured to display one or more functional interfaces  in accordance with one embodiment. The virtual porthole (e.g.,  and ) is a \u201cwindow\u201d into a view of a set of one or more functional interfaces. The virtual porthole ,  can be configured to be any length, width, or height for viewing the functional interfaces that fit within the particular dimensions as defined. In this example, the virtual porthole  includes three adjacent functional interfaces Source, Search and Media and the virtual porthole  includes the three adjacent functional interfaces Pick, Plug, and Play. With the virtual porthole , a user can search for content in selected sources and keep the results for a later view. With the virtual porthole , a user may select, play and control media content.","Based on the predefined functional logic between the functional interfaces, a user action in a selected functional interface not only affects the selected functional interface itself, but also affects its immediate neighboring functional interfaces. For example, \u201cSource\u201d interface has an immediate neighboring interface \u201cSearch\u201d on its right horizontally. A media source can be selected using a search filter and the search result for the \u201cSource\u201d interface affects the \u201cSearch\u201d functional interface, such as causing the \u201cSearch\u201d interface to update its search filters associated with the user.","In another example, a user can dynamically edit the list of items in the \u201cPlug\u201d interface, such as queuing a media item from the \u201cPick\u201d interface into the end of a current list of items, or changing the playback order of the media items. In yet anther example, by making a connection between a media item (simple or compound) from the \u201cPlug\u201d interface and playback device in the \u201cPlay\u201d interface, such as drag-and-dropping the media item selected from the \u201cPlug\u201d interface to the \u201cPlay\u201d interface, the selected media item starts playing on the connected playback device.","In one embodiment, the virtual porthole  displays the current functional interfaces of interest to a user and the virtual porthole  is hidden from the view. In response to a user interaction with the current display, e.g., moving away four functional interfaces to the left of the current display (i.e., the virtual porthole ), the new virtual porthole  displays the Source, Search, and Media interfaces instead of the Pick, Plug, and Play interfaces.","The user can navigate through the functional interfaces  in a variety of ways. For example, depending on the virtual porthole size, the user can navigate one or more functional interfaces at a time, a portion of a functional interface at a time, or a combination thereof.  shows a virtual porthole  that displays two adjacent functional interfaces Pick and Plug, and a virtual porthole  that displays two adjacent functional interfaces Preview and Pick. The virtual porthole  is displayed in response to user moving one functional interface to the left from the virtual porthole . After the move, the new virtual porthole  displays Preview and Pick interfaces instead of Pick and Plug interfaces.","In one embodiment, functional interfaces associated with more frequently used functions or operations (i.e., process flows) may be displayed closer to a predefined reference point (e.g., a central position) of a virtual porthole, and functional interfaces associated with less frequently used process flows may be displayed further away from the predefined reference point. In another embodiment, functional interfaces associated with less advanced process flows may be displayed closer to the predefined reference point of the virtual porthole, and functional interfaces associated with more advanced process flows may be displayed further away from the predefined reference point.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 2C"],"b":["210","211","200","210","211","200"]},"Depending on implementation and the size of a virtual porthole's display screen, a limited number (e.g., a subset) of functional interfaces may be displayed in the virtual porthole. That is, the virtual porthole  may display one or more functional interfaces, a portion of a functional interface, or a combination thereof. In , for example, three functional interfaces (e.g., Source, Search, and Media) are displayed in the porthole , while other functional interfaces (e.g., Preview, Pick, Plug, Play and Set) are hidden from view.

For example, the hardware environment  may be a laptop computer or other portable computing device embodied in an embedded system, for example, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile internet device (MID), a mobile communication unit (e.g., a wireless phone), or other similar hardware platforms that have information processing and\/or data storage and communication capabilities.","In certain embodiments of the system, the communication interface  communicates with other systems by sending and receiving electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information including program code. The communication may be established by way of a remote network (e.g., the Internet), or alternatively by way of transmission over a carrier wave.","Referring to Figure (or FIGS.) , A, , and , the system software  and the application software  may comprise one or more computer programs that are executed on top of an operating system after being loaded from the storage media  into the local memory . In a client-server architecture, the application software  may comprise client software to implement a control point and server software to implement a control server. The control server in one embodiment is local to the control point, for example, in the same physical device. In another embodiment, the control server may be remote to the control point such that the configuration includes two or more separate physical devices.","The software environment  may also comprise communication software  for accessing data available over local or remote computing networks (e.g., network environment ). Further, the software environment  may comprise a GUI  (e.g., virtual porthole P) for receiving user requests and data. Please note that the hardware and software architectures and environments described above are for purposes of example, and one or more embodiments may be implemented over any type of system architecture or processing environment.","It should also be understood that the logic code, programs, modules, processes, methods and the order in which the respective steps of each method are performed are purely exemplary. Depending on implementation, the steps may be performed in any order or in parallel, unless indicated otherwise in the present disclosure. Further, the logic code is not related, or limited to any particular programming language, and may comprise of one or more modules that execute on one or more processors in a distributed, non-distributed or multiprocessing environment.","A user may interact with input options provided by the control point to perform operations associated with functional interfaces . Selection operations may be performed by way of user interaction with a single functional interface to select, add, modify, remove, or change the order of items in the single functional interface. For example, a user can interact with a source interface comprising media servers and sources (e.g., Netflix, abc.com, Comcast, and iTunes) to select sources from which to retrieve media content.","Media sources are items associated with media devices, or with local\/remote media libraries or with remote services such as the Internet or a satellite head-end in the network environment . For example, a cable or satellite broadcasting service (e.g., Comcast, or Dish Network) may be associated with the STB\/DVR  and a media serving service (e.g., Apple iTunes) may be associated with the wireless media player . In one embodiment, a user may use Source interface to select from one or more local or remote sources. Search interface may be used to search for content based on search criteria defined by one or more search filters and selected media sources. A user may view a list of search results and select content for a later use, using Media interface.","A user interacts with a plurality of functional interfaces to establish a logical relationship among two or more functional interfaces. Examples of user interactions include: adding one or more items from one interface to another interface; adding one or more items from one interface to one or more items on another interface; connecting one or more items from one interface to another interface; and connecting one or more items from one interface to one or more items on another interface.","Generally, control point logic implemented in a control point collects requests from a user. A user request represents one or more user interactions with the functional interfaces. A user request can be a simple command requesting the control server to perform a requested action. For example, a user may transmit a request to the control server to search for particular media content from a content provider. A user also can transmit a request that represents a sequence of user interactions with the functional interfaces. For example, a user may transmit a request that includes a selection of the place to play a selected media content and a command that requests the control server to discover other playback devices, e.g., Lost: Season 4 (P) to be played on Living Room TV (P) in . Exemplary user requests further include navigation requests that changes the functional interfaces displayed in a virtual porthole after user moving the porthole in a first or a second direction in a linear functional interfaces predefined arrangement. The user requests also include activating one or more functional interfaces on the server side, that reflect the data to be displayed on the display screen of the connected control point devices.","The control point logic sends the user requests along with operation parameters (e.g., user authentication data, display size and resolution and etc.) to a control server for processing. In one embodiment, the control point logic immediately sends (or transmits) a user request to the control server. Other embodiments allow the control point to accumulate user requests and aggregate multiple user requests into an aggregated user request. The control point sends the aggregated user request to the control server for further processing. Once the control point device receives the requested data, e.g., one or more functional interfaces, the control point displays the relevant set of functional interfaces in the virtual porthole and provides one or more input options to a user for interacting with the virtual porthole.","In one embodiment, during initialization (e.g., when a control point is turned on), the control point establishes a connection with the control server and forwards to the control server its size, and resolution, among other parameters for the number of functional interfaces  to be displayed within a virtual porthole rendered on a display screen of the control point.","In another embodiment, the control point may also forward to a control server a user identifier uniquely identifying a user or a category of users. Accordingly, a customized set of functional interfaces associated with the particular user identifier may be displayed in the virtual porthole. The user identifier may indicate that the user of the control point is a novice user, an advanced user, an under-aged user, or other type of user, so that certain functionalities or operations are enabled or disabled in the functional interfaces . The user identifier may be also used to provide for some of the functional interfaces, custom options or menus to a user based on prior user settings or preferences.","Turning now to ,  illustrates a process of a user interacting with a plurality of functional interfaces to establish a logic relationship among two or more functional interfaces via a control server. Initially, a control point used by the user collects  system and basic data necessary for communication with the server. The system and basic data include user authentication data, display size and resolution, processing capabilities (e.g., CPU power and memory size, etc.) of the control point and etc. The control point initializes  the server communication channel, and sends  the authentication data along with the screen size and resolution and operation parameters to the control server.","Following the initialization, the control point receives  \u201cauthentication successful\u201d flag from the control server along with a list of pointers to the available functional interfaces to be displayed in a virtual porthole. The control point requests  the data for the set of the functional interfaces from the control server relevant to the display. The control point receives  from the control server the requested data and populates the virtual porthole. The control point waits  for a user interaction with a display device. In response to the user navigating  the porthole to a side of the adjacent functional interfaces, the control point requests  the data of the adjacent functional interfaces from the control server. In response to the user performing  local operations (e.g., selecting a media content item), the control point collects  the operation locally to a sequence of operations and requests  the data from the control server for the local operation. In response to the user changing basic data (e.g., user identification) or finishing a sequence of operations on a subset of the functional interfaces, the control point determines  whether the next operation is \u201cexit\u201d request from the user. If it is an \u201cexit\u201d operation, the control point ends  the operation; otherwise, the control point sends  authentication data to the control server and processes through the receiving of the flag  to the end .","A control server detects that a user intends to perform an action by monitoring user interaction with the control point, or being notified by the control point of a desired user action. The control server performs the requested logic for each relevant functional interface and updates information stored for one or more functional interfaces, and forwards update information to the control point device, in response to user interaction. Specifically, upon collecting the basic information and assembling the set of functional interfaces, for each control point device, a control server forwards information to be included in the set of functional interfaces to be displayed on the control point device virtual porthole. The information may be managed and stored in a storage device on the same device as the control server or in a separate storage device remotely accessible by the storage server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":["FIG. 8A","FIG. 8B-8D"],"b":["802","804","806","810","812","814","820","810","812","814","816","818","812","814","822","824"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 8B","b":["830","832","834","836","838","840","844","842"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIG. 8C","b":["850","845","852","856","858","860"]},"To further explain user interactions with a plurality of functional interfaces to establish a logic relationship among two or more functional interfaces via a control server illustrated in , ,  and , exemplary processing results of the user interactions are presented with ,  and .

If the functional interfaces  are arranged in a linear arrangement, the virtual porthole may be moved in first and second directions (e.g., to the left or to the right using navigation buttons P, P). For example, if the user navigates to the right in the linear arrangement, the virtual porthole on the control point device screen presents functional interfaces Media P, Preview P and Pick P, instead of Source P, Search P and Media P.","In some cases, a user action performed using the set of functional interfaces may automatically cause the virtual porthole to be moved in a certain direction. For example, in a virtual porthole that can display only one functional interface, if a user selects content from one functional interface, the control point may cause the virtual porthole to automatically provide a preview of the content by another functional interface in the virtual porthole.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0103"},"figref":"FIG. 4C"},"The user may connect or establish a logical relationship between the selected media (e.g., Channel 5) from Pick interface and Plug interface by, for example, selecting that content item, by pressing that media item associated button P, by selecting an icon associated with the selected content, by way of a drag and drop action, or other interactive means. Once the desired relationship or connection is established between content in Pick interface and Plug interface, Plug interface may display the content in a media display area (e.g., window P) of Plug functional interface of the virtual porthole.","In some embodiments, the user may, for example, select Channel 5 from Pick interface and either preview it in the display area of the Plug interface, or connect the selected content directly (e.g. for convenience) to a particular media device (e.g., the shaded block \u201cLiving Room TV\u201d P) in the network environment  to cause the selected media player to play the episode on the selected media device. For example, when \u201cdragged\u201d directly into Play functional interface, the control point device logic sends the control server a sequence of operations in form of a user request as if the user selected the content item P for preview in Plug functional interface and immediately selected for viewing on the Living room TV P. The control server, in one implementation, checks the content and the playback device for compatibility and starts a playback operation on the playback device if it is compatible, updates Plug functional interface with the content, and displays status change information in Play interface.","In some embodiments, if the selected media (e.g., Channel 5) is subdivided into several sub-contents (e.g., \u201cLost Season 4\u201d may have  recorded episodes), the Plug interface may display a list of the sub-content for user selection in the display area P. The user may, for example, select Episode 01 from Plug interface and preview it in the same display area, or connect the selected episode to a particular media device (e.g., the Living Room TV P) in the network environment  to cause the selected media player to play the episode on the selected media device. Plug interface may also be implemented to provide additional options P (e.g., \u201cRecord\u201d button P and \u201cMore\u201d button P) for viewing even more information or, for example, recording a content being played.","As illustrated in , additional information about a selected content may be presented in the Plug functional interface in the form of an option list o that provides a user with one or more options to learn about the production of the content, demographics of the viewers, or even purchasing related items over the Internet. Accordingly, depending on implementation, Plug interface may provide lists and sub-lists for a variety of possible options and sub-menus for a user in relation to media content selected from Pick interface.","Referring now to ,  illustrates a process of a control server in response to a user playback device discovery request in accordance with one embodiment.

If the authentication is successfully performed, the control server sends  the authenticated playback device an \u201cauthentication successful\u201d flag and opens a communication channel with the playback device. The control server receives  from the playback device a set of parameters including unique identification of the playback device. If the playback device is a pre-known device (e.g., has already registered with the system), the control server retrieves  all information from a device management database about the playback device. In response to the playback device is a newly discovered device, the control server retrieves  all information from the playback device itself (e.g., the manufacturer pre-settings), and updates  the device management database with the information obtained from the playback device.
