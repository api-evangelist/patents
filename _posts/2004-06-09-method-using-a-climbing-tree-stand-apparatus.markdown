The tree climbing stand engages a tree for supporting a hunter above the ground so that the prey does not know the hunter is in the area. In selecting the perfect site to set up his tree stand the hunter will sometimes walk a great distance from the hunter's vehicle to the location of the tree where the hunter will want to set up a tree stand. While making the trek to the tree stand, the hunter will have to carry many items with him, such as his weapon, other accessories and the tree stand. Therefore, any climbing tree stand design or climbing tree stand accessories should be as lightweight and compact as possible to allow the hunter to carry the items a great distance.","After the hunter has mounted the tree stand to the tree, the hunter has to climb onto the tree stand. If the trunk of the tree is round, similar to that of a telephone pole, the climbing tree stand would be attached rather easily and it would also be level at the base of the tree. However, because most trees have thicker trunks then the rest of the tree, when the hunter attaches the climbing tree stand to the tree trunk, the stand will not be level. A worse case would be to have the tree stand be at a steep angle in addition to it being several feet from the ground. The hunter then has to try to climb onto a tree stand that is not level and therefore could cause a potentially dangerous situation for the hunter. Reaching the elevated tree stand presents obvious difficulties to the hunter whether the stand is level or not. While making the ascent to the elevated tree stand, the hunter must bring the necessary weapon and other accessories required by them, a task complicated by the need to use all the hunter's limbs in successfully climbing the tree, while climbing the tree stand. Many of the present tree climbing stands include an upper platform and a cooperating lower foot platform (lower platform). The upper platform is positioned above the lower platform. The hunter first climbs onto the foot platform and raises and secures the upper platform to the tree. The present invention relates to a climbing tree stand apparatus that can be attached to a tree stand as an aid for assisting a person in getting up and easily onto a tree stand or getting down from a tree stand.","Accordingly, the invention is a climbing tree stand apparatus for use in conjunction with a tree stand that is mounted on a tree, the apparatus comprising a load-bearing member adapted to be graspable by a user of the tree stand and at least one point of attachment associated with the load-bearing member wherein the apparatus is adapted to be attached to the tree stand at the at least one point of attachment such that at least a portion of the load-bearing member extends below an underside of the tree stand. Furthermore, the invention provides a method for execution by a user of a climbing tree stand apparatus, the method comprising attaching a support member to a tree stand, wherein at least a portion of the support member extends below an underside of the tree stand; mounting the tree stand on a tree; and supporting at least a portion of the user's weight with the support member while climbing into the tree stand.","Referring more particularly to , wherein like numbers refer to similar parts climbing tree stand  and climbing tree stand apparatus  are shown according to the present invention. The climbing tree stand  shown includes an upper  and a lower  structure for supporting the user and the detachable climbing tree stand apparatus , thereby showing the preferred embodiment according to the invention. Both the upper  and the lower structure  of the tree stand  consists of an outer platform rail, (lower) and (upper) respectively, thereby allowing for the climbing tree stand apparatus  to be attached to opposite sides of the outer rail of the lower structure  of a climbing tree stand . Even though this particular climbing tree stand is shown, it is only used as way to describe the apparatus use with a climbing tree stand ; and therefore, the climbing tree stand apparatus  can be used on other climbing tree stands and is not limited to being used on this climbing tree stand only.","As best shown in , the apparatus, , comprises a load-bearing member adapted to be detachable by a user of the tree stand . The apparatus  is attached at two points to the tree stand  such that at least a portion of the load-bearing member extends below an underside of the tree stand . The load-bearing member of the apparatus  is constructed of a flexible material that hangs freely, and generally in an arciform path having two endpoints  and , when attached to the tree stand . As shown in , the load-bearing member is constructed from a ribbon of flexible sheet material having two ends  and  that terminate in a loop , . Each of the loops,  and  respectively, is formed by placing one end  of the apparatus  around one side of the platform tube of the lower structure  and then looping it back onto itself. On each opposite end of the apparatus  is a retaining bracket,  and , respectively, that retains and holds the loops in place. One of the brackets, , can be seen in more detail in . Each bracket,  and , respectively, is used to tighten and secure each end,  and , of the apparatus  around each side of the lower platform ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","18","18"]},"When the apparatus  is attached to the climbing tree stand  by a user, the user first places the ends  and  of the load bearing member over the tree stand platform from the outside of the platform  and overlaps the platform rail. The user then weaves the end of the load bearing member through the inside of the buckle and back again and at the same time carefully removing any slack. The apparatus  is then attached to the climbing tree stand  as shown in . The apparatus  when attached to the climbing tree stand reduces the platform height thereby making it easier for the user to get onto the stand . The user is then able to place both hands on the upper platform  of the climbing tree stand  and at the same time is able to place one foot on the apparatus  instead of placing one foot directly onto the lower platform . Because the user is able to place one foot on the apparatus  instead of directly onto the lower platform , the user is able to support himself while trying to get onto the lower platform . If the platforms are level then the task of getting onto the platforms  and  is easy. When the platforms  and  are not level and are at an angle, without the use of the apparatus , it is a very difficult task for a user to climb onto the tree stand . After the user has two hands on the upper platform  and a foot on the apparatus , the user is able to both push with one foot on the ground, one foot on the apparatus  and simultaneously pull his body by his two hands onto the platform  of the tree stand . The apparatus  allows the user to mount the tree stand  on a tree while supporting at least a portion of the user's weight with the support member while climbing into the tree stand .","The apparatus  can be made or formed using any of the following additional materials such as an composite alloy, fiberglass, nylon, other water proof material, rubberized grips, flexible material, ribbon of flexible sheet material, elastic cord, chain link, metal links, rope, or the like can be used as well as other appropriate material for the apparatus  such as webbing, fabric, including UV-resistant polyester, may be used. The apparatus  can be also made in all black and also in all camoflauge or any combination of these and\/or other colors. The retaining bracket for this apparatus  can also include but is not limited to any of the following: bracket, fastener, or similar buckle shapes.","While the preferred embodiment of the invention have been described above, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various modifications and alternatives to the disclosed embodiments may be developed in light of the overall teachings of the disclosure. Accordingly, the disclosed embodiments are meant to be illustrative only and not limiting to the scope and spirit of the invention which is to be given the full breadth of the following claim and all equivalents thereof.","It is to be understood that the present invention is by no means limited to the particular constructions herein disclosed and\/or shown in the drawings, but also comprises any modifications or equivalents within the scope of the claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
