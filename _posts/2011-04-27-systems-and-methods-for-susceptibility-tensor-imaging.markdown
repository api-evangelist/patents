title: Systems and methods for susceptibility tensor imaging
abstract: The present disclosure provides a method and system for quantifying and making images of tissue anisotropy property based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The systems and methods provided herein utilize orientation distribution of magnetic susceptibility to characterize magnetic susceptibility anisotropy (MSA) inside biological tissues. This MSA may be intrinsic property of the tissue or may be induced by the presence of external agents. In certain embodiments, the MSA is displayed as an orientation distribution function of susceptibility and/or may be described by mathematical quantities such as tensors (e.g., symmetric or asymmetric second order or higher order tensors) and spherical harmonics. In other embodiments, the MSA is characterized using a second order tensor named apparent susceptibility tensor (AST).

Accordingly, the Federal Government has rights to this invention.","The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for quantifying and generating images of tissue anisotropy property based in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).","Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-destructive method for the analysis of materials and represents a new approach to medical imaging. It is generally non-invasive and does not involve ionizing radiation. In very general terms, nuclear magnetic moments are excited at specific spin precession frequencies which are proportional to the local magnetic field. The radio-frequency signals resulting from the precession of these spins are received using pickup coils. By manipulating the magnetic fields, an array of signals is provided representing different regions of the volume. These are combined to produce a volumetric image of the nuclear spin density of the body.","MRI signals for reconstructing an image of an object are obtained by placing the object in a magnetic field, applying magnetic gradients for slice selection, applying a magnetic excitation pulse to tilt nuclei spins in the desired slice or volume, and then detecting MRI signals emitted from the tilted nuclei spins while applying readout gradients. The detected signals may be envisioned as traversing lines in a Fourier transformed space (k-space) with the lines aligned and spaced parallel in Cartesian trajectories or emanating from the origin of k-space in spiral trajectories.","An MRI may be used for scanning a patient's brain. The MRI may be useful for measuring development of the brain, particularly for scanning white-matter within the brain. White matter is a component of the central nervous system and consists of myelinated axons. Myelin acts as an insulator around nerve cells and increases the speed of transmission of nerve signals. The multilayered myelin sheath wrapping around nerve axons is essential for proper functioning of the central nervous system. Abnormal myelination leads to a wide range of neurological diseases and developmental disorders. MRI is the preferred reference test for diagnosing and monitoring the evolution of white-matter development and related diseases due to its excellent soft tissue contrast, high spatial resolution, and non-radioactive nature. However, conventional MRI methods may not provide satisfactory accuracy for quantifying the myelinated axons, and determining, for example, the amount of myelinated axons present in a subject's brain.","According to one embodiment, a method for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is provided. The method includes using an MRI system to acquire imaging data of an object. The imaging data includes a plurality of voxels. The method includes determining orientations of the voxels. The method includes generating an image based on the orientations of the voxels for depicting a characteristic of the object.","According to one embodiment, using an MRI system includes using the MRI system to apply a magnetic field to the object.","According to one embodiment, using an MRI system includes using the MRI system to acquire imaging data of the object at a plurality of orientations of the object relative to a magnetic field generated by the MRI system.","According to one embodiment, determining orientations of the voxels includes determining magnetic susceptibility tensors of the voxels.","According to one embodiment, determining one of vector components, eigenvalue decomposition, and invariant functions of susceptibility tensors of the voxels, and generating an image includes generating the image based on the one of vector components, eigenvalue decomposition, and invariant functions of the susceptibility tensors.","According to one embodiment, a method includes determining whether each of the voxels has an eigenvalue greater than a predetermined magnitude.

If it is assumed that the anisotropic susceptibility, that is the directional susceptibility of an object, is described by a second-order (or rank 2) tensor \u03c7 that is referred to as the apparent susceptibility tensor (AST), then the magnetic flux density vector B relative to each nucleus is related to the macroscopic flux density Bas:\n\n=(\u03b4\u2212\u03c3\u03b4\u2212\u2154\u03c7)\u2003\u2003[1]\n","with the further assumption that the nucleus is situated within a small sphere of Lorentz. Bis the i-th component of vector B; Bis the j-th component of vector B; \u03b4is the Kronecker delta function; and \u03c3 is the chemical shift caused by an electronic screen effect. The vacuum permeability \u03bcis assumed to be one for simplicity. The macroscopic flux density Bis further related to the applied magnetic field vector H and the demagnetizing field h as:\n\n=(+\u03b4\u03c7)(\u2212)\u2003\u2003[2]\n","The demagnetizing field is a result of the loading of objects into the scanner and is generated in order to satisfy Maxwell's equations. For modern superconductor MRI scanners, h<<H. For biological samples that are MRI compatible, it can also be assumed that the magnitude of susceptibility is small such that \u03c7<<1. Substituting Eq. [2] into Eq. [1] and keeping only up to the first-order terms, obtains:\n\n=(\u03b4\u2212\u03c3\u03b4+\u2153\u03c7)()\u2003\u2003[3]\n","To determine the demagnetizing field, the divergence of the flux density is zero from Maxwell's equation:\n\n\u2207=0\u2003\u2003[4]\n","In the absence of loading, Eq. [4] is also satisfied, which results in:\n\n\u2207=0\u2003\u2003[5]\n","Combining Eqs. [3], [4] and [5] while keeping terms only up to the first order, obtains:\n\n\u2207\u03c7+\u2207=0\u2003\u2003[6]\n","To facilitate calculation, a scalar magnetic potential \u03a6 is defined such that:\n\n\u2003\u2003[7]\n","Substituting Eq.

In one example method, AST may be measured by rotating the subject inside the magnet and by acquiring an image at each orientation.

Additional symmetry may be imposed, for example, by assuming \u03bb=\u03bb. Independent measurements may be obtained by rotating the imaging object with respect to the main magnetic field. Given a set of measurements, an AST may be estimated by inverting the system of linear equations formed by Eq. [13.a] in the subject frame of reference or Eq.

The difference between Eq. [26] and Eq. [17] is that Eq. [26] is expressed in the image domain while Eq. [17] is expressed in the frequency domain. Once the three notations are defined, the AST in the image domain may be found for each voxel as:\n\n=()\u2003\u2003[28]\n","Setting Baseline Reference","An uncertainty in phase images may be induced by, for example, receiver phase and the choice of reference frequency. In addition, subtle phase contrast may be disguised or overwhelmed by the presence of large local susceptibility such as bone and air. For images acquired with multiple-channel receiver coil, a complex-valued image may be reconstructed for each channel of the coil. A low-resolution phase map may be extracted from each coil by low-pass filtering the phase map with a Fermi filter or by fitting with a smooth polynomial or spline-type function or by Laplace filtering. This low-resolution phase is then subtracted from each coil. After removing global phases, images from all coils are combined in complex numbers to form the final image. To ensure that all images have a common reference, a uniform reference marker may be inserted in the coil, imaged at each session and served as a reference. Alternatively, an internal reference location can also be chosen as a reference such as the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Given a reference point, phase at other locations may be either positive or negative.  show the intensity-reversed phase sensitive images (RPSI) created by weighing the magnitude image by the negative and positive phase respectively. Here, negative phase tends to highlight vessels due to flow and the presence of iron whereas positive phase highlights the minute structure within white matter.","Setting the reference consistently addresses several important issues in quantifying AST such as a baseline shift that affects the mean susceptibility and a potential change of anisotropy caused by the baseline inconsistency in AMS or in the phase maps. The first effect is less significant as a constant shift in all AMS results in an addition of an identity matrix to the original AST and therefore does not affect the anisotropy:\n\n(+)\u03c7\u03b4\u2003\u2003[29]\n","The internal reference chosen may contain anisotropic susceptibility, although it is expected to be small inside CSF. If the reference region of interest (ROI) indeed has intrinsic magnetic susceptibility anisotropy (\u201cMSA\u201d), then the AST of the reference ROI will be subtracted from all voxels and therefore not affect the overall MSA contrast of the whole image volume.","Solving Eq. [14] is complicated when the image phase is wrapped around 2\u03c0. Phase wrapping appears commonly in high field imaging especially when large off-resonance is present and when TE is relatively large. The uncertainty in wrapped phase, if uncorrected, results in large errors in the estimated AST. A common approach in calculating susceptibility from phase images is to perform a phase unwrapping procedure prior to the matrix inversion. There are a number of algorithms existing in the literature for phase unwrapping. However, performing phase unwrapping for the calculation of AST is, unfortunately, not a feasible solution because of the uncertainty in the baseline phase. When performing phase unwrapping, a region has to be chosen as the reference. When different references are chosen, the unwrapped phase may be offset by multiples of 2\u03c0. It is improbable to assure that the unwrapped phases are consistent among different orientations even if the same reference region is used, because phase changes when the object orients differently with respect to the main magnetic field.","An example solution to this problem, according to at least one embodiment of the invention, may involve several steps described hereinafter. In an example step, the Laplacian of the phase is computed using only cosine and sine functions of the phase which is, thus, indifferent to the phase wrapping issue. In another example step, once the Laplacian is computed, the Fourier transform of the phase is computed through the Fourier transform of the Laplacian. In another example step, a phase map is multiplied by a mask, such as 1 inside the brain and zero outside, and the Laplacian operator is applied for a second time. This process may be iterated. Specifically, the Laplacian of the phase image is computed using the following trigonometric relationship:\n\n\u2207\u03b8=cos \u03b8\u2003\u2003[30]\n","Furthermore, the Laplacian of the trigonometric functions may be computed via Fourier transform as:\n\n\u2207\u03b8=(2\u03c0){sin \u03b8}}\u2003\u2003[31]\n\n\u2207\u03b8=(2\u03c0){cos \u03b8}}\u2003\u2003[32]\n","Once the Laplacian is computed, the Fourier transform of the phase image (the left side of Eq.

In addition, the Laplacians are computed on a matrix that is twice the size of the original image. In expanding the size of the matrix, the original phase image is mirrored to different quadrants, creating an even function, which, therefore, guarantees the computed Laplacian to be real. A further advantage of this method is that the background phase is automatically removed once the Laplacian is operated on masked phase maps. The mask may be generated based on the magnitude image which defines the interior of the brain (or region of interest) and exterior.","Quantifying MSA","The computed AST is coordinate system dependent.

A catheter is inserted into the left ventricle of the mouse heart. The animal is perfused with a peristaltic pump first with a mixture of 0.9% saline and ProHance (10:1, v:v) (Bracco Diagnostics, Princeton, N.J.), then with a mixture of 10% buffered formalin and ProHance (10:1, v:v). The perfused mouse brain is kept within the skull to prevent any potential damage to the brain caused by surgical removal. This fixation procedure simultaneously preserves the tissue and preferentially enhances the signal by reducing the spin lattice relaxation time. In addition, in comparison to conventional fixation techniques, the active staining technique appears to largely preserve the diffusion property of the brain tissues. For example, a mean diffusivity of 0.5\u00d710mm\/s has been measured for gray matter and 0.4\u00d710mm\/s for white matter.","Ultra-high resolution 3D SPGR images were acquired using a 7T horizontal bore magnet with shielded coil providing gradients of 160 G\/cm. The imaging parameters were: matrix=256\u00d7256\u00d7256, FOV=22\u00d722\u00d722 mm, TE=8 ms, and TR=100 ms. All images were acquired using a 7T magnet with shielded coil providing gradients of 770 mT\/m over 90 mm FOV. The system is controlled by a GE EXCITE MR imaging console. The specimen was sealed tightly inside a cylindrical tube (length 30 mm and diameter 11 mm). To allow free rotation, the tube was contained within and taped to a hollow sphere (diameter 30 mm). The sphere containing the specimen was placed inside a dual-channel mouse coil (diameter 31 mm, M2M imaging Corp, Cleveland Ohio). After each acquisition, the sphere was rotated to a different orientation and the acquisition was repeated. A total of 19 orientations were sampled that roughly cover the spherical surface evenly. To avoid-introduced frequency shifts, the same shimming currents were applied for all directions. The carrier frequency was also kept the same. Temperature was monitored through the scans and fluctuation was recorded to be below 1\u00b0 C.","Orientation-Dependent AMS and AST","AMS was computed for each orientation. The computed AMS maps are then coregistered to a reference orientation. Examples of the orientation dependent AMS are shown in  through F.","The AST was computed for the ex vivo mouse brain data. The three diagonal elements of the AST from a representative slice are shown in  through F. The anisotropy existing in the AST is clearly evident. The anisotropy is the strongest in white matter while relatively weaker in the gray matter. The observed anisotropy is not a consequence of the tensor model. Isotropic medium may be described by a diagonal tensor with equal diagonal entries.","The AST may be further decomposed into three eigen-vectors and three associated eigen-values. Examples of eigen-value maps are shown in  through D. FSA and color-coded FSA is shown in , B, C, and D. The major eigen-vector is projected onto the plane in an example region of interest in .","Application","MSA allows for image contrast generation for non-invasive ex vivo and in vivo MRI. As one example, MSA may be acquired, analyzed, and visualized with STI. This contrast may be a result of intrinsic tissue property or may be induced by external agents. This technique may be applied in any in vivo or ex vivo MRI imaging\/microscopy where the imaged subject exhibits MSA.","Tissue Contrast","Biologic tissues such as brain white and gray matter contain various amounts of iron and macromolecules. These iron and macromolecules carry an intrinsic magnetic susceptibility tensor that is determined by the iron property, the structural configuration of the macromolecules, and the dipolar coupling between different nuclei. Furthermore, once these irons and macromolecules are bonded with local tissue, the binding will enforce additional constraints on the orientation of the macromolecules thus affecting the apparent susceptibility tensor observed within one voxel. Consequently, because of tissue heterogeneity, there will be a difference between their AMS, AST, and MSA. Images may then be created by using these quantities to visualize and enhance tissue contrast. These images include a display of AMS, elements of AST, eigen-values and eigen-vectors of AST, and a combination thereof such as a magnitude image weighted by AMS. Tissue structural changes caused by tumor, stroke, traumatic injury, and iron-content changes caused by developmental iron deficiency and aging will then manifest in the changes of those quantities.","Brain Connectivity and Tractography","Currently, diffusion tensor MRI is a non-invasive method for visualizing whole brain white matter fiber tracts in vivo. DTI fiber tractography may be used for in vivo mapping of brain neural networks and may be used in the fields of diagnostic radiology, neuroscience, psychology and psychiatry. The basic assumption of DTI fiber tractography is that the most preferable diffusion orientation of water molecules inside white matter is along the fibers. Therefore, by following the major eigenvector direction, one is able to trace white matter fibers in three dimensions inside the whole brain. DTI tractography has so far faced three main challenges. Currently, it is thought that there is no other in vivo tracking method that may be used to validate DTI tractography. DTI tractography is ineffective of resolving multiple fiber orientations within one voxel. Third, DTI is extremely susceptible to motion and off-resonance artifacts. The image quality and spatial resolution of DTI as a result has so far been severely limited.","In addition, DTI has encountered significant difficulties at ultra-high field strength (7T and above). Although ultra high field offers stronger raw signal strength, this strength has been so far difficult if not impossible for DWI\/DTI to take advantage of. Many challenges still need to be overcome before improved DWI\/DTI image quality may be obtained at 7T. The difficulties include: more rapid T2 and T2* decay that negates the gain of raw signal strength; high specific absorption rate (SAR) that limits slice coverage of the brain and causes safety concern; severe inhomogeneous B1-field that induces additional signal-to-noise (SNR) loss; and severe off-resonance artifacts that create severe geometrical distortion for echo-planner-imaging (EPI) and blurring for spiral imaging. The current DWI\/DTI quality at 7T is still significantly below that of 3T. The development in this area has been limited to implementing DWI\/DTI at ultra-high field. Single shot EPI, the most-widely used technique for DWI acquisition, has been impractical at 7T and higher, even at the typical 2\u00d72 mmresolution. Until more sophisticated technology is developed to address the aforementioned challenges, routine application of DWI\/DTI at 7T will remain impractical.","More importantly, DTI primarily sensitizes to geometrical changes and offers few insights on tissue specificity. STI may offer a number of important benefits that will significantly enhance pediatric neuroimaging, such as: new insights on white matter architecture complimenting and potentially cross-validating DTI results, superior resolution (0.4\u00d70.4\u00d71.0 mm), safer and significantly smaller specific absorption rate (SAR), inherent advantage at high and ultra-high fields where susceptibility effect is amplified, compatibility with ultra-short T2 species and specific information on tissue composition of iron and proteins that are important for brain development.","The orientation information offered by STI may be used to reconstruct white matter fiber pathways, thus providing a much-needed second in vivo method for mapping brain white matter fiber pathways.","Susceptibility Tensor Spectroscopic Imaging (STSI)","Within an image volume, each voxel contains an ensemble of microscopic susceptibility tensors. The measured AST is an ensemble average of all microscopic susceptibility tensors. Each microscopic tensor is an intrinsic property of the molecules within the voxel. In a solution form, the orientation information of the microscopic tensor is averaged out if molecules are orienting randomly or are tumbling quickly. However, in an ordered structure such as brain tissue and especially the white matter, the rotational mobility of those molecules is restricted. Consequently, there will be some residual orientation information within each voxel. The signal observed in a typical proton MRI experiment is primarily from water molecules due to their relatively long T2 and T2* values compared to those of macromolecules. Both free water protons and protons exchanged from macromolecules are included. Diffusion of water molecules within brain tissue, especially within white matter, is anisotropic. Therefore, this anisotropic diffusion process cannot average out the surrounding anisotropic susceptibility tensor. As a result, the residual orientation information will manifest as a frequency spectrum that may be obtained in a spectroscopic imaging experiment. The frequency range of this residual dipole field is typically within 0.1 ppm, much smaller than that of NAA (2 ppm) for example. The spectrum distribution may be expressed as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0124","num":"0123"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00016","num":"00016"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03c9","mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"\u03b3","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":"B","mn":"0"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mo":"\u222b","mi":"\u03b8"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mo":"\u222b","mi":"\u03c6"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"p","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["\u03b8","\u03c6"],"mo":","}}},{"msubsup":{"mi":["R","\u03c7","T"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["\u03b8","\u03c6"],"mo":","}}},{"mi":"R","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["\u03b8","\u03c6"],"mo":","}}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"\u03b8"},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"\u03c6"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.2em","height":"0.2ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.2em","height":"0.2ex"}}}]}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mn":"36"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"Alternatively, susceptibility tensor spectroscopic imaging (STSI) can also be conducted on other nuclei that exhibit NMR signals. For example, direct STSI of 13C, 15N, 31P and 19F would provide a more direct examination of the molecular susceptibility tensor. Such examination would not depend on the diffusion interaction between water protons and the microscopic susceptibility tensor. The signal gain of hyperpolarized nuclei such hyperpolarized 13C will aid the detection the MSA greatly.","Molecular Imaging","Molecular imaging is another important area of application for the methodology developed here and the interaction mechanism described by this invention between water proton diffusion and microscopic susceptibility. The method may be used to guide the design of molecular contrast agent and may be used to detect small concentrations of these agents once injected into the tissue. Specific exogenous contrast agents may be designed to enhance its MSA by manipulating its structure and by adding frequency-shifting atoms. These contrast molecules may be designed to allow certain preferable binding configurations and orientations with tissue macromolecules thus to further enhance local MSA. This invention provides the methodology to further detect and enhance the tissue-specific and pathology-specific anisotropic shift effect. Imaging of this class of molecular contrast agent will not just simply rely on T1 or T2* effects. Rather, it will rely on the anisotropic magnetic field generated by these agents.","In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, an MRI system as disclosed herein may be implemented on any computing device suitable for implementing a transaction.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product.
