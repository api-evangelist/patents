Field of the Invention","This invention relates to color switchable sensors, and more particularly, to a color switchable sensor containing both fracto-mechanoluminescent and elasto-mechanoluminescent materials for both visually and remotely detecting the transition point between stress and fracture in a structure, e.g., aircraft and\/or ship components possibly due to hydrodynamic drag, by an optic waveguide.","2. Description of the Prior Art","Glassy, plastic, polymer and composite among many different structural materials during both manufacture and use require integrity and robustness monitoring in situ and in real time in order to ascertain damage leading to failure of the structure. Usually, the failure is the result of a progression from initial stress to the structure to an eventual fracture. Monitoring the stress on a structure would allow for repair of the structure prior to fracture. Sage et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,905,260 recites to a damage sensor using triboluminescent materials connected to light guiding fibres or layers embedded within the structure or mounted on the structure's surface to detect the physical damage to the structure. The triboluminescent materials disclosed in Sage et al. are all fracto-mechanoluminescent materials emitting different wavelengths of light when fractured. The wavelength of emission can be used, through an algorithm, to directly locate the position of the fracture.","There is a need to know prior to the occurrence of a fracture where and when a fracture could occur to a structure in order that a fracture can be prevented with repair.","Referring now to the drawings, the method of fabrication and the structures containing both fracto-mechanoluminescent and elasto-mechanoluminescent materials dispersed therethrough and\/or thereon involves the following: the present invention provides a color switchable sensor. One embodiment consists of a structure having dispersed therethrough both elasto-mechanoluminescent material, fracto-mechanoluminescent materials and fiber optic cables for detecting at least two different visible light emissions. Another embodiment consists of a structure having either dispersed therethrough or thereon both elasto-mechanoluminescent, fracto-mechanoluminescent materials and fiber optic cables for detecting at least two different visible light emissions. Another embodiment consists of a structure having a coating containing both elasto-mechanoluminescent and fracto-mechanoluminescent materials and fiber optic cable for detecting at least two different visible light emissions. Another embodiment consists of a structure and a coating thereon and both elasto-mechanoluminescent and fracto-mechanoluminescent materials dispersed therethrough and fiber optic cables for detecting at least two different visible light emissions.","Triboluminescent materials are crystalline materials that emit visible wavelengths of light resulting from stress, fracture or plastic deformation of the material that can be detected by optic fiber cable with and\/or without the length of the cable including a cladding. U.S. Pat. No. 6,710,328 to Mastro et al., Fiber Optic Composite Damage Sensor, is incorporated herein by reference. Triboluminescent materials include both elasto-mechanoluminescent and fracto-mechanoluminescent materials. Elasto-mechanoluminescent materials will emit light when the material is stressed, e.g., hydrodynamic stress (pressure or shear). Fracto-mechanoluminescent materials emit light when the material is fractured and not emit light when the material is stressed.","Fracto-mechanoluminescent materials are not elasto-mechanoluminescent materials and elasto-mechanoluminescent materials are not fracto-mechanoluminescent materials. Once fracture of a fracto-mechanoluminescent material occurs, all wavelengths of light being emitted due to stress on the elasto-mechanoluminescent material tends to cease and the light emission from the fracture of the fracto-mechanoluminescent material dominates.","Fracto-mechanoluminescent materials emit visible light under mechanical fracture of the material and not stress. Some of the high intensity fracto-mechanoluminescent materials are EuDTEA, europium tetrakis triethylammonium, and BaAlSiO, hexacelsiam doped with rare earth ions, e.g., Samarium, Ytterbium, and Cerium. EuDTEA emits an orange-red color peaking at 610 nm upon fracture of the fracto-mechanoluminescent material. Terbium complex will emit green with a strong peak at 545 nm, Mn complex emit around 515 nm and ester at about 450 nm. The hexacelsiam doped with Samarium emits red, doped with Ytterbium emits green and doped with Cerium emits blue light.","Elasto-mechanoluminescent materials emit visible light under elastic deformations in absence of plastic deformation or fracture, i.e., due to stress, shear or load. Some of the high intensity elasto-mechanoluminescent materials are ZnS:Mn, ZnGaO:Mn, SrAlO:rare earth element, MgGaO, BaAlSiO:rare earth, SrAlO:rare earth, CaAlSiO: rare earth element, CaAlSiO, Gehlenite, which is doped with Ce (one of the brightest elasto-mechanoluminescent materials), ZnMnTe and ZrO:Ti. The rare earth element can be Eu. The rare earth elements appear to be quite suitable as their emission possibly is due to the f-f transition, which is not effected by the host lattice. It has been found that SrAlO:Eu has a peak emission at 520 nm (green), ZnMnTe has emissions at 386 and 648 nm and ZrO:Ti has a peak emission at 480 nm. The elasto-mechanoluminescent materials have to be charged with UV irradiation before stress measurements. Successive stress cycles decrease the intensity of the materials but UV irradiation restores the intensity. It has been found that the intensity of the elasto-mechanoluminescent material is proportional to the stress applied. This relationship is exponential and not linear. Stress can be quantified by measuring the intensity of the emission. The emissions take place when the stress occurs and when the stress is removed.","The fiber optic cable, light dispersive element and photodetectors together are referred to as a fiber optic cable system. Fiber optic cable itself includes both a core and a cladding. There are two modes in which of fiber optic cable can detect the optical signal, i.e., point and distributive. In the point mode, cable receives the light at its tip and transmits the light along the length of the cable. In the distributive mode, cable has had cladding removed in discrete sections, channels, along the length of the cable. This allows the light to be detected at these discrete points along the entire length of the cable and to be transmitted to the photodetectors located at each end. Adjacent each detector is a light dispersive element. The light dispersive material, e.g., a prism or a grating separates light of different colors. It separates the elasto-mechanoluminescent and the fracto-mechanoluminescent emissions into the different wavelengths. Appropriate filters can also be used for this purpose. The sections of cable with the cladding are impermeable to the light and the sections of the cable where the cladding has been removed are permeable to the light. In either case, light is transmitted along the core. For position sensing, photodetectors are placed at both ends of the optic fiber. Thus, when an event takes place, light pulses enter the optic fiber and travel to photodetectors placed a both ends of the fiber. These pulses will generate electrical signals in the photodetector, which can be then recorded\/displayed on a device such as an oscilloscope (not shown). By monitoring the time difference between the electrical pulses from the two photodetectors, an algorithm can determine the position of the event.","Both elasto-mechanoluminescent and fracto-mechanoluminescent materials are dispersed on\/throughout the structure and\/or in a coating on a structure or dispersed in isolated locations of the structure and\/or coating.  show a structure  containing elasto-mechanoluminescent materials  and fracto-luminescent materials . Fiber optic cables  are dispersed throughout the structure and\/or coating  in proximity with the both the elasto-mechanoluminescent and fracto-mechanoluminescent materials in order to detect and transmit at least some of the emitted light to photodetectors, which are remotely located.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","120","122","124","126","128","114","122","124","126","128","122","124","114","122","122","124","122","124","122","124","122"],"br":[{},{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{},{},{}],"i":["X=L\/","T\u00d7V\/","X=L\/","T\u00d7V\/"]},"A structure can be any structure that can be physically damaged, e.g., parts of ship and airplane structures, such as a propeller from hydrodynamic conditions, e.g., cavitation. A structure and\/or coating on the structure can be composed of glassy, plastic, composite, rubber, metal or the like materials. The elasto-mechanoluminescent and fracto-mechanoluminescent materials can be dispersed deep within the structure, at or near its surface, in specific locations, or in a coating on the surface of the structure. The fiber optic cable that receives at least some of the emitting light and transmits light to photodetectors needs to be positioned sufficiently near the elasto-mechanoluminescent and fracto-mechanoluminescent materials for the cable to receive and transmit at least some of the emitted light so that stress and\/or fracture of the material is clearly detected and monitored. A structure or coating containing both elasto-mechanoluminescent material that emits visible light and fracto-mechanoluminescent material selected to emit a different color, i.e., wavelength of light than the elasto-mechanoluminescent material, are dispersed therethrough and\/or thereon and\/or in a coating can be designed so that upon the application of stress visible color from only the elasto-mechanoluminescent material will emanate from the stressed elasto-mechanoluminescent material and be detected along the length of an optical fiber that is in proximity with the elasto-mechanoluminescent material. As the stress increases so does the intensity of the color. At a point in time there is a transition point where a fracture occurs in the fracto-mechanoluminescent material and a different visible light is emitted now from the fracto-mechanoluminescent material and detected along the length of the fiber optic cable that is in proximity with the fracto-mechanoluminescent material.","This color switching from elasto-mechanoluminescent material to fracto-mechanoluminescent material will indicate stress that caused the fracture. The selection of the specific elasto-mechanoluminescent and the specific fracto-mechanoluminescent materials is based on each having a difference wavelength of light emitted provides for a color switchable damage sensor. The selection of the fracto-mechanoluminescent material is based on the material only emitting visible light when fractured and not emitting visible light when stressed. Each of the materials is dispersed along with fiber optic cables in a structure and\/or coating for detecting the color emission and transmitting the light to photodetectors in or on the structure of concern in any desired location of the structure.","A composite structure can be designed to contain, for example, microcrystals of ZrO:Ti and EuDTEA. Under stress the ZrO:Ti will emit a bluish green color at 480 nm. The intensity of the emission will increase with a concomitant increase in stress, shear or load on the structure. At the point of fracture, the EuDTEA will start emitting an orange-red color at 610 nm. The point at which this change in color takes place will denote the stress at which the fracture takes place, the transition point. By having both an elasto-mechanoluminescent, fracto-mechanoluminescent materials and fiber optic cables dispersed therethrough or thereon the structure and\/or the coating, the monitoring of stress-fracture transition in real time in situ at places which might not be available for visual inspection.","Europium tetrakis (dibenzoylmethide) triethylammonium (EuDTEA) (CHEuNO) was chosen for these studies due to high brightness and ease of preparation. EuDTEA was synthesized following the procedure of Hurt et al., C. R. Hurt, N. McAvoy, S. Bjorklund and N. Filipescu, 212, 179 (1966). The following procedure was followed:","1. Dissolved 2 m mols of EuClin 10 ml of ethyl alcohol (CHCHOH).","2. Dissolved 8 m mols of dibenzoylmethane [(CHCO)CH] and 8 m mols of triethylamine [(CH)N] in 60 ml of absolute ethyl alcohol.","Solution 1 was mixed with solution 2 at 60\u00b0 C. The mixture was allowed to cool slowly at room temperature overnight. It was filtered and washed repeatedly with ethanol until no chlorine ion was detected with silver nitrate (0.1 mol). The crystalline product was air-dried.","EuDTEA was embedded in clear epoxy by mixing one part by weight of EuDTEA and three parts by weight of clear epoxy and then molded in a disc of 25 mm diameter and 15 mm thick. On fracturing the disc, an orange-red emission at 610 nm was observed.","Titanium doped Zirconium Oxide (ZrO:Ti) was prepared following the method of Akiyama et al., M. Akiyama, C. Xu and K. Nonaka, ., Vol. 81, p. 457, 2002, from ZrO(purity 99.99%) and TiO(purity 99.99%) powders. These powders were weighed and mixed in ethanol for half an hour. The mixture was then pressed in the form of pallets, put into cylindrical crucibles and slowly inserted into the furnace containing Argon at a slightly reducing atmosphere. The temperature increments were 3-5\u00b0 C.\/min, with the optimum sintering temperature at 1500\u00b0 C. and the corresponding sintering time at 4 hours.","Gehlenite (CaAlSiO:Ce) was prepared by two different methods. The first method is based on a two steps process. The non-stoichiometric composition of pure Gehlenite was first prepared from powders of CaCO, \u03b1-AlO, and SiOof high purity. The samples were sintered for 3 hours in the atmosphere at 1300\u00b0 C. The bulk material of pure CaAlSiOwas grounded, weighed and doped with (0.01%-0.005% mol of Ce). The powders were mixed with 0.2% mol of HBOas flux in the ethanol for about half an hour. The mixed powders were loaded into the cylindrical crucibles, shaken during 3 minutes and slowly inserted into the furnace with reducing atmosphere (Ar+5% H). The temperature was increased at a rate of 3-5\u00b0 C.\/min until it reached 1450\u00b0 C. and maintained constant for 3 hours.","The second method was similar to the method of Akiyama et al., M. Akiyama, C. Xu and K. Nonaka, ., Vol. 81, p. 457, 2002. The powders of CaCO, SiO, \u03b1-AlO, CeOand HBOwere mixed in ethanol for half an hour and the same sintering conditions applied as for the last step of the first method. The intensity Gehlenite prepared by the first method was 35% greater than the Gehlenite prepared by second method.","Both ZrO:Ti and CaAlSiO:Ce were embedded in clear epoxy (one part elasto-mechanoluminescent material and three part epoxy) and molds of 25 mm diameter and 15 mm thickness were made. The UV excitation showed that ZrO:Ti and CaAlSiO:Ce emitted at 480 nm and 427 nm respectively. These emissions are the same as the elasto-mechanoluminescent material emissions expected of these materials. Both were than subjected to a load of 400 lbs. The intensity of elasto-mechanoluminescence for ZrO:Ti was six times higher than the background and intensity of the elasto-mechanoluminescence for CaAlSiP:Ce was twice the background. For ZrO:Ti, the minimum load which could be detected through elasto-mechanoluminescence was 40 lbs.","When both fracto-mechanoluminescent material EuDTEA and elasto-mechanoluminescent materials ZrO:Ti and CaAlSiO:Ce are embedded in a structure and stress is applied only elasto-mechanoluminescent materials will emit at 480 nm or 427 nm, respectively. However, when the stress becomes sufficient to cause fracture, the fracto-mechanoluminescent material emission at 610 nm is to be observed. This color change gives the indication that the magnitude of the stress is such that it eventually causes fracture and the switching of the color emission from either 480\/427 nm to 610 nm thereby indicating the transition point.","Therefore what has been described above is a structure that uses fracto-mechanoluminescent and elasto-mechanoluminescent materials dispersed therethrough and\/or thereon and\/or within a coating and a fiber optic cable for detecting a specific visible light emitted due to the stress to the elasto-mechanoluminescent material and a different specific visible light emitted due to the fracture of a fracto-mechanoluminescent material and the transition point when the visible light from the elasto-mechanoluminescent material tends to cease being emitted as the fracto-mechanoluminescent material is fractured and its emission of the different visible light.","Other embodiments of this invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from a consideration of this specification or practice or the invention disclosed herein. Various omissions, modifications and changes to the principles described may be made by one skilled in the art without departing from the true scope and spirit of the invention, which is indicated by the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and other objects, features and advantages of the invention, as well as the invention itself, will become better understood by reference to the following detailed descriptions when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
