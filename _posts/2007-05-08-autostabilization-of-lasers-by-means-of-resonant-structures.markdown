No. 60\/798,471 filed 8 May 2006, which application is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made with Government support through Subaward no. 31607 awarded by the MURI\/University of Colorado at Boulder under the U.S. Office of Naval Research prime grant no. N00014-02-1-0714. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates generally to lasers and stabilization of lasers in particular.","Coherent population trapping, first observed in sodium atoms, is a manifestation of laser interaction with a three level system, where a coherence between two hyperfine ground state levels is achieved through a two photon process. In a three-level lambda (\u039b) system, a particular laser excitation can provide a resonance condition in which destructive interference occurs between excitation pathways. The population is reduced in the upper state and trapped within the two ground states, creating a \u201cdark state.\u201d This reduction of fluorescence and absorption has been given the name \u201cdark line.\u201d","The transition between ground states of an alkali metal is electric dipole forbidden and has a long lifetime. The narrow resonance feature of this effect has stimulated the idea of an all-optical frequency standard. Introducing a buffer gas in a cell as well as using a cell with Paraffin-coated walls can reduce the linewidth. The dependence of the width and contrast of this narrow line on the laser power, the light polarization, the magnetic field, and the cell temperature of rubidium has been studied. In those experiments, a pair of phase locked lasers or a single laser source modulated by half of the ground-state hyperfine splitting has been used to create coherence between hyperfine split ground state levels. The coherence effect using a pulse train by adjusting its repetition rate to a submultiple of the hyperfine splitting of sodium has been observed. Pulse generation by current modulation of a laser diode has been used. Further advances in laser systems and laser spectroscopy are needed.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings that show, by way of illustration, various example embodiments.

In an embodiment, the optical length, through a change in index of refraction due to material , decreases as the repetition rate of the laser output of laser cavity  decreases. Random changes in the cavity length of mode-locked lasers cause the repetition rate to fluctuate. For instance, as the cavity length increases, the repetition rate decreases. Embodiments include inserting inside the laser a material of which the optical length (through the index of refraction) decreases as the repetition rate decreases. As a result of the material in the laser cavity, the two effects can compensate, eliminating the fluctuations in repetition rate. The material may be structured with a resonant atomic transition proportional to the repetition rate. The material may have a structure having at least a three levels to provide resonant coherent interaction.

The following examines dark line resonance in Rb.","Spectroscopy of a \u039b structure in Rb can be performed with a mode locked laser. A dark line, resulting from population trapping between the hyperfine levels, is observed when the repetition rate is a submultiple of the hyperfine splitting, such as 1\/57th of the hyperfine splitting. The pulse bandwidth (inverse of the pulse duration) is chosen to be much broader than the 6.847 GHz splitting of the ground state. Therefore, the series of modes within the Doppler profile contribute to transitions from the 5S, F=1, to the 5Pto the 5Slevels. Calculations and measurements of the excitation of rubidium excited by an infinite train of pulses, as the repetition rate (or the period of the pulse train) is being varied can be conducted. The calculations can be carried out in the time domain, integrating the system of differential equations for the density matrix of the three levels (two ground states 1 and 2, and an excited state 3) for a time sufficient to reach steady state (more than 400 pulses), for various values of the pulse period. The fluorescence of the excited rubidium will be proportional to the diagonal matrix element p, while the dispersion\/absorption are given by the real and imaginary parts of the off-diagonal elements \u03c3and \u03c3.

For optical frequencies \u03c9=\u03c9+\u03b4, where \u03b4 can be any value from 0 to 1 GHz, the height and width of the dark line (\u03c1as a function of repetition rate) remains unchanged. This property shows that Doppler broadening does not, to first order, affect the dark line feature.","The jitter added in  is a random change of frequency after each 40 pulse of 900 pulses. It is clear that the dark line width and amplitude is independent of the mode frequency jitter.  illustrates another confirmation of the robustness of the dark line, where the fluorescence of the dark line (or \u03c4) is plotted as a function of repetition rate for a randomly fluctuating carrier frequency. To simulate statistical motion of cavity elements, the carrier frequency \u03c9 is given an increment \u0394 after every 40 pulses \u03c9=\u03c9+\u0394, where |\u0394| takes the random value up to 2 MHz () and 10 MHz () in . The result shows the depth and width of the dark line to be independent of mode frequency shift or of the fluctuation in the value of the mode frequency. Therefore there is essentially no need for mode and offset frequency stabilization in the dark line measurement.","The power broadening for the resonance feature corresponds to the case that repetition rate matches substantially the exact hyperfine splitting may be observed in . The shape of the dark line is very sensitive to the laser power, as illustrated by the successive plots in . The curves are labelled by the value of the area, time integral of the Rabi frequency for an individual pulse. The repetition rate is chosen to be close to the hyperfine splitting, to study the dependence of the first of the dark line series in , on optical power. The laser pulse duration is set to 1 ps. For areas below 0.01, the dark line is only a small perturbation on a weak fluorescence. For the area between 0.01 and 0.1, the dark line has a narrow width. As the area increase above 0.5, the broadening of the dark line can be seen in the picture, leading to complete extinction of the dark line feature for an area equal to 2. The result of the power broadening calculation in  may be used as an aid to select the appropriate beam size and power for optimum observation of the dark line.","The following considers dark line measurement with ps pulse train. The use of the two photon transition (to the 5Dlevel in ) in counter propagating geometry, for two photon dark line spectroscopy at 778 nm, has been investigated. The interference between two pathways coupling the ground states (direct Raman coupling or coupling via the two-photon resonant transition) made the physical situation complex. Meanwhile, the dark line study with continuous source shows that the D1 transition of Rb is a better candidate than the D2 transition, since Clebsch-Gordan (C-G) coefficients are equal for both hyperfine levels of the upper state.","Since there is an optimal pulse area, it is desirable to use longer pulses than the 100 fs pulses that a Ti Sapphire typically generates. For a given power density, longer pulses corresponds to larger areas. Therefore, a longer pulse allows the use of a broader beam, hence a smaller transit time broadening. On the other hand, the pulse width should be short enough for both ground state transitions to keep them on resonance, and long enough to cover only one transition line to the single upper level. A system may be arranged to operate with 1 ps pulses, of which spectrum covers both the hyperfine splitting and the 500 MHz Doppler width.","The laser source used may be Ti:Sapphire pumped by a doubled Nd Vanadate laser (Coherent Verdi-5W). Mode locking and spectrum control may be achieved through appropriate design of multiple quantum wells in reflection. A 4.6 mm quartz birefringent filter may be used to enable fine tuning of the pulse frequency, and a restriction of the pulse bandwidth (central frequency 795 mm and bandwidth 2 nm).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1220","1225","1220","1225","1235"],"sup":"87"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},"The dark line resonance of rubidium has been studied both experimentally and theoretically for mode-locked laser excitation. It has been demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that the resonance width is insensitive to fluctuations in optical frequency. In various embodiments, high resolution spectroscopy may be conducted by which only the repetition rate (cavity length) is being scanned. The spectral features are independent of the exact mode frequency, which fluctuates as the repetition rate is being scanned. With this insensitivity to optical frequency, this resonance may be applied to a variety of applications to stabilize the repetition rate of a frequency comb.","Spectroscopy has traditionally used the laser as a delta-function frequency source, tunable across the spectrum, to probe mainly the absorptive properties of material placed outside of that source. Various embodiments may provide intracavity spectroscopy with mode-locked lasers. A laser may be used as a source of one or more frequency combs, to probe the dispersive properties of matter inside the laser cavity. By tuning the repetition rate of an ultrashort pulse laser, resonances that are even narrower than the single mode bandwidth may be observed. Such spectroscopy may have applications in biology, where stiff bilayer structures, such as lipid membranes, could be excited at a subharmonic of the laser repetition rate.","When evolving from traditional spectroscopy, where the source tends towards a \u03b4-function in frequency, to time resolved spectroscopy with femtosecond pulses, one has to walk a tight rope between achieving temporal or spectral resolution. With the stabilization of the mode-combs, it appeared feasible to combine high spectral resolution with temporal resolution. Simulation studies and experiments of coherent excitation of two-photon transitions in rubidium with stabilized trains of femtosecond to picosecond pulses may be conducted. One should recognize the extreme difficulty in controlling simultaneously the shape and position of the single pulse spectrum, the position of one single mode, and the mode spacing. Typically, orthogonality of the controls is nearly impossible. By using a linear combination of controls, orthogonality of the repetition rate and single mode, but not the spectral envelope, may be achieved. However, orthogonality of the repetition rate and single mode and the spectral envelope is used for two-photon spectroscopy of rubidium transitions. There are, however, some spectral properties that are, to first order, independent of the mode position, but only repetition rate dependent. The \u201cdark line\u201d resonance is one of them. Another example where the repetition rate scanning may provide sharp resonances is in the study of collective vibration modes, such as the compression resonance of lipid membranes in biology. In both of these examples, the laser repetition rate is a submultiple of the feature to be analyzed, resulting in a narrowing of the observed structures.","Dark line resonances had been observed traditionally with two phase locked narrow line continuous wave (cw) lasers. Simulations of coherent interaction show the coherent interaction with mode locked laser that results in a dark line in Rb fluorescence, when the hyperfine splitting is a submultiple of laser repetition rate and the laser frequency is on resonance with the D1 (795 nm) line.  show a recording of the fluorescence of rubidium (rubidium vapor at room temperature with no buffer gas) versus laser repetition rate. The laser is mode-locked with multiple quantum wells.  indicates that the FWHM of the dark line is 11 kHz in the absence of the magnetic field.  illustrates Zeeman splitting due to the magnetic field. Curve  is the fluorescence with no magnetic field. Curve  is the fluorescence with a 240 mG magnetic field. Curve  is the fluorescence with a 420 mG magnetic field.","A numerical integration code of the interaction equations for an infinite train of pulses may be constructed. The real part of the polarization is plotted as a function of repetition rate in , for three values of the repetition rate. Curve  is for the initial pulse (normalized). Curve  is for a 10.0991 ns pulse. Curve  is for a 10.0919 ns pulse. Curve  is for a 10.09557 ns pulse (resonance). As expected, the index of refraction is antisymmetric with respect to the resonance. For consideration of an intracavity application, only the real part of the polarization is relevant, since the absorption corresponding to the imaginary part will be compensated by the gain medium. It may be noted that for the values of the repetition rate below resonance, the contribution of the resonant polarization is negative, corresponding to an acceleration of the light, while there is a decrease in light velocity at higher repetition rates. This result is consistent with the observation of slow light.","The standard approach to stabilizing the repetition rate of a laser, is to compare it to an electronic standard or an optical standard, to amplify electronically the error signal, and apply it to a piezo-element driving a cavity mirror. Electronic stabilization of a mode-locked laser has been studied. In addition, electronic feedback into a laser has been used to stabilize the laser to the atomic transition of rubidium (hyperfine splitting in Rb) in an application as a time standard.","In an embodiment, an approach to stabilization includes inserting in the laser cavity an element with a strong dependence of group velocity on repetition rate. When the pulse repetition rate increases, the group velocity in that medium decreases, resulting in a decrease of the pulse repetition rate. Resonantly enhanced refractive index in atomic vapors via atomic coherence may make it possible to stabilize the laser repetition rate in a purely optical fashion, without electronics. Electronic noise in feedback loops is eliminated in the purely passive optical system for a variety of embodiments. The conditions that may be satisfied in various embodiments include a proper gain in the feedback loop (i.e. a proper change in group velocity for a small change in repetition rate), an error signal independent of the optical frequency, a correction that does not distort the intracavity pulse, fast dynamics (minimum delay between the detection of an error and its correction), and a correction that does not affect the laser operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 2A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["1610","1620"]},"The use of three level (two split ground states connected to a common upper state) resonant coherent interaction inside a mode-locked laser cavity can provide the feedback. As the spectral envelope covers the two optical transitions, and the repetition rate is tuned to resonance with the ground-state hyperfine splitting, a narrow dip (or peak) in absorption and fluorescence (\u201cdark line\u201d) can be observed. Since the establishment of coherence between the split ground states is insensitive to the exact carrier frequency, which may be confirmed theoretically and experimentally using a fs Ti:sapphire laser, the provided error signal is an error signal independent of the optical frequency. The \u201cgiant index of refraction\u201d associated with the resonance provides the abovementioned feedback with gain required. The absence of any electronics provides the fastest possible feedback.","A simplified analytical approach may be used for the laser response to the dark line resonance to study the nonlinear Fabry-Perot. The circulation time, \u03c4, of the pulse through the ring is the sum of the propagation time, l\/v, through the Rb cell and the propagation time, \u03c4, through the rest of the cavity. Through the coherent resonant coupling, the group velocity, v, in rubidium is itself a function of the repetition rate. One has to solve a self-consistent equation, which, in the case of a Lorentzian model, leads to a third order algebraic equation for the repetition rate. The root of this equation as a function of \u03c4provides the response of the \u201cclose loop.\u201d Such a simplified model lets one identify the optimal parameters (pressure, magnetic fields, temperature, and buffer gas) for stabilization, as well as the conditions of bi-stability and oscillations. Numerical codes can be used to simulate the coherent response of the atomic system to the train of pulses, which may be used in a study of the laser self-stabilization.","A Ti:sapphire laser has been stabilized in carrier frequency and repetition rate. A technique in which the laser is locked to an ultra-low expansion quartz cavity provides a rapid stabilization, as compared to stabilization to an atomic vapor, but not long term accuracy. A hybrid stabilization may include use of a reference cavity for short term stability and an atomic vapor for accuracy. Using fluorescence of rubidium upon irradiation by a train of pulses in condition of two-photon resonance, the pulse duration is taken to be longer than 1 ps, in order to avoid a cascade excitation via the single s-p photon resonance. Three experimental parameters associated with such configurations include the individual modes of the laser, the repetition rate of the mode-locked laser, and the spectral envelope of the laser (spectral bandwidth and central frequency).","Most work on femtosecond comb has focused on ultrashort (10 to 50 fs) femtosecond pulses, for which the bandwidth is so broad that the spectral envelope is totally irrelevant. In these projects related to the establishment of links between frequency standards, there are only two parameters to control, which may provide a challenge. Controlling simultaneously the three parameters (the individual modes of the laser, the repetition rate of the mode-locked laser, and the spectral envelope of the laser) is a daunting task for pulses longer than 100 fs. It is noted, in attempting to control simultaneously the three parameters, that a Kerr-lens mode-locking is not a reliable mechanism for longer pulses, that multiple quantum wells are effective saturable absorbers for mode-locking, provided the composition of the quantum well is adjusted to the desired wavelength, and that the pulse duration can be controlled by a single birefringent filter, which allows also for a tunability of the mode-locked train in a limited range.","In various embodiments, synchronously pumped OPO configurations may be used for independent, orthogonal control of all parameters including repetition rate, carrier frequency, and pulse spectral envelope. Analysis of coherent interaction with rubidium indicate a resonant enhancement of the fluorescence, where the carrier frequency is resonant with the two-photon transition and the repetition rate is simultaneously resonant with the ground state splitting in situations where a direct Raman coupling between the split ground states is neglected. No resonance may be identified when such Raman transition is taken into account. However, the study of the single photon transition has demonstrated that the dark line resonance can provide an absolute error signal for the repetition rate, independently of the carrier frequency.","Application of the high rate of accuracy and stability that can be achieved in mode-locked lasers may be utilized in a mode of communication at a bit rate in excess of 10 THz. In addition, stabilization of mode-locked lasers may be used in a variety of sensor systems. Sensors may be realized having the absence of a dead band leads for methods to measure backscattering of near perfect optical surfaces (intensity backscattering coefficient as small as 10). In various embodiments, an intracavity pumped ring OPO with a beat note bandwidth of 1 Hz may be used.","A dark line resonance of a material may be observed when the laser repetition rate is a sub-multiple of hyperfine splitting. In various embodiments, application of this feature may be used inside the laser cavity to provide stabilization without any electronic feedback. The dispersion curve of the dark line acts as a purely optical feedback. The slope of this error signal can be adjusted by the number of atoms in the cell, which may be realized by adjusting the cell temperature. Although this auto-stabilization is realized with the D1 transition in Rb(87), it is not limited to this particular atomic vapor cell, and can be applied to materials with a level structure exhibiting a \u201clambda\u201d shaped resonance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 17","br":[{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["v","v","\/L","L+\u0394v","\/L"],"sub":["RT","g","cav","g","cell","cav ","g ","g ","g "],"sup":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 18"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":["1902","1904"]},"In an embodiment, a laser configuration may include use of a semiconductor laser as a pump. Such a configuration may make the laser operation easier and more efficient. Not only does such a configuration avoid an interminable chain of lasers, but it also provides a gain medium with high gain and short lifetime, similar to the dye laser, with no tendency to Q-switching. Intracavity loss may be reduced by using a non-collinear PPLN configuration, enabling the use of single wavelength coatings of 99.9% reflectivity and enhancing the bandwidth of the parametric conversion. By choosing the signal wavelength to be 1.55 \u03bcm, the signal cavity may be aligned with a fiber laser.","Each of the pulse trains emitted by an OPO cavity is characterized by a repetition rate and the optical frequency of a mode. In general, these two parameters are not independent: any correction on one parameter (for instance, the wavelength) affects the other as well (the repetition rate). The situation is different in a synchronously pumped OPO. The repetition rate of the signal is uniquely determined by the repetition rate of the pump. The wavelength (mode frequency) of the \u201csignal\u201d is uniquely determined by the optical length of the signal cavity. The wavelength and exact mode frequency of the OPO signal is independent from that of the signal within the phase matching bandwidth: to any fluctuation in pump carrier frequency will correspond an opposite frequency fluctuation in the idler, which leaves the signal unaffected.","In an embodiment, a configuration is designed to stabilize the repetition rate of the pump cavity to a hyperfine transition of rubidium and to use another atomic standard to stabilize the wavelength (phase velocity control) in the OPO signal cavity. This approach ensures orthogonality, independent controls of the repetition rate and mode frequency.","In order to maintain a compact, robust and light instrument, self-stabilization by an atomic vapors for the pump and signal cavities, following embodiments as described above, may be employed. The pump wavelength can be at the 795 nm rubidium resonance and the signal wavelengths near 1.5 \u03bcm, for which calcium is a prime candidate as the other atomic standard, with a transition at 1.5 \u03bcm of which the ground state can be populated by a semiconductor laser around 650 nm. Various embodiments provide a method to stabilize in time (mode spacing) and wavelength (absolute mode position) a diode laser. Such arrangements may provide considerably more compact and simple instrument than the design involving a combination of a reference cavity for fast feedback and an atomic vapor for accuracy. Consider  that shows an apparatus  having a laser cavity  including a material  to stabilize output from laser cavity  with laser cavity  coupled to an external cavity  that includes another material  that provides another atomic standard. In embodiment, material  may include rubidium and material  may include calcium. Other materials may be used dependent upon the application for the laser system.","For the intracavity pumped OPO ring laser, the conventional alkali atomic vapors are typically ruled out, since the wavelength of the s\u2192p transitions falls below 1 \u03bcm. The OPO pumped at 780 nm would operate in the range of 1 to 2 \u03bcm. Better transitions for this wavelength range may be found from metastable states of Ca, Yb, or Sr. Calcium is as prime candidate, with a transition at 1.5 \u03bcm of which the ground state can be populated by a semiconductor laser around 650 nm. In a configuration, one can use hollow cathode discharge lamps as sample cells. For an enhanced instrument, purely optical excitation may be used to avoid the perturbation of the measurements due to the magnetic fields produced by the discharge lamps.","Any cavity length fluctuation in the OPO cavity results in the shift of the modes and the spectrum of the laser pulse in that cavity. In an embodiment, a novel optical solution for stabilization is provided by the use of a prism pairs  in the cavity  in . In an embodiment, a wavelength near 1.5 micron may be used. Most glasses have negative dispersion around 1.5 microns. By translating the two prisms along each others, one can continuously adjust the thickness of intracavity glass, hence the amount of negative dispersion in that cavity. Consider the following view of the stabilization. If the OPO cavity length increases (noise fluctuation), the wavelength of the OPO signal will also increase. If the wavelength increases, the index of refraction of the glass decreases, resulting in a decrease of optical path. For a sufficient amount of glass\/dispersion in the cavity, the decrease in optical path will compensate the increase due to length fluctuation. The use of glass in the above provides a non-limiting example. Other materials may be used in applications at this example wavelength or at other wavelengths. Materials, for instance atomic vapors, with the same property of negative dispersion may be used.","In various embodiments, a purely optical solution (both in mode and repetition rate) with orthogonal error signals for laser cavity stabilization may be realized. Such solutions can provide for construction of a laser that is at the same time a stable, calibrated \u201cclock, that is a time standard, (stable, calibrated repetition rate) and a wavelength standard, without the use of complex electronic stabilization.","In the above detailed description, reference may be made to specific examples by way of drawings and illustrations.
