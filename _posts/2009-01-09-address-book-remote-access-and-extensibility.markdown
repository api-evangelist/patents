{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Modern communication systems have a large number of capabilities including integration of various communication modalities with different services. For example, instant messaging, voice\/video communications, and other forms of communication may be combined with presence and availability information of subscribers. To provide a broad spectrum of services, a variety of communication applications store, manage, and disseminate different types of information. Conventional email applications, for example, stored and managed basic user information such as name, address, email address, phone number, and title. Modern systems integrate calendar information, presence information, alternate contacts, and other types of data for providing enhanced services. Moreover, communication applications such as email applications tend to have differing protocols, data schema, and other differences.","On the user side, a majority of users typically utilize multiple services such as email accounts. For example, a typical user may have a work email (and any other associated services), a personal email, an instant messaging service, and comparable services. Since some or all of those services may use different protocols, data schema, and data storage, combining the information from the different services is a challenging task.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to exclusively identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Embodiments are directed to retrieving user associated data such as contact information, group information, resource information, and similar data from a plurality of sources, customizing the data for consistent presentation, and providing to the user without the user having to retrieve the data separately from each source.","These and other features and advantages will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are explanatory and do not restrict aspects as claimed.","As briefly described above, address book information from a plurality of local and\/or remote sources may be provided to a user's client application in a consistent manner through a third party service. In the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustrations specific embodiments or examples. These aspects may be combined, other aspects may be utilized, and structural changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","While the embodiments will be described in the general context of program modules that execute in conjunction with an application program that runs on an operating system on a personal computer, those skilled in the art will recognize that aspects may also be implemented in combination with other program modules.","Generally, program modules include routines, programs, components, data structures, and other types of structures that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that embodiments may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and comparable computing devices. Embodiments may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.","Embodiments may be implemented as a computer-implemented process (method), a computing system, or as an article of manufacture, such as a computer program product or computer readable media. The computer program product may be a computer storage medium readable by a computer system and encoding a computer program that comprises instructions for causing a computer or computing system to perform example process(es). The computer-readable storage medium can for example be implemented via one or more of a volatile computer memory, a non-volatile memory, a hard drive, a flash drive, a floppy disk, or a compact disk. The computer program product may also be a propagated signal on a carrier (e.g. a frequency or phase modulated signal) or medium readable by a computing system and encoding a computer program of instructions for executing a computer process.","Throughout this specification, the term \u201cserver\u201d generally refers to a computing device executing one or more software programs typically in a networked environment. However, a server may also be implemented as a virtual server (software programs) executed on one or more computing devices viewed as a server on the network. More detail on these technologies and example operations is provided below. Also, the term \u201cdynamic\u201d as used in conjunction with address book information is intended to illustrate the distinction between conventional approaches, where statically stored and managed information is used with rigid rules, and embodiments, which enable creation and updating of address book information based on frequently changing parameters such as subscriber presence. Furthermore, the term address book is used to represent storage of data associated with providing communication services to a user. Contact information such as names and addresses of a user's contact, calendar information associated with the user (and\/or with the contacts), information associated with resources available to the user (printers, scanners, etc.), and comparable data are examples of information that may be stored and provided to a user as part of address book data in an enhanced communication system.","Referring to , diagram  illustrating an example networked system, where address book information at multiple sources is accessed, is illustrated. An enhanced communication system with a wide range of capabilities and services to be provided to subscribers may operate employing a number of servers, specialized computing devices (routers, firewalls, etc.). An example of enhanced communication services is a unified communication system, which is a real-time communications system facilitating instant messaging, presence, audio-video conferencing, and web conferencing functionality among other things.","In a unified communication system, users may communicate via a variety of end devices, which are client devices of the unified communication system. Each client device (e.g. ) may be capable of executing one or more communication applications for voice communication, video communication, instant messaging, application sharing, data sharing, white-boarding, and comparable ones. In addition to their advanced functionality, the end devices may also facilitate traditional phone calls through an external connection such as through a Public Switched Telephone Network (\u201cPSTN\u201d). End devices may include any type of smart phone, cellular phone, any computing device executing a communication application, a smart automobile console, and advanced phone devices with additional functionality.","An enhanced communication may include a number of servers for performing different tasks. For example, servers may provide registration, presence, and routing functionalities. Routing functionality enables the system to route calls to a user to anyone of the client devices assigned to the user based on default and\/or user set policies. For example, if the user is not available through a regular phone, the call may be forwarded to the user's cellular phone, and if that is not answering a number of voicemail options may be utilized. Since the end devices can handle additional communication modes, the servers may provide access to these additional communication modes (e.g. instant messaging, video communication, etc.) through an access server. An access server may reside in a perimeter network and enable connectivity through the unified communication network(s) with other users in one of the additional communication modes. Some of the servers (e.g. ) may perform combinations of the above described functionalities or specialized servers that only provide a particular functionality. Home servers providing presence functionality, routing servers providing routing functionality, firewall servers providing security functionality () are examples of such servers.","In an enhanced communication system like a unified communication system, users may have one or more identities, which is not necessarily limited to a phone number. The identity may take any form depending on the integrated networks, such as a telephone number, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), or any other identifier. Moreover, typical users, today, have multiple identities at different services for their communication needs. For example a user may have a work communication account for the listed communication services, one or more private email accounts with various providers, a social network account that enables instant messaging, email, or even video calls. Such a user may utilize the different communication services through one or more applications executed on client device . The applications may communicate with communication services through various networks such as an email service executed on server  through network(s) .","Network(s)  is an example infrastructure for an enhanced communication service. Network(s)  brings together directory server , administration server , email management server , and data stores  in addition to the above discussed servers. Users may interact with the communication service directly through client devices within network(s)  (e.g. ) or remotely through another network (e.g. ). Firewall server  may provide security services in case of remote connections. Directory server  may manage information associated with the communication services such as contact information (names, addresses, titles, organizational information). While information managed by the directory server  is typically static, a directory server with advanced capabilities may also manage presence information (availability, calendar information, location information), group information (delegates, teams, other groupings), and information associated with available resources such as printers, scanners, conference rooms, or other services. A portion or all of this information may also be managed by other servers (e.g. presence server, access server) and stored in data stores .","As discussed above, enhanced communication technologies enable subscribers to utilize a wide range of computing device and application capabilities in conjunction with communication services. This means, a subscriber may use one or more devices (e.g. a regular phone, a smart phone, a computer, a smart automobile console, etc.) to facilitate communications. Depending on the capabilities of each device and applications available on each device, additional services may be enabled in conjunction with the available communications. Furthermore, information in addition to the examples provided above may be used by the service in determining whether or not to initiate communication with a subscriber, which mode of communication, and similar decisions.","Network(s) , , and  may comprise any topology of servers, clients, Internet service providers, and communication media. A system according to embodiments may have a static or dynamic topology. Network(s) , , and  may include a secure network such as an enterprise network, an unsecure network such as a wireless open network, or the Internet. Network(s) , , and  may also include or coordinate communication over other networks such as PSTN or cellular networks. Network(s) , , and  provides communication between the nodes described herein. By way of example, and not limitation, network(s) , , and  may include wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media.","Many other configurations of computing devices, applications, data sources, and data distribution systems, and information types may be employed to implement a system for managing remote address book access and extensibility. Furthermore, the networked environments discussed in  are for illustration purposes only. Embodiments are not limited to the example applications, modules, or processes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":"200"},"Each user in a remote organization may have access to a different subset of address list entries, and the synchronized address lists cannot be shared and may have to be mirrored per user, rendering the process resource intensive.","The different communication services a user may utilize are represented in diagram  by servers , , and  with their respective data stores , , , where the address book information may be stored. The user may access any one of these services remotely through an application on client device  or . In a system according to embodiments, a third party service executed on server  may receive a request from one of the client devices, access one or more of the communication services, retrieve the data using the user's credentials, customize the data for consistent presentation, and provide to the user's client device. Since authentication is a crucial aspect of most communication systems, an independent authentication service () may be utilized to authenticate the third party service as representing the user to the services.","Customization and presentation of the data may depend on the application employed by the user. Discrepancies between the formats and\/or schema of the data from different services and supported features may be handled according to default policies, user preferences, or a combination of the two.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","354","1","3","358","362","364","356"]},"According to some embodiments, a single protocol may be employed between the client application  and third party information management service  regardless of the data source. Third party information management service  may employ applicable protocols when retrieving data from information sources - (, , and ).","Third party information management service  may translate data from individual information sources and modify the schema for consistency. As discussed previously, features supported by the information source may vary. The data provided to client application  may be customized to manage these differences. For example, some features may be hidden for consistent presentation of the data. According to other embodiments, default features may be used as a back-up for features not supported by a particular information source (or data). The discrepancies between data schema and supported features may be handled based on a set of default policies, a set of user preferences, client application capabilities, client device capabilities, network capabilities, or a combination of any of those.","According to further embodiments, third party information management service  may render the customized data available through a standard Application Programming Interface (API) to other services  for their use on behalf of the user. Similarly, third party information management service  may accept information from other services  for use in processing user data. For example, third party information management service  may support a number of standard protocols for interfacing with major communication services and expose an API for other communication services that do not conform to the standard protocols. This way, user's data from a service with a custom protocol may still be retrieved as long as that service can provide the data using the third party information management service's API.","Other services  may also represent auxiliary information sources, whose data may be combined with data from one of the information sources - to complement a particular feature. For example, other services  may provide Global Positioning System (GPS) data for particular contacts, whose main contact information may be received from information source  () and combined with the GPS data from other services  as part of that contact's presence information.","Third party information management service  may provide the processed data to client application  as a contact card. Contact card is an increasingly standardized form of providing address book information about contacts, groups, and resources and may include any of the information given as examples herein.","The above discussed scenarios, example systems, communications methods, or applications are for illustration purposes. Embodiments are not restricted to those examples. Other forms of user data, contact cards, and applications may be used in implementing remote address book access and extensibility in a similar manner using the principles described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","400","402","404","400","404","404","405","404","406","422","424","426"]},"Information management service  may facilitate retrieval of address book data (static and dynamic) from multiple information sources employing applicable protocols and delivery of customized information to client applications for consistent presentation of the address book data. Information processing module  may perform the customization operations discussed above such as translation and\/or filtering of received data, modification of data schema, handling of discrepant features, resolution of overlapping or discrepant data (e.g. contact information for the same contact from two sources that may or may not be the same). As mentioned, many communication services require some form of authentication, which may also be different depending on the service. Optional authentication module  may manage authentication of the user's credentials to respective information sources (communication services), preferably without the user having to provide their credentials each repeatedly. Information management service , information processing module , and optional authentication module  may be separate applications or integral modules of a hosted service that provides enhanced communication services to client applications\/devices. This basic configuration is illustrated in  by those components within dashed line .","Computing device  may have additional features or functionality. For example, the computing device  may also include additional data storage devices (removable and\/or non-removable) such as, for example, magnetic disks, optical disks, or tape. Such additional storage is illustrated in  by removable storage  and non-removable storage . Computer readable storage media may include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information, such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data. System memory , removable storage  and non-removable storage  are all examples of computer readable storage media. Computer readable storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by computing device . Any such computer readable storage media may be part of computing device . Computing device  may also have input device(s)  such as keyboard, mouse, pen, voice input device, touch input device, and comparable input devices. Output device(s)  such as a display, speakers, printer, and other types of output devices may also be included. These devices are well known in the art and need not be discussed at length here.","Computing device  may also contain communication connections  that allow the device to communicate with other devices , such as over a wireless network in a distributed computing environment, a satellite link, a cellular link, and comparable mechanisms. Other devices  may include computer device(s) that execute communication applications, other directory or presence servers, and comparable devices. Communication connection(s)  is one example of communication media. Communication media can include therein computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal, such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism, and includes any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media.","Example embodiments also include methods. These methods can be implemented in any number of ways, including the structures described in this document. One such way is by machine operations, of devices of the type described in this document.","Another optional way is for one or more of the individual operations of the methods to be performed in conjunction with one or more human operators performing some. These human operators need not be collocated with each other, but each can be only with a machine that performs a portion of the program.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500"]},"Process  begins with operation , where a request for information is received from a client application. A client application may request all details or a subset of the available details about a contact. Based on what is requested, a different subset of data sources may be contacted. For example, only the presence server may be contacted if the user requested the presence information. Alternatively, remote address book access may be provided periodically without necessarily awaiting client application request. At operation , a data source associated with the requested (or configured to update) data is determined. As discussed previously, the data sources may include a variety of servers associated with communication services, where the user may have an account and access rights associated with that account. According to some embodiments, a protocol employed to retrieve information from a data source may be auto-detected, where the auto-detection is performed once and persisted for future use.","At optional operation , the user's credentials may be authenticated to the data source. This may be done through a variety of ways, some of which may involve a third party authentication service. Subsequently, the information may be requested and received from the data source at operation . At operation , the information is customized through translation, filtering, and other operations for consistent presentation of the information from a variety of sources to the user. At operation , the customized data is forwarded to the user's client application for presentation to the user.","The operations included in process  are for illustration purposes. Providing remote address book information access through a third party service may be implemented by similar processes with fewer or additional steps, as well as in different order of operations using the principles described herein.","The above specification, examples and data provide a complete description of the manufacture and use of the composition of the embodiments.
