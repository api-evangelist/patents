Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an image pickup apparatus suitable for use, for example, with a storage medium capable of storing a plurality of images, a method of controlling such an image pickup apparatus, and a storage medium.","2. Description of the Related Art","With advances in digital technology in recent years, a great number of image pickup apparatus having a digital recording capability (generally called digital cameras) have been proposed. Some of these digital cameras include (i) a viewfinder or a small-sized display device such as a TFT liquid crystal display device for displaying an image during or after an image taking operation, and (ii) a mass storage device such as a flash memory for storing a taken image, disposed in the main body of the digital camera.","In this technical field, it is desired that the digital camera have an editing capability whereby a plurality of taken images may be stored in such a manner that they are linked to each other. To store a plurality of taken images in a conventional digital camera, it is required to read images one by one from a storage area provided in the main body of the digital camera and perform an operation of establishing a link for each image. However, such an operation is very complex and troublesome for a user. Furthermore, because an image to be linked is selected, for example, by its file name there is a possibility that an undesired image is linked by mistake.","It is a general object of the present invention to solve the above problem. More specifically, it is an object of the present invention to provide an image pickup apparatus capable of easily linking a taken image to another image, a method of controlling an image pickup apparatus, and a storage medium.","According to an aspect of the present invention, to achieve the above objects, there is provided an image pickup apparatus comprising: image sensing means; storage means for storing predetermined data; display means for displaying the predetermined data stored in the storage means; designation means for designating an arbitrary point on the predetermined data displayed on the display means; and generation means for generating link information in such a manner that if an image is taken by the image sensing means after a point is designated by the designation means, link information indicating that the taken image is linked to the designated point is generated.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of controlling an image pickup apparatus, comprising: an image sensing step; a displaying step for displaying predetermined data stored in a storage unit; a designation step for designating an arbitrary point on the predetermined data displayed in the displaying step; and a generation step for generating link information in such a manner that if an image is taken in the image sensing step after a point is designated in the designation step, link information indicating that the taken image is linked to the designated point is generated.","These and other objects and features of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","1","2","3","2","4","2","3","2","3"]},"The main body  includes a display unit  realized using, for example, a TFT color liquid crystal display technique, for monitoring the image during the operation of taking an image and for displaying an image after the image taking operation. There is provided a tablet  of the pressure-sensitive type or the like on the display unit  so that the user can input a control command for controlling the digital camera  or other information by touching the tablet  with a pen . A mode key is provided on a side of the display unit  whereby the user can switch the application or the operation mode. Reference numeral  denotes a shutter button. Reference numeral  denotes a selection switch for selecting an operation mode between an image taking mode and a reproducing mode wherein the switch  also acts as a power switch.","To take an image of a subject, the digital camera  is set so that the lens  is aimed at the subject, and the composition is determined while monitoring the image displayed on the display unit . If the shutter button  is pressed after determining the composition, the image is stored in the data storage unit of the digital camera . To reproduce a taken image, the selection switch  is set into a reproducing mode (PLAY), and the mode key and the pen  are operated so that a desired image is displayed on the display unit .","The operation performed in the digital camera  to take an image is described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"1"},"In , reference numeral  denotes a CPU which controls the operation of the digital camera . The CPU  is connected to a RAM , a RAM , a data storage unit , an image processor , a tablet controller , an LCD controller , and a shutter button . The image processor  is connected to a CCD controller  and a CCD . The tablet controller  is connected to a handwriting tablet , and the LCD controller  is connected to a display driver  and further to a display unit .","The CPU  controls the operation over the entire digital camera  in accordance with the control program stored in the ROM . The operations controlled by the CPU  includes a process of reading image data output by the image processor  and transferring it to the RAM , a process of transferring data from the RAM  to the LCD controller , a process of compressing image data according to the JPEG (Joint Photographic Expert Group) standard and storing the resultant image data file into the data storage unit , processes of executing various application programs in accordance with information input via the handwriting tablet , and a process of starting an image taking operation in response to the operation of the shutter button .","The RAM  includes an image storage area , a work area , a VRAM , and a temporarily saving area . The image storage area is used as a temporary buffer for temporarily storing image data (YUV digital signal) output from the image processor  or JPEG-compressed image data read from the data storage unit . The image storage area is also used as a work area during image compression and decompression processes. The work area is a work area used by various application programs. The VRAM is a VRAM for storing image data to be displayed on the display unit . The temporary saving area is a work area used to temporarily save various data.","The data storage unit  is a memory for storing, into the form of a file, image data compressed by the CPU  according to the JPEG standard and also various associated data used by various application programs for the purpose of reference. This memory is preferably a nonvolatile memory such as a flash memory. The data storage unit  is detachable and thus it is possible to transfer data stored in a storage device of an external device to the digital camera  via the detachable data storage unit .","A lens set  includes a plurality of lenses for optically projecting an image of a subject onto the CCD . The CCD (photoelectric conversion element)  is a device for converting the image projected via the lens set  into an analog electric signal. The CCD controller  includes a timing generator for supplying a transfer clock signal and a shutter signal to the CCD , a circuit for removing noise from the signal output by the CCD and for controlling the gain, and an A\/D converter for converting the analog signal into a 10-bit digital signal.","The image processor  performs image processing, such as gamma conversion, color space conversion, white balance correction, AE, and flash correction, on the 10-bit digital signal output from the CCD controller . The resultant signal is output as an 8-bit digital signal in the YUV (4: 2: 2) format. Herein, the assembly of the lens set , the CCD , the CCD controller , and the image processor  is referred to as a camera module .","The tablet controller  controls the operation of driving the handwriting tablet  and also controls the operation of converting a control command input by a user or other information into a digital signal and transferring it to the CPU . The LCD controller  receives YUV digital image data transferred from the image processor  or YUV image data produced by JPEG-decompressing an image file stored in the data storage unit, and converts it into an RGB digital signal. The resultant RGB digital signal is output to the display driver .","The display driver  drives the display unit . The display unit  ( in ) serves to display an image and includes for example a TFT liquid crystal display device according to the VGA (640 dots\u00d7480 dots) standard. A shutter button  ( in ) is a switch used to start an image taking operation. This shutter button  can be in either of two switching positions depending on the pressure applied to the shutter button. If it is detected that the shutter button  is in the first position (hereinafter referred to as a \u201chalf-pressed position\u201d), camera settings associated with white balance, AE, and the like are locked. When the shutter button  is pressed to the second position (hereinafter referred to as a \u201cfull-pressed position\u201d), an image signal is captured.","The employment of the half-pressed position makes it possible for a user to check the quality and other features of an image before the image is actually taken, by monitoring the image which is displayed on the display unit  after being subjected to various processes such as a white balance correction.","The interface  serves as an interface in data transmission between the digital camera  and an external device such as a personal computer. The external device  is for example a personal computer or a server connected to the digital camera via a network.","Referring to flowcharts shown in , , and , the operation of the digital camera  for taking an image in accordance with a first embodiment is described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"1"},"If a user sets the selection switch  into the image recording mode (REC) in step S, the CCD module including the CCD  and the CCD controller  is enabled in step S. Then in step S, the display unit , serving as an electronic viewfinder for monitoring a subject image to be recorded, starts to operate.","In step S, it is determined whether some key is pressed by the user. In step S, it is determined whether the operation mode of the digital camera  is in the normal mode or the half-pressed mode. Then in step S, the CCD  converts optical information obtained via the lens set  into an electric signal. The resultant signal is output in the form of a noninterlaced analog signal. To increase the operating speed, the signal or image data is output after performing a resolution reduction according to a known technique from 640 dots\u00d7480 dots to 320 dots\u00d7to 240 dots.","The signal obtained in step S is then subjected, in the following step S, to a noise reduction process and a gain controlling process in the CCD controller . The signal in the analog form is then converted into a 10-bit digital signal and transmitted to the image processor . In step S, the image processor  performs various processes including a white balance correction, AE, a correction needed when the image is taken with a strobe, and a signal conversion into the YUV (4: 2: 2) format. The resultant YUV signal is constantly written by the CPU  into the VRAM and output to the LCD controller .","In step S, the LCD controller  converts the received YUV signal into an RGB digital signal and outputs the resultant RGB signal to the display driver  in the following step S. In step S, the display unit  receives the signal output by the display driver  and displays an image according to the received signal.","The process from step S to step S is performed repeatedly for example every {fraction (1\/30)} sec so that the subject image input from the camera module  is displayed on the display unit .","If some key, for example the shutter button  (), is pressed by the user when the subject image is displayed, an interrupt event is generated in response to a signal generated by the key operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"1"},"At the stage where a key operation is performed by the user, the digital camera  is in either of two operation modes: the normal mode in which the viewfinder operation is continuously performed as described above with reference to ; or the half-pressed mode which is activated when the user presses the shutter button  into the half-pressed position and in which the viewfinder operation is performed while locking the various camera settings. With reference to , the process in the normal mode is first described and then the process in the half-pressed mode is described.","In the normal mode, step S performs a key status reading process to determine which key is operated when a key operation is performed by the user. If it is detected in step S that the shutter button  is pressed, then in step S current settings associated with the automatic white balance, AE, and the strobe correction, which are controlled by the image processor , are locked. Then in the following step S, the operations of the display driver  and the display unit  are stopped to reduce the processing load on the CPU.","In step S, image data corresponding to the taken image is input. The image processor  performs various processes including white balance correction on the input image data. The image data output by the image processor  is stored by the CPU  into the image storage area of the RAM . In step S, an image compression process according to the JPEG standard is performed on the image data stored in the image storage area . Then in step S, the compressed image data is stored into the data storage unit .","After that, in step S, the display driver  and the display unit  in a pausing state are restarted. In step S, the taken image is displayed on the display unit  for a predetermined period of time. Then in step S, the interrupt process is completed and the process returns to step S in  to restart the viewfinder operation. On the other hand, in the key status reading process in step S, if the CPU  detects (in step S) that the shutter button  is pressed by the user into the half-pressed position, then the CPU  sets, in step S, the operation mode of the digital camera  into the half-pressed mode. Then in step S, as in step S, current settings associated with the automatic white balance, AE, and the strobe correction (which are controlled by the image processor ) are locked.","In step S, the interrupt process is completed and the process returns to step S in  to restart the viewfinder operation. In the case where it is detected in step S that a key is pressed by the user to change an image taking condition, then the process goes to step S in which the settings associated with the automatic white balance control, AE, the strobe correction, which are controlled by the image processor , are modified depending on the key operation performed by the user. Then in step S, the process returns to step S in  to continue the operation of displaying the image.","In the case where the switch  of the digital camera  is switched by the user into the \u201cOFF\u201d position in step S, the operation of displaying the subject image on the display unit is terminated (in step S) and the operation of the CCD module including the CCD  and the CCD controller is also terminated (step in S). After terminating the other operations associated with the image taking process in step S, the electric power supply of the digital camera  is turned off. In the case where in step S the user does not set the selection switch  of the digital camera  into the \u201cOFF\u201d position, the process goes to step S in  to continue the image displaying process.","If an interrupt occurs when the digital camera  is in the half-pressed mode, the following procedure is performed.","In the half-pressed mode, step S performs a key status reading process to determine which key is operated when a key operation is performed by the user. If it is detected in step S that the shutter button  is pressed by the user, the information of various settings of the digital camera  set in step S is made effective, and the process goes to step S. If, in step S, the user releases the shutter button  of the digital camera  from the half-pressed position, then the process goes to step S to change the operation mode of the digital camera  from the half-pressed mode to the normal mode. The process then goes to step S.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"1"},"If the user sets the selection switch  into a reproducing mode (PLAY) in step S, then in step S the operations of the display driver  and the display unit  are started. In the following step S, the CPU  reads the compressed image data stored in the data storage unit  and temporarily stores it in the image storage area of the RAM . Then in step S, the CPU  decompresses the compressed image data.","In step S, the decompressed image data is stored in the VRAM . In step S, the YUV signal represented by the image data stored in the VRAM is converted to an RGB digital signal. The resultant RGB signal is output to the display driver  in step S. In step S, the display unit  receives the signal output by the display driver  and displays an image according to the received signal.","The digital camera  has the capability of storing a plurality of image data together with information representing links among them and reproducing linked image data as described below.

When the direct mode is selected, if the user designates a link point assigned to the data displayed on the display unit  () with the pen , then the operation of taking and storing a subject image is immediately started. However, if the direct mode is not selected, the operation of taking and storing a subject image is started when the shutter button  () is pressed after a link point assigned to the data displayed on the display unit  () is designated by the user with the pen .","In step S, it is determined whether another key operation has been performed by the user. If it is determined that the user has performed another key operation, a process corresponding to the operated key is performed. However, if it is determined that no key operation has been performed by the user, the process returns to step S. In the case where it is determined in step S that the direct mode is selected, the process goes to step S and the process shown in  is performed. In step S, the subject image obtained through the lens  and the CCD  is displayed on the display unit  () in such a manner the subject image is superimposed on the image data to which the subject image is to be linked.","In step S, it is determined whether an arbitrary point (link point) of the image data displayed on the display unit  () is designated by the user with the pen . If no link point is designated by the user, the process goes to step S and determines whether another key operation has been performed by the user. If it is determined that the user has performed another key operation, a process corresponding to the operated key is performed. However, if it is determined that no key operation has been performed by the user, the process returns to step S. In the case where it is determined in step S that a link point is selected by the user, the process goes to step S.","In step S, the process of taking and storing the image data is performed according to the procedure shown in FIG. . In step S, link information is generated which represents that the taken image is linked to the image data displayed on the display unit  (). Then in step S, the link information associated with the taken image is added to the image data to which the taken image is linked. In step S, the image data of the taken image and the data to which the taken image is linked to and which includes the added link information are stored in the data storage unit . In step S, a message is displayed on the display unit  () to tell the user that the linking and storing processes are complete and the process returns to step S.","The present embodiments may be applied to various types of systems which may include either a plurality of devices (such as a host computer, interfaces, reader, printer, etc.) or a single device (such as a copying machine or a facsimile machine).","Furthermore, the objects of the present embodiments may also be achieved by supplying a storage medium, on which a software program implementing the functions of any of the embodiments described above is stored, to a system or an apparatus whereby a computer (CPU or MPU) in the system or apparatus reads and executes the program code stored on the storage medium.","In this case, it should be understood that the program code read from the storage medium implements the functions of the embodiments and thus the storage medium storing the program code falls within the scope of present invention.","Storage media which can be preferably employed in the present invention to supply the program code include a floppy disk, hard disk, optical disk, magneto-optical disk, CD-ROM, CD-R, magnetic tape, non-volatile memory card, and ROM.","Furthermore, the scope of the present embodiments includes not only such a system in which the functions of any embodiment described above is implemented simply by reading and executing a program code on a computer but also a system in which a part of or the whole of process instructed by the program code is performed using an OS (operating system) on the computer.","Furthermore, the scope of the present embodiments also includes a system in which a program code is transferred once from a storage medium into a memory provided in a function extension board inserted in a computer or provided in a function extension unit connected to the computer, and then a part of or the whole of process instructed by the program code is performed by a CPU or the like in the function extension board or the function extension unit thereby implementing the functions of any embodiment described above.","As described above, the present embodiments provide an image pickup apparatus having the capability of easily linking a stored image to another stored image.
