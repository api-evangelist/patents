{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present application relates to novel fused pyrimidines and triazines, to processes for their preparation, to their use alone or in combinations for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases and to their use for preparing medicaments for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases, in particular for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.","One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitric oxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The representatives of this family disclosed to date can be divided both according to structural features and according to the type of ligands into two groups: the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one haem per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory site. The latter is of central importance for the mechanism of activation. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of haem and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Haem-free preparations cannot, by contrast, be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also able to attach to the central iron atom of haem, but the stimulation by CO is distinctly less than that by NO.","Through the production of cGMP and the regulation, resulting therefrom, of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays a crucial part in various physiological processes, in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission, and in disorders caused by an impairment of the aforementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system may be suppressed, which may lead for example to high blood pressure, platelet activation, increased cellular proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, myocardial infarction, thromboses, stroke and sexual dysfunction.","A possible way of treating such disorders which is independent of NO and aims at influencing the cGMP signaling pathway in organisms is a promising approach because of the high efficiency and few side effects which are to be expected.","Compounds, such as organic nitrates, whose effect is based on NO have to date been exclusively used for the therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase. NO is produced by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attaching to the central iron atom of haem. Besides the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.","Over the last years, a number of substances which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly. i.e. without prior release of NO, have been described, for example 3-(5\u2032-hydroxymethyl-2\u2032-furyl)-1-benzylindazole [YC-1; Wu et al., 84 (1994), 4226; M\u00fclsch et al., 120 (1997), 681], fatty acids [Goldberg et al., 252 (1977), 1279], diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate [Pettibone et al., 116 (1985), 307], isoliquiritigenin [Yu et al., 114 (1995), 1587], and also various substituted pyrazole derivatives (WO 98\/16223).","WO 00\/06569 and WO 03\/095451 disclose fused pyrazole derivatives and carbamate-substituted 3-pyrimidinylpyrazolopyridines, respectively, as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase. WO 2010\/065275 discloses substituted pyrrolo- and dihydropyridopyrimidines as sGC activators.","It was an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which act as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and have a comparable or improved therapeutic profile compared to the compounds known from the prior art, for example with respect to their in vivo properties and\/or their pharmakokinetic behaviour.","It is an object of the present invention to provide compounds of the general formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"47.50mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09216978-20151222-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["A represents nitrogen or CR,\n    \n    ","L represents a group *\u2014CRR\u2014(CRR)-#,\n    \n    ","Rrepresents hydrogen or fluorine,","Rrepresents benzyl,\n    \n    "]}},"Compounds according to the invention are the compounds of the formula (I) and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, the compounds included in the formula (I) of the formulae mentioned in the following and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, and the compounds included in the formula (I) and mentioned in the following as embodiment examples and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, where the compounds included in the formula (I) and mentioned in the following are not already salts, solvates and solvates of the salts.","Preferred salts in the context of the present invention are physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds according to the invention. Salts which are not themselves suitable for pharmaceutical uses but can be used, for example, for isolation or purification of the compounds according to the invention are also included.","Physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds according to the invention include acid addition salts of conventional mineral acids, carboxylic acids and sulphonic acids, e.g. salts of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulphonic acid, ethanesulphonic acid, toluenesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid, naphthalenedisulphonic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, and benzoic acid.","Physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds according to the invention also include salts of conventional bases, such as, by way of example and preferably, alkali metal salts (e.g. sodium and potassium salts), alkaline earth metal salts (e.g. calcium and magnesium salts) and ammonium salts derived from ammonia or organic amines having 1 to 16 carbon atoms, such as, by way of example and preferably, ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, ethyldiisopropylamine, monoethanol-amine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, dicyclohexylamine, dimethylaminoethanol, procaine, dibenzylamine, N-methylmorpholine, arginine, lysine, ethylenediamine and N-methylpiperidine.","Solvates in the context of the invention are designated as those forms of the compounds according to the invention which form a complex in the solid or liquid state by coordination with solvent molecules. Hydrates are a specific form of solvates, in which the coordination takes place with water. Hydrates are preferred solvates in the context of the present invention.","The compounds according to the invention can exist in different stereoisomeric forms depending on their structure, i.e. in the form of configuration isomers or optionally also as conformation isomers (enantiomers and\/or diastereomers, including those in the case of atropisomers). The present invention therefore includes the enantiomers and diastereomers and their particular mixtures. The stereoisomerically uniform constituents can be isolated from such mixtures of enantiomers and\/or diastereomers in a known manner; chromatography processes are preferably used for this, in particular HPLC chromatography on an achiral or chiral phase.","Where the compounds according to the invention can occur in tautomeric forms, the present invention includes all the tautomeric forms.","The present invention also encompasses all suitable isotopic variants of the compounds according to the invention. An isotopic variant of a compound according to the invention is understood here to mean a compound in which at least one atom within the compound according to the invention has been exchanged for another atom of the same atomic number, but with a different atomic mass than the atomic mass which usually or predominantly occurs in nature. Examples of isotopes which can be incorporated into a compound according to the invention are those of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, such as H (deuterium), H (tritium), C, C, N, O, O, P, F, S, S, S, S, F, Cl, Br, I, I, I and I. Particular isotopic variants of a compound according to the invention, especially those in which one or more radioactive isotopes have been incorporated, may be beneficial, for example, for the examination of the mechanism of action or of the active compound distribution in the body; due to comparatively easy preparability and detectability, especially compounds labelled with H or C isotopes are suitable for this purpose. In addition, the incorporation of isotopes, for example of deuterium, can lead to particular therapeutic benefits as a consequence of greater metabolic stability of the compound, for example an extension of the half-life in the body or a reduction in the active dose required; such modifications of the compounds according to the invention may therefore in some cases also constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Isotopic variants of the compounds according to the invention can be prepared by generally used processes known to those skilled in the art, for example by the methods described below and the methods described in the working examples, by using corresponding isotopic modifications of the particular reagents and\/or starting compounds therein.","The present invention moreover also includes prodrugs of the compounds according to the invention. The term \u201cprodrugs\u201d here designates compounds which themselves can be biologically active or inactive, but are converted (for example metabolically or hydrolytically) into compounds according to the invention during their dwell time in the body.","In the context of the present invention, the substituents have the following meaning, unless specified otherwise:","Alkyl in the context of the invention represents a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.

Removal of blood is after 0.033, 0.083, 0.17, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 24 hours in the case of rats, after 0.033, 0.083, 0.17, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 24, 48 and 72 hours in the case of mice and after 0.083, 0.25, 0.28 0.33, 0.42, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 24 hours in the case of dogs. For all species, oral administration of the dissolved substance via gavage is carried out based on a water\/PEG400\/ethanol formulation (50\/40\/10). Here, the removal of blood from rats is after 0.083, 0.17, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 24 hours and from dogs after 0.083, 0.17, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 24, 30 and 48 hours. The blood is removed into heparinized tubes. The blood plasma is then obtained by centrifugation; if required, it can be stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until further processing.","An internal standard (ZK 228859) is added to the samples of the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention, calibration samples and QCs, and the protein is precipitated using excess acetonitrile. After addition of an ammonium acetate buffer (0.01 M, pH 6.8) and subsequent vortexing, the mixture is centrifuged at 1000 g and the supernatant is examined by LC-MS\/MS (API 4000, AB Sciex). Chromatographic separation is carried out on an Agilent 1100-HPLC. The injection volume is 10 \u03bcl. The separation column used is a Phenomenex Luna 5\u03bc C8(2) 100 A 50\u00d72 mm, adjusted to a temperature of 40\u00b0 C. A binary mobile phase gradient at 500 \u03bcl\/min is used (A: 0.01 M ammonium acetate buffer pH 6.8, B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile): 0 min (90% A), 1 min (90% A), 3 min (15% A), 4 min (15% A), 4.50 min (90% A), 6 min (90% A). The temperature of the Turbo V ion source is 500\u00b0 C. The following MS instrument parameters are used: curtain gas 15 units, ion spray voltage 4.8 kV, gas 1 45 units, gas 2 35 units, CAD gas 40 units. The substances are quantified by peak heights or areas using extracted ion chromatograms of specific MRM experiments.","The pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC, C, t(terminal half-life), MRT (mean residence time) and CL (clearance) are calculated by means of the validated pharmacokinetics calculation program KinEx (Vers. 2.5 and 3) from the plasma concentration-time curves obtained.","As substance quantification takes place in plasma, the blood\/plasma distribution of the substance must be determined for appropriate adjustment of the pharmacokinetic parameters. For this, a defined amount of the substance in heparinized whole blood of the corresponding species is incubated for 20 min in the tumbling roller mixer. After centrifugation at 1000 g, the plasma concentration is measured (see above) and the C\/Cvalue is determined by finding the quotient.","Following intravenous administration of 0.3 mg\/kg of Example 1, 18, 19 and 27 in rats, the following values were recorded:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0703","num":"1009"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Example",{}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"1","18","19","27"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"CL[L\/h\/kg]","1.1","0.46","0.32","0.35"]},{"entry":[{},"terminal half-life [h]","0.9","1.4","3.0","5.6"]},{"entry":[{},"mean residence time [h]","1.2","1.9","4.0","7.3"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}},"br":{}},"The compounds according to the invention can be converted into pharmaceutical preparations in the following ways:","Tablet:","Composition:","100 mg of the compound according to the invention, 50 mg of lactose (monohydrate), 50 mg of maize starch (native), 10 mg of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP 25) (from BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany) and 2 mg of magnesium stearate.","Tablet weight 212 mg, diameter 8 mm, radius of curvature 12 mm","Production:","The mixture of compound according to the invention, lactose and starch is granulated with a 5% strength solution (m\/m) of the PVP in water.
