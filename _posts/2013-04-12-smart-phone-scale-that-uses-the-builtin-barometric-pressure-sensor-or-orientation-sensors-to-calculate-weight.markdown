A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. 37 CFR \u00a71.71(d).","The disclosed technology pertains to portable methods and apparatus for weighing an item.","Scales date back to biblical times. The need remains for improved scales that are small, portable, and accurate for weighing relatively small items such as mail pieces to determine correct postage.","The following is a summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not intended to identify key\/critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","The current invention proposes multiple different embodiments for implementing a small portable scale. The embodiments have in common leveraging the screen display and other electronics typically provided in a portable computing device such as a smart phone, pad computer, laptop computer, iPhone\u00ae, iPad\u00ae or the like.","Additional aspects and advantages of this invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","102","104","106","106","110","106","104","115","115","312","106","104","106","104","112","302"]},"In an example, transparent window  may be made of a variety of materials known to those of skill in the art configured to communicate a signal and\/or pressure to a touch screen sensor of mobile device , such as, for example, a capacitative and or resistive material or assembly. In another example, a controller including Bluetooth\u00ae and\/or other wireless method of communication may be used to communicate commands to mobile device  while enclosed in chamber .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","220","220","222","226","222","222"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","3","3","100","302","304","302","304","220","110","100","226","306","222","226","306","306","302","304","302","302","100","310","310","302","110"]},"In an alternative embodiment, a rigid plastic box may be used with a plastic bag enclosed therein provide a sealing agent inside of the rigid container. The rigid container may be rectangular or cylindrical with a floating first half, and a second half that rests on a fixed surface. These halves can have a seal between them or simply fit snugly with a sealed plastic bag within. The mobile device may be placed in the bag and then the bag in the container. Changes in barometric pressure responsive to the weight of an item being weighed may be used to estimate the weight after calibration.","In an example, mobile device  may store a software application for estimating a weight of an object disposed on surface  based on a change in barometric pressure within chamber . Mobile device  may include a built-in barometric pressure sensor accessible to the weighing application via an application programming interface (API) that may be associated with the weighing application. Again, using an API to access the barometer function, a software application (\u201capp\u201d) can be provided for weighing operations. The new scale can be calibrated using objects having known weights. The scale can be used for a variety of things. In one scenario, it can be used at a pick-up or collection point for processing mail or parcel items in the field prior to speed accurate delivery. For example, a single (preferably ruggedized) portable device can implement weighing, as explained above, as well as mobile OCR, address recognition and correction, and label printing. Then the subject parcel is \u201cgood to go\u201d while minimizing subsequent handling for delivery, and the delivery address is likely to be valid. In general, the disclosed scale can be part of an effective decentralized parcel handling process.","Referring again to , mobile device  may be configured to display a graphical user interface (GUI)  including one or more soft buttons and a display area for showing a calculated weight. A process for weighing an item may begin by calibrating the weighing application. A user may select a \u201ccalibrate\u201d soft button  to activate the weighing application to begin a calibration routine which may include weighing items of known weight using weighing assembly . Other calibration methods may be used and claimed subject matter is not limited in this regard.","A user may select an \u201caccept\u201d soft button  to accept and\/or store a particular weight, tare and\/or calibration operation. A user may select a \u201creset\u201d soft button  to reset the weighing application, perhaps after calibrating and\/or weighing an item. The weighing application may be configured to tare an item to be weighed by resetting a weight to zero when a user selects a \u201ctare\u201d soft button .","In an example, mobile device  may be disposed in chamber . After calibration of the weighing application, an item may be weighed by placing it on surface  of weighing assembly . A change in barometric pressure within chamber  responsive to a displacement of piston  within cylinder  due to a downward force exerted on surface  by the item may be measured by the weighing application and correlated to a weight of the item.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","106","104","112","104","304","220"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["500","502","502","112","502","112","112","502","502","112","502"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"],"b":["600","602","604","606","608","610","612","612","608","606","612","610","606","612","610","612","610","614","612","610","612","610","112"]},"In an example, cylindrical foot assembly  may comprise a cylinder  and a foot  configured to extend into a chamber of cylinder  similar to a piston action. A downward force exerted by an item placed in item receptacle  may cause foot  to extended into cylinder . In an example, foot  may be a pneumatic piston, a spring loaded piston and\/or the like.","In an example, receptacle  may include slot  which may be configured to hold an item to be weighed such as a letter envelope. In another embodiment, receptacle  may have any shape configured to hold, contain, balance and\/or otherwise support an item to be weighed and claimed subject matter is not limited in this regard.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","7","7","600","702","704","702","704","602","112","708","706"]},"In an example, if an item is placed in slot  to be weighed, foot  may depress spring  and may extend into chamber  of cylinder  a distance proportional to the weight of the item. Displacement of foot  within chamber  may displace gases within chamber . Displaced gasses may be communicated to chamber  via channel  changing the pressure of the gases within chamber . As discussed above, a pressure change within chamber  may be measured using a barometer either incorporated into weighing assembly  and\/or a mobile communication device . A change in barometric pressure may be correlated to the weight of an item supported in slot  by a weighing application executable on mobile device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 7"],"b":["800","802","804","800","602","804","812","806","804"]},"The item to be weighed may be placed on the top side  of weighing assembly . The item may be, for example, an envelope or mail item. Alternatively, the item may be placed in receptacle . Receptacle  may be integrally formed with mobile device  (as in ) or may be removable (as in ). For example, receptacle  may comprise a plug  that may fit in port . An alternative receptacle , for example, may have a cup shape for holding granular or otherwise \u201cloose\u201d materials  for weighing, for example, spices, herbs, chemicals or any other substance. The material to be weighed may be a liquid, gelatinous, solid or any other form. Plug  may fit in port  as well. In an example, receptacle  may comprise an extended or extendable arm coupled between plug  and receptacle  older to increase the moment arm of receptacle  and thereby to increase sensitivity of the weighing application.","The load cell  may be coupled to mobile device  electronics by a cable or integral wiring (not shown). In some embodiments, mobile device  may comprise a wireless receiver . Load cell  may be coupled to a wireless transmitter . Load cell  may communicate with mobile device  wirelessly, for example, by short-range wireless technology such as Blue Tooth\u00ae. Coupling to the mobile device  electronics may be arranged to enable a processor in the mobile device  to receive data indicative of a force sensed and reported by the load cell. The load cell data may be used for zeroing (tare), calibration and\/or weighing operations. Preferably, a processor in the mobile device  may access and utilize the load cell data under control of a weighing application program.

The weighing application may estimate a weight of an item placed on a top surface  of mobile device  or in receptacle  based on a change in orientation of mobile device  resulting from a downward force applied on mobile device  by the item. The weighing application may be calibrated by first identifying an original orientation and then by identifying an orientation of mobile device  responsive to weighing various items of known weight. A tare mode may \u201czero\u201d out the weighing application at a starting orientation which may be different from the initial orientation.","In an example, the compressible material may be rubber and\/or silicone or a suitable polymeric material. It should be designed to recover to its uncompressed dimensions when the weighing item is removed, in a repeatable fashion.
