title: System and method of securing private health information
abstract: A system and method for securing private health information collected by a covered entity. The system and method comprises a key generation module configured to generate a public key and a private key compatible with a fully homomorphic encryption scheme. The patient's private health information, having been encrypted using the public key, can be processed by business associates without decrypting it, yielding an encrypted result. Only the holder of the unencrypted private key can decrypt the encrypted private health information and the encrypted result. The invention ensures that business associates can process private health information and return a result without accessing the private health information.

Field of the Invention","This invention relates to the field of secure processing of private health information.","2. Description of the Background Art","Medical professionals and institutions often transmit patients' private health information over open networks to third party business associates, who process that information in order to provide a variety of services. These services include, among other things, claims processing or administration; data analysis, utilization review; quality assurance; benefit management; practice management; repricing; facilitation of health information exchange organizations and regional health information organizations; e-prescribing; providing personal health records; data aggregation; and performing accounting, billing, actuarial, and consulting services.","Various rules and regulations require medical professionals and institutions to adopt certain authorization and authentication safeguards to protect the confidentiality of patients' private health information when transmitting it over open networks. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires certain health care providers, health care clearinghouses, and health plans (\u201ccovered entities\u201d) to encrypt private health information using secure TCP\/IP network encryption technology, such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. In addition, a covered entity may disclose private health information to a business associate only after obtaining satisfactory assurances that the business associate will appropriately safeguard the information.","Unfortunately, even with these safeguards, the security of private health information transmitted to third parties is too often compromised. Indeed, a recent survey demonstrated that 39% of security breaches are caused by third parties entrusted with sensitive data. (See 2010 Annual Study: U.S. Cost of a Data Breach, Symantec Corporation (March 2011).) In addition to exposing covered entities and business associates to liability, these security breaches undermine important objectives of the health care system by discouraging patients from disclosing their private information to covered entities.","An illustrative prior art system for enabling covered entities to transmit private health information to business associates is depicted in .","At step , the key generation module  of the business associate  generates a public key  and private key  according to an asymmetric key algorithm. As would be appreciated by one of skill in the art, there are a variety of asymmetric key algorithms, such as the RSA algorithm, the ElGamal algorithm, and the Paillier algorithm.","At step , the covered entity  collects private health information  of the patient . The private health information  may be provided directly by the patient  and entered into a computer system of the covered entity , or it may be collected from the patient  using a modality such as a CT scan device, or by a medical professional involved in the care and\/or health records of the patient. The private health information  may be stored and transferred according to the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard, published by the American College of Radiology and the National Electronic Manufacturers Association. Medical images, which may also constitute private health information, may be stored and retrieved using a Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS).","At step , the covered entity  initiates the submission of the private health information  to the business associate . Submission of this information can be accomplished using software, such as an application programming interface (API) over any standard network protocol.","At step , the business associate  sends the public key  to the covered entity .","At step , the key generation module  of the covered entity  generates a symmetric key  according to a symmetric key algorithm such as Blowfish, Twofish, or Serpent. In step , the encryption module  of the covered entity  encrypts the private health information  with the symmetric key , and encrypts the symmetric key  with the public key  provided by the business associate . The encrypted private health information, along with the encrypted symmetric key, is sent to the business associate  over connection  in step . In step , the decryption module  of business associate  uses the private key  to decrypt the symmetric key . The decrypted symmetric key  is then used by decryption module  of the business associate  to decrypt the private health information  in step .","Once the private health information  has been decrypted, it can be processed by the processing module  of the business associate  at step , yielding result . The business associate  may perform a variety of operations on the private health information , such as statistical analysis.","In step , the encryption module  of the business associate  uses the symmetric key  to encrypt the result  that was yielded from the processing module , yielding an encrypted result . The business associate  then sends the encrypted result  to the covered entity  over connection . Finally, at step , the decryption module  of the covered entity  uses the symmetric key  to decrypt the encrypted result , yielding a decrypted result  that can be accessed by the covered entity , the patient , or both.","Under this and other prior art methods, a covered entity who wants to take advantage of the services offered by a business associate must provide that business associate with the symmetric key so that the business associate can decrypt the encrypted private health information and perform the requested operations on that private health information. This is disadvantageous because covered entities often do not know the precise security policies and practices of business associates, or the identities and trustworthiness of the individuals responsible for administering the operations of the business associates. Given the potentially severe penalties associated with security breaches, covered entities are often reluctant to share private health information with business associates, and may decide to forego the valuable services that certain business associates offer. Alternatively, covered entities may devote significant resources to investigate the security policies of a business associate.","What is needed is an efficient system and method for enabling business associates to process private health information collected by covered entities without enabling business associates to access that information.","The present invention is a system and method that enables covered entities to send encrypted private health information of patients to business associates who may efficiently perform operations on that encrypted information, without requiring the covered entities to disclose the contents of the private health information or the unencrypted private key that could be used to decrypt that private health information. The invention utilizes a fully homomorphic encryption scheme, so that any operation performed on the encrypted private health information yields an encrypted result that cannot be decrypted without the unencrypted private key.","In particular, the covered entity generates a public key and a private key compatible with a fully homomorphic encryption scheme, and then uses the public key to fully homomorphically encrypt private health information of a patient. The covered entity then sends the fully homomorphically encrypted private health information to a business associate, who performs operations on the encrypted private health information, yielding an encrypted result. Because the business associate lacks the unencrypted private key, the business associate is unable to access the private health information.","By providing a mechanism for efficiently processing the private health information of covered entities' patients while maintaining the confidentiality of that information, the present invention benefits covered entities, business associates, and patients. The invention benefits covered entities by enabling them to receive valuable services offered by business associates without requiring the covered entities to investigate the business associates' security policies. The invention also benefits covered entities by lowering or eliminating their exposure to liability associated with security breaches by business associates. Because only the holder of the unencrypted private key can decrypt the private health information and the encrypted results of processing that information, covered entities need not fear untrusted business associates, or unknown third parties, accessing that information. Nor do covered entities or patients need to fear computer hackers breaking into the networks of business associates to retrieve private health information. Because only encrypted information is provided to business associates, hackers could, at worst, retrieve from such business associates encrypted information without the corresponding unencrypted private key.","Similarly, the invention benefits business associates by enabling them to spend fewer resources on security. Because business associates receive only encrypted information without the corresponding unencrypted private key, business associates need not develop elaborate security systems to protect the confidential information of covered entities' patients. Similarly, the invention will enable business associates to reduce or eliminate their exposure to liability associated with security breaches. In addition, the invention benefits business associates by providing them with more business, because covered entities who normally would not trust third parties with private health information can be assured that their information will be secure.","The invention also benefits patients by protecting the confidentiality of their private health information, by making the valuable services provided by business associates more widely available, and by reducing or eliminating medical care costs associated with investigating the security policies of business associates.","These and other advantages of one or more aspects of the invention will become apparent from consideration of the detailed description and accompanying drawings.","The preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to .","As depicted in , the patient  possesses private health information , which is provided to or collected by the covered entity . The private health information  may be any private information of the patient, such as information relating to the patient's physical or mental health or condition, the care provided to the patient, demographic information, or information regarding the patient's payment for care. The covered entity  may be any person or entity that collects private health information of patients, such as a health care provider, a medical professional, a health care clearinghouse, or a health plan. The covered entity  wishes to take advantage of the services offered by the business associate . The business associate  may offer any number of services or software applications relating to the processing of private health information. For example, the business associate  may offer software applications for claims processing or administration; data analysis, utilization review; quality assurance; benefit management; practice management; repricing; facilitation of health information exchange organizations and regional health information organizations; e-prescribing; providing personal health records; data aggregation; and performing accounting, billing, actuarial, and consulting services.","In order to take advantage of the services or software applications offered by the business associate  without disclosing private health information  to the business associate , the covered entity  utilizes a trusted server  to fully homomorphically encrypt the private health information . A fully homomorphic encryption scheme is described in Craig Gentry, , Dissertation submitted to the Department of Computer Science and the Committee on Graduate Studies of Stanford University, September 2009, as well as Craig Gentry and Shai Halevi, -, IBM Research, Feb. 4, 2011. These documents are incorporated by reference into this specification for all purposes.","The trusted server , which may be a cluster of servers, has sufficient processing power to perform fully homomorphic encryption of private health information . The processing power required is dependent on the length of the private health information , the speed at which the private health information  must be encrypted, and the level of security desired. The trusted server  may be operated by any entity or individual, including the covered entity .","At step , the key generation module  of the trusted server  generates a public key  and private key  compatible with a fully homomorphic asymmetric key encryption scheme.","At step , the covered entity  accesses the trusted server  through connection . Connection  may be an internet connection, wireless connection, satellite connection, network connection, application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) provided by either the trusted server  or the business associate , or any other connection accomplished using standard protocols. The covered entity  may access the trusted server  by means of an application developed by the operator of trusted server , by means of an internet browser, or any other means that would be appreciated by one of skill in the art.","At step , the trusted server  provides the public key  generated by the key generation module  to the covered entity .","At step , the covered entity  initiates the submission of private health information  and a request for processing that information to the trusted server . The private health information  may have been collected from the patient  in written form, by using a modality such as a CT scan, or by a medical professional involved in the care and\/or health records of the patient . Alternatively, the private health information  may have been collected from an authorized source other than the patient , such as a different covered entity. The private health information  may be stored and transferred according to the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard, published by the American College of Radiology and the National Electronic Manufacturers Association. Medical images, which may also constitute private health information , may be stored and retrieved using a Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). The transmission of the private health information  to the trusted server  may be initiated a variety of ways, depending on the needs of the covered entity  and the service requirements of the business associate  and\/or the trusted server . For instance, if the covered entity  desires to have the private health information  processed quickly, the covered entity  may initiate the encryption and transmission of the private health information  once it is collected. In that case, the transmission may be initiated manually by a medical professional or other agent of the covered entity , or automatically by software associated with the computer network or modalities of the covered entity . Alternatively, if the covered entity  desires to have the private health information  processed according to a predetermined schedule, the covered entity  may deploy a software application, such as a time-based job scheduler like cron, to initiate the encryption of the private health information , transmission of private health information , and\/or transmission of the request, at the appropriate time.","The private health information  may be encrypted by the encryption module  of the covered entity  using any known key algorithm, such the symmetric key algorithms Blowfish, Twofish, or Serpent, before it is sent to the trusted server . Accordingly, the term \u201cprivate health information,\u201d as used herein and in the claims, may refer to unencrypted or encrypted private health information, as the context permits.","At step , the encryption module  of the trusted server  uses a fully homomorphic encryption scheme to fully homomorphically encrypt private health information  (and, if required by the applicable homomorphic encryption scheme, one or more instances of private key ) using at least one instance of public key , yielding encrypted private health information . Accordingly, as used herein and in the claims, the terms \u201cencrypted private health information\u201d and \u201cfully homomorphically encrypted private health information\u201d may refer to only private health information  that has been encrypted, or to both private health information  in encrypted form and one or more instances of private key  in encrypted form, as the context permits.","At step , the trusted server  sends the fully homomorphically encrypted private health information , public key , and a request for processing the fully homomorphically encrypted private health information  over connection  to the business associate . The business associate  may be any entity other than the patient  or covered entity  that operates one or more computer servers capable of processing fully homomorphically encrypted private health information. Connection  may be an internet connection, wireless connection, satellite connection, network connection, application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) provided by either the trusted server  or the business associate , or any other connection accomplished using standard protocols. As would be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the public key , the encrypted private health information , and the request for processing the encrypted private health information  could be sent to the business associate  separately, or simultaneously, and any or all could be in a compressed format to make their transmission more efficient.","After the business associate  receives the public key , encrypted private health information , and the request for processing the encrypted private health information , the processing module  of the business associate  processes the encrypted private health information  in accordance with the request using one or more functions at step . The processing of the encrypted private health information  may also be conducted according to a predetermined schedule by using software such as a time-based job scheduler like cron. Because the business associate  does not have access to the unencrypted private key , the business associate  cannot decrypt the encrypted private health information . Nevertheless, because the private health information has been encrypted with a fully homomorphic encryption scheme, the encrypted private health information  can be processed with any number of functions without decrypting it. These functions could be quite basic, such as performing simple mathematical operations like addition and multiplication, or rather complex, such as statistical analysis or string manipulation. The output of the processing step  is an encrypted result . This encrypted result , like the encrypted private health information , is encrypted according to the public key , and can be decrypted only by using the private key . Accordingly, the business associate  cannot decrypt the encrypted result .","The business associate  sends the encrypted result  to the trusted server  at step . If desired, the business associate  may store the encrypted result , the encrypted private health information , and\/or the request in the private health information database  for future use.","At step , the trusted server  decrypts the encrypted result  using the private key , yielding a decrypted result . The trusted server  can then make appropriate use of the decrypted result . For example, the trusted server  can send the decrypted result  to the covered entity  over a secure connection, so that the covered entity  can use the decrypted result  for the benefit of the patient , for administrative purposes, or for improving the overall quality of the services provided by the covered entity . Alternatively, the trusted server  may utilize the decrypted result  to perform additional processing as required by the covered entity . The trusted server  may also use the private health information database  to store the private health information , the encrypted private health information , the encrypted result , or the decrypted result , for future use.","An alternative embodiment is depicted in .","In the alternative embodiment, fully homomorphic encryption is performed by the covered entity  rather than by a trusted server. The alternative embodiment is suitable for covered entities that have the resources to perform fully homomorphic encryption with the appropriate level of security and speed.","At step , the covered entity  accesses a computer server operated by the business associate  through a connection . Connection  may be an internet connection, wireless connection, satellite connection, network connection, application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) provided by either the business associate  or the covered entity , or any other connection accomplished using standard protocols. The covered entity  may access the computer server of the business associate  in a variety of ways, such as by using an application developed by the business associate  and installed on a computer server of covered entity , or by means of an internet browser used by the covered entity .","At step , the covered entity  initiates the submission of private health information . The private health information  may have been collected from the patient  in written form, by using a modality such as a CT scan, or by a medical professional involved in the care and\/or health records of the patient . Alternatively, the private health information  may have been collected from an authorized source other than the patient , such as a different covered entity.

Finally, at step , the decryption module  of covered entity  decrypts the encrypted result  using the private key , yielding a decrypted result .","A second alternative embodiment is depicted in .","In the second alternative embodiment, at step , the key generation module  of a security clearinghouse  generates a public key  and a private key  compatible with a fully homomorphic asymmetric key encryption scheme. The security clearinghouse  may be any entity, server, or cluster of servers capable of generating public keys and private keys compatible with a fully homomorphic asymmetric key encryption scheme. The security clearinghouse  may be separate from the covered entity , or may be owned or operated by the covered entity . The security clearinghouse  may generate the public key  and private key  at the request of the covered entity , or at the request of the patient . The request may be made in person, or electronically through requestor interface , which may be a computer terminal, website, or other electronic interface accessed locally or via an internet connection, wireless connection, satellite connection, network connection, application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) provided by either the security clearinghouse , covered entity , or business associate , or any other connection accomplished using standard protocols. After the public key  and private key  have been generated, either or both keys may be stored in the key database  for future retrieval. Key database  may be an actual database, a hard drive, or other appropriate storage repository.","At step , the key storage device generation module  stores the private key , the public key , or both, on the key storage device . The key storage device  may be a portable device such as a magnetic stripe card, USB flash drive, compact disc, mobile device, tablet, laptop computer, or a security token, such as a time-synchronized security token. The key storage device  may also be a stationary device, such as a computer server. The key storage device  may be remotely accessible in order to enable the patient  or other authorized party to remotely retrieve the key or keys.","In the event that the request for key generation was submitted electronically through requestor interface , the security clearinghouse  may, instead of directly storing the key or keys onto the key storage device , send the key or keys to the patient , covered entity , or other requestor, using a connection such as an internet connection, wireless connection, satellite connection, network connection, application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d), or any other connection accomplished using standard protocols. In that case, the recipient of the key or keys could store them as appropriate.","At step , the patient  provides the key storage device  to the covered entity , who reads the public key , private key , or both, from the storage device . For example, the patient  may provide a magnetic stripe card to covered entity , who would use a magnetic stripe card reader to read the public key , private key , or both, from the card. The covered entity  may alternatively retrieve public key  from security clearinghouse  over a connection such as an internet connection, wireless connection, satellite connection, network connection, application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d), or any other connection accomplished using standard protocols.","At step , the covered entity  collects private health information  of the patient .
