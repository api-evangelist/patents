In use, the database  may receive data streams from a plurality of hosts or applications. For example, the data streams may include any data, records, events, and\/or alerts received from the plurality of hosts. Further, the data streams may be received via an application programming interface (API), a network connection, a network socket, or any other method of communicating, the data stream from the plurality of hosts to the database. In addition, the plurality of hosts may include clients and servers. Further, these hosts may run specialized software that may collect records, detect fraud, detect intrusions, monitor security, log activity, or any other software capable of generating a data stream.","In addition, the processing system ay include a number of different operations. In one embodiment, the processing system may provide data stream filtering. For example, the data stream filtering may include filtering new data streams in order to match at least one rule. In yet another embodiment, the processing system may provide data stream regrouping. In yet another example, the data stream regrouping may regroup data from the data stream matching at least one rule into another context (e.g. time). Still yet, in another embodiment, the processing system may fire an event if there is a critical mass of waiting data. For example, the event may be fired if the mass of waiting data from the data stream exceeds a threshold.","In one embodiment, the data stream filtering is based on contexts within the data stream. Further, the contexts within the data stream may include the number of distinct appearances of a type of data in the data stream. As an example, the contexts may include a flag such as condition or state, and\/or attributes such as time, phone number, duration, session record, source host, etc. In addition, the contexts may be further divided into heavy contexts and light contexts. In one embodiment, light contexts may refer to those conditions and\/or attributes that have a few distinct appearances in the data stream. Further, in yet another embodiment, heavy contexts may refer to those conditions and\/or attributes that have numerous distinct appearances in the data stream. For example, continually incrementing timestamp data in the data stream may be a heavy context since there may be numerous distinct timestamp values in the data stream.","In still yet another embodiment, the processing system may provide filters that may act upon the contexts in the data stream. In one embodiment, the filters may include an original context filter. As an option, the original context filter may provide the original context as received in the data stream. In another embodiment, the filters may include a reduction of context filter. Optionally, the reduction of context filter may attempt to reduce the scope and\/or context of the data stream a broader context. For example, the time context in the data stream may be broadened to a context such as hours, days, months, year, date, etc. Furthermore, in the context of the current example, a heavy context such as time may be reduced to a light context such as date. Further, in yet another embodiment, the filters may include a functional transformation filter. As an option, the functional transformation filter may transform the data stream by a function of the processing system. In still yet another embodiment, the filters may include a state filter. Optionally, the state filter may filter the data stream to a matching state. For example, a data stream including phone numbers may be filtered into states such as a domestic caller, or an international caller. Additionally, in one embodiment, the processing system may be dependent upon the distribution and frequency of the contexts in the data stream for processing.","In yet another embodiment, the processing system may utilize a database  (e.g. Adjust). Further, the database  may utilize any relational database management system (RDBMS) to implement a finite state oriented system. For example, the database  may utilize a RDBMS such as MySQL\u2122 by merely mapping the database  operations into Standard Query Language (SQL) operations utilized by the RDBMS. Furthermore, by use of the SQL operations, the database  may be transparent to the underlying RDBMS. Furthermore, the database  may utilize an API for interacting with the aspects and functionality of the database .","In another embodiment, the database  may reduce the complexity of a data stream thereby simplifying the data definition and manipulation associated with the data received from the data stream. Further, as an option, the database  may utilize a cabinet that may be associated with a metadata definition. For example, the cabinet may be utilized in a physical segment of a physical table in the RDBMS and may be further associated with a particular state. In use, a change in state may be indicated by a change in the cabinet. For example, an employee record may reside in an \u2018active\u2019 cabinet while employed, a \u2018fired\u2019 cabinet if let go, or a \u2018retired\u2019 cabinet if retired. In the context of the present example, the three different cabinets may represent the different states that an employee may exist in during the lifecycle of the record. Still yet, in another embodiment, each cabinet may utilize a different set of parameters or fields that are used in that particular state.","Additionally, in one embodiment, the cabinet may include a spectrum cabinet. As an option, the spectrum cabinet may include a list of cabinets. Further, as another option, the spectrum cabinet may include a metadata definition that may not be associated with a cabinet. Further, in another embodiment, the cabinet may include a context cabinet. As yet another option, the context cabinet may include a list of cabinets. In still yet another embodiment, the cabinet may include a root cabinet. For example, another cabinet may inherit from the root cabinet.","Furthermore, in yet another embodiment, the data may not be directly inserted into the cabinet, but may instead be inserted via a discharge operation from a specialized table such as a reactor. Additionally, the cabinet may include a set of reserved fields from a previous cabinet. As an example, the set of fields may be utilized as an enumerated state field that may be represented by a field for the cabinet.","Still yet, in another embodiment, each record in the cabinet may include a header field and a body field. Further, as an option, the body field may include multiple data fields such as slots. In addition, as yet another option, the metadata definition may be utilized for mapping the slots of the body field to the actual conditions and\/or attributes utilized by other cabinets. Furthermore, in still yet another option, the header field may include additional control fields. In one embodiment, the additional control fields may be utilized for registration, state management, concurrency, identification, abstraction, and connectivity for the cabinet. In yet another embodiment, the header field may be utilized to control and operate upon the records in the cabinet. Additionally, the number of non-empty contexts for the records in a cabinet may be referred to as a cabinet mass. As an example, the cabinet mass may be increased when at least one empty context is populated for the cabinet. Further, in the context of the present example, the cabinet mass may be decreased when at least one empty context is discharged from the cabinet.","In another embodiment, the header may contain a plurality of fields such as a cabinet, registration identification (RegID), linker, link to (LinkTo), registration time (RegIime), and\/or tracker. Optionally, the cabinet field may identify the cabinet. For example, the cabinet field may consist of alpha, numeric, alphanumeric, or binary values that may identify the cabinet. Further, as an option, the RegID field may be utilized for linking records from the same cabinet or a plurality of other cabinets to the cabinet. For example, the linked records may be grouped based on a common condition and\/or attribute. In addition, as yet another option, the linker field (e.g. Linkey) may be utilized as a unique key for the cabinet. In one embodiment, the linker field may be concatenated from any of the fields in the header. In yet another embodiment, the linker field may be a match key from any field in the cabinet. Additionally, the LinkTo field may include a pointer from the record to a RegID in the same cabinet or the plurality of other cabinets. Furthermore, as an option, the RegTime field may be utilized as a field for storing the time the record was registered in the cabinet. Optionally, the tracker field (e.g. Trackey) may be utilized to store a numeric header utilized in data stream processing. Further, as yet another option, the numeric header may be hashed.","In yet another embodiment, the database  may utilize several types of tables that may be used to stored the data. As an option, the several types of tables may be associated with a metadata definition. In one embodiment, the database  may utilize a reactor table as a processing table. Optionally, the reactor table may hold the data that is being processed. As an option, the reactor table may be a temporary table. Further, as yet another option, the data in a reactor table may be dropped or inserted, into another table. In addition, in another embodiment, the data from the data stream may enter the processing system  through a reactor table of the database  such that data from the data stream may insert or update data into the reactor table for processing. In one embodiment, the reactor table may discharge the data into a data table. As another option, once all the data is discharged from the reactor table, the reactor table may be utilized to process a new data stream.","Still yet, in another embodiment, there may be several types of reactor tables (e.g. a driving reactor) that may reference a data stream and may further join with other tables via the linker field. In addition, as an option, a satellite reactor may extend the driving reactor such that each record may be a member in a cabinet with identical RegID numbers. Further, as yet another option, a resulting reactor may serve as a connecting table for the data in the driving reactor and any rules fired from a rules table (e.g. DOQMA table). Additionally, in another embodiment, the resulting reactor may be joined with the same context in a reactor table. Optionally, if the linker field is not unique for the cabinet, then one or more rules may be fired if the result is positive.","In one embodiment, the database  may utilize a data table for storing data discharged from the reactor table. Further, the data table may include the linker field that may identify the cabinet for the data. In addition, in yet another embodiment, the database  may utilize an archive table for storing historical data. Further, as an option, the archive table may be utilized to store the data associated with a unit of time. For example, the database  may have an archive table for each month of the year, such as \u2018archive1) to \u2018archive12,\u2019 in order to store historical data based on the month. As another option, the archive data may be stored in one table with the use of database partitioning. As another example, the archive table for each month of the year may be renamed in order to shift the archives back a month, thereby removing the oldest archive table and creating a new archive table. Optionally, there may be any number of archive tables and not simply the 12 iterations as disclosed in the previous examples.","Furthermore, the database  may utilize an accumulator table that may include contexts and other aggregated values. In one embodiment, the contexts of the accumulator table may be locked such that only the aggregated values may be updated. As an option, the aggregator table may collect values on the contexts. Optionally, the aggregator table may allow for joins with other tables via the linker field. Still yet, in another option, the database  may utilize a linker table that may link a plurality of header fields to fields in other tables.","Moreover, the database  may utilize a rules table where the linker field may hold a permutation of contexts associated with at least one rule. For example, each permutation of the contexts may be identified by a different cabinet identifier. In addition, in one embodiment, an additional field in the rules table may identify a rule that may be fired when a similar context is met for data from the data stream. Further, in yet another embodiment, the rules table may include a unique linker field for each cabinet that may set the context of a reactor's fields associated with the data stream (e.g. a driving reactor). Furthermore, as an option, the processing system  may be orthogonal to the number rules. For example, if a new rule includes a plurality of contexts associated with at least one existing filter, then adding a new rule to the rules table may not increase the number of contexts filtered.","In one embodiment, the tables may be joined via the linker field in several different ways. For example, the tables may be joined as a reactor table to another reactor table, a reactor table to a data table, an accumulator table to an archive table, an accumulator table to another accumulator table, etc. As an option, the tables may interact with each other by matching the linker field in a join (e.g. collision). In one example, if the reactor's cabinet, is the same as the existing cabinet, then the contexts of the cabinet may be populated or manipulated with the reference table contexts, in another example, if the reactor's cabinet is different from the existing cabinet, which may indicate a state change, then the fields in the reactor that are not active in the prior cabinet may be updated or manipulated utilizing the reference table fields.","in another embodiment, the database  may utilize several state operators for operating on the records in the tables. For example, the database  may utilize an arm operator that may occur when the linker field in the header receives a new value for the processing, cycle. As an option, for each filtering iteration, the linker field may be prepared or updated via an absolute arm operation or a relative arm operation. Further, in yet another option, the absolute arm operation may set the linker field in the header. Optionally, the relative arm operation may update the value in the linker field in the header. For example, the updating may include adding an additional context to the linker field.","Additionally, in one embodiment, the database  may utilize a disarm operator that may set the cabinet field in the header to zero. As an option, the disarm operator may represent a logical delete of the record from the table. For example, cabinet zero may have a mass of zero. In addition, as yet another option, the database  may process only those records with a non-zero value in the cabinet field. Furthermore, in another embodiment, the database  may utilize a collision operator. As an option, the collision operator may be similar to a join operator. Further, as another option, the collision may occur between two cabinets via a header field such as a linker. Moreover, as yet another option, the database  may utilize a state operator that may change the cabinet number to a non-zero value. For example, a change in state may be represented by a change in the cabinet.","In addition, in yet another embodiment, the database  may utilize a charge operator that may occur when the cabinet mass is increased. Further, as an example, the database  may utilize a discharge operator if content in a reactor table is moved to a non-reactor table within the same cabinet, thereby decreasing the mass of the reactor table. For example, the discharge operation may occur when filtered data in a reactor table is moved, to a more persistent table. Moreover, in another embodiment, the database  may utilize a de-escalate operation. As an option, the de-escalate operation may occur when contexts are copied to another reactor that thereby reduces the mass of the original reactor. For example, the de-escalated reactor may have a role in data stream filtering in combination with a light context filtering process. Additionally, in one embodiment, the database  may utilize a rolling operator to move data from one row to the following row. For example, the rolling operator may move data from the Nth row to the Nth+1 row. Furthermore, in still yet another embodiment, the database  may utilize a skip operator. Optionally, the skip operator may update a field in the header to disable joins or collisions.","In one embodiment, a reactor may be de-escalated by performing an arm operation on a header LinkTo field such that the LinkTo field may contain a hashed concatenation of light contexts of reactor R. Further, a charge operation may be performed on reactor R in order to charge the header RegID field with the value of the reactor R LinkTo field and the reactor R slots holding the distinct values of the contexts in reactor R. In addition, the reactor R may be refined with new or modified contexts. As an option, the slots of reactor R may exist with the reactor R RegID field pointing to the reactor R LinkTo field. Additionally, a state operation may be performed on the reactor R to redefine the slots moved to reactor R. Furthermore, as another option, the state operation on reactor R may free the unused slots in order for the slots to hold new contexts for future operations.","In another embodiment, the processing system may utilize a recorder  (e.g. CREAM). Optionally, the recorder  may be coupled to the database . In addition, as yet another option, the recorder  may be utilized to record information associated with the states and\/or the contexts of data in the database . For example, the recorder  may be utilized to record the states and\/or the contexts of the cabinets in the database . In yet another embodiment, the recorder  may include a plurality of nodes. As an option, the nodes may be processing nodes. Optionally, the nodes may include reactor nodes. Furthermore, as yet another option, each node of the processing nodes may process at least one state. Still yet, as another option, the recorder  may record the information for a period of time. Further, as an option, the information may be stored. Additionally, as another option, the recorder  may allow for the selection of required states and\/or contexts by the tracer .","In still yet another embodiment, the processing system may utilize a tracer  (e.g. CATAR). Optionally, the tracer  may be coupled to the database  an option, the tracer  may be utilized to select required states and contexts for tracing. Furthermore, a cabinet may be specified for use by the tracer . Optionally, the cabinet may include a regular cabinet, a spectrum cabinet, a root cabinet, and\/or a context cabinet.","Additionally, in one embodiment, a mode of interaction may be specified between a node and a request. As an option, the mode of interaction may be specified utilizing a trace form. For example, the trace form may include a cabinet controlling cabinet and\/or a context controlling cabinet. Optionally, enabling trace may include enabling a freezing mode on at least one node. Further, as another option, when a required cabinet and\/or context appears, an action may be available. Furthermore, as yet another option, when a node is frozen, the node may be waiting for the action. Optionally, when the node is frozen, other nodes may be active. Additionally, as yet another option, if another node is waiting on input from a frozen node, the node may not be active.","In one embodiment, the action may include moving, step by step to break the freezing; mode on a node. In another embodiment, the action may include enabling an inquiry to the frozen node. As yet another option, a filtering tool (e.g. DOQMA) may be utilized for filtering and\/or rules checking. Furthermore, in yet another embodiment, a stop policy may be utilized. As an option, the stop policy may proceed until a fresh occurrence of a cabinet and\/or context occurs in a node. Additionally, in still yet another embodiment, the action may include a changed mass cabinet stop action. Optionally, the changed mass cabinet stop action may indicate that the number of records within a target cabinet has increased or decreased. In one embodiment, the action may include a resume action. As an option, the resume action may indicate that the tracing may be stopped. Optionally, the resume action may indicate that the execution of the node may continue uninterrupted. Furthermore, in another embodiment, the action may include a halt action. As an option, the halt action may stop the tracing application.","in another embodiment, for each step that affects the cabinet field of a reactor, the tracing application may be activated. Optionally, the tracing application may collect data about each affected reactor. In addition, as yet another option, each cabinet matching a search list may be stored in a match reactor. Optionally, the match reactor may include two flip-flop reactors. Furthermore, as yet another option, the flip-flop reactor may be capable of storing two states.","Additionally, in yet another embodiment, if a match occurs, the tracing application may verify that a new appearance of a cabinet matching a search list has occurred since the previous match check. Still yet, as another option, the cabinet may disappear if the cabinet appeared in a previous match reactor but not in the current match reactor. As still yet another option, on a positive match, contexts of the matching cabinet may be found and saved. Furthermore, as another option, if a positive match exists, that may indicate that the required cabinet and\/or context was located.","In addition, in one embodiment, if a positive match exists, then the executing node may execute the stop policy. As an option, when the node is stopped, the node may proceed after a request, an action, and\/or a timeout. Additionally, as another option, the stop policy may stop on each following node step in order to query the node's content. For example, the node reactor content may be queried. Optionally, a trace form stop policy may be modified on each stop. As yet another option, the trace form stop policy may not be modified on a resume and\/or a halt. Furthermore, in yet another option, if a resume and\/or halt is issued, the current result of each node may be consolidated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 1-4"],"b":["500","500","500"]},"In one embodiment, a global recorder controlling, cabinet  (e.g. cabinet ) may control the global recorder.

Additionally, in another embodiment, the contexts may be shared with cabinets associated with a distinct cabinet. As an option, the context OFFER_TYPE may be associated with values such as FLAT, FAMILY, VPN, and\/or RANGED. For example, the context OFFER_TYPE may be shared with any cabinet associated with the common root cabinet (e.g. cabinet ).

As an option, the contexts may appear and\/or disappear according to an order of steps associated with the processing and\/or synchronization between operating nodes. For example, as illustrated in Table 12 above, the context WIFE_NAME may be represented as an intermediate context. Optionally, the intermediate context may not exist in a final state (e.g. persistent data cabinet ). For example, a wife cabinet (e.g. cabinet ) may be derived from a family cabinet (e.g. cabinet ) if the family cabinet includes a record with an active WIFE_NAME context.
