{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING COMPACT DISCS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["This invention relates to software and to development of such software. More particularly, this invention relates to a programming interface that facilitates use of a software platform by application programs and computer hardware.","Accompanying this specification is a set of three compact discs that stores a Software Development Kit (SDK) for the Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae Code-Named \u201cLonghorn\u201d operating system. The SDK contains documentation for the Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae Code-Named \u201cLonghorn\u201d operating system. Duplicate copies of each of these three compact discs also accompany this specification.","The first compact disc in the set of three compact discs (CD 1 of 3) includes a file folder named \u201clhsdk\u201d that was created on Oct. 22, 2003; it is 586 Mbytes in size, contains 9,692 sub-folders, and contains 44,292 sub-files. The second compact disc in the set of three compact discs (CD 2 of 3) includes a file folder named \u201cns\u201d that was created on Oct. 22, 2003; it is 605 Mbytes in size, contains 12,628 sub-folders, and contains 44,934 sub-files. The third compact disc in the set of three compact discs (CD 3 of 3) includes a file folder named \u201cns\u201d that was created on Oct. 22, 2003; it is 575 Mbytes in size, contains 9,881 sub-folders, and contains 43,630 sub-files. The files on each of these three compact discs can be executed on a Windows\u00ae-based computing device (e.g., IBM-PC, or equivalent) that executes a Windows\u00ae-brand operating system (e.g., Windows\u00ae NT, Windows\u00ae 98, Windows\u00ae 2000, Windows\u00ae XP, etc.). The files on each compact disc in this set of three compact discs are hereby incorporated by reference.","Each compact disc in the set of three compact discs itself is a CD-R, and conforms to the ISO 9660 standard. The contents of each compact disc in the set of three compact discs is in compliance with the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII).","Very early on, computer software came to be categorized as \u201coperating system\u201d software or \u201capplication\u201d software. Broadly speaking, an application is software meant to perform a specific task for the computer user such as solving a mathematical equation or supporting word processing. The operating system is the software that manages and controls the computer hardware. The goal of the operating system is to make the computer resources available to the application programmer while at the same time, hiding the complexity necessary to actually control the hardware.","The operating system makes the resources available via functions that are collectively known as the Application Program Interface or API. The term API is also used in reference to a single one of these functions. The functions are often grouped in terms of what resource or service they provide to the application programmer. Application software requests resources by calling individual API functions. API functions also serve as the means by which messages and information provided by the operating system are relayed back to the application software.","In addition to changes in hardware, another factor driving the evolution of operating system software has been the desire to simplify and speed application software development. Application software development can be a daunting task, sometimes requiring years of developer time to create a sophisticated program with millions of lines of code. For a popular operating system such as various versions of the Microsoft Windows\u00ae operating system, application software developers write thousands of different applications each year that utilize the operating system. A coherent and usable operating system base is required to support so many diverse application developers.","Often, development of application software can be made simpler by making the operating system more complex. That is, if a function may be useful to several different application programs, it may be better to write it once for inclusion in the operating system, than requiring dozens of software developers to write it dozens of times for inclusion in dozens of different applications. In this manner, if the operating system supports a wide range of common functionality required by a number of applications, significant savings in applications software development costs and time can be achieved.","Regardless of where the line between operating system and application software is drawn, it is clear that for a useful operating system, the API between the operating system and the computer hardware and application software is as important as efficient internal operation of the operating system itself.","Furthermore, most applications make use of data. This data can oftentimes change during execution of and\/or the life of the application, and is typically stored on a local device or on some remote device (e.g., a file server or other computing device on a network). Traditionally, applications have \u201cowned\u201d their own data, with each application being responsible for managing its own data (e.g., retrieving, saving, relocating, etc.) using its own formats. This traditional structure has problems, however, as it makes searching for related data across applications very difficult, if not impossible, and frequently results in similar information having to be entered in multiple places (for example, contact information may have to be entered separately into an email application, a messenger application, a phone application, a word processor, and so forth).","The inventors have developed a unique set of programming interface functions to assist in solving these problems.","A programming interface for a computer platform is described herein.","In accordance with certain aspects, the programming interface can include one or more of the following groups of types or functions: those related to core file system concepts, those related to entities that a human being can contact, those related to documents, those common to multiple kinds of media, those specific to audio media, those specific to video media, those specific to image media, those specific to electronic mail messages, and those related to identifying particular locations.","This disclosure addresses programming interfaces such as an application program interface (API) for a network platform upon which developers can build Web applications and services. More particularly, an exemplary API is described for operating systems that make use of a network platform, such as the .NET\u2122 Framework created by Microsoft Corporation. The .NET\u2122 Framework is a software platform for Web services and Web applications implemented in the distributed computing environment. It represents the next generation of Internet computing, using open communication standards to communicate among loosely coupled Web services that are collaborating to perform a particular task.","In the described implementation, the network platform utilizes XML (extensible markup language), an open standard for describing data. XML is managed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). XML is used for defining data elements on a Web page and business-to-business documents. XML uses a similar tag structure as HTML; however, whereas HTML defines how elements are displayed, XML defines what those elements contain. HTML uses predefined tags, but XML allows tags to be defined by the developer of the page. Thus, virtually any data items can be identified, allowing Web pages to function like database records. Through the use of XML and other open protocols, such as Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), the network platform allows integration of a wide range of services that can be tailored to the needs of the user. Although the embodiments described herein are described in conjunction with XML and other open standards, such are not required for the operation of the claimed invention. Other equally viable technologies will suffice to implement the inventions described herein.","As used herein, the phrase application program interface or API includes traditional interfaces that employ method or function calls, as well as remote calls (e.g., a proxy, stub relationship) and SOAP\/XML invocations.","Exemplary Network Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","1","102","104","102","104"]},"Web services  are accessible directly by other services (as represented by communication link ) or a software application, such as Web application  (as represented by communication links  and ). Each Web service  is illustrated as including one or more servers that execute software to handle requests for particular services. Such services often maintain databases that store information to be served back to requesters. Web services may be configured to perform any one of a variety of different services. Examples of Web services include login verification, notification, database storage, stock quoting, location directories, mapping, music, electronic wallet, calendar\/scheduler, telephone listings, news and information, games, ticketing, and so on. The Web services can be combined with each other and with other applications to build intelligent interactive experiences.","The network environment  also includes representative client devices (), (), (), (), . . . , (M) that utilize the Web services  (as represented by communication link ) and\/or the Web application  (as represented by communication links , , and ). The clients may communicate with one another using standard protocols as well, as represented by an exemplary XML link  between clients () and ().","The client devices, referenced generally as number , can be implemented many different ways. Examples of possible client implementations include, without limitation, portable computers, stationary computers, tablet PCs, televisions\/set-top boxes, wireless communication devices, personal digital assistants, gaming consoles, printers, photocopiers, and other smart devices.","The Web application  is an application designed to run on the network platform and may utilize the Web services  when handling and servicing requests from clients . The Web application  is composed of one or more software applications  that run atop a programming framework , which are executing on one or more servers  or other computer systems. Note that a portion of Web application  may actually reside on one or more of clients . Alternatively, Web application  may coordinate with other software on clients  to actually accomplish its tasks.","The programming framework  is the structure that supports the applications and services developed by application developers. It permits multi-language development and seamless integration by supporting multiple languages. It supports open protocols, such as SOAP, and encapsulates the underlying operating system and object model services. The framework provides a robust and secure execution environment for the multiple programming languages and offers secure, integrated class libraries.","The framework  is a multi-tiered architecture that includes an application program interface (API) layer , a common language runtime (CLR) layer , and an operating system\/services layer . This layered architecture allows updates and modifications to various layers without impacting other portions of the framework. A common language specification (CLS)  allows designers of various languages to write code that is able to access underlying library functionality. The specification  functions as a contract between language designers and library designers that can be used to promote language interoperability. By adhering to the CLS, libraries written in one language can be directly accessible to code modules written in other languages to achieve seamless integration between code modules written in one language and code modules written in another language. One exemplary detailed implementation of a CLS is described in an ECMA standard created by participants in ECMA TC39\/TG3. The reader is directed to the ECMA web site at www.ecma.ch.","The API layer  presents groups of functions that the applications  can call to access the resources and services provided by layer . By exposing the API functions for a network platform, application developers can create Web applications for distributed computing systems that make fill use of the network resources and other Web services, without needing to understand the complex interworkings of how those network resources actually operate or are made available. Moreover, the Web applications can be written in any number of programming languages, and translated into an intermediate language supported by the common language runtime  and included as part of the common language specification . In this way, the API layer  can provide methods for a wide and diverse variety of applications.","Additionally, the framework  can be configured to support API calls placed by remote applications executing remotely from the servers  that host the framework. Representative applications () and () residing on clients () and (M), respectively, can use the API functions by making calls directly, or indirectly, to the API layer  over the network .","The framework can also be implemented at the client devices . Client () represents the situation where a framework  is implemented at the client. This framework may be identical to server-based framework , or modified for client purposes. The framework  includes an API layer analogous to (or identical to) API layer  of framework . Alternatively, the client-based framework may be condensed in the event that the client is a limited or dedicated function device, such as a cellular phone, personal digital assistant, handheld computer, or other communication\/computing device.","Developers' Programming Framework",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["132","140","130","1","130","2","130","3","130","4","130","140","144","140","140","144","140","144"]},"The framework  encapsulates the operating system () (e.g., Windows\u00ae-brand operating systems) and object model services () (e.g., Component Object Model (COM) or Distributed COM). The operating system () provides conventional functions, such as file management, notification, event handling, user interfaces (e.g., windowing, menus, dialogs, etc.), security, authentication, verification, processes and threads, memory management, and so on. The object model services () provide interfacing with other objects to perform various tasks. Calls made to the API layer  are handed to the common language runtime layer  for local execution by the operating system () and\/or object model services ().","The API  groups API functions into multiple namespaces. Namespaces essentially define a collection of classes, interfaces, delegates, enumerations, and structures, which are collectively called \u201ctypes\u201d, that provide a specific set of related functionality. A class represents managed heap allocated data that has reference assignment semantics. A delegate is an object oriented function pointer. An enumeration is a special kind of value type that represents named constants. A structure represents static allocated data that has value assignment semantics. An interface defines a contract that other types can implement.","By using namespaces, a designer can organize a set of types into a hierarchical namespace. The designer is able to create multiple groups from the set of types, with each group containing at least one type that exposes logically related functionality. In the exemplary implementation, the API  is organized to include three root namespaces. It should be noted that although only three root namespaces are illustrated in , additional root namespaces may also be included in API . The three root namespaces illustrated in API  are: a first namespace  for a presentation subsystem (which includes a namespace  for a user interface shell), a second namespace  for web services, and a third namespace  for a file system. Each group can then be assigned a name. For instance, types in the presentation subsystem namespace  can be assigned the name \u201cWindows\u201d, and types in the file system namespace  can be assigned names \u201cStorage\u201d. The named groups can be organized under a single \u201cglobal root\u201d namespace for system level APIs, such as an overall System namespace. By selecting and prefixing a top level identifier, the types in each group can be easily referenced by a hierarchical name that includes the selected top level identifier prefixed to the name of the group containing the type. For instance, types in the file system namespace  can be referenced using the hierarchical name \u201cSystem.Storage\u201d. In this way, the individual namespaces , , and  become major branches off of the System namespace and can carry a designation where the individual namespaces are prefixed with a designator, such as a \u201cSystem.\u201d prefix.","The presentation subsystem namespace  pertains to programming and content development. It supplies types that allow for the generation of applications, documents, media presentations and other content. For example, presentation subsystem namespace  provides a programming model that allows developers to obtain services from the operating system () and\/or object model services ().","The shell namespace  pertains to user interface functionality. It supplies types that allow developers to embed user interface functionality in their applications, and further allows developers to extend the user interface functionality.","The web services namespace  pertains to an infrastructure for enabling creation of a wide variety of web applications, e.g. applications as simple as a chat application that operates between two peers on an intranet, and\/or as complex as a scalable Web service for millions of users. The described infrastructure is advantageously highly variable in that one need only use those parts that are appropriate to the complexity of a particular solution. The infrastructure provides a foundation for building message-based applications of various scale and complexity. The infrastructure or framework provides APIs for basic messaging, secure messaging, reliable messaging and transacted messaging. In the embodiment described below, the associated APIs have been factored into a hierarchy of namespaces in a manner that has been carefully crafted to balance utility, usability, extensibility and versionability.","The file system namespace  pertains to storage. It supplies types that allow for information storage and retrieval.","In addition to the framework , programming tools  are provided to assist the developer in building Web services and\/or applications. One example of the programming tools  is Visual Studio\u2122, a multi-language suite of programming tools offered by Microsoft Corporation.","Root API Namespaces",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["206","206","206"]},"The file system namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage\u201d), includes classes and APIs that support the file system. The file system, which may also be referred to as \u201cWinFS\u201d, is an active storage platform for organizing, searching for, and sharing all kinds of information. This platform defines a rich data model, builds on top of a relational storage engine, supports a flexible programming model, and provides a set of data services for monitoring, managing, and manipulating data. The data can be file-based or non-file data, and data is typically referred to as an \u201citem\u201d. The file system extends the functionality typically provided by file systems because it also deals with items that are non-file data, such as personal contacts, event calendars, and e-mail messages. Additional information regarding the file system can be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/646,545, filed Aug. 21, 2003, entitled \u201cSystems and Methods for Interfacing Application Programs with an Item-Based Storage Platform\u201d, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","The file system namespace  defines additional namespaces, which may also be referred to as schemas. These additional namespaces include one or more of: Synchronization namespace , Notification (or Notifications) namespace , Meta namespace , Core namespace , Base namespace , Contact (or Contacts) namespace , Document (or Documents) namespace , Media namespace , Audio namespace , Video namespace , Image (or Images) namespace , Message (or Messages) namespace , Fax namespace , Email (or Mail) namespace , Annotation (or Annotations) namespace , Note (or Notes) namespace , Program (or Programs) namespace , Explorer namespace , NaturalUI (or NaturalUserInterface) namespace , ShellTask (or ShellTasks) namespace , UserTask (or User Tasks) namespace , Help (or Assistance) namespace , Service (or Services) namespace , Location (or Locations) namespace , Principal (or Principals) namespace , Calendar (or Calendars) namespace , Watcher namespace , Interop namespace , File (or Files) namespace , GameLibrary (or GameLibraries) namespace , and CategoryHierarchy (or CategoryHierarchies) .","The file system namespace  defines a data model for the file system. The file system namespace  describes the basic conceptual structure for defining other namespaces, which are described in more detail below. The file system namespace  includes, for example, definitions of items, relationships, nested elements, extensions, and so forth.","The Synchronization namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Synchronization\u201d) defines classes and interfaces that allows data and data changes to be moved between the WinFS file system and other file systems. The functionality defined by namespace  allows, for example, data stored in formats defined by previous (legacy) file systems, databases, and other data storage structures to be represented and manipulated in the WinFS file system, thereby making the data accessible to the functionality of the other namespaces described herein. The functionality defined by namespace  further allows, for example, data stored in the WinFS file system to be represented and manipulated in other data storage structures or formats.","The Notifications (or Notification) namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Notifications\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.Notification\u201d) defines classes and interfaces that allow for the creation and management of rules. The Notifications namespace  allows rules to be defined (e.g., by applications) as well as actions to take when data events (such as the addition, modification, or deletion of data) conforming to one of the rules is detected. The file system monitors these rules for data events that conform to the rules and takes the defined actions when such data events are detected. The file system may search through data that is stored in the file system to detect data that such an event has occurred, and\/or analyze data as it is accessed (e.g., by the same application defining the rule or a different application) to detect whether operations on data conform to one or more of the rules.","The Meta namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Meta\u201d) is used to define other schemas in file system namespace  (also referred to as the other namespaces in file system namespace ). The Meta namespace  defines the overall schema or namespace of these other namespaces in namespace  in a form that allows querying (e.g., to allow applications to see what types have been installed as part of the file system). New types can be created by authoring a schema document (e.g., in an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) format, other markup language format, or other non-markup language format) and installing that schema document as part of the file system. For example, in certain embodiments the meta namespace  defines a type which may be called \u201ctype\u201d and a type which may be called \u201cproperty\u201d, with a relationship between the \u201ctype\u201d type and the \u201cproperty\u201d type that indicates which properties are found with which types. By way of another example, certain embodiments define a type which may be called \u201cschema\u201d in the meta namespace , with a relationship between the \u201ctype\u201d type and the \u201cschema\u201d type that indicates which types appear in which schemas (namespaces).","The Core namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Core\u201d) defines types that are regarded as being the core concepts behind the WinFS file system. The Core namespace  represents the core concepts that the operating system itself is expected to understand, and that are expected to be used by most other sub-namespaces -. For example, in certain embodiments the Core namespace  defines the following seven types: message (an item that represents any of a variety of different kinds of messages, such as Email messages, fax messages, and so forth), document (an item that represents content that is authored), contact (an item that represents an entity that can be contacted by a human being), event (an item that records the occurrence of something in the environment), task (an item that represents work that is done at a particular point in time or repeatedly over time, or as a result of some event other than the passage of time), device (a logical structure that supports information processing capabilities), and location (an item that represents one physical or geographic space).","The Base namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Base\u201d) defines types that form the foundation of the WinFS file system. These are the types that are typically necessary in order for the file system to operate and support the other sub-namespaces -. These types may be defined in namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Base\u201d), or alternatively in file system namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage\u201d).","As illustrated in , several additional namespaces - are also included in file system  in addition to the synchronization namespace , notifications namespace , meta namespace , core namespace , and base namespace . Each of the additional namespaces - defines a collection of related functionality. The determination of which namespace - particular functionality is to be part of is made by considering at least how tightly tied the particular functionality is to other functionality already defined in the namespaces -. Functionality that is tightly tied together is typically included in the same namespace.","An example of the logical structure of the namespaces - in file system namespace  can be seen in . Storage engine  provides the storage for the file system, and in certain embodiments storage engine  is a relational database. Base namespace  is situated on top of storage engine  along with any other types defined in file system namespace \u2014this combination may also be referred to as the data model of the file system. Core namespace  is situated on top of base namespace , and one or more of the remaining namespaces - of  are situated on top of core namespace  (these namespaces are identified as namespaces (), (), . . . , () in ). The Meta namespace  is situated to the side of namespaces , , and , as it is used to describe the types in those namespace , , and . One or more applications  sit on top of namespaces , and also on top of core namespace , base namespace , and meta namespace . Thus, applications  can access and define their own namespaces, building them on top of one or more of base namespace , core namespace , and namespaces .","Returning to , a discussion of the functionality defined in the namespaces - follows.","The Contacts (or Contact) namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Contacts\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.Contact\u201d) defines types representing entities that a human being can contact, such as people, groups, organizations, households, and so forth. The way in which such entities could be contacted can vary, such as by electronic mail address, phone number, chat address, postal address, and so forth.","The Documents (or Document) namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Documents\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.Document\u201d) defines document types that can be accessed and used by the other namespaces -. These document types refer to different document formats that can be accessed and used. Some document types may be included by default in namespace , and application designers can extend these namespace  to include different document types of their own design and\/or choosing.","The Media namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Media\u201d) defines base types used for audio, video, image, and other kinds of media. These base types are typically types that can be used by multiple kinds of media (e.g., both audio and video). These types can include, for example, types for meta data regarding the media (e.g., a history of actions taken with the media (e.g., whether it was edited, who it was sent to, etc.), a rating for the media, and so forth). Additional types specific to particular kinds of media are defined in the particular namespaces for those media (e.g., Audio namespace  and Video namespace ).","The Audio namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Audio\u201d) defines types specific to audio media. These types can include, for example, types for meta data regarding audio media (e.g., artist name, album name, and so forth).","The Video namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Video\u201d) defines types specific to video media.","The Images (or Image) namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Images\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.Image\u201d) defines types specific to image media. The Images namespace  includes types used to represent different kinds of images, such as properties of file formats for presenting images (e.g., using the GIF, TIFF, JPEG, etc. formats), or properties that represent the semantic contents of a file (e.g., photographer, people in the image, etc.).","The Message (or Messages) namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Message\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.Messages\u201d) defines types used for any kind of message, such as Email messages, Fax messages, IM (instant messaging) messages, and so forth. These types are typically types that can be used by multiple kinds of media (e.g., both Email messages and IM messages). Additional types specific to particular kinds of messages are defined in the particular namespaces for those messages (e.g., Fax namespace  and Email (or Mail) namespace ).","The Fax namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Fax\u201d) defines types specific to facsimile messages. These types can include, for example, types for details regarding transmission of facsimile messages.","The Email (or Mail) namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Email\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.Mail\u201d) defines types specific to electronic mail messages.","The Annotation (or Annotations) namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Annotation\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.Annotations\u201d) defines types used to annotate documents. An annotation describes additional information linked to one or more pieces of data. Examples of annotations include: a text bubble next to a paragraph, a highlight of some text, a margin-bar next to paragraphs, an audio comment, an ink-annotation of some text, and so forth. The Annotation namespace  allows different kinds of data to act as the annotation content, and provides a flexible mechanism to specify where the annotation is anchored. The annotation system can be, for example, the Common Annotation Framework (CAF)\u2014additional details regarding the Common Annotation Framework (CAF) are available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.","The Note (or Notes) namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Notes\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.Note\u201d) defines types for items which are notes. These notes can be, for example, Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae operating system Journal notes, electronic \u201csticky\u201d notes, and so forth.","The Programs (or Program) namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Programs\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.Program\u201d) defines types that allow a database of programs that are installed in the system to be maintained. This database can then be accessed by, for example, the operating system or other applications and information regarding programs that are installed in the system can be obtained.","The Explorer namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Explorer\u201d) defines types that allow a history list for use with the operating system to be maintained and accessed. The history list is, for example, a record of actions taken by the user, such as a record of locations in the file system that have been accessed (e.g., a list of folders that have been opened as a user navigates through the file system looking for a file).","The NaturalUI (or NaturalUserInterface) namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.NaturalUI\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.NaturalUserInterface\u201d) defines types used to support a natural language search engine. The types are used, for example, to store data regarding word equivalences, rules, and other aspects of natural language processing.","The ShellTask (or ShellTasks) namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.ShellTask\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.ShellTasks\u201d) defines types used to provide lists of tasks in the user interface shell to let users know what actions they can perform as they navigate the user interface. The functionality of the ShellTask namespace  may alternatively be incorporated into the NaturalUI namespace .","The UserTask (or UserTasks) namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.UserTask\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.UserTasks\u201d) defines types used to allow user tasks to be created and managed, including being delegated to others, accepted or rejected, modified, and so forth. The user tasks are tasks analogous to those often provided with personal information manager (PIM) applications, such as jobs to be performed, phone calls to make, projects to complete, items to purchase, and so forth. The types further allow relationships to be defined, such as a relationship between a user task and an event (the event that is supposed to initiate the task), a relationship between a user task and a message (the message that notifies or reminds the user of the task), a relationship between a user task and a person (such as the person that assigned the task, the person to which the task is assigned, and so forth).","The Help (or Assistance) namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Help\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.Assistance\u201d) defines types used to allow help information to be maintained and accessed. This help information can be displayed to the user (e.g., when requested by the user) to assist the user in performing various actions when using the system.","The Services (or Service) namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Services\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.Service\u201d) defines types that allow service endpoints to be maintained and accessed. These service endpoints allow users to use services on the local computing device or over a network, such as the Internet. For example, a service endpoint could identify a service that is to be used to allow the user to instant message another user of a different system, or chat with that other user.","The Locations (or Location) namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Locations\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.Location\u201d) defines types used to identify particular physical or geographic locations. These locations can be, for example, postal addresses or coordinates (e.g., latitude and longitude type information, Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates, and so forth). The locations can be, for example, locations of contacts described using contacts namespace .","The Principals (or Principal) namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Principals\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.Principal\u201d) defines types used to maintain information regarding security principals. A security principal refers to anything in the system that can have access rights assigned to it (e.g., an item or a resource of the system). These types in the Principals namespace  allow security principals to be identified and allow the access rights for those security principals to be identified and assigned (e.g., identifying who or what has access to the security principal).","The Calendar (or Calendars) namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Calendar\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.Calendars\u201d) defines types used to maintain and access information regarding appointments and attendees. Appointments may include, for example, information regarding time, location, recurrence, reminders, attendees, and so forth, as well as title and message body. Appointment attendees may include, for example, email address, availability, and response (e.g., whether the attendee accepted or declined the appointment).","The Watcher namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Watcher\u201d) defines types used to allow the creation and management of event monitoring and resultant actions. These types allow an interest in the occurrence of some type of event to be registered, as well as an indication of what should occur if and when that event does occur. When the specified event occurs, the specified action is taken by the system.","The Interop namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Interop\u201d) defines a set of namespaces parallel to namespaces - and - containing classes used by non-managed consumers (consumers not writing to the Common Language Runtime). For example, a \u201cSystem.Storage.Interop.Video\u201d would contain the classes related to video media that could be called from unmanaged consumers. Alternatively, such classes could live in an \u201cInterop\u201d namespace nested below each of the namespaces - and -. For example, classes related to video media that could be called from unmanaged consumers could be located in a \u201cSystem.Storage.Video.Interop\u201d namespace.","The Files (or File) namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.Files\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.File\u201d) defines types used to maintain information regarding files stored in the file system. These types can include, for example, meta data or properties regarding files stored in the file system. Alternatively, these types may be defined in the file system namespace  (that is, in the System.Storage namespace).","The GameLibrary (or GameLibraries) namespace  (\u201cSystem.Storage.GameLibrary\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.GameLibraries\u201d) defines types used to represent games that are installed in the system. These types can include, for example, meta data regarding games that are installed in the system, and types that allow querying so that applications can identify which games are installed in the system.","The CategoryHierarchy (CategoryHierarchies) namespace  (\u201cSystem. Storage.CategoryHierarchy\u201d or \u201cSystem.Storage.CategoryHierarchies\u201d) defines types used to represent and navigate hierarchical category dictionaries.","Example Namespace Members","This section includes multiple tables describing the examples of members that may be exposed by example namespaces (e.g., namespace in file system namespace  of ). These exposed members can include, for example, classes, interfaces, enumerations, and delegates. It is to be appreciated that the members described in these examples are only examples, and that alternatively other members may be exposed by the namespaces.","It should be appreciated that in some of namespace descriptions below, descriptions of certain classes, interfaces, enumerations and delegates are left blank.

The hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  are each connected to the system bus  by one or more data media interfaces . Alternatively, the hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  can be connected to the system bus  by one or more interfaces (not shown).","The disk drives and their associated computer-readable media provide non-volatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data for computer . Although the example illustrates a hard disk , a removable magnetic disk , and a removable optical disk , it is to be appreciated that other types of computer readable media which can store data that is accessible by a computer, such as magnetic cassettes or other magnetic storage devices, flash memory cards, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, random access memories (RAM), read only memories (ROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and the like, can also be utilized to implement the exemplary computing system and environment.","Any number of program modules can be stored on the hard disk , magnetic disk , optical disk , ROM , and\/or RAM , including by way of example, an operating system , one or more application programs , other program modules , and program data . Each of the operating system , one or more application programs , other program modules , and program data  (or some combination thereof) may include elements of the programming framework .","A user can enter commands and information into computer  via input devices such as a keyboard  and a pointing device  (e.g., a \u201cmouse\u201d). Other input devices  (not shown specifically) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, serial port, scanner, and\/or the like. These and other input devices are connected to the processing unit  via input\/output interfaces  that are coupled to the system bus , but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port, or a universal serial bus (USB).","A monitor  or other type of display device can also be connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor , other output peripheral devices can include components such as speakers (not shown) and a printer  which can be connected to computer  via the input\/output interfaces .","Computer  can operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computing device . By way of example, the remote computing device  can be a personal computer, portable computer, a server, a router, a network computer, a peer device or other common network node, and so on. The remote computing device  is illustrated as a portable computer that can include many or all of the elements and features described herein relative to computer .","Logical connections between computer  and the remote computer  are depicted as a local area network (LAN)  and a general wide area network (WAN) . Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets, and the Internet.","When implemented in a LAN networking environment, the computer  is connected to a local network  via a network interface or adapter . When implemented in a WAN networking environment, the computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the wide network . The modem , which can be internal or external to computer , can be connected to the system bus  via the input\/output interfaces  or other appropriate mechanisms. It is to be appreciated that the illustrated network connections are exemplary and that other means of establishing communication link(s) between the computers  and  can be employed.","In a networked environment, such as that illustrated with computing environment , program modules depicted relative to the computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in a remote memory storage device. By way of example, remote application programs  reside on a memory device of remote computer . For purposes of illustration, application programs and other executable program components such as the operating system are illustrated herein as discrete blocks, although it is recognized that such programs and components reside at various times in different storage components of the computing device , and are executed by the data processor(s) of the computer.","An implementation of the framework  and\/or , and particularly, the API included in the framework  and\/or  or calls made to the API included in the framework  and\/or , may be stored on or transmitted across some form of computer readable media. Computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, computer readable media may comprise \u201ccomputer storage media\u201d and \u201ccommunications media.\u201d \u201cComputer storage media\u201d include volatile and non-volatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data.

By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared, and other wireless media. Combinations of any of the above are also included within the scope of computer readable media.","Alternatively, portions of the framework may be implemented in hardware or a combination of hardware, software, and\/or firmware. For example, one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or programmable logic devices (PLDs) could be designed or programmed to implement one or more portions of the framework.","A programming interface (or more simply, interface) may be viewed as any mechanism, process, protocol for enabling one or more segment(s) of code to communicate with or access the functionality provided by one or more other segment(s) of code. Alternatively, a programming interface may be viewed as one or more mechanism(s), method(s), function call(s), module(s), object(s), etc. of a component of a system capable of communicative coupling to one or more mechanism(s), method(s), function call(s), module(s), etc. of other component(s). The term \u201csegment of code\u201d in the preceding sentence is intended to include one or more instructions or lines of code, and includes, e.g., code modules, objects, subroutines, functions, and so on, regardless of the terminology applied or whether the code segments are separately compiled, or whether the code segments are provided as source, intermediate, or object code, whether the code segments are utilized in a runtime system or process, or whether they are located on the same or different machines or distributed across multiple machines, or whether the functionality represented by the segments of code are implemented wholly in software, wholly in hardware, or a combination of hardware and software.","Notionally, a programming interface may be viewed generically, as shown in  or .  illustrates an interface Interface as a conduit through which first and second code segments communicate.  illustrates an interface as comprising interface objects I and I (which may or may not be part of the first and second code segments), which enable first and second code segments of a system to communicate via medium M. In the view of , one may consider interface objects I and I as separate interfaces of the same system and one may also consider that objects I and I plus medium M comprise the interface. Although  show bi-directional flow and interfaces on each side of the flow, certain implementations may only have information flow in one direction (or no information flow as described below) or may only have an interface object on one side. By way of example, and not limitation, terms such as application programming or program interface (API), entry point, method, function, subroutine, remote procedure call, and component object model (COM) interface, are encompassed within the definition of programming interface.","Aspects of such a programming interface may include the method whereby the first code segment transmits information (where \u201cinformation\u201d is used in its broadest sense and includes data, commands, requests, etc.) to the second code segment; the method whereby the second code segment receives the information; and the structure, sequence, syntax, organization, schema, timing and content of the information. In this regard, the underlying transport medium itself may be unimportant to the operation of the interface, whether the medium be wired or wireless, or a combination of both, as long as the information is transported in the manner defined by the interface. In certain situations, information may not be passed in one or both directions in the conventional sense, as the information transfer may be either via another mechanism (e.g. information placed in a buffer, file, etc. separate from information flow between the code segments) or non-existent, as when one code segment simply accesses functionality performed by a second code segment. Any or all of these aspects may be important in a given situation, e.g., depending on whether the code segments are part of a system in a loosely coupled or tightly coupled configuration, and so this list should be considered illustrative and non-limiting.","This notion of a programming interface is known to those skilled in the art and is clear from the foregoing detailed description of the invention. There are, however, other ways to implement a programming interface, and, unless expressly excluded, these too are intended to be encompassed by the claims set forth at the end of this specification. Such other ways may appear to be more sophisticated or complex than the simplistic view of , but they nonetheless perform a similar function to accomplish the same overall result. We will now briefly describe some illustrative alternative implementations of a programming interface.","A. Factoring","A communication from one code segment to another may be accomplished indirectly by breaking the communication into multiple discrete communications. This is depicted schematically in . As shown, some interfaces can be described in terms of divisible sets of functionality. Thus, the interface functionality of  may be factored to achieve the same result, just as one may mathematically provide 24, or 2 times 2 times 3 times 2. Accordingly, as illustrated in , the function provided by interface Interface may be subdivided to convert the communications of the interface into multiple interfaces InterfaceA, Interface B, Interface C, etc. while achieving the same result. As illustrated in , the function provided by interface I may be subdivided into multiple interfaces I, I, I, etc. while achieving the same result. Similarly, interface I of the second code segment which receives information from the first code segment may be factored into multiple interfaces I, I, I, etc. When factoring, the number of interfaces included with the 1code segment need not match the number of interfaces included with the 2code segment. In either of the cases of , the functional spirit of interfaces Interface and I remain the same as with , respectively. The factoring of interfaces may also follow associative, commutative, and other mathematical properties such that the factoring may be difficult to recognize. For instance, ordering of operations may be unimportant, and consequently, a function carried out by an interface may be carried out well in advance of reaching the interface, by another piece of code or interface, or performed by a separate component of the system. Moreover, one of ordinary skill in the programming arts can appreciate that there are a variety of ways of making different function calls that achieve the same result.","B. Redefinition","In some cases, it may be possible to ignore, add or redefine certain aspects (e.g., parameters) of a programming interface while still accomplishing the intended result. This is illustrated in . For example, assume interface Interface of  includes a function call Square(input, precision, output), a call that includes three parameters, input, precision and output, and which is issued from the 1Code Segment to the 2Code Segment. If the middle parameter precision is of no concern in a given scenario, as shown in , it could just as well be ignored or even replaced with a meaningless (in this situation) parameter. One may also add an additional parameter of no concern. In either event, the functionality of square can be achieved, so long as output is returned after input is squared by the second code segment. Precision may very well be a meaningful parameter to some downstream or other portion of the computing system; however, once it is recognized that precision is not necessary for the narrow purpose of calculating the square, it may be replaced or ignored. For example, instead of passing a valid precision value, a meaningless value such as a birth date could be passed without adversely affecting the result. Similarly, as shown in , interface I is replaced by interface I\u2032, redefined to ignore or add parameters to the interface. Interface I may similarly be redefined as interface I\u2032, redefined to ignore unnecessary parameters, or parameters that may be processed elsewhere. The point here is that in some cases a programming interface may include aspects, such as parameters, that are not needed for some purpose, and so they may be ignored or redefined, or processed elsewhere for other purposes.","C. Inline Coding","It may also be feasible to merge some or all of the functionality of two separate code modules such that the \u201cinterface\u201d between them changes form. For example, the functionality of  may be converted to the functionality of , respectively. In , the previous 1and 2Code Segments of  are merged into a module containing both of them. In this case, the code segments may still be communicating with each other but the interface may be adapted to a form which is more suitable to the single module. Thus, for example, formal Call and Return statements may no longer be necessary, but similar processing or response(s) pursuant to interface Interface may still be in effect. Similarly, shown in , part (or all) of interface I from  may be written inline into interface I to form interface I\u2033. As illustrated, interface  is divided into Iand I, and interface portion Ihas been coded in-line with interface I to form interface I\u2033. For a concrete example, consider that the interface I from  performs a function call square (input, output), which is received by interface I, which after processing the value passed with input (to square it) by the second code segment, passes back the squared result with output. In such a case, the processing performed by the second code segment (squaring input) can be performed by the first code segment without a call to the interface.","D. Divorce","A communication from one code segment to another may be accomplished indirectly by breaking the communication into multiple discrete communications. This is depicted schematically in . As shown in , one or more piece(s) of middleware (Divorce Interface(s), since they divorce functionality and\/or interface functions from the original interface) are provided to convert the communications on the first interface, Interface, to conform them to a different interface, in this case interfaces InterfaceA, InterfaceB and InterfaceC. This might be done, e.g., where there is an installed base of applications designed to communicate with, say, an operating system in accordance with an Interface protocol, but then the operating system is changed to use a different interface, in this case interfaces InterfaceA, InterfaceB and InterfaceC. The point is that the original interface used by the 2Code Segment is changed such that it is no longer compatible with the interface used by the 1Code Segment, and so an intermediary is used to make the old and new interfaces compatible. Similarly, as shown in , a third code segment can be introduced with divorce interface DI to receive the communications from interface I and with divorce interface DI to transmit the interface functionality to, for example, interfaces Iand I, redesigned to work with DI, but to provide the same functional result. Similarly, DI and DI may work together to translate the functionality of interfaces I and  of  to a new operating system, while providing the same or similar functional result.","E. Rewriting","Yet another possible variant is to dynamically rewrite the code to replace the interface functionality with something else but which achieves the same overall result. For example, there may be a system in which a code segment presented in an intermediate language (e.g. Microsoft IL, Java ByteCode, etc.) is provided to a Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler or interpreter in an execution environment (such as that provided by the Net framework, the Java runtime  environment, or other similar runtime type environments). The JIT compiler may be written so as to dynamically convert the communications from the 1Code Segment to the 2Code Segment, i.e., to conform them to a different interface as may be required by the 2Code Segment (either the original or a different 2Code Segment). This is depicted in . As can be seen in , this approach is similar to the Divorce scenario described above. It might be done, e.g., where an installed base of applications are designed to communicate with an operating system in accordance with an Interface  protocol, but then the operating system is changed to use a different interface. The JIT Compiler could be used to conform the communications on the fly from the installed-base applications to the new interface of the operating system. As depicted in , this approach of dynamically rewriting the interface(s) may be applied to dynamically factor, or otherwise alter the interface(s) as well.","It is also noted that the above-described scenarios for achieving the same or similar result as an interface via alternative embodiments may also be combined in various ways, serially and\/or in parallel, or with other intervening code. Thus, the alternative embodiments presented above are not mutually exclusive and may be mixed, matched and combined to produce the same or equivalent scenarios to the generic scenarios presented in . It is also noted that, as with most programming constructs, there are other similar ways of achieving the same or similar functionality of an interface which may not be described herein, but nonetheless are represented by the spirit and scope of the invention, i.e., it is noted that it is at least partly the functionality represented by, and the advantageous results enabled by, an interface that underlie the value of an interface.","Although the invention has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the invention defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described.
