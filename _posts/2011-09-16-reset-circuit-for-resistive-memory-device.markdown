{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-212626, filed Sep. 22, 2010, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Embodiments described herein relate generally to a nonvolatile semiconductor memory device and a method of controlling the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device.","In recent years, an attempt has been made to further miniaturize a nonvolatile semiconductor memory device with memory elements each composed of a MOS transistor with a floating gate and to make higher the capacity of the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device. To realize the miniaturization and higher capacity, a next-generation nonvolatile semiconductor memory device using new materials and a different operating principle is being developed. A resistance-change memory has been considered as such a next generation nonvolatile semiconductor memory device.","A magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) using a tunnel magnetoresistive effect produced by a magnetic tunnel junction, a phase-change random access memory (PRAM) making use of the fact that a chalcogenide semiconductor phase-transits from a crystal phase to an amorphous phase or vice versa by Joule heat produced by current and the resistance in one phase differs greatly from that in the other phase, and the like have been developed. In addition, the development of new memories using other resistance-change materials and operating principles is on the rise. Those memories are generically called resistive random access memories (ReRAMs).","In general, according to one embodiment, a nonvolatile semiconductor memory device comprises a memory cell which includes a variable resistance element and a current-limiting element that has a nonlinear current-voltage characteristic and a driver which changes the resistance of the variable resistance element by causing a first current to flow in the memory cell. In addition, the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device further comprises a detection module which detects a change in the resistance of the memory cell based on the magnitude of the first current and a current supplying module which causes a second current to flow in the detection module in place of the first current.","Hereinafter, an embodiment will be explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.","The embodiment explained below is related to an ReRAM which uses a variable resistance element as a memory element. Here, a variable resistance element is an element made of a material whose resistance varies with voltage, current, heat, or the like.","In this specification, for example, metallic oxide, a metallic compound, an organic thin film, carbon, a carbon nanotube, or the like is prepared as the variable resistance element. They are elements whose resistance can be electrically changed reversibly.","Here, one method of changing the resistance of a memory element is to change the resistance of a memory element at least between a first value and a second value in a reversible manner by controlling the magnitude of voltage or current and the applying time without changing the polarity of the voltage applied to the memory element. Another method of changing the resistance of a memory element is to change the resistance of a memory element at least between a first value and a second value in a reversible manner by changing the polarity of the voltage applied to the memory element. The former is called a unipolar operation and the latter is called a bipolar operation.","(1) Overall View",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","2","3","4","6","7","8","9","10"]},"The resistance-change memory  receives a control signal and data from an external host  and operates according to the control signal and data. While in the embodiment, the host  is located outside the resistance-change memory , it may be provided inside the resistance-change memory .","The cross-point memory cell array  is configured to have a stack structure composed of a plurality of memory cell arrays. The cross-point type means a structure where memory cells are formed at the intersections of a plurality of interconnections arranged in parallel and another plurality of interconnections arranged in parallel so as to cross the interconnections at right angles in multiple levels. A memory cell of the embodiment includes a variable resistance element. The memory cell holds data, depending on whether the variable resistance element holds either a low-resistance state or a high-resistance state. The structure of the memory cell will be described later.","The first control circuit  is arranged to one end side of the cross-point memory cell array  in a first direction. The second control circuit  is arranged to one end side of the cross-point memory cell array  in a second direction perpendicular to the first direction.","The first and second control circuits ,  select at least one of the memory cell arrays stacked one on top of another on the basis of, for example, a memory cell array selection signal.","The first control signal  selects a row in the cross-point memory cell array  on the basis of, for example, a row address signal. The second control signal , which includes a resistance-change detection circuit, selects a column in the cross-point memory cell array  on the basis of, for example, a column address signal.","The first and second control circuits ,  control the writing\/reading of data into\/from a memory element in the cross-point memory cell array .","The first and second control circuits ,  can write\/read data into\/from one of the stacked memory cell arrays. In addition, the first and second control circuits ,  can write\/read data into\/from at least two or all of the stacked memory cell arrays simultaneously.","In writing data into a memory cell, the first and second control circuits ,  change the memory cell from the high-resistance state to the low-resistance state or vice versa. Hereinafter, the operation of changing the memory cell from the high-resistance state to the low-resistance state is called a SET and the operation of changing the memory cell from the low-resistance state to the high-resistance state is called a RESET. In a SET and a RESET, if the voltage or the direction of current is the same, the operation is called a unipolar operation. In a SET and a REST, if the voltage or the direction of current is reversed, the operation is called a bipolar operation. The resistance in a SET state has only to differ from that in a RESET state.","If in a SET operation, one of a plurality of resistances is configured to be selectively written, a multilevel resistance-change memory where a memory element stores multilevel data can be realized.","The command interface circuit  determines on the basis of a control signal whether data from the host  is command data. If the data is command data, the command interface circuit  transfers the data from the data input\/output buffer  to the state machine .","The state machine  manages the operation of the entire resistance-change memory  according to the command data. For example, the state machine  manages a set\/reset operation and a read operation on the basis of the command data from the host . The host  can receive status information managed by the state machine  and make a determination on the operation result of the resistance-change memory.","The address buffer  receives an address signal from the host  in a set\/reset operation and a read operation. The address signal includes, for example, a memory cell array selection signal, a row address signal, and a column address signal. The address signal is input to the first and second control circuits ,  via the address buffer .","The pulse generator  outputs, for example, a voltage pulse or a current pulse necessary for a set\/reset operation and a read operation on the basis of an instruction from the state machine .","(2) Memory Cell Array","Next, the configuration of the cross-point memory cell array  will be explained with reference to .  is a perspective view of the cross-point memory cell array .","As shown in , the cross-point memory cell array  is provided over a semiconductor substrate (e.g., a silicon substrate) .

Signal BLSELm is applied to the gate terminal of transistor MNm. Bit line BLm is connected to the source terminal of transistor MNm. The drain terminal of transistor MNm is connected to the driver . Signal BLSELm is a bit line selection signal and rises to a high voltage VHH according to an externally input address. At the high voltage VHH, signal BLSELm allows voltage VRESET from the driver  to be applied to bit line BLm.","At the start of a RESET operation, all the word lines are set to a voltage higher than the bit line voltage so as to prevent current from flowing between the word lines and the selected bit line. All the word lines may be lowered in voltage from the bit line voltage in a leakage allowable range. At the time when the selected bit line BLm has reached voltage VRESET, the selected word line WLn is set to 0 V and cell current icell flows in the selected memory cell.","The driver  comprises an operational amplifier and transistors MP to MP, p-type MOSFETs.","A voltage at the source terminal of transistor MP is input to the noninverting input (+) of the operational amplifier and voltage VCLAMP is input to the inverting input (\u2212) of the operational amplifier . Voltage VCLAMP, which is a clamp voltage of the bit line, is set to a specific voltage VRESET. Suppose voltage VRESET is a sufficient voltage to cause RESET current to flow in the selected low-resistance memory cell. When voltage VCLAMP has been set to voltage VRESET, the output terminal of the operational amplifier outputs to the gate terminal of transistor MP such a voltage as makes the voltage of bit line BLm equal to voltage VRESET.","The output terminal of the operational amplifier is connected to the gate terminal of transistor MP. Node N to which voltage VHH is applied is connected to the drain terminal of transistor MP. The output terminal of the operational amplifier is connected to the gate terminal of transistor MP. Node N to which voltage VHH is applied is connected to the drain terminal of transistor MP.","The drain terminal of transistor MP is connected to the source terminal of transistor MP. The source terminal of transistor MP is connected to the drain terminal of transistor MNm and the operational amplifier . The source terminal of transistor MP is connected to the gate terminal of transistor M. The drain terminal of transistor MP is connected to the source terminal of transistor MP. The source terminal of transistor MP is connected to the detection module . The source terminal of transistor MP is connected to the gate terminal of transistor MP. Transistor MP and transistor MP form a current mirror.","The detection module  comprises transistors NM to MN, n-type MOSFETs, transistors MP, MP, p-type MOSFETs, and a computation unit , a NAND gate.","Node N to which voltage VDD is applied is connected to the drain terminals of transistors MP, MP. The source terminal of transistor MP is connected to the gate terminals of transistors MP, MP.","The drain terminal of transistor MN is connected to the source terminal of transistor MP. The gate terminal of transistor MN is connected to the source terminal of transistor MP. The drain terminal of transistor MN is connected to the source terminal of transistor MP. The gate terminal of transistor MN is connected to the source terminal of transistor MP. Transistor MN and transistor MN form a current mirror.","The drain terminal of transistor MN is connected to the source terminal of transistor MP. The source terminal of transistor MN is connected to the ground. A voltage node is connected to the gate terminal of transistor MN. Voltage VIREF_RESET is applied to the gate terminal of transistor MN. The drain terminal of transistor MN is connected to the source terminal of transistor MN. The source terminal of transistor MN is connected to the ground. A voltage node is connected to the gate terminal of transistor MN. Signal DET is applied to the gate terminal of transistor MN. The drain terminal of transistor MN is connected to the source terminal of transistor MN. The source terminal of transistor MN is connected to the ground. A voltage node is connected to the gate terminal of transistor MN. Signal DET is applied to the gate terminal of transistor MN.","The drain voltage VOUT of transistor MN and signal DET are input to the computation unit , which ANDs these voltages. According to the computation result, the computation module outputs a signal DETECT with an amplitude of 0 V to VDD. The voltage VOUT corresponds the result of comparing cell current icell and reference current IREF_RESET to determine which one of them carries a larger current.","The VIREF_RESET bias generator circuit comprises transistor MN and a current source as shown in . The drain terminal of transistor MN is connected to the current source. The drain terminal and gate terminal of transistor MN are connected to each other. The source terminal of transistor MN is grounded. The current source generates current IREF_RESET and causes this current to flow in the drain of transistor MN. The gate voltage of transistor MN is output as voltage VIREF_RESET.","Since voltage VIREF_RESET is applied to the gate of transistor MN, transistor MN also allows reference current IREF_RESET to flow as described above. As a result, reference current IREF_RESET is also allowed to flow through the drain terminal of transistor MN. If cell current icell is larger than reference current IREF_RESET, voltage VOUT drops. If cell current icell is smaller than reference current IREF_RESET, voltage VOUT rises.","Next, a comparative example of a RESET operation will be explained roughly with reference to .  is a timing chart for the resistance-change detection circuit  shown in . The horizontal axis represents elapsed time.","During standby time until time t, selected word line WLn and selected bit line BLm are in an unselected state. Although reference current IREF_RESET is supplied to the drain of transistor MN, voltage VOUT remains high because cell current icell does not flow.","At time t, signal BLSELm at the gate of transistor MNm is made high, making the voltage of the selected word line WLn high.","At time t, the voltage of the selected bit line BLm is made high. Since the voltage of the selected word line WLn is high, no current flows in the selected memory cell.","At time t, the voltage of the selected word line WLn is made low (0 V), allowing cell current icell to begin to flow in the selected memory cell. At this time, signal DET is changed from low (0 V) to high (VDD) to cause a current equal to cell current icell flowing in transistor MP to flow in transistor MP, transistor MN, and transistor MN. At this time, a mirrored cell current icell flows in transistor MN and becomes larger than reference current IREF_RESET, which causes voltage VOUT to fall. However, voltage VOUT does not become stable until time t. Therefore, the selected word line WLn is activated. Immediately after cell current icell has begun to flow, it is necessary to wait for the state of the resistance-change detection circuit  to become stable.","At time t, signal DET is changed from the low level to the high level after the time that voltage VOUT has become stable at the low level.","At time t, the resistance of the selected memory cell changes from the low-resistance state to the high-resistance state and cell current Icell varies. Here, cell current Icell becomes smaller than reference current IREF_RESET.","At time t, mirror current of cell current icell flowing in transistor MN becomes smaller than reference current IREF_RESET, causing voltage VOUT to change from the low level to the high level. Both signal DET and voltage VOUT go high, causing the computation unit to output signal DETECT at a high level. Therefore, at time t, a circuit (not shown) lowers the voltage of the selected bit line BLm to 0 V, preventing a voltage from being applied to the selected memory cell.","The resistance-change detection circuit  might cause the following problem. To detect cell current icell accurately, it is necessary to wait for a specific time until voltage VOUT becomes stable to raise signal DET from the low level to the high level. The time required for voltage VOUT to become stable is a hundred nanoseconds to several hundreds of nanoseconds, depending on the reset current or bit voltage. During that time, the cell current continues flowing. The reset time needed by the variable resistance element  used in a memory cell varies according to materials and conditions for a set operation when the variable resistance element has transitioned to the low-resistance state.","In the comparative example, the selected memory cell changes from the low-resistance state to the high-resistance state after voltage VOUT has become stable. However, it is known that the reset time is sometimes 50 nanoseconds or shorter. That is, the selected memory cell might change from the low-resistance state to the high-resistance state before the stabilization time of voltage VOUT has elapsed. This is called SET disturb after RESET, which is caused as a result of a voltage kept applied to the memory cell even after the memory cell has changed from the low-resistance state to the high-resistance state when RESET current was caused to flow in the memory cell. In this way, when the voltage is kept applied to the selected memory cell until voltage VOUT has become stable, this might permit the memory cell selected by the disturb to change again from the high-resistance state to the low-resistance state. Therefore, it is difficult to perform a stable RESET operation.","(5) Second Control Circuit  of the Embodiment","Next, a resistance-change detection circuit  included in the second control circuit  according to the embodiment will be explained in detail with reference to .  is a circuit diagram schematically showing a basic configuration of the resistance-change detection circuit  of the embodiment.  is a circuit diagram schematically showing a basic configuration of a VIREF_RESET bias generator circuit and a VDMY bias generator circuit according to the embodiment. The VIREF_RESET bias generator circuit and VDMY bias generator circuit may be included in the second control circuit  or provided outside the second control circuit and inside the memory .","As shown in , the resistance-change detection circuit  comprises a driver  connected to the memory cell array , a detection module  connected to the driver , and a dummy current module (a current supplying module)  connected to the driver . That is, the resistance-change detection circuit  is so configured that the dummy current module  is added to the resistance-change detection circuit  in the comparative example. The remaining configuration and basic operation are the same as described above. Therefore, a detailed explanation of them will be omitted.","The dummy current module  comprises transistors MN and MN, n-type MOSFETs, and a computation unit ","The drain terminal of transistor MN is connected to the source terminal of transistor MP. A voltage node is connected to the gate terminal of transistor MN. Voltage VDMY is applied to the gate terminal of transistor MN. The drain terminal of transistor MN is connected to the source terminal of transistor MN. The source terminal of transistor MN is connected to the ground. A voltage node is connected to the gate terminal of transistor MN. Voltage DETA is applied to the gate terminal of transistor MN. Transistor MN and transistor MN form a current mirror.","Signal DET and inverted signal DET are input to the computation unit , which ANDs these signals. According to the computational result, the computation unit outputs signal DETA with an amplitude of 0 V to VDD.","The VDMY bias generator circuit comprises transistor MN and a current source as shown in . Transistor MN has its drain terminal connected to the current source, its drain terminal and gate terminal connected to each other, and its source terminal grounded. The current source generates dummy current idummy and causes the dummy current to flow in the drain of transistor MN. The gate voltage of transistor MN is output as voltage VDMY. Dummy current idummy, which is larger than reference current IREF_RESET, is set to, for example, an integer multiple of reference current IREF_RESET and functions as a dummy of cell current. Dummy current idummy does not exceed the maximum cell current icell in the low-resistance state. Here, the maximum cell current in the low-resistance state is a statistical value of a cell current that varies from cell to cell.","The detection module  comprises transistor MN that receives current corresponding to cell current icell and transistor MN that forms a current mirror circuit together with transistor MN and is connected to an output node of the detection module . When the dummy current module  supplies dummy current idummy, transistor MN receives dummy current idummy in place of cell current icell. The driver  comprises transistor MP that supplies cell current icell to memory cell CUs and transistor MP that forms a current mirror circuit together with transistor MP and supplies cell current icell. The dummy current module  includes transistor MP that supplies dummy current idummy. Transistor MN of the detection module  receives cell current icell. When transistor MP of the dummy current module  is turned on, dummy current idummy is caused to flow in transistor MP.","(6) Operation","Next, an operation of the resistance-change memory will be explained with reference to .","(6-1) Summary of Operation","First, a data read operation of the variable resistance element  will be explained briefly. A data read operation is performed by applying, for example, a read voltage (Vread) pulse to the selected variable resistance element  and detecting a current determined by the resistance of the variable resistance element . The voltage pulse preferably has such a small amplitude that prevents the material of the variable resistance element  from changing its state.","This is done by applying, for example, a read voltage from bit line BL to the selected memory cell and measuring the current at that time with a sense amplifier.","Next, a data write operation of the variable resistance element  will be explained briefly.","The variable resistance element  can be caused to transition to the low-resistance state (LRS) by applying a set voltage (Vset) pulse to the variable resistance element  in the high-resistance state (HRS). Causing the variable resistance element  to transition from the high-resistance state to the low-resistance state is called SET.","In addition, the variable resistance element  can be caused to transition to the high-resistance state, a written state, by applying a reset (Vreset) pulse to the variable resistance element  in the low-resistance state. Causing the variable resistance element  to transition from the low-resistance state to the high-resistance state is called RESET.","In the embodiment, data is recorded in two levels, provided that the variable resistance element  in the low-resistance state is set as a \u201c1\u201d written state and the variable resistance element  in the high-resistance state is set as a \u201c0\u201d written state. In addition, let the resistance of the variable resistance element  in the low-resistance state be Ron and the resistance of the variable resistance element  in the high-resistance state be Roff. Roff is more than three times higher in resistance than Ron. In RESET, when the variable resistance element  changes from the low-resistance state to the high-resistance state, the bit line current decreases accordingly. Whether \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d are allocated to either the low-resistance state or the high-resistance state is arbitrary.","(6-2) Details Of Operation","Next, a RESET operation in the embodiment will be explained in detail with reference to , particularly centering on the operation of the resistance-change detection circuit .  is a timing chart showing variations in voltage v(BLSEL) of signal BLSEL, voltage v(WLn) of word line WLn and voltage v(BLm) of bit line BLm, cell current icell, voltage v(DET) of signal DET, voltage v(DET) of signal DET, and voltage v(DETA) of signal DETA, dummy current idummy, output voltage VOUT, and voltage v(DETECT) of signal DETECT with respect to time in the resistance-change detection circuit  shown in . The horizontal axis represents elapsed time.","During standby until time t, the selected word line WLn and selected bit line BLm are unselected. Although reference current IREF_RESET is supplied to the drain of transistor MN, voltage VOUT is high because cell current icell does not flow. Voltage VDMY is supplied to the gate terminal of transistor MN.","At time t, the second control circuit  makes signal BLSEL at the gate of transistor MNm high (VHH). The first control circuit  makes the voltage v(WLn) of the selected word line WLn high.","At time t, the second control circuit , more specifically, the driver , makes voltage v(BLm) of the selected bit line BLm high. Here, although the bit line has risen to the VRESET level, no current flows in the selected memory cell because the voltage of the selected word line WLn is high. At the same time, for example, the state machine  raises signal DET from the low level to the high level (VDD). Therefore, transistor MN and transistor MN are turned on. At this time, the state machine  sets the voltage of signal DET at the low level (0 V). Accordingly, the output DETA of the computation unit is at the high level (VDD). Therefore, transistor MN is turned on, causing dummy current idummy to flow in transistor MN.","Here, transistor MN, together with transistor MN, forms a current mirror. Therefore, a current similar to dummy current idummy flows in transistor MN. In addition, a current similar to dummy current idummy also flows in transistor MN constituting a current mirror together with transistor MN.","Voltage VOUT fluctuates, depending on whether reference current IREF_RESET is larger than dummy current idummy or vice versa in the drain of transistor MN. Specifically, when dummy current idummy is larger than reference current IREF_RESET, transistors MN, MN cause voltage VOUT to fall. When dummy current idummy is smaller than reference current IREF_RESET, the drain terminal of transistor MN is connected electrically to VDD via transistor MP, raising voltage VOUT.","With the VIREF_RESET bias generator circuit and VDMY bias generator circuit according to the embodiment, dummy current idummy is set so as to be larger than reference current IREF_RESET. Therefore, at time t, voltage VOUT falls. However, until time t, voltage VOUT does not become stable. Dummy current idummy, which is set to an integer multiple of reference current IREF_RESET, functions as a dummy of cell current. The time from the rising of DET to the falling of the selected word line can be secured as long as the time required to stabilize voltage VOUT.","At time t, signal DET is raised from the low level to the high level. Then, since signal DET is high and signal DET is high (VDD) (which is inverted, producing the low level), the computation unit outputs a low-level (or 0-V) signal DETA. This turns off transistor MN, preventing dummy current idummy from being supplied.","Then, the first control circuit  sets the voltage of the selected word line WLn to the low level (0 V), activating the selected word line WLn, which causes cell current icell to start to flow in the selected memory cell. At this time, for example, the state machine  raises signal DET from the low level (0 V) to the high level (VDD) to cause a current equal to cell current icell flowing in transistor MP to flow in transistor MP, transistor MN, and transistor MN. At this time, the mirrored cell current icell flows in transistor MN, exceeding reference current IREF_RESET, which lowers voltage VOUT.","At this time, since dummy current idummy is flowing in transistor MN before the supply of cell current icell, voltage VOUT is almost stable. Therefore, the selected word line WLn is activated. Immediately after cell current icell starts to flow, the computation unit can detect a change in the cell current icell (a change in voltage VOUT).","At time t, the resistance of the selected memory cell changes from the low to high, changing cell current icell. Here, cell current icell becomes smaller than reference current IREF_RESET, changing voltage VOUT from the low level to the high level.","At time t, signal DET and voltage VOUT both go high, causing the computation unit to output signal DETECT at a high level. Therefore, a circuit (not shown) lowers the voltage of the selected bit line BLm to 0 V, applying no voltage to the selected memory cell.","(7) Effects of the Embodiment","As described above, the configuration of the embodiment produces the effect of suppressing the application of a voltage to the selected memory cell even after the resistive state of the memory cell has changed. This will be explained in detail below.","In the embodiment, the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device comprises a memory cell array  where memory cells CUs, each including a variable resistance element  and a current-limiting element (diode)  that has a nonlinear current-voltage characteristic, are arranged in a matrix, a driver  that changes the resistance of the variable resistance element  by causing cell current icell to flow in a memory cell CUs, a detection module  that detects a change in the resistance of a memory cell CUs on the basis of the magnitude of current, and a dummy current module  that causes dummy current idummy different from cell current icell to flow in the detection module  in place of cell current icell.","The detection module  compares reference current IREF_RESET with cell current icell. If cell current icell has become smaller than reference current IREF_RESET, the driver  is caused to stop the supply of cell current icell.","The embodiment comprises a current path composed of transistor MN, an n-type MOSFET, connected to the driver , a VDMY bias generator circuit that includes a node to which voltage VDMY that determines the magnitude of dummy current idummy is applied, and a computation unit (logic gate) that outputs signal DETA for controlling the timing with which dummy current idummy flows.","With the above configuration, before cell current icell is caused to flow, dummy cell current (dummy current) idummy that uses a reference current for detecting the RESET of the selected memory cell is supplied to transistor MN. That is, before the cell current is caused to flow in a bit line, the detection module  is operated by the dummy current, thereby stabilizing voltage VOUT beforehand.","After the word line is activated, dummy current idummy is stopped and cell current icell is actually caused to flow in the selected memory cell. At this time, voltage VOUT at the output node of the detection module  is already stable (at the low level). That is, the resistance-change detection circuit  can detect the resistance immediately after the word line is activated.","Therefore, although the time required to stabilize voltage VOUT has ranged from one hundred nanoseconds to several hundreds of nanoseconds since the cell current started to flow, the time can be shortened remarkably. This makes it possible to quickly detect a change in the resistive state of the selected memory even when the time required for the selected memory cell to change from the low-resistance state to the high-resistance state (RESET time) is short.","As a result, even after the resistive state of the selected memory cell has changed, the application of a voltage to the memory cell can be suppressed and the state of the memory cell selected by disturb can be prevented from changing again from the high-resistance state to the low-resistance state.","The aforementioned embodiment is not the only embodiment and may be modified variously. For example, while in the embodiment, an example of the resistance-change detection circuit has been explained with reference to , any structure may be used, provided that dummy current idummy is caused to flow in the detection module  before cell current icell is caused to flow in the detection module  in order to stabilize voltage VOUT used in detecting a change in cell current icell.","While certain embodiments have been described, these embodiments have been presented by way of example only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventions.
