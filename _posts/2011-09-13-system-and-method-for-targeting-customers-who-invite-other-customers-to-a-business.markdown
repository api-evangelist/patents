{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The subject technology relates generally to posting and displaying messages in a social network.","Smart phones and other GPS-enabled devices may be enabled to receive selective targeting by business establishments based on a transmitted location. For example, a smart device may notify a server associated with a business when its user comes within a predefined distance of the business, and, in response, the server may automatically transmit an advertisement or coupon for use at the business to the smart phone. In other aspects, a device may be integrated with a social network and configured to allow a user to \u201ccheck-in\u201d to a business and to share that information with other users in the user's social network group.","The subject technology provides a system and computer-implemented method for targeting customers who invite other customers to a business. According to one aspect, the method includes receiving from a subscribed user, an indication that the subscribed user is at a business establishment, receiving a signal from one or more other users in a social group which includes the subscribed user, that the one or more other users arrived at the business establishment within a predetermined period of time after the indication was received from the subscribed user, and sending an offering to the subscribed user in response to receiving the signal. In another aspect, the method may include, on receiving the indication, sending to a plurality of users, a message that the subscribed user is at the business establishment, wherein the plurality of users include the one or more other users.","It is understood that other configurations of the subject technology will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein various configurations of the subject technology are shown and described by way of illustration. As will be realized, the subject technology is capable of other and different configurations and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects, all without departing from the scope of the subject technology. Accordingly, the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","101","102","103","104","102","101","105","102","103","102","102","105","102"]},"In the depicted example, a computing device  (for example, a GPS-enabled smart phone) may be integrated with a check-in feature that enables a first subscribing user  to send an indication (for example, an announcement, message, or the like) to centralized servers  or business servers  that user  is at business establishment  (for example, at or near the first user's current geographic location). If the indication is received by business servers , business servers  may be configured to forward the indication to centralized servers . On receiving the indication, centralized servers  may send a message to other subscribing users  (for example, contacts of user  in a social network who are also using a device ) that first user  is at business establishment . Subscribed users  may be designated or listed as contacts of user , or users of the social network who can view or receive messages from user . The message sent by servers  may be sent over network , through the social network, by way of an electronic text message or email, or the like.","In another aspect, the indication that user  is at business establishment  may be sent between computing devices , for example, bypassing centralized servers . In this regard, centralized servers  may be configured to detect the indication sent from user  to the other users , and\/or detect that the other users received the message that first user  is at business establishment . Computing device  may, for example, be configured by a user with a separate application to inform other users that a user is at a business establishment, and to allow the detection of that notification by centralized servers . For example, computing device  may be configured by its user to allow, for example, monitoring of a check-in application, text messages, instant messages, email, or the like.","In one aspect, if, during the time that first user  remains at business , one or more of the other users  check-in to the same business location, centralized servers  may determine that first user  invited the one or more other users  to join him or her at that business, and send targeted advertising to first user , or offer first user  an offering. For example, centralized servers  may be configured to receive one or more signals (for example, messages, notifications, or the like) that one or more users  arrived at business establishment  within a predetermined period of time (for example, 20 or 30 minutes) after the indication from user  was received. On receiving the one or more signals within the period of time, centralized servers  may send an offering  to user . Offering  may be included in an electronic publication (for example, an email), and may include an advertisement related to business , one or more coupons redeemable at business  (for example, for a free coffee), a reward, or the like. In one aspect, centralized servers  may send a targeted advertisement to the one or more (for example, all) users  who arrived at business establishment  within the predetermined time. In other aspects, servers  may send an offering only after a predetermined number of users  arrive at business establishment  (for example, on receiving the last of a predetermined number of signals).","In another aspect, a centralized server  may include or be operably connected to a database . Centralized server  may store in database  information pertaining to each time an offering is sent to a user by centralized server , contact information (for example, an email address) for the subscribed users  or  who arrived at business establishment , metrics on sales generated through the efforts of identified users  or users , or the like. A report may be periodically generated (for example, monthly) by centralized server  and sent to business servers . Business establishment  may then use the contact information in the report to provide targeted advertising to those customers who frequently invite other customers to business establishment , or otherwise bring sales to business establishment  or a similar businesses establishment.","Centralized server  or business servers  may be responsible for automatically sending the subscribed users the previously described offerings or targeted advertisements. In a further aspect, business establishment , rather than centralized server , may be responsible for sending the offering to the users. To this end, centralized server  may merely make a determination that a group of users are patronizing the business establishment together, and then send that information to business server  (for example, by the previously described report). Business establishment  may then send those individuals an offering directly (for example, by email of by direct U.S. mail service).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","201","101","202","203","202","204","205","206","207","106","208","107","203","208","202","208","209","210","210"]},"Customer  may enter or scan code  using his or her computing device , and device  may be configured to send the code , or information derived there from, to centralized server . For example, device  may send code  to centralized server  over network . In another aspect, customer  may text code  to a predetermined location (for example, phone number) printed on receipt . The scanning and\/or sending of code  may cause device  to \u201ccheck-in\u201d to business establishment , or otherwise signal that customer  has arrived at business establishment . In another aspect, code  may inform centralized server  of the purchase, including, for example, the item purchased. After receiving code , centralized server  may send the previously described offering to first customer  or one or more second customers . In one aspect, purchase information obtained from code  may be used to limit the offering to certain products (for example, related to the purchase).","If multiple users in the same social group make a purchase at the same business establishment , within a certain period of time after an initial purchase (for example, by customer ), centralized server  may make a determination that they came to the business together or to meet each other, and send one or more targeted advertisements to one or more of the users, or offer them the offering (for example, a coupon redeemable at the business or a similar business). In one aspect, centralized server  may determine that customer  (for example, who announced his or her location to the other users prior to the purchases being made) is the organizer of the group transactions, and send the advertisement or offering to that customer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["100","200","301","302","303","304"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","101","201","102","103","401","402","403","404","405","406","401","407","406","400"]},"Processor  may be configured to execute code or instructions to perform the operations and functionality described herein, manage request flow and address mappings, and to perform calculations and generate commands.
