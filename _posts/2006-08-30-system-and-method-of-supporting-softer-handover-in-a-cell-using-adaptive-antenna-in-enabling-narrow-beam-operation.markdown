title: System and method of supporting softer handover in a cell using adaptive antenna in enabling narrow beam operation
abstract: Handover is a main function that is used to support mobility in the network. In a cellular communication network having adaptive antennas for enabling narrow beam operation, a network control unit sends a radio link setup request to a selected cell-serving network unit for configuration of a new serving radio link. Before responding to the radio link setup request the cell-serving network unit performs uplink measurements with respect to the mobile unit, and a narrow target beam is selected within a cell served by the cell-serving network unit based on these measurements. The cell-serving network unit then configures the new serving radio link for the considered mobile unit directly with the selected narrow target beam. Consequently the system can perform the handover procedure using narrow beams only, without first establishing the radio link with a cell-wide beam and then reconfiguring the radio link onto a narrow beam.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of US Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/781,366, filed Mar. 13, 2006, the disclosure of which is fully incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention generally relates to wireless or cellular communication and more particularly to narrow beam handover for adaptive antennas.","The use of adaptive or smart antennas is considered as one of the key features for increasing coverage and capacity of a wireless system such as WCDMA. When beamforming is applied in the base station several narrow beams, compared to the sector\/cell beam, may be created to maintain coverage in the cell.  illustrates a sector cell antenna beam. Although a sector antenna is useful to communicate broadcast and\/or control information to all mobiles in the sector cell, an adaptive antenna may be used to transmit and receive in narrow beams covering just a part of the sector cell.  shows an example of a narrow antenna beam.  illustrates an example of a cellular network with a base station transmitting a sector beam, a base station transmitting one of the possible beams in a multi-beam system, and a base station transmitting a steerable beam. Some benefits of adaptive antennas are shown in , where a narrow beam of the adaptive antenna may be directed to an intended mobile and therefore spreads less interference in the download or downlink direction. The narrow beam also suppresses spatial interference from adjacent cell interferers in the uplink direction. Both factors increase the signal-to-interference gain, and therefore increase the overall system performance. Currently there exist no commercial installations of adaptive antennas in the field of WCDMA systems.","Another fundamental feature in a cellular network is handover (HO). Handover is a main function that is used to support mobility in the network. When a user is moving in the cellular network, it has to change serving cell when the signal from the current cell is too weak to support the current radio link. Also, in e.g. WCDMA there is a soft handover (SHO) functionality. This means that there may exist several radio links between the user terminal and the network. This has the effect that the combination of several radio links together may provide sufficient quality of the combined radio link set.","When narrow beams are created by the smart antenna system, the user equipment (UE) needs to make a handover between the different beams in order to maintain the call. In order to make these handovers, a reference (or pilot) signal measurement is used to decide upon the quality of a specific base station antenna beam.","However, when adaptive antennas and handover are combined in wireless networks such as WCDMA certain problem arises. In many systems, e.g. WCDMA, a common pilot signal is used as a reference for the handover measurements. This reference should be transmitted in the whole cell (defining the cell coverage), as specified by 3GPP standards. Hence the reference is common for an entire cell and may thus constitute a poor reference for the quality in specific beams when beamforming is applied. Furthermore, when performing a handover, the narrow beams of the adjacent cells are not known to the mobile, hence the handover needs to be carried out on sector covering wide beams.","In reference [1], downlink quality measurements associated with a broadcast signal transmission from neighboring base stations are detected by the mobile and reported to the radio network. First, a target base station is determined based on the measurements, and a radio link is established between the target base station and the mobile using the cell-wide broadcast signal. Subsequently, a desired antenna beam is determined using uplink measurements, and the radio link is then re-configured to the desired antenna beam. This means that after establishing a radio link, the link needs to be re-configured onto a narrow beam. When a new handover should be performed, each radio link must first be re-configured to a sector-wide beam again. This process will not only consume resources in the network for signaling, but will also lower the capacity since some radio links are transmitted over a wide sector beam instead of a high gain narrow beam.","There is thus a general need to improve the handover function in wireless systems when adaptive antennas and\/or beamforming is applied.","The present invention overcomes these and other drawbacks of the prior art arrangements.","It is a general object of the present invention to improve handover in wireless cellular systems using adaptive antennas for beamforming.","It is an object to improve the possibility to secure and more fully exploit the system capacity\/coverage potential offered by narrow beam\/adaptive antenna techniques.","In particular it is desirable to facilitate the handover function to allow for direct handover from\/to narrow beams, and narrow beam to narrow beam without the need to back off and transmit over the entire cell at handover.","Briefly, the problem when adaptive antenna (AA) technology is deployed is that the common reference signal specified by standards covers the whole cell, while the beam pattern formed by the AA system will cover parts of the cell only.","A basic idea of the invention is to provide efficient support for handover in a cellular radio communication system by using the handover protocol suite combined with measurements in a non-conventional way. The communication system has (adaptive) antennas for enabling narrow beam operation, and it is assumed that a mobile unit is served by an active cell set of at least one cell in the cellular communication system. In accordance with the invention, a network control unit sends a radio link setup request to a selected cell-serving network unit for configuration of a new serving radio link, and before responding to the radio link setup request the cell-serving network unit performs uplink measurements with respect to the mobile unit for selection of a narrow target beam within a cell served by the cell-serving network unit. The cell-serving network unit then configures the new serving radio link for the considered mobile unit directly with the selected narrow target beam.","In this way, the system can perform the handover procedure using narrow beams only, without first establishing the radio link with a cell-wide beam and then reconfiguring the radio link onto a narrow beam.","Preferably, the cell-serving network unit sends information, e.g. in a radio link setup response, representative of the selected narrow target beam to the network control unit.","The active cell set may include one or more active cells, and the neighbor area may include one or more neighbor cells.","The invention also relates to a network unit in a cellular radio communication system. The network unit preferably comprises a module for receiving a radio link setup request from a network control unit for configuration of a new serving radio link for a selected mobile unit. It also comprises a module for performing, before responding to the radio link setup request, uplink measurements with respect to the mobile unit for selection of a narrow target beam within a cell served by the network unit. The network unit can then configure the new serving radio link directly with the selected narrow target beam.","The invention offers the following advantages:\n\n","Other advantages offered by the invention will be appreciated when reading the below description of embodiments of the invention.","For a better understanding of the invention, it may be useful to begin with a brief overview and analysis of the prior art techniques.","In WCDMA, for example, the handover measurements and signaling is always based on the Primary Common PIlot CHannel, P-CPICH, which is the basis for all measurements in the system. This signal, which is a unique sequence in each cell, is measured by all terminals in the system. It can be argued that this is the signal that defines a cell in a WCDMA system. Since this signal needs to be the same in the whole cell, certain problems arise when several narrow beams are used to cover a cell, e.g. when beamforming is applied in the system. For example, the handover mechanism is based on quality measurements on the P-CPICH. The UE is constantly measuring the quality of the pilot from neighboring cells, and this is reported to the radio network controller (RNC). The RNC then decide to add a link from a certain cell to the active set if certain requirements are fulfilled, e.g. the quality of the pilot signal is above a certain threshold. Also, when the quality of a pilot signal drop below a certain limit, this radio link is dropped. In this way, the UE can maintain a radio connection when it travels through the cellular layout of a system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["10","14","18","1","2","14","12","16","17","1","1","2","3","2","4","5","6","2","4","4","20","1","4","2","4"]},"It has been recognized that the primary problem when beamforming is deployed in a conventional WCDMA system is how to manage the handovers. Since the mobile or UE receives the radio link through a narrow beam, the channel quality of which may be very different from the quality of a sector covering P-CPICH, the handover measurements made by the UE on the P-CPICH may not reflect the quality that the UE experiences with transmission over the narrow beam. In this case a radio link that is below the threshold when measured on the P-CPICH may be dropped even if the quality on the narrow beam is above the threshold. Another problem that arises when beamforming is used is that the prior art systems cannot handle inter\/intra cell beam handovers in an efficient way. Since all handover measurements are based on the P-CPICH, the quality of each beam cannot be monitored by the UE.","This problem is alleviated to some extent for the intra cell case by measurements performed by the base station per user in each cell portion of a given cell as introduced in later revisions of the 3GPP standard of reference [2]. However, it is not possible to use these measurements for handover from one cell to another cell due to limitations in the 3GPP standard.","The invention proposes a completely new solution based on using the handover protocol suite combined with measurements in a non-conventional way. The communication system has (adaptive) antennas for enabling narrow beam operation, and it is assumed that a mobile unit is served by an active cell set of at least one cell in the cellular communication system. With reference to the exemplary flow diagram of , a network control unit sends (S) a radio link setup request to a selected cell-serving network unit for configuration of a new serving radio link. Before responding to the radio link setup request the cell-serving network unit performs uplink measurements (S) with respect to the mobile unit, and a narrow target beam is selected (S) within a cell served by the cell-serving network unit based on these measurements. The cell-serving network unit then configures (S) the new serving radio link for the considered mobile unit directly with the selected narrow target beam.","Consequently the system can perform the handover procedure using narrow beams only, without first establishing the radio link with a cell-wide beam and then reconfiguring the radio link onto a narrow beam.","In a sense, the radio link setup request can be regarded as incomplete with respect to the setup of the new serving radio link, and information about the selected narrow target beam thus constitutes complementary information for the final setup of the new radio link directly with the selected narrow target beam.","Preferably, the cell-serving network unit also sends information representative of the selected narrow target beam to the network control unit. Advantageously, the standard protocol suite is modified in an exemplary embodiment by appending information representative of the selected narrow target beam to the conventional radio link setup response.","It should be understood that the network control unit of the invention can be any suitable network control unit known to the art such as a radio network controller, a mobility server and an access gateway. Similarly, the cell-serving network unit of the invention can also be any known cell-serving network unit such as a radio access node, a radio base station and a Node B.","In the following, the invention will be described with reference to the particular examples of . Although the invention will primarily be described with reference to W-CDMA systems, the invention is generally applicable to handover in cellular radio communication systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["30","14","1","18","1","18","2","14","2","18","3","18","4","20","3","18","3","2","18","2"]},"When the system should perform a handover (HO), the radio network controller (RNC) will issue a Radio Link Setup Request to the NodeB (base station in WCDMA terminology) [2]. This message contains general information on how the new radio link should be configured in the NodeB, but according to the 3GPP and other relevant standards the RNC has no narrow beam handover information at this point. According to the invention it is proposed that, before responding to this message, the NodeB should measure and determine the \u201cbest\u201d cell portion (3GPP terminology for narrow beam) according to [3] or any other proprietary developed measurement. The Node B can then use the result of this measurement to configure the new serving radio link for the considered mobile unit\/user equipment directly onto a narrow target beam. It is of course advantageous to select the best cell portion\/narrow beam, or at least a target beam among the best narrow beams, according to any suitable traditional quality criterion (e.g. based on SNR, CIR or similar quality measure). When responding to the request, the NodeB will preferably append the result of this measurement (selection) procedure to the standardized Radio Link Setup Response message from NodeB to the RNC. It is possible to use existing information entities such as a \u201ccell portion field\u201d for this signaling. The RNC is adapted to interpret this information correctly so that it can forward the appropriate information of the radio link configuration to the considered mobile unit.","For so-called downlink coherent detection schemes a phase reference is required that has experienced the same propagation channel as the transmitted payload transmission. For this reason WCDMA supports Secondary Common Pilot Channels, S-CPICHs, where each of these reference signals can be associated to a narrow beam (cell portion in the 3GPP nomenclature) transmission. The inventors have recognized the possibility to use the S-CPICH field of the radio link setup response or similar existing field to provide information on the cell portion that corresponds to the selected narrow target beam. With a mapping of cell portions to corresponding narrow target beams, the RNC or equivalent network control unit can efficiently translate the cell portion information to a narrow target beam.","The RNC (more generally a network control unit) may inform the mobile unit that the new serving radio link is associated with a selected Node B (more generally a cell-serving network unit) and also with a reference signal related to the selected narrow target beam. According to the standards of today, the message from the (S)RNC to the UE (mobile) does not include any information on selected narrow target beam, but rather includes information on the pilot (S-CPICH) to be used for phase reference \u201cassociated\u201d to a narrow beam or cell portion. However, as an option suggested by the invention, it is possible that future revisions of the standards may include information directly corresponding to a cell portion or narrow beam so that the network control unit may inform the mobile unit that the new serving radio link is associated with a selected cell-serving network unit and a selected narrow target beam.","The state-of-the art solution simply consists in adding, to the Active Set, the cell that corresponds to the P-CPICH whose measure triggered the Handover command. In case this target cell is equipped with narrow Fixed Beams (narrow multi-beams), the new link must, according to the standard, be established with the cell-wide beam that carries P-CPICH. Only upon completion of the Soft Handover procedure, the RNC is able to initiate Physical Channel Reconfiguration onto a proper narrow beam.","The prior art solution thus requires that the addition of the proper beam is always completed after:\n\n","In the following, the above conventional two-step procedure will be referred to as \u201cwide beam handover\u201d.","According to the invention, the new serving radio link can be established directly with the selected target beam. In other words, the proposed solution referred to as \u201cnarrow beam handover\u201d means that the addition of the proper beam is completed after completion of the handover procedure towards the new cell and narrow beam. This is in clear contrast to the prior art, where the radio link first has to be established with a cell-wide beam and then reconfigured onto a narrow beam.","Advantages of the proposed new procedure include:\n\n","An exemplary novel procedure of \u201cnarrow beam handover\u201d, proposed as a part of the present invention, includes measurements and selection of a target beam within a target cell before responding to the radio link setup response, as indicated in the signal and sequence diagrams of , where  illustrates a continuation of the sequence of .","The handover mechanism is conventionally based on quality measurements on the P-CPICH. The UE is constantly measuring the quality of the pilot from neighboring cells, and this is reported to the radio network controller (RNC). The RNC is communicating to the UEs information on which neighbors to monitor via a limited size neighbor list. From the P-CPICH measurements reported for the neighbor list, the RNC or similar network unit may decide to add a link from a certain cell to the active set if certain requirements are fulfilled, e.g. the quality of the pilot signal is above a certain threshold. Also the opposite, when the quality of a pilot signal drop below a certain limit, this radio link is dropped. In this way, the UE can maintain a radio connection when it travels through the cellular layout of a system.","Based on the current active cell set, the RNC may thus select a target cell (and corresponding node B) from the P-CPICH measurements reported for the neighbor list.","With reference to , the SNRC detects that a radio link should be added to the active set. The SNRC sends a so-called RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST to the DRNC. The DRNC basically performs admission control to see if there are any available radio resources. If the requested resources are available, the DRNC sends the RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST to the relevant node B (node B in this example) and also decides on a set of control parameters such as uplink (UL) SIR target limits. According to the invention, Node B performs narrow beam measurements with respect to the considered mobile unit\/user equipment (UE) and selects or determines a suitable narrow target beam (e.g. the beam with the best quality). Node B then allocates the requested resources, allocating a radio link directly with the selected narrow target beam, and reports successful radio resource allocation in a RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE to the DRNC. Preferably, the response message includes information of the selected narrow target beam, e.g. by using the S-CPICH field. The Node B starts uplink (UL) reception. The DRNC sends the RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE back to the SRNC. Among other things, the SRNC then initiates user plane establishment, which normally involves setup of an Iur\/Iub or equivalent data transport bearer and binding to the Dedicated Channel (DCH). Then Node B starts downlink (DL) transmission. The Radio Resource Control (RRC) Active Set Update procedure is then initiated, normally meaning that the SRNC sends a new Active Set Update message to the UE and the UE acknowledges with an Active Set Update Complete message. When Node B achieves uplink synchronization on the Uu interface, it may notify the DRNC with a RADIO LINK RESTORE INDICATION message. The DRNC may in turn notify the SRNC.","According to the standards, the Radio Resource Control (RRC) functionality also controls the items to be measured in the radio interface including the measurement period, timing and reporting method by the UE. Measurement Initiation is a conventional procedure for setting measurement functions of the UE, and Measurement Reporting is a conventional procedure for the UE to forward measurement results to the network. The RRC also handles power control, and the downlink power control procedure (including sending downlink (DL) power control requests to the relevant node Bs) can be initiated by the SRNC any time after establishment of a radio link.","The place to add the indication of \u201cbest beam\u201d is indicated in . Note also that the proposed extension to the existing protocol structure is only needed for base stations that are \u201cbeamforming capable\u201d. This is known in the RNC due to the cell portion entities available in the conventional cell creation command.","Note that similar problem as stated above can be found in the case when one radio link should be replaced with another i.e. when a \u201cRADIO LINK ADDITION REQUEST\u201d and a \u201cRADIO LINK DELETION REQUEST\u201d is performed.  schematically illustrates the replacement of a radio link. Here, the radio link to \u201cNodeB \u201d is replaced by a radio link to\/from \u201cNodeB \u201d. Similar protocols as in the previous example (see ) are used here. In addition to adding a new radio link, the old radio link is removed. Also in this case, the RNC should be informed onto which cell portion, \u201cbeam\u201d, the new radio link should be established in the \u201cnew\u201d NodeB.","For a better understanding of the invention, a typical trace of an exemplary command suite is shown below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0066"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","orient":"land"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"609pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"SHO Trace listing"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"609pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"118.79mm","wi":"213.36mm","file":"US09521597-20161213-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["100","110","120","130","140","120","130","140"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["200","210","212","214","216"]},"The handover controller  also comprises general conventional functionality for detecting the need for setting up a new radio link with another cell. In that process, the handover controller normally use signal quality information related to those cells that are found in the neighbor list of the current active cell set to select a suitable target cell (e.g. #Y).","The handover controller  issues a radio link setup request from the radio link setup request module  to the Node B that is responsible for the target cell. The handover controller  subsequently receives a radio link setup response to the radio link setup response module  from the contacted Node B. This response message preferably comprises information representative of a selected narrow target beam, e.g. appended to the response message in a cell portion field such as the S-CPICH field. For example, S-CPICH #X corresponds to narrow target beam (cell portion) #X.","Information of the selected reference signal (S-CPICH #X) and the target cell (#Y) is then typically transferred from the control signaling module  to the considered mobile unit\/user equipment for enabling appropriate configuration in the mobile unit according to accepted standards.","The advantage of this invention is at least twofold. First, the handover (or creation of a new radio link) can be done directly on a narrow beam. This in contrast to first establish the radio link on a sector covering wide beam and then reconfigure the radio link onto a narrow beam. The conventional procedure is not only power inefficient, but will also lead to increased signaling. This stands in clear contrast to the case when the proposed scheme is used, where the radio link is directly configured onto the high gain power-efficient narrow beam. The scheme proposed by the invention also results in a faster handover since the detour over a sector beam is avoided.","The invention thus allows for handover from\/to narrow beam and narrow beam to narrow beam directly without the need to back off and transmit over the entire cell at handover. This will substantially improve the possibility to secure and achieve the system capacity\/coverage gains promised by narrow beam (smart antennas\/adaptive antennas\/fixed beam) techniques.","The embodiments described above are merely given as examples, and it should be understood that the present invention is not limited thereto.
