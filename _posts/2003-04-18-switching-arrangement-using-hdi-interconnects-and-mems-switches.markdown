MEMS switch structure  includes a MEMS dielectric substrate  defining an upper surface and a lower surface . The movable mechanical element in MEMS structure  is illustrated as an electrically conductive switch contact , which is fabricated so that a drive structure (not illustrated in ) can cause it to move upward and downward (relative to the orientation of the FIGURE) in the direction of double-headed arrow . In order to incorporate the movable element  into a transmission line, a further strip conductor  is deposited on or otherwise supported by the upper surface of dielectric plate , extending partially under movable switch element , with a break  in the continuity of strip conductor  generally at the location of the movable element . When the movable element  is in its uppermost state or condition, which is the position illustrated in , there is no continuity between the left and right portions of strip conductor , and the switch is therefore OPEN or nonconductive. Conversely, when the movable conductor element  is in its lowermost state or condition, it is in contact with both left and right halves or portions of strip conductor , and provides electrical continuity therebetween. In this state, the switch is said to be CLOSED. It should be noted in passing that European usage looks on a switch as one might a gate, and a nonconductive state is known as CLOSED, while the conductive state is known as OPEN. Movable switch element  is controlled to the UP or DOWN state by MEMS controllers, not illustrated.","In order to avoid transmission-line discontinuities which might perturb proper transmission, it is desirable to have strip conductor  of in the form of a transmission line. The transmission line of MEMS structure  includes a further ground plane  lying below lower surface of MEMS substrate , at least in the region lying below strip conductor  and movable element .","In order to provide a space or \u201croom\u201d for the desired movement of movable conductive element  of the MEMS structure , a layer  of dielectric is placed between the transmission line structure  and the MEMS structure , with a gap or opening  at the location of movable element . Finally, the connections are completed by a plurality of through vias and metallizations. More particularly, a through via  extends at transverse plane T from ground plane  to a metallization , and a further through via  extends at a transverse plane T from metallization  to ground plane . Thus, the combination of through vias  and , in conjunction with metallization , provides contact between the right-most end of ground plane  and the left-most end of ground plane . In addition, a through via  extends at transverse plane T from ground plane  to a metallization , and a further through via  extends at a transverse plane T from metallization  to ground plane . Thus, the combination of through vias  and , in conjunction with metallization , provides contact between the left-most end of ground plane  and the right-most end of ground plane . Some strip conductor connections are made by means of a through via  extending at a plane T through dielectric plate  to a metallization , and a further through via  extending through dielectric plate  at plane T from metallization  to the left-most end of strip conductor . The strip conductor connections are completed by means of a through via  extending at a plane T through dielectric plate  to a metallization  lying between dielectric plates  and , and a further through via  extending at a plane T through dielectric plate  to the right-most end of strip conductor . Thus, through vias  and , in conjunction with metallization , provides electrical continuity from strip conductor  to the right end of strip conductor .
