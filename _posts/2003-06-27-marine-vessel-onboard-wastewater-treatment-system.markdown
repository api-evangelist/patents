title: Marine vessel onboard wastewater treatment system
abstract: Shipboard wastewater undergoes treatment within an automatic system based on membrane bioreactor technology. Bacteria that are naturally present in the raw waste stream break down during treatment and consume organic material in the wastewater. Membranes in a bioreactor within which the wastewater is treated provide a physical barrier, retaining the bacteria and other solids while producing an effluent sufficiently clean to be discharged directly overboard. To ensure adequate treatment, a flow-through ultraviolet disinfection unit is employed in the system downstream of filtration. Inorganic and other non-biodegradable material that accumulates in the bioreactor with time is removed automatically to maintain the desired solids concentration in the bioreactor. Using selective control established through the operator interface, the system can be operated under automatic process/standby mode or maintenance mode, and sludge concentrate can be directed either overboard, to an onboard storage tank or to undergo further treatment within a concentration device or destruction within an incinerator for example, depending on the ship's equipment, location and operating conditions.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention relates generally to treatment of wastewater onboard a marine vessel from which cleansed wastewater effluents are discharged.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","Marine vessels are presently required by Federal Regulations to have certified sanitation devices installed to hold or treat sewage. There are four general types of such sanitation devices categorized as \u201cflow-through and discharge\u201d devices and \u201cnon-flow-through\u201d devices. The \u201cflow-through and discharge\u201d devices receive and treat sewage, producing an effluent that meets specified fecal coliform (FC) population and total suspended solids (TSS) limits. The \u201cnon-flow-through\u201d devices are designed to collect and hold either sewage only, or a combination of graywater and sewage, depending on the system design, to enable the ship to transit restricted navigable waters. Graywater is defined as wastewater from showers, sinks, laundry, galley and scullery sources. No wastewater treatment is performed in the \u201cnon-flow-through\u201d type of systems.","Both commercial and military vessels frequently travel to foreign ports which have discharge regulations that are so restrictive as to establish limits not only for TSS and FC, but also for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). A reduction of BOD to specified limits can only be achieved through selected methods of treatment. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide a system for marine vessels including U.S. Navy ships that will collect and treat both graywater and sewage, producing a clean effluent that satisfies current and anticipated limits for BOD, TSS, and FC.","Pursuant to the present invention, a highly automated shipboard wastewater treatment system based on membrane bioreactor technology has been developed. Wastewater is treated in sequential processes, involving biological pre-treatment, membrane separation, and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection. Pre-treatment occurs in a bioreactor tank wherein bacteria naturally present in the raw waste stream break down and consume organic material in the wastewater. Aeration is supplied to the bioreactor via diffusers to sustain the bacterial population. Membranes in the bioreactor provide a physical barrier, retaining the bacteria and other solids therein while producing an effluent sufficiently clean to be discharged directly overboard. To ensure adequate treatment, a flow-through ultraviolet disinfection unit is employed downstream of filtration, further reducing fecal coliform concentrations in the effluent. Inorganic and other non-biodegradable material that accumulates in the bioreactor with time is removed automatically to maintain the desired solids concentration in the bioreactor. The system accommodates diverse types of membranes.","As diagrammed in , a wastewater treatment system  is provided for processing raw sewage and graywater on-board a marine vessel to form several different sources  of wastewater that is fed into a feed collector component . Specific fractions of the sewage and graywater within the wastewater from the sources  vary in accordance with the generation thereof. The feed collector  supplies the wastewater to a bioreactor component  within which biological pre-treatment of organic matter takes place. Following such bioreactor pre-treatment, membranes located in the bioreactor  separate solids and bacteria from a clean effluent stream. The separated solids and bacteria are fed into a permeate extraction component unit  by ultraviolet light producing an effluent  suitable for overboard discharge. Non-biodegradable material is separately removed automatically from the bioreactor  as sludge  to maintain necessary conditions for continued treatment. Operation and control of the feed collector , the bioreactor  and the permeate disinfecting extraction component  are achieved by means of a programmable logic controller (PLC) , and through which all components of the system  are supplied with electricity from a power supply .","As diagrammed in more detail in , the bioreactor component  includes a tank , of roughly 1100 gallons capacity for giving the system  a 75-person size capacity. Aeration is supplied by duty and back-up blowers  through a network of diffusers  located at the bottom of the tank , to sustain the bacterial population therein. Any foam that is generated in the bioreactor tank  as a byproduct of treatment flows by gravity into a foam collection tank , wherein it collapses and is pumped by a positive displacement foam condensate pump  back into the bioreactor tank . The foam tank  is approximately 200 gallons in capacity for the same 75-person size system  and is vented to atmosphere at an overboard connection via a vent . Located inside the bioreactor tank  is a membrane module assembly , which extracts clean permeate from the biomass through filtration for delivery through plumbing conduit  to the permeate disinfection unit . A positive displacement sludge pump  removes non-biodegradable sludge  from the bioreactor tank  automatically, and pumps it either overboard, to a holding tank, or to an onboard concentration or destruction device such as an incinerator depending on the ship's location.","As shown in , the permeate disinfection unit  connected by the plumbing conduit  to the bioreactor , has two positive displacement duty and backup permeate pumps  and an ultraviolet disinfection unit  connected to the discharge piping . The permeate pump  draws permeate through the membranes in the bioreactor  at a sub-atmospheric pressure and delivers the flow to the ultraviolet unit . Operation of the ultraviolet unit  is controlled by the controller  when energized while the treatment system  is processing wastewater. Permeate flows over baffles inside the ultraviolet unit  to ensure adequate residence time for disinfection, and is directed through the plumbing for the overboard discharge of the effluent .","As diagrammed in greater detail in , the feed collector component  includes a tank , having a capacity of 750 gallons for the same 75-person system . Aeration from the same two blowers  that supply the bioreactor tank  also supply an array of diffusers  at the bottom of the tank , for the purpose of preventing anoxic conditions in the tank  which could disrupt treatment system performance. The tank  is vented to atmosphere at an overboard connection via the vent line . Sewage and graywater from the onboard wastewater sources  supply the feed tank . Macerator feed pumps  (one duty, one backup) circulate raw wastewater within tank  to ensure mixed contents and reduce the size of solids particles. Based on a level demand signal from the bioreactor , feed is supplied by the macerator pumps  to the bioreactor  for treatment.","An \u201cAuto\/Maintenance\/Off selector\u201d switch  as diagrammed in  allows the selection of one of four operational modes of the system , including Off, Automatic process, Automatic Standby, and Maintenance. When the system  is in the OFF mode (selector switch  in OFF position) all power to components ,  and  is secured. All of the pumps ,  and , blowers , and the UV unit  remain off. In the AUTO position of the selector switch , the automatic process mode is initiated which includes both the normal process and standby modes. In such process mode, a graphical user interface (GUI) associated with the controller  indicates when the working level in the feed tank  is reached. The macerator pump  as diagrammed in  automatically starts and circulates wastewater in the feed tank , delivering wastewater to the bioreactor  when there is a demand based on the level switches in the bioreactor . Pressure transducers monitor the macerator pump  discharge pressure for alarm and shutdown conditions due to low discharge pressure or high pressure. The bioreactor  receives feed from the feed tank . When the working level switch is reached in the bioreactor , the PLC  waits a set period of time, to allow the bioreactor level to drop. The macerator pump  then feeds water to the bioreactor  as hereinbefore indicated. During such cycle, the system  automatically switches between 8 minutes of permeation and 2 minutes of rest. One of the two blowers  will always be operating during automatic operation. Programming is provided to automatically switch all the redundant pumps and blowers from the duty pump  or blower  to the backup unit in case of failure. This cycle continues as long as the system  is in the automatic mode and there are no alarm conditions. The system  is accordingly designed to operate 24 hours per day.","An automatic feature of the controller  during its programmed functioning stops permeation without stopping bioreactor and membrane scouring aeration. When the system is in the standby mode, the permeate pump , UV unit , and sludge pump  are powered off. The blowers operate. There is no feed supplied by the feed tank  to the bioreactor , and sludge concentrate is not discharged during this cycle.","The foam condensate pump  operates based on the level switching and logic of the controller  during the standby mode of operation. If a low level is reached in the bioreactor  at any time during the standby mode, the foam condensate pump  operates until all excess liquid in the foam tank  (condensate above the low level) is transferred to the bioreactor , until the bioreactor working level is reached.","A maintenance mode is established through the power control diagrammed in  so as to assist with troubleshooting whereby certain portions of the operation cycle may be initiated manually through the selector control switch  connected to the power supply  through the controller . Maintenance personnel can thereby take redundant equipment out of service, reset run hours for selected key equipment, and choose from several standard maintenance tests. Maintenance test screens provide several pushbuttons for an operator to test the following functions:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"10"},"Other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing discussion.
