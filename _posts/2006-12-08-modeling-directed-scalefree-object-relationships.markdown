No. 10\/603,034, filed on Jun. 24, 2003, entitled \u201cNEWS GROUP CLUSTERING BASED ON CROSS-POST GRAPH\u201d. The entireties of the aforementioned applications are incorporated herein by reference.","The invention pertains to generating models for growth and distribution of directed scale-free object relationships.","Many new processes for generating distributions of random graphs have been introduced and analyzed, inspired by certain common features observed in many large-scale real-world graphs such as the \u201cweb graph\u201d, whose vertices are web pages with a directed edge for each hyperlink between two web pages. For an overview see the survey papers [2] and [15] of the Appendix. Other graphs modeled are the \u201cinternet graph\u201d [18], movie actor [28] and scientific [25] collaboration graphs, cellular networks [21], and so on.","In addition to the \u201csmall-world phenomenon\u201d of logarithmic diameter investigated originally in the context of other networks by Strogatz and Watts [28], one of the main observations is that many of these large real-world graphs are \u201cscale-free\u201d (see references [5, 7, 24] of the Appendix), in that the distribution of vertex degrees follows a power law, rather than the Poisson distribution of the classical random graph models G(n, p) and G(n, M) [16, 17, 191, see also [9]. Many new graph generators have been suggested to try to model such scale-free properties and other features, such as small diameter and clustering, of real-world events, phenomena, and systems that exhibit dynamically developing object relationships such as that presented by the Worldh aWide Web (WWW). Unfortlunately, such existing generators produce models that are either completely undirected or, at most, semi-, or uni-directional (i.e., either in-degrees or out-degrees are treated, but not both simultaneously), and\/or have a statically predetermined degree distribution.","In light of this, existing techniques for generating graphs do not provide realistic treatments of dynamically generated scale-free graphs with directed object relationships (i.e., link(s) from one object to another) that develop in a way depending on both links out-of and into an object. As such, conventional generation techniques do not adequately represent specific or fully modeled simulations of scale-free, directed object relationships that may exist in nature and\/or other dynamic environments such as the WWW.","In view of these limitations, systems and methods for generating models of directed scale-free graphs or dynamic communities of relationships (e.g., network topologies) are greatly desired. Such generators could be used, e.g., to generate sample directed network topologies on which directed internet routing protocols are tested, or to generate sample web graphs on which search algorithms are tested.","Systems and methods for generating models of directed scale-free object relationships are described. In one aspect, a sequence of random numbers is generated. Individual ones of these random numbers are then selected over time to generate the directed scale-free object relationships as a graph based on sequences of in-degrees and out-degrees.","Overview","The following systems and methods generate directed scale-free modeling of object relationships. This is accomplished through the simultaneous treatment of both in-degrees and out-degrees (bidirectional) to provide a very natural model for generating graphs with power law degree distributions. Depending on the characteristics of the entity or the abstraction being modeled, power laws can be different for in-degrees and out-degrees. Such modeling is consistent with power laws that have been observed, for example, in nature and in technological communities (e.g., directed hyperlinks among web pages on the WWW, connections among autonomous systems on the AS internet, connections among routers on the internet, etc.).","Exemplary Operating Environment","Turning to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements, the invention is illustrated as being implemented in a suitable computing environment.

Thus, i=1 . . . N, and j=1 . . . N. (Hereinafter, the terms node and nodes are often used interchangeably with the terms vertex and vertices). To grow graph () from some number of nodes to a greater number of nodes, the network generating module  adds a node to the graph (). This means that a row and a column representing the new node are added to the graph (). The (i,j) element E(i,j) of the graph () represents the number of directed edges or connections from node i to node j, modeling e.g., the number of hyperlinks from web page i to web page j, or a directed transfer of E(i,j) objects or characteristics from entity i to entity j (such as the transfer of money and goods between a merchant and a buyer), and\/or the like.","In the representation (), we have adopted the convention that edge direction is evaluated from the row-node to the column-node.","We now describe the edge E(i, j) values of graph () in view of network  of , which shows the exemplary network  of directed object relationships. In this exemplary network, objects -, -, and - have at least one edge  (i.e., one or more edges - through -N) to\/from another object. For example, object - () shows a looping edge - that indicates that the object has a relationship to itself (for example, a web page having a hyperlink to a point inside itself).","Referring to , such a looping edge is also represented in graph () at the edge value that corresponds to the intersection between row-Nodeand column-Node(i.e., E(,)=1). This indicates that Nodehas a single relationship to itself. This type of edge is called a \u201cloop\u201d.","In this implementation, the module  may generate (self-)loops in the graph . However, the generating module  can be configured not to generate loops to model systems without self-loops.","In another example to represent edges  of  with a directed scale-free graph () of , note that object - of  has three (3) edges - through - to node -. In particular, the intersection of row-Nodewith column-Node(i.e., E(1,2)) shows a value of 3, which is representative of the relationship between object - of  to object -. This type of edge is called a \u201cmultiple edge\u201d, which in general refers to two or more edges from a particular object Nodeto a different object Node. In this implementation, the module  may generate multiple edges in the graph . However, in another implementation, the generating module  can be configured not to generate multiple edges, to model systems in which there are only single edges.","Although network  of , and graph () of  respectively represent\/map only 3 nodes\/objects, it can be appreciated that the complexity and number of objects represented\/mapped by the exemplary network  and graph (), are exemplary and could represent\/map any number of objects of any complexity.","We now describe the algorithms used by the generating module  to generate directed scale-free object relationships in further detail.","Generating Directed Scale-Free Object Relationships","Referring to , the generating module  introduces random and probabilistic aspects during graph  generation to simulate dynamically created objects (e.g., web pages, etc.) and relationships between them (e.g., hyperlinks, etc.) that is\/are often observed, for example, in technological (e.g., the web), cultural, natural, and\/or the like, environments. Such a random aspect is obtained via iterative generating module  requests over time t for respective random number(s)  from the random number generating module (RNG) . The RNG  can be a standalone module, or a service provided by a computer program module such as the OS  ().","Some of the random numbers  will be required to lie between 0 (zero) and 1 (one). For each of these random numbers , the network generating module  uses the random number  to determine one of three possibilities, labeled (A), (B) and (C), depending on whether the random number lies between 0 (zero) and \u03b1, \u03b1 and \u03b1+\u03b2, or \u03b1+\u03b2 and \u03b1+\u03b2+\u03b3, respectively. The parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 are non-negative real numbers that when added together equal one (1), i.e., \u03b1+\u03b2+\u03b3=1. These parameters stored as respective portions of the configuration data . The parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 can be selected\/determined in different manners, for example, manually preconfigured by a system administrator, programmatically configured in view of environmental measurements, etc. This allows for considerable flexibility to customize the model generating process to simulate structural and object relationships of various types of measured environments.","When the generating module  maps the random number  to the range [0, \u03b1], the generating module  augments the graph  by adding a vertex and an edge from the new vertex into an existing (old) vertex. When the generating module  maps the random number  to the range [\u03b1, \u03b1+\u03b2], the generating module  augments the graph  by connecting two old vertices (i.e., a vertex is not added, but one of the E(i,j) values increases by one). When the generating module  maps the random number  to the range [\u03b1+\u03b2, \u03b1+\u03b2+\u03b3], the generating module  augments the graph  by connecting an old vertex to a newly generated vertex. Additionally, during graph generation, the module  applies configurable constants \u03b4and\/or \u03b4to introduce in-degree and out-degree shifts to the graph.","The degree shift, \u03b4or \u03b4, is a non-negative parameter added to the in-degree or out-degree of a vertex, respectively. The degree shift is added before applying any other rules which are used to choose random vertices.","In light of the above, let Gbe any fixed initial directed graph , for example, a single vertex (i.e., Node) without edges (i.e., E(,)=0), and let tbe the number of edges of G. The generating module  always adds one edge per iteration, and sets G(t)=G, so at time t the graph G(t) has exactly t edges, and a random number n(t) of vertices. For purposes of discussion, number(s) of edges and vertices, as well as other intermediate parameters and calculations are represented by respective portions of \u201cother data\u201d .","In the operation of the generating module , to choose a vertex v of G(t) according to d+\u03b4means to choose v so that Pr(v=v) is proportional to d(v)+\u03b4, i.e., so that Pr(v=v)=(d(vi)+\u03b4)\/(t+\u03b4n(t)). To choose v according to d+\u03b4means to choose v so that Pr(v=v)=(d(v)+\u03b4)\/(t+\u03b4n(t)). Here d(v) and d(v) are the out-degree of vand the in-degree of v, respectively, measured in the graph G(t).","For t\u2267t, the generating module  forms G(t+1) from G(t) according the following rules:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0046"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"d","mrow":{"mi":["i","n"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"j"}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["E","ij"]}}],"mo":"="}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":"\u2003At this point, the generating module  requests an additional random number  between 0 and the sum of all numbers d(j)+\u03b4in G(t):"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0048"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"d","mrow":{"mi":["i","n"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"j"}},"mo":"+","msub":{"mi":"\u03b4","mrow":{"mi":["i","n"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}}},{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["E","ij"]}}},{"mi":"n","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":"\u03b4","mrow":{"mi":["i","n"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}],"mo":"+"},{"mi":"t","mo":"+","mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":"\u03b4","mrow":{"mi":["i","n"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}}],"mo":"="}],"mo":"="}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":["\u2003The range from 0 to t+n\u03b4is divided into n slots with lengths d(j)+\u03b4, j=1, . . . , n.

In particular, the following parameter values can be avoided to exclude trivialities:\n\n","In one implementation, when graph  represents a web graph, \u03b4is set to 0. The motivation is that vertices added under rule (C) correspond to web pages which purely provide content; such pages do not change, are born without out-links and remain without out-links. In this implementation, vertices generated\/added under rule (A) correspond to usual pages, to which links may be added later. While mathematically it may seem natural to take \u03b4=0 in addition to \u03b4=0, doing so would provide a model in which every page not in Ghas either no in-links or no out-links, i.e. a trivial model.","A non-zero value of \u03b4corresponds to insisting that a page is not considered part of the web until something points to it, for example, a search engine. This allows the generating module  to consider edges from search engines independently\/separately from the rest of the graph, since they are typically considered to be edges of a different nature (for purposes of implementing a search algorithm, for example) than other types of edges. For the same reason, \u03b4does not need to be an integer. The parameter \u03b4is included to provide symmetry to the model with respect to reversing the directions of edges (swapping \u03b1 with \u03b3 and \u03b4with \u03b4), and to further adapt the model to contexts other than that of the webgraph.","In one implementation, taking \u03b2=\u03b3=\u03b4=0 and \u03b1=\u03b4=1, the generating module  includes a precise version of the special case of m=1 of the Barab\u00e1si-Albert model [5], wherein m represents the number of new edges added for each new vertex A more general model than that so far described here, with additional parameters, can be generated by adding m edges for each new vertex, or (as in [14]) by adding a random number of new edges with a certain distribution for each new vertex. In implementing the description here, the main effect of the Barab\u00e1si-Albert parameter m, namely varying the overall average degree, is achieved by varying \u03b2.","Another more general model than that so far described here, again with additional parameters, can be generated to describe systems in which different vertices have different fitnesses. For example, some web pages may be considered more fit or attractive than others, and may get more connections per unit time even if their degrees are not as high as those of less fit web pages. To model this, whenever the generating module  creates a new vertex v, the random number generator  will independently generate two random numbers \u03bb(v) and \u03bc(v) from some specified distributions Dand D, respectively, independently of each other and of all earlier choices. Then steps (A), (B) and (C) of [0041] will be modified as follows: In step (A), the existing vertex w will be chosen according to \u03bb(w)(d+\u03b4), so that Pr(w=w)\u221d\u03bb(w) (d(w)+\u03b4). In step (B), the existing vertex v will be chosen according to \u03bc(v)(d+\u03b4), and the existing vertex w will be chosen according to \u03bb(w)(d+\u03b4), so that Pr(v=v, w=w)\u221d\u03bc(v)\u03bb(w)(d(vi)+\u03b4)(d(w)+\u03b4). In step (C), the existing vertex w will be chosen according to \u03bc(w)(d+\u03b4), so that Pr(w=w)\u221d\u03bc(w)(d(w)+\u03b4).","An Exemplary Procedure",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0066"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["400","402","202","404","202","206"],"sub":["in ","out"]},"Conclusion","The described systems and methods generate directed scale-free object relationships.
