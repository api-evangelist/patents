{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/500,115 filed Jun. 22, 2011 under the title SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PERSONALIZING DIGITAL CONTENT","The content of the above patent application is hereby expressly incorporated by reference into the detailed description hereof.","The present disclosure relates generally to user profiling. More specifically, it relates to methods and systems for predicting user interest in a document.","Systems which provide users with access to a large volume of documents are sometimes required to select a subset of the documents for display to a user. For example, since displays are of a limited size, it is sometimes necessary to select only a portion of all available documents for display to a user.","Similarly, it is often necessary to prioritize documents for display to user since a user's attention span and available time may be limited. That is, it may be necessary or desirable to display documents which are of a higher priority higher in a list than other documents which are of a lower priority. Typically, systems attempt to display documents which are likely to be more interesting at a higher position than documents which are likely to be less interesting.","The problem of selecting and prioritizing documents is a problem which may arise, for example, with search engine systems which index a large volume of documents. Users are more likely to view search results which are displayed more highly in a list of search results. Accordingly, it may be desirable to select and prioritize search results so that results which are displayed more highly are results which are likely to be useful to a user.","Similarly, news aggregation systems may be required to select and prioritize documents. News aggregation systems and websites may analyze content from various sources and may provide access to that content through a common portal. Since news aggregation systems and websites index content from many different sources, the number of stories and documents which are indexed by such systems and websites may be quite large. Accordingly, news aggregation systems may select and prioritize documents in order to provide users with access to documents which may be of interest to such users.","Similar reference numerals are used in different figures to denote similar components.","In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a method implemented by a processor of a profiling system. The method comprises: based on a document corpus containing a plurality of documents, creating a topic set, at least some of the topics in the topic set being organized in a hierarchical structure which includes a plurality of topic levels including an upper topic level and a lower topic level, each topic in the lower topic level being a subtopic of at least one of the topics in the upper topic level; monitoring interest in a plurality of documents for a user to identify one or more documents-of-interest to the user; and based on the monitored interest for the user, creating an interest profile for the user by determining a measure of topical interest for the user for at least one of the topics at the upper topic level and for a subtopic of that topic, the subtopic being at the lower topic level.","In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a profiling system. The profiling system includes a processor and a memory coupled to the processor. The memory stores processor executable instructions which, when executed by the processor cause the processor to: based on a document corpus containing a plurality of documents, create a topic set, at least some of the topics in the topic set being organized in a hierarchical structure which includes a plurality of topic levels including an upper topic level and a lower topic level, each topic in the lower topic level being a subtopic of at least one of the topics in the upper topic level; monitor interest in a plurality of documents for a user to identify one or more documents-of-interest to the user; and based on the monitored interest for the user, create an interest profile for the user by determining a measure of topical interest for the user for at least one of the topics at the upper topic level and for a subtopic of that topic, the subtopic being at the lower topic level.","Other aspects and features of the present application will become apparent to those ordinarily skilled in the art upon review of the following description of specific embodiments of the application in conjunction with the accompanying figures.","Sample Operating Environment","Reference is first made to , which illustrates a system diagram of a possible operating environment  in which embodiments of the present disclosure may operate.","In the embodiment of , a profiling system  is configured to create a user-specific interest profile  for one or more users. The interest profile  may be used in order to predict a user's interest in a document . A user's predicted interest in a document  may be used in order to determine whether the document  or a portion of the document  (such as a title of the document) will be displayed to a user and\/or in order to determine how prominently the document  will be displayed. For example, the interest profile  for a user may be used to determine how high a document  should be displayed relative to other documents .","In at least some embodiments, the users may each be associated with one or more user devices . The user devices  may be electronic devices which are connected to the profiling system  via a network , such as the Internet.","The user devices  may, in various embodiments, include any one or more of: smartphones, tablet computers, laptop or netbook style computers, desktop computers, or other electronic devices. The user devices  are generally equipped with a display (not illustrated) which may allow the user devices to display one or more documents .","The profiling system  may create an interest profile  for a user based on documents  which a user appears to be interested in. That is, the profiling system  may monitor user behaviour in order to determine whether a user is interested in a given document  and may create an interest profile  for the user by analyzing documents  which the user appears to be interested in.","In at least some embodiments, the profiling system  may connect to or include a document aggregation system . In at least some embodiments, the interest profiles  which are created by the profiling system  may be used by the document aggregation system  in order to select and\/or prioritize one or more documents  or clusters of documents  for display to a user of a user device . In the embodiment illustrated, the profiling system  and the document aggregation system  are illustrated as a common system. However, in other embodiments, the profiling system  and the document aggregation system  may be separate systems which may, for example, communicate via a network .","In at least some embodiments, the document aggregation system  is configured to analyze at least a portion of a plurality of machine readable documents  and to group related documents together. That is, the document aggregation system  is configured to obtain document clusters. Each document cluster includes one or more documents  which are related to one another. More particularly, in at least some embodiments, the documents  in a document cluster are related to one another by subject matter. That is, all of the documents  in a given document cluster may be related by virtue of the fact that they all discuss a common story. The story may relate to a topic, issue, or event such as a recent event.","Some document clusters may include a single document . This may occur, for example, where none of the other documents  analyzed by the document aggregation system  are related to the single document  in the document cluster. A single document cluster may, however, include a plurality of documents . Where a single document cluster includes a plurality of documents , all of the documents  in that document cluster are related.","The documents  which grouped by the document aggregation system  and\/or which are used by the profiling system  to create a user-specific interest profile  are machine readable documents , such as, for example, text based documents, video, and\/or audio. These documents  may include, for example, blog posts , micro blog posts , news articles , comments , videos , and other documents . Other types of documents  may be used.","The documents  which are analyzed by the document aggregation system  and which may be included in the document clusters and\/or the documents  which are used by the profiling system  to create interest profiles  may, for example, be documents  which are associated with one or more document servers . In some embodiments, the documents  may include one or more blog posts . A blog is a website on which an author records opinions, links to other sites, and other content on a regular basis. A blog is a form of online journal which allows user to reflect, share opinions and discuss various topics in the form of an online journal. A blog post  is an entry in a blog. In at least some embodiments, the blog posts  may be stored on and\/or accessed through one or more blog server .","The documents  which are analyzed by the document aggregation system  and which may be included in the document clusters and\/or the documents  which are used by the profiling system  to create interest profiles  may, for example, include micro-blog posts . A micro-blog is a form of a blog in which the entries to the blog are typically restricted to a predetermined length. By way of example, in at least some embodiments, the micro-blog posts  may include Tweets\u2122 on Twitter\u2122. In at least some embodiments, the micro-blog posts  may be social networking posts including status updates, such as Facebook\u2122 posts and updates and\/or Google\u2122 Buzz\u2122 posts and updates. In at least some embodiments, the micro-blog posts may be restricted to one hundred and forty (140) characters. The micro-blog posts  may, in at least some embodiments, be stored on and\/or accessed through one or more micro-blog server .","The documents  which are analyzed by the document aggregation system  and which may be included in the document clusters and\/or the documents  which are used by the profiling system  to create interest profiles  may, for example, include news articles . News articles  are text based documents which may, for example, contain information about recent and\/or important events. In at least some embodiments, the news articles  may be stored on and\/or accessed through one or more news servers .","The documents  which are analyzed by the document aggregation system  and which may be included in the document clusters and\/or the documents  which are used by the profiling system  to create interest profiles  may include other documents instead of or in addition to the blog posts , micro-blog-posts  and\/or news articles . By way of example, in at least some embodiments, the documents  may include one or more comments , one or more videos  and\/or one or more other documents . Comments  may, in at least some embodiments, be documents  which are user-generated posts which are input within an interface which allows a user to comment about a primary document. The primary document may, for example, be a blog post , micro-blog post , news article , or video . Other types of primary documents may also be used. That is, comments  may be remarks which express an opinion or reaction to a primary document. Users may be given the opportunity to submit comments  when viewing the primary documents. In at least some embodiments, the comments may be stored on and\/or accessed through the blog server , micro-blog server  or news server . In other embodiments, the comments  may be stored on and\/or accessed through one or more other document servers .","The other document servers  may, in at least some embodiments, store and\/or provide access to one or more videos  and\/or other documents.","The documents  which are analyzed by the document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system  are machine readable documents. The documents  may include, for example, text-based documents which contain data in written form. By way of example and not limitation, the documents  may be formatted in a Hyper-Text Markup Language (\u201cHTML\u201d) format, a plain-text format, a portable document format (\u201cPDF\u201d), or in any other format which is capable of representing text or other content. Other document formats are also possible.","In at least some embodiments, the documents  may include documents  which are not text-based documents. Instead, the documents  may be documents which are capable of being converted to text based documents. Such documents  may include, for example, video or audio files. In such embodiments, the document aggregation system , the profiling system , or another system, may include a text extraction module which is configured to convert audible speech into written text. Such text may then be analyzed by the document aggregation system  in order to obtain the document clusters and\/or by the profiling system  in order to obtain an interest profile  for a user.","Accordingly, in at least some embodiments, the documents  are stored on a document server  which is accessible to the document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system . The document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system  may connect to the document servers  via a network , such as the Internet. In some embodiments, one or more of the document servers  may be a publicly and\/or privately accessible web-site which may be identified by a unique Uniform Resource Locator (\u201cURL\u201d).","The network  may be a public or private network, or a combination thereof. The network  may be comprised of a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN), a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), the Internet, a Local Area Network (LAN), or any combination of these network types. Other types of networks are also possible and are contemplated by the present disclosure.","In at least some embodiments, one or more of the document servers  may include an application programming interface (API)  which permits the document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system  to access the documents  associated with that document server . By way of example, in some embodiments, the blog server  may include an API  which permits the document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system  to access blog posts  associated with the blog server . Similarly, in at least some embodiments, the micro-blog server  may include an API  which permits the document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system  to access micro-blog posts  associated with the micro-blog server . Similarly, in at least some embodiments, the news server  may include an API  which permits the document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system  to access news articles  associated with the news server . In at least some embodiments (not shown), one or more of the other document servers  may include an API  for permitting the document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system  to access the documents  associated with those other document servers .","The API  associated with any one or more of the document servers  may be configured to provide documents  associated with that document server  to the document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system . For example, in at least some embodiments, an API  associated with a document server  may be configured to receive a request for one or more documents  from the document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system  (or another system) and, in response, retrieve one or more documents  from storage and provide the retrieved document(s) to the document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system  (or other system from which a request was received).","While in some embodiments, the API  of one or more of the documents servers  may be configured to return documents  to a system (such as the document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system ) in response to a request from that system, in other embodiments, one or more of the document servers  may provide documents  to a system (such as the document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system ) when other criteria is satisfied. For example, one or more of the document servers  may, in at least some embodiments, be configured to periodically provide documents  to the document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system . For example, a document server  may periodically send to the document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system  any documents  which have been posted since the document server  last sent documents  to the document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system  (i.e. it may send new documents ).","In at least some embodiments, the document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system  may access the documents  on the document servers  in other ways. For example, in at least some embodiments, the document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system  may include web scraping and\/or crawling features. In such embodiments, the document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system  may automatically navigate to a URL associated with a document server  and may index and\/or retrieve one or more documents  associated with that document server .","In at least some embodiments, the document aggregation system  may be of the type described in United States Publication Number 2011\/0093464 A1 which was filed Aug. 17, 2010 and entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GROUPING MULTIPLE STREAMS OF DATA,\u201d the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system  may include a number of systems, functions, subsystems or modules apart from those specifically discussed herein. In at least some embodiments, the document aggregation system  and\/or the profiling system  also includes a web-interface subsystem (not shown) for automatically generating web pages which permit access to documents  in the document clusters and\/or provide other information about such documents . The other information may include a machine-generated summary of the contents of the documents .","The web-pages which are generated by the web-interface subsystem may provide access to documents  in document clusters determined by the document aggregation system . More particularly, the web-pages may display document clusters or information associated with document clusters. Each document cluster may represent a story. A user may select a story via the webpage by selecting a document cluster (or by selecting other information associated with a document cluster) and documents  associated with that document cluster may then be displayed (or information associated with those documents  may be displayed).","In at least some embodiments, the web-interface subsystem (not shown) is configured to generate web pages based on scores assigned to each of a plurality of document clusters and\/or documents . The web-interface subsystem may generate one or more web-pages for display to a specific user based on a measure of predicted interest for that user for one or more documents  and\/or document clusters. That is, the prediction system  may gauge a user's interest in a document  or a document cluster by determining a measure of predicted interest for the user in the document  (or document cluster). The measure of predicted interest may be determined based on the interest profile  for that user. The web-interface subsystem may use the measure of predicted interest in order to generate web pages containing content which is likely of interest to the user. For example, the web-interface subsystem may generate a web page which includes a link to a document  that a user will likely be interested in but which does not include a link to a document  which a user will likely not be interested in.","Accordingly, in at least some example embodiments, web-pages generated by a web-interface subsystem may display identification data for documents  and\/or document clusters having a higher relative measure of predicted interest more prominently than identification data for documents  or document clusters having a lower relative measure of predicted interest. For example, in at least some embodiments, the generated web-pages may display identification data for documents  or document cluster having a measure of predicted interest at a higher relative position than identification data for documents  or document clusters having a lower relative measure of predicted interest.","Accordingly, in some embodiments, the document aggregation system  may allow public access to documents  and\/or document clusters. In some such embodiments, the document aggregation system  provides such access by generating web pages which are accessible through a network  such as the Internet. For example, user devices  may access the web pages. The web pages may visually represent the relationship of documents  by subject matter. For example, the web pages may display related documents, portions of related documents  and\/or or links to related documents  (i.e. documents  in the same document cluster) on a common web page to indicate that such documents  are related. Such related documents , portions and\/or links may be displayed in close proximity to one another to visually represent the fact that the documents are related to one another.","The profiling system  and\/or the document aggregation system  may in various embodiments, include more or less subsystems and\/or functions than are discussed herein. The functions provided by any set of systems or subsystems may be provided by a single system and that these functions are not, necessarily, logically or physically separated into different subsystems and are not, necessarily, logically or physically included in a common system. In the illustrated example, the profiling system  and the document aggregation system  are a single system which provides both document aggregation capabilities and also profiling capabilities. Such a system may be referred to as a profiling system  or a document aggregation system  since both document cluster ranking capabilities and document aggregation capabilities are provided. In other embodiments, the profiling system  may be physically or logically separated from the document aggregation system .","Accordingly, the term profiling system  as used herein includes standalone profiling systems which are not, necessarily, part of a larger system, and also profiling systems  which are part of a larger system or which include other systems or subsystems. The term profiling system , therefore, includes any systems in which the profiling methods described herein are included.","Furthermore, while  illustrates one possible operating environment  in which the document cluster ranking system  may operate, it will be appreciated that the profiling system  may be employed in other systems in which it may be useful to profile user interests.","Example Profiling System","Referring now to , a block diagram of an example profiling system  is illustrated. The profiling system  includes a controller, comprising one or more processor  which controls the overall operation of the profiling system .","The profiling system  includes a memory  which is connected to the processor  for receiving and sending data to the processor . While the memory  is illustrated as a single component, it will typically be comprised of multiple memory components of various types. For example, the memory  may include Random Access Memory (RAM), Read Only Memory (ROM), a Hard Disk Drive (HDD), a Solid State Drive (SSD), Flash Memory, or other types of memory. It will be appreciated that each of the various memory types will be best suited for different purposes and applications.","The processor  may operate under stored program control and may execute software modules  stored on the memory . In at least some embodiments, the profiling system  also functions as a document aggregation system  (). In such embodiments, the modules  may include a document aggregation module  which is configured to perform the functions of the document aggregation system . Example functions of the document aggregation system  are discussed above. In at least some embodiments, the document aggregation module  is configured to cluster documents . A document cluster  may, for example, include a plurality of documents  which are determined by the document aggregation module  to be related to one another. For example, the document aggregation module  may find a plurality of documents  which are all related to the same subject matter.","In at least some embodiments, the profiling system  includes a user profiling module . The user profiling module  is configured to generate a user-specific interest profile  for a user of the profiling system  and\/or the document aggregation system . More particularly, the profiling system  is configured to create an interest profile  for a user. The interest profile  may created by monitoring a user's interest in documents  and, based on the user's interest in those documents , creating a profile which may be used to predict their interest in other documents . That is, the profiling system  may determine, based on whether a user liked or disliked a document , whether that same user will like or dislike another document .","The user profiling module  will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to . More particularly, methods of creating an interest profile  will be discussed below with reference to .","In at least some embodiments, the user profiling module  may predict a user's interest in a document  or document cluster  by determining a measure of predicted interest in that document  or document cluster  based on the interest profile  for that user. The measure of predicted interest may be used to determine how prominently a document cluster  or document  will be displayed. For example, when documents  or document clusters (or information about documents  or document clusters ) are displayed in a web page, the documents  or document clusters  may be ordered according to their respective measures of predicted interest. A document  or document cluster  with a relatively higher measure of predicted interest may be displayed higher on a web page than a document with a relatively lower measure of predicted interest.","Document clusters  and\/or interest profiles  may, for example, be stored in a data  area of memory . The document clusters  may include documents , portions thereof, or identifying information regarding documents . That is, in some embodiments, the documents  themselves may be locally stored in the memory  of the document cluster ranking system . In other embodiments, the document clusters  may include pointers or links specifying where such documents  may be found. For example, in some embodiments, the documents  in the document clusters  may be stored on a remote server such as the document servers  of  and the document clusters  may specify the location of the documents  (such as an address associated with the document server  and the location of the documents  on the document server ).","Each interest profile  may include or be associated with user identifying information which may be used to identify a specific user associated with an interest profile. The user identifying information may, for example, include a username, password, name, IP address, or other identifying information associated with a user and\/or a user device  ().","The memory  may also store other data  not specifically referred to above.","The profiling system  may be comprised of other features, components, or subsystems apart from those specifically discussed herein. By way of example and not limitation, the profiling system  will include a power subsystem which interfaces with a power source, for providing electrical power to the profiling system  and its components. By way of further example, the profiling system  may include a display subsystem for interfacing with a display, such as a computer monitor and, in at least some embodiments, an input subsystem for interfacing with an input device. The input device may, for example, include an alphanumeric input device, such as a computer keyboard and\/or a navigational input device, such as a mouse.","The modules  may be logically or physically organized in a manner that is different from the manner illustrated in . By way of example, in some embodiments, two or more of the functions described with reference to two or more modules may be combined and provided by a single module. In other embodiments, functions which are described with reference to a single module may be provided by a plurality of modules. Thus, the modules  described with reference to  represent one possible assignment of features to software modules. However, such features may be organized in other ways in other embodiments.","Creating and Using an Interest Profile","Referring now to , a flowchart is illustrated of a method  for creating and using an interest profile for a user.","The method  includes steps or operations which may be performed by the profiling system . In at least some embodiments, the profiling system  may include a memory  (or other computer readable storage medium) which stores computer executable instructions which are executable by one or more processor  and which, when executed, cause the processor to perform the method  or a portion thereof. In some example embodiments, these computer executable instructions may be contained in one or more module  such as, for example, the user profiling module  and\/or the document aggregation module . That is, in at least some example embodiments, one or more of these modules  (or other software modules) may contain instructions for causing the processor  to perform the method  of .","At , the profiling system  may create a topic set based on a document corpus containing a plurality of documents . The document corpus is a set of machine readable documents, such as text documents. The documents  may, for example, include news articles, blog posts, micro blog posts, comments, or other types of documents . In at least some example embodiments, the documents  may be formatted in a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format. Other document formats may also be used.","In at least some example embodiments, the document corpus may include documents  which are obtained from one or more document servers  which are connected to the profiling system  via a network , such as the Internet. The profiling system  may retrieve the documents  from the document servers . In at least some embodiments, the documents  forming the document corpus may be stored in memory  of the profiling system . In at least some such embodiments, at  the profiling system  may retrieve the documents  from memory.","Accordingly, at , the profiling system  may create a topic set. The topics in the topic set are topics which represent the content of at least some of the documents  in the document corpus. That is, the topics summarize the content of documents .","In at least some example embodiments, the profiling system  is configured to create a topic set which is organized in a hierarchical structure. The hierarchical structure includes a plurality of topic levels, including an upper topic level and a lower topic level. Each topic in the lower topic level is a subtopic of at least one of the topics in the upper topic level. That is, the topic set is organized in a hierarchical structure which includes a plurality of topic levels in which at least one topic which is at a lower relative topic level is a subtopic of another topic which is at a higher relative topic level. A topic which is a subtopic of another topic (i.e. a topic at the lower topic level) may be referred to as a child topic and the topic which has a subtopic (i.e. a topic at the upper topic level) may be referred to as a parent topic. A topic set which is organized in a hierarchical structure may be referred to as a hierarchical topic set.","Each subtopic (which may be referred to as a child topic) represents a narrower topic than its parent topic. That is, a topic at a lower topic level is narrower than at least one topic at an upper topic level. By way of example, a parent topic may be a sports topic and a subtopic (i.e. child topic) of that topic may be a hockey topic. In at least some embodiments, all documents  which relate to a child topic also relate to the parent topic for that child topic. However, all documents  which relate to the parent topic may not relate to one child topic of that parent topic.","In at least some example embodiments, the hierarchical topic set is created by the profiling system  to allow subtopics to have progressively narrower subtopics. That is, a topic may have a child topic and may also have a grandchild topic which is a topic which is narrower than the child topic. That is, the hierarchical structure may contain more than two topic levels. For example, in some example embodiments, there are three or more topic levels. For example, in some example embodiments, the hierarchical structure may include an upper topic level, a first lower topic level (which includes subtopics of topics in the upper topic level), and a second lower topic level (which includes subtopics of topics in the upper topic level and in the second lower topic level).","The profiling system  may create the topic set so that a topic may also have more than one subtopic. For example, a parent topic may be a sports related topic and that parent topic may have basketball, hockey, golf and baseball related subtopics.","In at least some example embodiments, at  the profiling system  may automatically create the topic set. That is, after obtaining the document corpus or a portion thereof, the profiling system  may automatically generate the topic set based on the documents  without further input or interaction from a user or administrator.","In at least some embodiments, the topics at the upper topic level may be created by the profiling system  before the topics at the lower topic level are created by the profiling system . That is, the topics which are at the upper topic level may be created and then, following the creation of the topics which are at the upper topic level, topics which are at the lower topic level may be created. In at least some embodiments, the upper topic level may include a plurality of topics.","In at least some example embodiments, a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) may be applied to the documents  in the document corpus in order to create the topic set. In other example embodiments, the topic set may be created by using a graph partitioning algorithm. Other algorithms may be used in other embodiments.","In at least some embodiments, the profiling system  may represent a topic as a bag-of-words vector. That is, each topic may be defined by a bag-of-words vector which represents the number of occurrences of words in documents  which are included in that topic. Accordingly, the bag-of words vector which represents the topic may be generated based on the content of documents  related to the topic.","In at least some embodiments, the topic set which is created at  is non-user specific. That is, the same topic set may be used to create an interest profile for a plurality of users.","At , the profiling system  monitors user interest in a plurality of documents  to identify one or more documents-of-interest for the user. That is, the profiling system  obtains interest information for a user which indicates the user's interest in the documents . The documents may be documents  which were included in the document corpus discussed with reference to  or may be other documents  which are not included in the document corpus.","At , the profiling system  attempts to determine whether a user is interested in each of a plurality of documents . As will be described below, such information may be used in order to create an interest profile  for the user so that the profiling system  (or another system) may predict user interest in other documents .","User behaviour in response to one or more documents  may be monitored for specific predetermined behaviour which is indicative of user interest in a document . For example, the profiling system  may provide a user with access to a document  (e.g. by presenting a link to the document  with a description of the content of the document  on a display). If the user accesses the document , the profiling system  may determine that the user is interested in the document . If, however, the user does not access the document , then the profiling system  may determine that the user is not interested in the document . A document which a user is determined to be interested in may be referred to as a document-of-interest.","Similarly, in some example embodiments, the profiling system  may monitor the amount of time that a user viewed a document . That is, the profiling system  may present the document  to a user on a display (e.g. a display associated with a user device  ()) and may then determine how much time elapsed between the time the document  was displayed and the time when the user ceased displaying the document .

The measure of topical interest is a measure of the degree to which a user may be interested in a topic. That is, the measure of topical interest may indicate whether a user is or is not interested in a topic. In at least some embodiments, the measure of topical interest for a topic is determined by comparing the content of each document-of-interest (i.e. all document  which the user being profiled appeared to be interested in) to that topic.

That is, the profiling system  may determine a measure of topical interest for topics which are both at the upper topic level and topics which are at the lower topic level (or which are at other topic levels).","The multi-leveled structure (i.e. hierarchical structure) of the topic set, may allow the profiling system  to pinpoint whether a user's interest in a topic at an upper topic level is caused by the user's interest in a topic at a lower topic level. By way of example, where an upper level topic relates to sports and a lower level topic relates to hockey, it may appear that the user is interested in sports when in fact they are only interested in a particular sport, such as hockey.

The measure of significance for a topic may also be referred to as a weight. In at least some embodiments, the measure of significance for a topic may be used to gauge the relative importance of a child topic with regard to its parent topic.

Heuristic features are non-content related features which are related to documents  which may affect a user's interest in that document. By way of example, in at least some embodiments, a heuristic feature which may be considered when generating an interest profile  for a user is a document type.

In at least some embodiments, the heuristic feature value is a number which is assigned based on the document type for a document-of-interest. For example, in at least some embodiments, a heuristic feature vector may be determined for a document-of-interest. The heuristic feature vector may include a plurality of heuristic feature values at predetermined positions within the heuristic feature vector. Each heuristic feature value may correspond to a different heuristic feature. For example, in at least some embodiments, a heuristic feature value at one position may be set to one if a document-of-interest is a blog post (or zero if it is not a blog post), another heuristic feature value at another position may be set to one if the document-of-interest is a micro-blog post (or zero if it is not a micro-blog post), another heuristic feature value at another position may be set to one if the document-of-interest is a comment (or zero if it is not a comment), another heuristic feature value at another position may be set to one if the document-of-interest is a news article (or zero if it is not a news article). Other heuristic feature values at other positions may be set based on other heuristic features not specifically discussed above.","As noted previously, the heuristic feature values for documents-of-interest may be considered when generating an interest profile  for a user. For example, the profiling system  may, in at least some embodiments, generate an interest profile  based on the heuristic feature values for the documents-of-interest.","A user's interest in a documents related to a topic may, at least in part, depend on heuristic features associated with those documents . For example, a user may prefer documents  of one document type when viewing documents which are related to one of the topics and may prefer documents  of another document type when viewing documents which are related to another one of the topics. That is, a user's interest in a document may not solely depend on the content of the document; it may also depend on heuristic features such as the document-type associated with the document.","In at least some embodiments, the profiling system may, at , create a per-topic heuristic feature profile for the user. The per-topic heuristic feature profile for a user specifies the degree to which documents-of-interest for a user associated with a topic accord with certain heuristic features.

For example, for each topic, the profiling system may independently determine the type of documents that a user is interested in for that topic. For example, a user may prefer traditional news sources for a weather related topic (and may not prefer comments, blog posts and\/or micro blog posts), but may prefer blogs for a sports related topic (and may not prefer traditional news sources).","Next, at , an interest profile  may be created for a user based on the per-topic heuristic feature profile for the user.
