Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an intermediate transfer member and an image forming apparatus using the same.","2. Description of the Related Art Known is an intermediate transfer belt for an image forming apparatus, which is produced by using a continuous extrusion molding method advantageous in cost and productivity, which includes at least an electroconductive filler, a thermoplastic resin, and an electroconductive resin incompatible with the thermoplastic resin, and which has a sea-island structure where discontinuous phases formed from the electroconductive resin are present in a continuous phase formed form the thermoplastic resin and the electroconductive filler is dispersed in the continuous phase.","However, the conventional intermediate transfer belt produced by the extrusion method has had many difficulties in ensuring desired electrical properties and desired flame retardancy at the same time. That is, the electroconductive resin added to the intermediate transfer belt for stabilizing its electroconductivity is mostly easily flammable, and there are cases where even if a thermoplastic resin having flame retardancy is used, the resultant intermediate transfer belt does not exhibit sufficient flame retardancy depending on the amount and the dispersion state of the electroconductive resin forming the discontinuous phases. In addition, there has also been a problem that addition of a flame retardant to an intermediate transfer belt elevates cost and involves bleed out of the flame retardant.","Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 2011-186035, 2011-191406, and 2002-202668 disclose respectively a seamless belt, a transfer belt, and an endless belt for an image forming apparatus each of which has a sea-island structure. However, any of these literatures has no description about dispersion of the sea-island structure, and has not yet been able to solve the problem with flame retardancy.","The present invention aims to solve the existing problems pertinent in the art and provide an intermediate transfer member including a layer containing a thermoplastic resin, an electroconductive resin, and electroconductive inorganic particles, and being capable of exhibiting desired electrical properties and desired flame retardancy at the same time.","The above problems are solved by the following invention 1):","1) an intermediate transfer member, including:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["a layer containing a thermoplastic resin, an electroconductive resin, and electroconductive inorganic particles,","wherein the layer has a sea-island structure where discontinuous phases formed from the electroconductive resin are present in a continuous phase formed from the thermoplastic resin,","wherein in a cross-sectional surface of the layer perpendicular to a rotation direction of the intermediate transfer member, the discontinuous phases formed from the electroconductive resin each have a cross-sectional shape of an ellipse, and a minor axis b of the ellipse is from 0.5 \u03bcm to 5.0 \u03bcm, and","wherein in the cross-sectional surface of the layer perpendicular to the rotation direction of the intermediate transfer member, a rate \u03b1 of a total area of the discontinuous phases formed from the electroconductive resin in an area of the cross-sectional surface of the layer perpendicular to the rotation direction of the intermediate transfer member is from 2.0% to 20.0%."]}}}},"According to the present invention, it is possible to provide an intermediate transfer member including a layer containing a thermoplastic resin, an electroconductive resin, and electroconductive inorganic particles, and being capable of exhibiting desired electrical properties and desired flame retardancy at the same time.","Hereinafter, the present invention 1) will be described in detail, but embodiments of the present invention 1) include the following 2) to 4), which will be described as well.","2) The intermediate transfer member described in 1), wherein in a cross-sectional surface of the layer in the rotation direction of the intermediate transfer member, the discontinuous phases formed from the electroconductive resin each have a cross-sectional shape of a circle, and a diameter e of the circle is from 0.5 \u03bcm to 5.0 \u03bcm, and\n\n","The intermediate transfer member of the present invention has a cross-sectional surface having a sea-island structure formed from the thermoplastic resin and the electroconductive resin, and satisfies the above requirement for the present invention 1) to attain desired electrical properties and desired flame retardancy at the same time.","The sea-island structure in the present invention is the same as the above-described conventional art in that discontinuous phases formed from the electroconductive resin are present in a continuous phase formed from the thermoplastic resin. However, the dispersion state of the electroconductive resin corresponding to the island is different from the conventional art, and the present invention is defined about this different point in terms of a cross-sectional state thereof.","The sea-island structure in the present invention cannot be obtained by using a combination of a thermoplastic resin and an electroconductive resin incompatible with the thermoplastic resin as in the above conventional techniques. It is necessary to select a proper combination of resins considering compatibility between the thermoplastic resin and the electroconductive resin. For example, when the thermoplastic resin and the electroconductive resin are selected so that the difference in solubility parameter (SP value) therebetween is 2.5 or more, and these resins are used to produce an intermediate transfer member by a twin screw extruder with a rotation speed set to be from 10 rpm to 40 rpm, the thus-produced intermediate transfer member can have an intended surface resistivity \u03c1S of 8\u2266log \u03c1S\u226613, which has been difficult to control by conventional techniques.","Examples of the thermoplastic resin used in the present invention include homopolymers of vinylidene fluoride, copolymers formed between vinylidene fluoride and other monomers, polyethylene-tetrafluoroethylene resins (ETFE), vinylidene fluoride-tetrafluoroethylene copolymer resins (PVDF-ETFE), polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE), tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene copolymers (FEP), a tetrafluoroethylene resin, and perfluoroalkylvinylether copolymers (PFA).","Examples of the electroconductive resin used in the present invention include polyethers, polyesters, polyamides, polyimides, polyethyleneglycols, polyethyleneoxides, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, and polymers each containing, as a main structural unit, a copolymer having two or more kinds of structures selected from the foregoing. Among these, polymers having a polyether unit are preferable. A SP value of the electroconductive resin is preferably within the range of from 7 to 11.","Examples of the electroconductive inorganic particles used in the present invention include carbon black, graphite, natural graphite, artificial graphite, tin oxide, titanium oxide, zinc oxide, nickel, and copper.","An average primary particle diameter of the electroconductive inorganic particles is preferably from 5 nm to 50 nm.","Examples of the intermediate transfer member of the present invention include an endless intermediate transfer belt, and an intermediate transfer drum.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The endless intermediate transfer belt  has flexibility and is freely deformable.  illustrates a state in which the endless intermediate transfer belt  is bridged around two rollers. A dimension of the endless intermediate transfer belt  is generally from about 100 mm to about 300 mm in outer diameter when it is formed to have a cylindrical shape, from about 100 mm to about 300 mm in width (W), and from about 50 \u03bcm to about 200 \u03bcm in thickness (T).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":"10"},"In a usual case, when the endless intermediate transfer belt is molded through continuous extrusion molding, spherical particles of the electroconductive resin dispersed are extended in parallel with the extrusion direction (i.e., in a perpendicular direction to the rotation direction of the endless intermediate transfer belt) at the time the materials having passed through a kneader are extruded to pass through a mold, and as a result the spherical particles of the electroconductive resin turn into elliptical particles. Hence, when the endless intermediate transfer belt is cut along the rotation direction of the endless intermediate transfer belt, each of the cross-sectional surfaces of the particles of the electroconductive resin is observed to be circular, and when the endless intermediate transfer belt is cut along a perpendicular direction to the rotation direction of the endless intermediate transfer belt, each of the cross-sectional surfaces of the particles of the electroconductive resin is observed to be elliptical. The sea-island structure in the endless intermediate transfer belt of the present invention produced through molding does not come to be in a geographically uniform state, nor do the shapes of the islands come to be geographically constant. Therefore, the terms \u201cellipse\u201d and \u201celliptical\u201d used in the present specification and the claims each refer to not only an ellipse in a literal sense, but also to a substantially elliptical shape that is near to an ellipse but has distortion. Similarly, the terms \u201ccircle\u201d and \u201ccircular\u201d used in the present specification and the claims each refer to not only a circle in a literal sense, but also to a substantially circular shape that is near to a circle but has distortion.","Here, the rotation direction of the intermediate transfer belt can also be expressed as a direction in which the surface of the intermediate transfer belt moves.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"When the endless intermediate transfer belt is cooled with liquid nitrogen and then cut along a surface perpendicular to the rotation direction thereof to expose its cross-sectional surface, and the resultant is subjected to electron staining using an appropriate staining agent such as ruthenium tetraoxide and observed as a backscattered electron image (compositional image) with a scanning electron microscope, it is possible to confirm the electroconductive resin as stained portions in the thermoplastic resin forming a continuous phase, as illustrated in . It is possible to observe that the cross-sectional surfaces of the electroconductive resin are substantially elliptical and also that the minor axis b thereof is from 0.5 \u03bcm to 5.0 \u03bcm and the expression: 1<a\/b\u226630 (where \u201ca\u201d denotes the major axis thereof) is satisfied. Moreover, when image processing software is used to calculate \u03b1 rate \u03b1 of a total area of discontinuous phases formed from the electroconductive resin in an area of the cross-sectional surface of the intermediate transfer member cut along the direction perpendicular to the rotation direction of the intermediate transfer member, the rate \u03b1 is from 2.0% to 20.0%.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"When the endless intermediate transfer belt is cooled with liquid nitrogen and then cut along the rotation direction thereof to expose its cross-sectional surface, and the resultant is subjected to electron staining using an appropriate staining agent such as ruthenium tetraoxide and observed as a backscattered electron image (compositional image) with a scanning electron microscope, it is possible to confirm a state where the electroconductive resin in the thermoplastic resin forming a continuous phase is dispersed to form a heterogeneous phase, as illustrated in .

Although a drum-shape photoconductor is employed in , a belt-shape photoconductor may be employed as well.","The photoconductors Y, C, M, and K are driven to rotate in the arrow direction in  while contacting the endless intermediate transfer belt  which is the surface-moving member. Each of the photoconductors Y, C, M, and K is composed of a relatively thin cylindrical electroconductive substrate, a photoconductive layer formed thereon, and a protective layer formed on the photoconductive layer. Here, an intermediate layer may be provided between the photoconductive layer and the protective layer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["1","1","1","1","2","2","2","2"]},"A charging device , a developing device , a transfer device , and a cleaning device  are disposed around the photoconductor  in this order along the direction in which the surface of the photoconductor  moves. The charging device  serves as a charging unit. The developing device  serves as a developing unit. The transfer device  serves as a transfer unit configured to transfer a toner image on the photoconductor  onto a recording medium or the endless intermediate transfer belt . The cleaning device  is configured to remove the un-transferred toner remaining on the photoconductor . A space is secured between the charging device  and the developing device  so that light emitted from an exposing device , which serves as an exposing unit configured to write an electrostatic latent image, can reach the photoconductor .","The charging device  is for negatively charging the surface of the photoconductor . In this example, the charging device  is equipped with a charging roller serving as a charging member which performs charging treatment by a so-called contact\/close charging method. That is, the charging device  makes the charging roller contact with or close to the surface of the photoconductor , and applies negative bias to the charging roller to charge the surface of the photoconductor . Specifically, the charging device  applies DC charging bias to the charging roller so that the surface potential of the photoconductor  becomes \u2212500 V. The charging bias may be one obtained by superposing AC bias on DC bias. Moreover, the charging device  may be equipped with a cleaning brush which cleans the surface of the changing roller.","Note that, the charging device  may be one obtained by winding a thin film around both end portions on the circumferential surface of a charging roller in the axial direction thereof, and this may be disposed so as to contact the surface of the photoconductor . In the case of this configuration, the surface of the charging roller and the surface of the photoconductor  are apart from each other by only the thickness of the film, which is a state where the surface of the charging roller is very close to and the surface of the photoconductor . In this state, charging bias applied to the charging roller generates electrical discharge between the surface of the charging roller and the surface of the photoconductor , so that the surface of the photoconductor  is charged by the generated electrical discharge.","The surface of the photoconductor  charged in this manner is exposed to light by the exposing device  to have an electrostatic latent image corresponding to each color. The exposing device  writes an electrostatic latent image corresponding to each color on the photoconductor  according to image information corresponding to each color.","Note that, in this example, the exposing device  employs a laser method, but may employ another method using an LED array and an imaging unit.","A toner replenished from a toner bottle Y, C, M, or K to the developing device  is conveyed by a developer supply roller and born on a developing roller . The developing roller is rotated to a developing region facing the photoconductor . In a region facing the photoconductor  (hereinafter referred to as \u201cdeveloping region\u201d), the surface of the developing roller moves at a higher linear velocity than that of the surface of the photoconductor  in the same direction as the photoconductor  moves. The toner on the developing roller is supplied to the surface of the photoconductor  while the developing roller is sliding on the surface of the photoconductor . At this time, a developing bias of \u2212300 V is applied to the developing roller from an unillustrated power source, whereby a developing electric field is formed in the developing region. Between the developing roller and the electrostatic latent image on the photoconductor , the toner on the developing roller will receive such an electrostatic force as to direct the toner toward the electrostatic latent image. This electrostatic force allows the toner on the developing roller to adhere to the electrostatic latent image on the photoconductor . By this adhesion, the electrostatic latent image on the photoconductor  is developed to be a toner image corresponding to each color.","The endless intermediate transfer belt  in the transfer device  is wound around three support rollers , , and  in a stretched manner, and is configured to rotate in the arrow direction in the figure. Toner images on the photoconductors Y, C, M, and K are transferred onto the endless intermediate transfer belt  on top of each other by an electrostatic transfer method.","The electrostatic transfer method used here employs a transfer roller  involving generation of less transfer dust particles, although a transfer charger may be employed. Specifically, primary transfer rollers Y, C, M, and K, each serving as a transfer device , are disposed on the rear surfaces of contact portions of the endless intermediate transfer belt with the photoconductors Y, C, M, and K. As a result, primary transfer nip portions are formed between the photoconductors Y, C, M, and K and portions of the endless intermediate transfer belt  which are pressed by the primary transfer rollers Y, C, M, and K. When the toner images on the photoconductors Y, C, M, and K are transferred onto the endless intermediate transfer belt , positive bias is applied to each of the primary transfer rollers . As a result, a transfer electric field is formed in each of the transfer nip portions, and the toner images on the photoconductors Y, C, M, and K are deposited electrostatically on and transferred onto the endless intermediate transfer belt .","An intermediate transfer belt cleaning device  is provided around the endless intermediate transfer belt  in order to remove toner particles remaining on the surface thereof. The intermediate transfer belt cleaning device  is configured to use a fur blush and a cleaning blade to collect unnecessary toner particles deposited on the surface of the endless intermediate transfer belt .","Note that, the collected unnecessary toner particles are conveyed from the intermediate transfer belt cleaning device  to a waste toner tank by an unillustrated conveyance unit.","A secondary transfer roller  is disposed to be in contact with the endless intermediate transfer belt  at a part of the endless intermediate transfer belt  around the support roller . A secondary transfer nip portion is formed between the endless intermediate transfer belt  and the secondary transfer roller , receiving sheets of recording paper serving as a recoding member at a predetermined timing. The sheets of recording paper are housed in a paper feeding cassette  located below the exposing device  in the figure, and are conveyed to the secondary transfer nip portion by, for example, a paper feeding roller  and a pair of registration rollers . The toner images superposed on top of each other on the endless intermediate transfer belt  are transferred onto the sheet of recording paper at one time in the secondary nip portion.","At the time of this secondary transfer, positive bias is applied to the secondary transfer roller , and the thus-generated transfer electrical field allows the toner images on the endless intermediate transfer belt  to be transferred onto the sheet of recording paper.","In the case where the toner image formed on the photoconductor  is transferred onto the endless intermediate transfer belt , it is preferable that the photoconductor  and the endless intermediate transfer belt  be pressed against each other. The pressure force for this is preferably from 10 N\/m to 60 N\/m.","A heat-fixing device  serving as a fixing unit is disposed downstream of the secondary transfer nip portion in the conveyance direction of the sheets of recording paper. The heat-fixing device  has a heating roller with a built-in heater and a pressure roller for applying pressure.","The sheet of recording paper having passed through the secondary transfer nip portion is sandwiched between these rollers to receive heat and pressure. As a result, the toner particles on the sheet of recording paper melt, and a toner image is fixed on the sheets of recording paper. After this fixing, the sheet of recording paper is discharged by a discharge roller  to a discharge tray disposed on the upper surface of the apparatus.","The developing roller serving as a developer bearing member is partially exposed from the opening of a casing of the developing device . Also, the developer used here is a one-component developer containing no carrier. The developing device  contains each of the corresponding color toners therein which have been replenished from toner bottles Y, C, M, and K illustrated in . The toner bottle Y, C, M, or K is configured to be attachable to and detachable from the body of an image forming apparatus so that each of the bottles can be replaced alone. This configuration can reduce users' expenditure since only the toner bottle Y, C, M, or K may be replaced at the time the toner is used up, and the other constituent members with service life remaining at that time can be used as they are.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"While being stirred by the supply roller serving as a developer supplying member, a developer (toner) in a developer container is conveyed to a nip portion in the developing roller serving as a developer bearing member which bears, on its surface, the developer to be supplied to the photoconductor . At this time, the supply roller and the developing roller rotate in opposite directions (counter rotation) in the nip portion. Moreover, the amount of the toner on the developing roller is regulated by a regulating blade , which serves as a developer layer regulating member disposed so as to contact the developing roller , and a toner thin layer is formed on the developing roller ","Also, the developer is rubbed in the nip portion between the supply roller and the developing roller , and in between the regulating blade and the developing roller , so that the amount of charges of the developer is controlled appropriately.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},"In general, among constituent elements such as an electrostatic latent image bearing member, an electrostatic latent image charging unit, and a developing unit, two or more of them are united together as a process cartridge. This process cartridge is configured to be attachable to and detachable from the main body of an image forming apparatus such as a copier or a printer.","The process cartridge illustrated in  has an electrostatic latent image bearing member, an electrostatic latent image charging unit, and the developing unit described in .","The above describes the case of the endless intermediate transfer belt, but applies also to the case of an intermediate transfer drum. However, as illustrated in , a general intermediate transfer drum  has a structure in which a semiconductive layer  is laminated on a cylindrical electroconductive base material , and hence this semimconductive layer is formed from the same materials to have the same structure as in the endless intermediate transfer belt.","The present invention will next be described in more detail by way of Examples and Comparative Examples.

The results are collectively shown in Tables 1 to 4. The units of the numerical values in the columns for the materials in the tables are % by mass.","[Localized State of Electroconductive Resin]","A cross-sectional surface of the endless intermediate transfer belt was analyzed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (S-4800, product of Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation). In addition, elemental analysis of the cross-sectional surface was performed with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDS) (an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer, product of EDAX Co.) to determine whether the electroconductive resin was localized or not.","A microtome (product of Leica Co.) was employed for preparation of samples of cross-sectional surfaces. The measurement results obtained using the SEM and the EDS were processed using image processing software \u201cIMAGE J\u201d to calculate \u03b1 rate of the electroconductive resin in the cross-sectional surface of the layer.","Here, \u201cbeing localized\u201d is a feature of a belt having desired electrical characteristics. A cross-sectional surface of such a belt is observed as a state where dispersed electroconductive resin particles are aggregated in the resin serving as a main component of the belt and are present in the form of a sea-island structure to form electroconductive paths. In contrast, \u201cbeing uniformly dispersed\u201d is a feature of a belt that does not exhibit desired electrical characteristics. Since the resin serving as a main component is uniformly compatible with an electroconductive resin, there are not electroconductive paths in the belt. In the present invention, a state of \u201cbeing localized\u201d is preferable.","[Resistivity]","Resistivity of the endless intermediate transfer belt was measured using HIRESTA UP MCP-HT450 model (product of Mitsubishi Chemical Analutech Co, Ltd.). Specifically, surface resistivity was measured at a plurality of measurement points of the endless intermediate transfer belt after application of voltage at 10 V or 500 V for 10 seconds, and the measurements were averaged to calculate an average, which was used as the surface resistivity. Volume resistivity was measured at a plurality of measurement points of the endless intermediate transfer belt after application of voltage at 100 V or 250 V for 10 seconds, and the measurements were averaged to calculate an average, which was used as the volume resistivity.","The surface resistivity and the volume resistivity falling within a range from 1.00\u00d710to 9.99\u00d710are regarded as pass. In Tables 5-1 and 5-2, the term \u201cOVER\u201d means that the surface resistivity or the volume resistivity is higher than 1.00\u00d710, and the term \u201cUNDER\u201d means that the surface resistivity or the volume resistivity is lower than 9.99\u00d710.","[Flame Retardancy]","A flammability test was performed according to the UL94 Standard. After applied ten and several times to a central part of the lower end of a specimen, a 6-inch-flame was taken away from the specimen. A burning time of the specimen was measured. Immediately after putting out the flame, a flame was applied again to the specimen for 20 seconds, and taken away from the specimen. A burning time, a glowing time, and the presence or absence of ignition of surgical cotton placed 12 inch below were recorded and judged.","Note that, the flame retardancy according to the UL94 Standard is ranked UL94V-2, UL94V-1, UL94V-0, UL945VB, or UL945VA in the order that the flame retardancy becomes higher, and UL94V-0, UL945VB, and UL945VA are regarded as
