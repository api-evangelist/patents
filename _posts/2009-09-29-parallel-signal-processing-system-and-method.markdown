title: Parallel signal processing system and method
abstract: A system and method for processing a plurality of channels, for example audio channels, in parallel is provided. For example, a plurality of telephony channels are processed in order to detect and respond to call progress tones. The channels may be processed according to a common transform algorithm. Advantageously, a massively parallel architecture is employed, in which operations on many channels are synchronized, to achieve a high efficiency parallel processing environment. The parallel processor may be situated on a data bus, separate from a main general purpose processor, or integrated with the processor in a common board or integrated device. All, or a portion of a speech processing algorithm may also be performed in a massively parallel manner.

Field of the Invention","The invention relates to the field of real time digital signal processing, particularly in a context of a general purpose computer executing a non-real-time operating system.","2. Background of the invention","While modern architecture general purpose central processing units (CPU's) typically have sufficient processing capability to perform signal processing tasks, to some degree, the various operating systems used to implement systems, such as Windows XP, Windows Vista, Linux and Unix-derivative, and Macintosh operating systems have difficulty supporting substantive real-time processing of complex signals representing large amounts of data to be processed, except perhaps particular data types for which the processor has special purpose instructions or hardware execution units. The various software processes handled by such processors compete for processing capability, making it difficult for a programmer or system designer to predict the real-time performance envelope of such a system with any degree of accuracy; therefore, the effective real-time performance is well below the theoretical processing envelope in a real-world system which is not particularly designed to be dedicated to real-time functionality. Therefore, as the real-time processing capacity increases, and the processing latency becomes more critical, general purpose computers with desktop or server operating systems are deemed less suitable for tasks that impose real-time requirements.","Typically, when one of two strategies is implemented to improve the real-time performance of a system: provide a coprocessor which handles only the required real-time tasks, and using a so-called real-time operating system (RTOS) with restrictions on other software which may execute in the same environment.","Existing telephone systems, such as the CallTrol Object Telephone Server (OTS\u2122), tend to require and rely upon special purpose hardware to handle real-time signal processing tasks for large numbers of concurrent voice channels. More information about this system can be found at www.calltrol.com\/CalltrolSDKWhitepaper6-02.pdf, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","3. Call Progress Tone Analysis","In many traditional systems, a single dedicated analog and\/or digital circuit is provided for each public switch telephone network (PSTN) line. See, e.g., Consumer Microcircuits Limited CMX673 datasheet, Clare M-985-01 datasheet. In other types of systems, a digital signal processor (coprocessor) is provided to handle signal processing tasks for multiple channels in parallel. Two particular tasks which require significant signal processing capability are call tone progress analysis and echo cancellation. See, e.g., Manish Marwah and Sharmistha Das, \u201cUNICA\u2014A Unified Classification Algorithm For Call Progress Tones\u201d (Avaya Labs, University of Colorado), en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Echo_cancellation, and www.voip-info.org\/wiki\/view\/Asterisk+echo+cancellation, each of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.","Call progress tone signals provide information regarding the status or progress of a call to customers, operators, and connected equipment. In circuit-associated signaling, these audible tones are transmitted over the voice path within the frequency limits of the voice band. The four most common call progress tones are: Dial tone; Busy tone; Audible ringback; and Reorder tone. In addition to these, there are a number of other defined tones, including for example the 12 DTMF codes on a normal telephone keypad. There may be, for example, about 53 different tones supported by a system. A call progress tone detector, may additionally respond to cue indicating Cessation of ringback; Presence\/cessation of voice; Special Information Tones (SITs); and Pager cue tones. Collectively, call progress tones and these other audible signals are referred to as call progress events. Call progress tone generation\/detection in the network is generally based on a Precise Tone Plan. In the plan, four distinctive tones are used singly or in combination to produce unique progress tone signals. These tones are 350 Hz, 440 Hz, 480 Hz and 620 Hz. Each call progress tone is defined by the frequencies used and a specific on\/off temporal pattern.","The ITU-T E.180 and E.182 recommendations define the technical characteristics and intended usage of some of these tones: busy tone or busy signal; call waiting tone; comfort tone; conference call tone; confirmation tone; congestion tone; dial tone; end of three-party service tone (three-way calling); executive override tone; holding tone; howler tone; intercept tone; intrusion tone; line lock-out tone; negative indication tone; notify tone; number unobtainable tone; pay tone; payphone recognition tone; permanent signal tone; preemption tone; queue tone; recall dial tone; record tone; ringback tone or ringing tone; ringtone or ringing signal; second dial tone; special dial tone; special information tone (SIT); waiting tone; warning tone; Acceptance tone; Audible ring tone; Busy override warning tone; Busy verification tone; Engaged tone; Facilities tone; Fast busy tone; Function acknowledge tone; Identification tone; Intercept tone; Permanent signal tone; Positive indication tone; Re-order tone; Refusal tone; Ringback tone; Route tone; Service activated tone; Special ringing tone; Stutter dial tone; Switching tone; Test number tone; Test tone; and Trunk offering tone. In addition, signals sent to the PSTN include Answer tone; Calling tone; Guard tone; Pulse (loop disconnect) dialing; Tone (DTMF) dialing, and other signals from the PSTN include Billing (metering) signal; DC conditions; and Ringing signal. The tones, cadence, and tone definitions, may differ between different countries, carriers, types of equipment, etc. See, e.g., Annex to ITU Operational Bulletin No. 781-1.II.2003. Various Tones Used In National Networks (According To ITU-T Recommendation E.180) (03\/1998).","Characteristics for the call progress events are shown in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Call Progress Event",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Characteristics","Frequencies","Temporal","Event"]},{"entry":["Name","(Hz)","Pattern","Reported After"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Dial Tone","350 + 440","Steady tone","Approximately 0.75"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"seconds"]},{"entry":["Busy Tone","480 + 620","0.5 seconds on\/","2 cycles of precise,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"0.5 seconds off","3 cycles of nonprecise"]},{"entry":["Detection","440 + 480","2 seconds on\/","2 cycles of precise or"]},{"entry":["Audible",{},"4 seconds off","nonprecise"]},{"entry":["Ringback","\u2014","\u2014","3 to 6.5 seconds after"]},{"entry":["Cessation",{},{},"ringback detected"]},{"entry":["Reorder","480 + 620","0.25 seconds ","2 cycles of precise,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"on\/0.25 ","3 cycles of nonprecise"]},{"entry":[{},{},"seconds off",{}]},{"entry":["Detection","200 to 3400","\u2014","Approximately 0.25 "]},{"entry":["Voice","\u2014","\u2014","to 0.50 seconds"]},{"entry":["Cessation",{},{},"Approximately 0.5 to"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"1.0 seconds after "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"voice detected"]},{"entry":["Special Information","See Table 2.","See Table 2.","Approximately 0.25 "]},{"entry":["Tones (SITs)",{},{},"to 0.75 seconds"]},{"entry":["Pager Cue Tones","1400","3 to 4 tones at","2 cycles of precise "]},{"entry":[{},{},"0.1 to 0.125","or any pattern of "]},{"entry":[{},{},"intervals","1400-Hz signals"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Dial tone indicates that the CO is ready to accept digits from the subscriber. In the precise tone plan, dial tone consists of 350 Hz plus 440 Hz. The system reports the presence of precise dial tone after approximately 0.75 seconds of steady tone. Nonprecise dial tone is reported after the system detects a burst of raw energy lasting for approximately 3 seconds.","Busy tone indicates that the called line has been reached but it is engaged in another call. In the precise tone plan, busy tone consists of 480 Hz plus 620 Hz interrupted at 60 ipm (interruptions per minute) with a 0.5 seconds on\/0.5 seconds off temporal pattern. The system reports the presence of precise busy tone after approximately two cycles of this pattern. Nonprecise busy tone is reported after three cycles.","Audible ringback (ring tone) is returned to the calling party to indicate that the called line has been reached and power ringing has started. In the precise tone plan, audible ringback consists of 440 Hz plus 480 Hz with a 2 seconds on\/4 seconds off temporal pattern. The system reports the presence of precise audible ringback after two cycles of this pattern.","Outdated equipment in some areas may produce nonprecise, or dirty ringback. Nonprecise ringback is reported after two cycles of a 1 to 2.5 seconds on, 2.5 to 4.5 seconds off pattern of raw energy. The system may report dirty ringback as voice detection, unless voice detection is specifically ignored during this period. The system reports ringback cessation after 3 to 6.5 seconds of silence once ringback has been detected (depending at what point in the ringback cycle the CPA starts listening).","Reorder (Fast Busy) tone indicates that the local switching paths to the calling office or equipment serving the customer are busy or that a toll circuit is not available. In the precise tone plan, reorder consists of 480 Hz plus 620 Hz interrupted at 120 ipm (interruptions per minute) with a 0.25 seconds on\/0.25 seconds off temporal pattern. The system reports the presence of precise reorder tone after two cycles of this pattern. Nnonprecise reorder tone is reported after three cycles.","Voice detection has multiple uses, and can be used to detect voice as an answer condition, and also to detect machine-generated announcements that may indicate an error condition. Voice presence can be detected after approximately 0.25 to 0.5 seconds of continuous human speech falling within the 200-Hz to 3400-Hz voiceband (although the PSTN only guarantees voice performance between 300 Hz to 800 Hz. A voice cessation condition may be determined, for example, after approximately 0.5 to 1.0 seconds of silence once the presence of voice has been detected.","Special Information Tones (SITs) indicate network conditions encountered in both the Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) and Inter-Exchange Carrier (IXC) networks. The tones alert the caller that a machine-generated announcement follows (this announcement describes the network condition). Each SIT consists of a precise three-tone sequence: the first tone is either 913.8 Hz or 985.2 Hz, the second tone is either 1370.6 Hz or 1428.5 Hz, and the third is always 1776.7 Hz. The duration of the first and second tones can be either 274 ms or 380 ms, while the duration of the third remains a constant 380 ms.

Most pager terminal equipment manufacturers use a 3- or 4-tone burst of 1400 Hz at 100- to 125-ms intervals. The system identifies three cycles of 1400 Hz at these approximate intervals as pager cue tones. To accommodate varying terminal equipment signals, tone bursts of 1400 Hz in a variety of patterns may also be reported as pager cue tones. Voice prompts sometimes accompany pager cue tones to provide instructions. Therefore, combinations of prompts and tones may be detected by configuring an answer supervision template to respond to both voice detection and pager cue tone detection.","A Goertzel filter algorithm may be used to detect the solid tones that begin fax or data-modem calls. If any of the following tones are detected, a \u201cmodem\u201d (fax or data) state is indicated: 2100 Hz, 2225 Hz, 1800 Hz, 2250 Hz, 1300 Hz, 1400 Hz, 980 Hz, 1200 Hz, 600 Hz, or 3000 Hz. Fax detection relies on the 1.5 seconds of HDLC flags that precede the answering fax terminal's DIS frame. DIS is used by the answering terminal to declare its capabilities. After a solid tone is detected, a V.21 receiver is used to detect the HDLC flags (01111110) in the preamble of DIS signal on the downstream side. If the required number of flags are detected, fax is reported. Otherwise, upon expiration of a timer, the call is may be determined to be a data modem communication. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,003,093, the entirety of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. See also, U.S. Pat. No. 7,043,006, expressly incorporated herein by reference.","Therefore, a well developed system exists for in-band signaling over audio channels, with a modest degree of complexity and some variability between standards, which themselves may change over time.","4. Graphics Processing Units","One known digital signal processor architecture, exemplified by the nVidia Tesla\u2122 C870 GPU device, provides a massively multi-threaded architecture, providing over 500 gigaflops peak floating point performance, and which is typically interfaced with a general purpose computer through a PCI x16 interface slot on a motherboard. This device encompasses a 128-processor computing core, and is typically provided as a coprocessor on a high speed bus for a standard personal computer platform. Similarly, the AMD\/ATI Firestream 9170 also reports 500 gigaflops performance from a GPU-type device with double precision floating point capability. Likewise, newly described devices (e.g., AMD Fusion) integrate a CPU and GPU on a single die with shared external interfaces.","The nVidia Tesla\u2122 GPU is supported by the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software development environment, which provides C language support. Typical applications proposed for the nVidia Tesla\u2122 GPU, supported by CUDA, are Parallel bitonic sort; Matrix multiplication; Matrix transpose; Performance profiling using timers; Parallel prefix sum (scan) of large arrays; Image convolution; 1D DWT using Haar wavelet; OpenGL and Direct3D graphics interoperation examples; Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines; Fast Fourier Transform; Binomial Option Pricing; Black-Scholes Option Pricing; Monte-Carlo Option Pricing; Parallel Mersenne Twister (random number generation); Parallel Histogram; Image Denoising; and a Sobel Edge Detection Filter. Therefore, the typical proposed applications are computer software profiling, matrix applications, image processing applications, financial applications, Seismic simulations; Computational biology; Pattern recognition; Signal processing; and Physical simulation. CUDA technology offers the ability for threads to cooperate when solving a problem. The nVidia Tesla\u2122 GPUs featuring CUDA technology have an on-chip Parallel Data Cache that can store information directly on the GPU, allowing computing threads to instantly share information rather than wait for data from much slower, off-chip DRAMs. Likewise, the software compile aspects of CUDA are able to partition code between the GPU and a host processor, for example to effect data transfers and to execute on the host processor algorithms and code which are incompatible or unsuitable for efficient execution on the GPU itself.","GPU architectures are generally well-suited to address problems that can be expressed as data-parallel computations: the same program is executed on many data elements in parallel, with high arithmetic intensity, the ratio of arithmetic operations to memory operations. Because the same program is executed for each data element, there is a lower requirement for sophisticated flow control; and because it is executed on many data elements and has high arithmetic intensity, the memory access latency can be hidden with calculations instead of big data caches. Thus, the GPU architecture typically provides a larger number of arithmetic logic units than independently and concurrently operable instruction decoders. Data-parallel processing maps data elements to parallel processing threads. Many applications that process large data sets such as arrays can use a data-parallel programming model to speedup the computations. In 3D rendering large sets of pixels and vertices are mapped to parallel threads. Similarly, image and media processing applications such as post-processing of rendered images, video encoding and decoding, image scaling, stereo vision, and pattern recognition can map image blocks and pixels to parallel processing threads. In fact, many algorithms outside the field of image rendering and processing are accelerated by data-parallel processing, from general signal processing or physics simulation to computational finance or computational biology.","While the GPU devices speed up data processing for appropriately selected and defined tasks, typically they are controlled through a general purpose operating system, and the offload of processed data from the GPU card back to the main processor is not treated as a real-time process. Thus, in a video environment, tasks are sent from the host processor to the GPU, and only if the usable output is fed directly from the GPU system, e.g., the video digital to analog converter (DAC), is the system treated as a real-time processing resource.","The Tesla\u2122 GPU device is implemented as a set of multiprocessors (e.g., 8 on the C870 device), each of which has a Single Instruction, Multiple Data architecture (SIMD): At any given clock cycle, each processor (16 per multiprocessor on the C870) of the multiprocessor executes the same instruction, but operates on different data. Each multiprocessor has on-chip memory of the four following types: One set of local 32-bit registers per processor, a parallel data cache or shared memory that is shared by all the processors and implements the shared memory space, a read-only constant cache that is shared by all the processors and speeds up reads from the constant memory space, which is implemented as a read-only region of device memory, and a read-only texture cache that is shared by all the processors and speeds up reads from the texture memory space, which is implemented as a read-only region of device memory. The local and global memory spaces are implemented as read-write regions of device memory and are not cached. Each multiprocessor accesses the texture cache via a texture unit. A grid of thread blocks is executed on the device by executing one or more blocks on each multiprocessor using time slicing: Each block is split into SIMD groups of threads called warps; each of these warps contains the same number of threads, called the warp size, and is executed by the multiprocessor in a SIMD fashion; a thread scheduler periodically switches from one warp to another to maximize the use of the multiprocessor's computational resources. A half-warp is either the first or second half of a warp. The way a block is split into warps is always the same; each warp contains threads of consecutive, increasing thread IDs with the first warp containing thread 0. A block is processed by only one multiprocessor, so that the shared memory space resides in the on-chip shared memory leading to very fast memory accesses. The multiprocessor's registers are allocated among the threads of the block. If the number of registers used per thread multiplied by the number of threads in the block is greater than the total number of registers per multiprocessor, the block cannot be executed and the corresponding kernel will fail to launch. Several blocks can be processed by the same multiprocessor concurrently by allocating the multiprocessor's registers and shared memory among the blocks. The issue order of the warps within a block is undefined, but their execution can be synchronized, to coordinate global or shared memory accesses. The issue order of the blocks within a grid of thread blocks is undefined and there is no synchronization mechanism between blocks, so threads from two different blocks of the same grid cannot safely communicate with each other through global memory during the execution of the grid.","A new trend seeks to integrate at least one GPU core and at least one CPU core in a single module, such as a single MCM or integrated circuit. This integration permits higher speed intercommunication, lower power consumption, and sharing of higher level resources, such as cache memory, external bus and memory driver circuitry, and other system elements. Such integration, which encompasses heterogeneous processing core aggregation, also permits parallel processing, speculative execution, and effectively races between different architectures and processing schemes.","5. Telephony Processing Platforms","Telephony control and switching applications have for many years employed general purpose computer operating systems, and indeed the UNIX system was originally developed by Bell Laboratories\/AT&T. There are a number of available telephone switch platforms, especially private branch exchange implementations, which use an industry standard PC Server platform, typically with specialized telephony support hardware. These include, for example, Asterisk (from Digium) PBX platform, PBXtra (Fonality), Callweaver, Sangoma, etc. See also, e.g., www.voip-info.org\/wiki\/. Typically, these support voice over Internet protocol (VOIP) communications, in addition to switched circuit technologies.","As discussed above, typical automated telephone signaling provides in-band signaling which therefore employs acoustic signals. A switching system must respond to these signals, or it is deemed deficient. Typically, an analog or digital call progress tone detector is provided for each channel of a switched circuit system. For VOIP systems, this functionality maybe provided in a gateway (media gateway), either as in traditional switched circuit systems, or as a software process within a digital signal processor.","Because of the computational complexity of the call progress tone analysis task, the density of digital signal processing systems for simultaneously handling a large number of voice communications has been limited. For example, 8 channel call progress tone detection may be supported in a single Texas Instruments TMS320C5510\u2122 digital signal processor (DSP). See, IP PBX Chip from Adaptive Digital Technologies, Inc. (www.adaptivedigital.com\/product\/solution\/ip_pbx.htm). The tone detection algorithms consume, for example, over 1 MIPS per channel for a full suite of detection functions, depending on algorithm, processor architecture, etc. Scaling to hundreds of channels per system is cumbersome, and typically requires special purpose dedicated, and often costly, hardware which occupy a very limited number of expansion bus slots of a PBX system.","Echo cancellation is typically handled near the client (i.e., microphone and speaker); however, in conferencing systems a server-side echo canceller is usually required to obtain good sound quality. Echo cancellation is often discussed with reference to speech signal communication between a \u201cnear end\u201d and a \u201cfar end\u201d. A person speaking at the \u201cfar end\u201d of a telephone connection has speech sent over the network to a person listening (and eventually speaking) at the \u201cnear end;\u201d a portion of the speech signal received at the near end is retransmitted to the far end, with a delay, resulting in an audible echo.","A typical network echo canceller employs an adaptive digital transversal filter to model the impulse response of the unknown echo channel so that the echo signal can be cancelled. The echo impulse response coefficients used in the transversal filter are updated to track the characteristics of the unknown echo channel. Various algorithms are known, and some are explicitly suited for parallel processing environments. See, e.g., US 20070168408, US 20020064139, U.S. Pat. No. 7,155,018, U.S. Pat. No. 6,963,649, U.S. Pat. No. 6,430,287, PCT\/US1998\/005854, Gan, W. S. Parallel Implementation of the Frequency Bin Adaptive Filter For Acoustical Echo Cancellation. September 1997, Proceedings of 1997 International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing, IEEE ICICS Volume 2, Issue, 9-12 Sep. 1997 Pages:754-757; \u201cAcoustic Echo Cancellation Algorithms and Implementation on the TMS320C8x\u201d, David Qi, Digital Signal Processing Solutions, Texas Instruments, SPRA063 May 1996, each of which is expressly incorporated herein in its entirety by reference thereto. It is noted that in a conferencing environment, client-side echoes, and line echoes may each be relevant, and a system must be adapted to deal with each. Therefore, it may be desired to handle echoes of in excess of 250 mS, for example 500 mS.","The present system and method improve the cost and efficiency of real time digital signal processing in a general purpose computing environment. In particular, one suitable use for the system is performing telephony signal processing functions, in which, for example, a general purpose computer supports a telephone switching system requiring real-time analysis of multiple voice channels in order to make switching decisions.","In one aspect of the invention, a massively parallel digital signal processor is employed to perform telephony in-band signaling detection and analysis and\/or echo cancellation as a coprocessor in a telephony system. In another aspect, a massively parallel coprocessor card is added to a telephony server application which is executed on a standard processor to increase call progress tone detection and\/or echo cancellation performance. Advantageously, the massively parallel processor may be adapted to execute standard software, such as C language, and therefore may perform both massively parallel tasks, and possibly serial execution tasks as well. Thus, a telephony system may be implemented on a single processor system, or within a distributed and\/or processor\/coprocessor architecture.","In a preferred embodiment exemplary of an aspect of the invention, performing call progress tone analysis, data blocks, each including a time slice from a single audio channel, are fed to the massively parallel processor, which performs operations in parallel on a plurality of time slices, generally executing the same instruction on the plurality of time slices. In this subsystem, real time performance may be effectively achieved, with a predetermined maximum processing latency. Further, in a telephone switching environment, the call progress tone analysis task is a limiting factor in achieving acceptable performance, and therefore the telephone switch, including the parallel processor, achieves acceptable performance for the entire telephone switching task. In this case, \u201creal-time\u201d means that the system appropriately processes calls (e.g., inbound and outbound) and in-band call progress tones according to specification.","In some cases, it is not necessary to detect tones on each audio channel continuously, and therefore the system may sample each channel sequentially. In addition, if a Fast Fourier Transform-type (FFT) algorithm is employed, the real (I) and imaginary (Q) channels may each be presented with data from different sources, leading to a doubling of capacity, or even represent qualitatively different high level processing tasks (which conform to the same FFT criteria). Thus, for example, using an nVidia Tesla\u2122 C870 GPU, with 128 processors, each processor can handle 8 (real only) or 16 (real and imaginary) audio channels, leading to a density of 1024 or 2048 channel call progress tone detection. Practically, the normal operation of the system is below theoretical capacity, to provide \u201cheadroom\u201d for other processing tasks and the like, and therefore up to about 800 voice channels may be processed, using a general purpose commercially available coprocessor card for a PC architecture.","For echo cancellation, with a 500 mS capacity and 8.4 kHz sampling rate, about 4200 samples per channel are processed. The processing may, in some cases, be consolidated with the CPT analysis, though a complete separation of these functions is possible. For example, some PC motherboards can host 2 or more PCIe 16\u00d7 cards, and therefore CPT call be implemented on one card, and echo cancellation (EC) on another. On the other hand, some of the processing is common for CPT and EC, for example an FFT transform. Therefore, the processing may also be combined. Likewise, two (or more) graphics processor boards may be linked through a so-called SLI interface, so that the power of two (or more) GPU devices may be employed in a single coordinated task.","The call progress tone detection coprocessor may, for example, be provided within a telephony server system, implementing a so-called private branch exchange (PBX) or the like.","For example, a PC architecture server may execute Asterisk PBX software under the Linux operating system. A software call is provided from the Asterisk PBX software to a dynamic linked library (DLL), which transfers data from a buffer in main memory containing time slices for the analog channels to be processed. For example, 2 mS each for 800 channels, at an 8.4 kHz sampling rate is provided (132 kB) in the buffer. The buffer contents is transferred to the coprocessor through a PCIe x16 interface, along with a call to perform an FFT for each channel, with appropriate windowing, and\/or using continuity from prior samples. The FFT may then be filtered on the coprocessor, with the results presented to the host processor, or the raw FFT data transferred to he host for filtering. Using a time-to-frequency domain transform, the signal energy at a specified frequency is converted to an amplitude peak at a specific frequency bin, which is readily extracted. Temporal analysis may also be performed in either the coprocessor or processor, though preferably this is performed in the processor. The analysis and data transform may also be used for speech recognition primitives, and for other processes.","A particular advantage of this architecture arises from the suitability of the call progress tone analysis to be performed in parallel, since the algorithm is deterministic and has few or no branch points. Thus, the task is defined to efficiently exploit the processing power and parallelism of a massively parallel processor.","The use of the system and architecture is not limited to telephony. For example, the architecture may be used for music signal processing, such as equalization, mixing, companding, and the like. Various sensor array data, such as sensors to detect fatigue and cracking in infrastructure, may be processed as well. In this later application, a problem may arise that the sensors are sensitive to dynamic and transient events, such as a truck rolling across a bridge, and it is that excitation which provides a signal for analysis. In that case, unless the system processes only a small portion of the data available, it is difficult to archive the unprocessed data which may come from hundreds of sensors (e.g., 500 sensors), each having a frequency response of 1 kHz or more (and thus a sampling rate of 2 kHz or more) with a dynamic range of, for example, 16 bits. In this example, the data throughput is 500\u00d72000\u00d72=2 MB per second, or 7.2 GB per hour, making remote processing unwieldly. After processing, for example to produce a model of the structure, the daily data may be reduced to less than 1 MB, or smaller. That is, the goal of the sensor array is to determine whether the structure is failing, and the raw data merely represents the excitation of the structure which is used to extract model parameters describing the structure. Changes in the model can be interpreted as changes in the structure, which may be innocent, such as snow cover, or insidious, such as stress fracture. Of course, other types of sensors, sensor arrays, or signal sources may also produce massive amounts of data to be processed and reduced, which necessarily requires real-time throughput as available from the present invention. The architecture therefore advantageously provides a signal processor which handles raw signal processing, the results of which may be passed, for example, to a general purpose processor which can perform a high-level analysis (as required) and general computational tasks, such as communications, mass storage control, human interface functionality, and the like.","Another use of the technology is real time control of complex systems, preferably, but not necessarily those with an array of similar components to be controlled. Thus, for example, a plurality of mechanical or electronic elements may be controlled, and each may be represented with a common model (possibly with different model parameters for each). Likewise, a set of actuators together controlling an interactive system may be controlled. Further, systems with similarly configured control loops, but not necessarily with interactive response, may be implemented. Banks of digital filters, for example, finite impulse response or infinite impulse response, or those with arbitrary topology, may be implemented. In each case, it is preferred that processors within any bank of multiprocessors mostly execute the same operation on data in parallel, though in some cases, this is not a hard limit of operation, and the broad parallelism may be sacrificed to process data separately. In some cases, there may be interactivity between the processing by a plurality of processors within a multiprocessor, or between data processed by different multiprocessors.","In another embodiment, a real system is implemented which specifically exploits the architecture of the real time parallel processor. Thus, for example if there are 128 processes arranged in 8 sets of 16 processors, then a rectangular actuator and\/or sensor array of these dimensions are implemented, with each processor handling a single actuator and\/or sensor of the 8\u00d716 array. Likewise, if there are distortions or symmetries which make the anticipated processing for some sets of actuators and\/or sensors more alike than others, these can be group together under a single multiprocessor. According to this same strategy, in some cases, control over an actuator and\/or sensor may be dynamically assigned to different processors based on a similarity of the processing task. Further, the system may be implemented such that actuators and\/or sensors are dynamically grouped based on an acceptability of identical algorithm execution (with possible exceptions), with or without post-correction of results. This may, in some cases, lead to a dithering, that is, an oscillation about a desired response, which may be tolerated, or later filtered.","The system and method may be used for processing supporting spatial arrays, for example antenna arrays. One preferred embodiment provides a dynamically adaptive synthetic aperture antenna in which each element of an array has, for example, a dynamically controllable gain and delay. If the elements of such an array have a large near-field pattern, a predetermined set of control parameters would be suboptimal, since the antenna will respond to dielectric elements within its near field. Therefore, in accordance with the present invention, the sets of parameters may be adaptively controlled to account for distortion and the like. Further, in some cases, transmit and receive antennas may be interactive, and thus require appropriate processing. In other cases, the performance of the antenna may be sensitive to the data transmitted or other aspects of the waveform, and the processing array can be used to shape the transmitted signal to \u201cpredistort\u201d the output for each element (or groups of elements), or to adapted the elements based on the transmitted or received signal characteristics.","In general, the processing architecture advantageously performs transforms on parallel data sets, which can then be filtered or simply processed as may be appropriate to yield a desired output. In some cases, the transformed signals are transformed at least twice, for example a transform and an inverse transform. In some cases, the transforms are Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms, though many other types of transformation are possible. A key feature of typical transforms is that the processing instructions and sequence is not data dependent, permitting a multiprocessor architecture to efficiently process many data streams in parallel. However, even in cases where there is a data dependency, such an architecture may provide advantages.","In cases where a set of heterogeneous cores are integrated, which access a common memory pool, a first type of processor may be employed to transform data in a data-dependent fashion, and a second processor may be employed to process the transformed data in a data-dependent fashion. For example, the data-dependent processor may be employed to make individual decisions regarding signal states, while the data-independent processor may be employed for filtering and orthoginalization of data representations.","One embodiment of the present invention provides a system and method for analyzing call progress tones and performing other types of audio band processing on a plurality of voice channels, for example in a telephone system. Examples of call progress tone analysis can be found at: www.commetrex.com\/products\/algorithms\/CPA.html; www.dialogic.com\/network\/csp\/appnots\/10117_CPA_SR6_HMP2.pdf; whitepapers.zdnet.co.uk\/0,1000000651,260123088p,00.htm; and www.pikatechnologies.com\/downloads\/samples\/readme\/6.2%20-%20Call%20Progress%20Analysis%20-%20ReadMe.txt.","In a modest size system for analyzing call progress tones, there may be hundreds of voice channels to be handled are simultaneously. Indeed, the availability of a general purpose call progress tone processing system permits systems to define non-standard or additional signaling capabilities, thus reducing the need for out of band signaling. Voice processing systems generally require real time performance; that is, connections must be maintained and packets or streams forwarded within narrow time windows, and call progress tones processed within tight specifications.","An emerging class of telephone communication processing system, implements a private branch exchange (PBX) switch, which employs a standard personal computer (PC) as a system processor, and employs software which executes on a general purpose operating system (OS). For example, the Asterisk system runs on the Linux OS. More information about Asterisk may be found at Digium\/Asterisk, 445 Jan Davis Drive NW, Huntsville, Ala. 35806, 256.428.6000 asterisk.org\/downloads. Another such system is: \u201cYate\u201d (Yet Another Telephony Engine), available from Bd. Nicolae Titulescu 10, Bl. 20, Sc. C, Ap. 128 Sector 1, Bucharest, Romania yate.null.ro\/pmwiki\/index.php?n=Main.Download.","In such systems, scalability to desired levels, for example hundreds of simultaneous voice channels, requires that the host processor have sufficient headroom to perform all required tasks within the time allotted. Alternately stated, the tasks performed by the host processor should be limited to those it is capable of completing without contention or undue delay. Because digitized audio signal processing is resource intensive, PC-based systems have typically not implemented functionality, which requires per-channel signal processing, or offloaded the processing to specialized digital signal processing (DSP) boards. Further, such DSP boards are themselves limited, for example 8-16 voice processed channels per DSP core, with 4-32 cores per board, although higher density boards are available. These boards are relatively expensive, as compared to the general purpose PC, and occupy a limited number of bus expansion slots.","The present invention provides an alternate to the use of specialized DSP processors dedicated to voice channel processing. According to one embodiment, a massively parallel processor as available in a modern video graphics processor (though not necessarily configured as such) is employed to perform certain audio channel processing tasks, providing substantial capacity and versatility. One example of such a video graphics processor is the nVidia Tesla\u2122 GPU, using the CUDA software development platform (\u201cGPU\u201d). This system provides 8 banks of 16 processors (128 processors total), each processor capable of handling a real-time fast Fourier transform (FFT) on 8-16 channels. For example, the FFT algorithm facilitates subsequent processing to detect call progress tones, which may be detected in the massively parallel processor environment, or using the host processor after downloading the FFT data. One particularly advantageous characteristic of implementation of a general purpose FFT algorithm rather than specific call tone detection algorithms is that a number of different call tone standards (and extensions\/variants thereof) may be supported, and the FFT data may be used for a number of different purposes, for example speech recognition, etc.","Likewise, the signal processing is not limited to FFT algorithms, and therefore other algorithms may also or alternately be performed. For example, wavelet based algorithms may provide useful information.","The architecture of the system provides a dynamic link library (DLL) available for calls from the telephony control software, e.g., Asterisk. An application programming interface (API) provides communication between the telephony control software (TCS) and the DLL. This TCS is either unmodified or minimally modified to support the enhanced functionality, which is separately compartmentalized.","The TCS, for example, executes a process which calls the DLL, causing the DLL to transfer a data from a buffer holding, e.g., 2 mS of voice data for, e.g., 800 voice channels, from main system memory of the PC to the massively parallel coprocessor (MPC), which is, for example an nVidia Tesla\u2122 platform. The DLL has previously uploaded to the MPC the algorithm, which is, for example, a parallel FFT algorithm, which operates on all 800 channels simultaneously. It may, for example, also perform tone detection, and produce an output in the MPC memory of the FFT-representation of the 800 voice channels, and possibly certain processed information and flags. The DLL then transfers the information from the MPC memory to PC main memory for access by the TCS, or other processes, after completion.","While the MPC has massive computational power, it has somewhat limited controllability. For example, a bank of 16 DSPs in the MPC are controlled by a single instruction pointer, meaning that the algorithms executing within the MPC are generally not data-dependent in execution, nor have conditional-contingent branching, since this would require each thread to execute different instructions, and thus dramatically reduce throughput. Therefore, the algorithms are preferably designed to avoid such processes, and should generally be deterministic and non-data dependent algorithms. On the other hand, it is possible to perform contingent or data-dependent processing, though the gains from the massively parallel architecture are limited, and thus channel specific processing is possible. Advantageously, implementations of the FFT algorithm are employed which meet the requirements for massively parallel execution. For example, the CUDA\u2122 technology environment from nVidia provides such algorithms. Likewise, post processing of the FFT data to determine the presence of tones poses a limited burden on the processor(s), and need not be performed under massively parallel conditions. This tone extraction process may therefore be performed on the MPC or the host PC processor, depending on respective processing loads and headroom.","In general, the FFT itself should be performed in faster-than real-time manner. For example, it may be desired to implement overlapping FFTs, e.g., examining 2 mS of data every 1 mS, including memory-to-memory transfers and associated processing. Thus, for example, it may be desired to complete the FFT of 2 mS of data on the MPC within 0.5 mS. Assuming, for example, a sampling rate of 8.4 kHz, and an upper frequency within a channel of 3.2-4 kHz, the 2 mS sample, would generally imply a 256 point FFT, which can be performed efficiently and quickly on the nVidia Tesla\u2122 platform, including any required windowing and post processing.","Therefore, the use of the present invention permits the addition of call progress tone processing and other per channel signal processing tasks to a PC based TCS platform without substantially increasing the processing burden on the host PC processor, and generally permits such a platform to add generic call progress tone processing features and other per channel signal processing features without substantially limiting scalability.","Other sorts of parallel real time processing are also possible, for example analysis of distributed sensor signals such as \u201cMotes\u201d or the like. See, en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Smartdust. The MPC may also be employed to perform other telephony tasks, such as echo cancellation, conferencing, tone generation, compression\/decompression, caller ID, interactive voice response, voicemail, packet processing and packet loss recovery algorithms, etc.","Similarly, simultaneous voice recognition can be performed on hundreds of simultaneous channels, for instance in the context of directing incoming calls based on customer responses at a customer service center. Advantageously, in such an environment, processing of particular channels maybe switched between banks of multiprocessors, depending on the processing task required for the channel and the instructions being executed by the multiprocessor. Thus, to the extent that the processing of a channel is data dependent, but the algorithm has a limited number of different paths based on the data, the MPC system may efficiently process the channels even where the processing sequence and instructions for each channel is not identical.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Massively multiplexed voice data  is received at network interface . The network could be a LAN, Wide Area Network (WAN), Prime Rate ISDN (PRI), a traditional telephone network with Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), or any other suitable network. This data may typically include hundreds of channels, each carrying a separate conversation and also routing information. The routing information may be in the form of in-band signaling of dual frequency (DTMF) audio tones received from a telephone keypad or DTMF generator. The channels may be encoded using digital sampling of the audio input prior to multiplexing. Typically voice channels will come in 20 ms frames.","The system according to a preferred coprocessor embodiment includes at least one host processor , which may be programmed with telephony software such as Asterisk or Yate, cited above. The host processor may be of any suitable type, such as those found in PCs, for example Intel Pentium Core 2 Duo or Quadra, or AMD Athlon X2.

discussed above uses a separate host and massively parallel processing array, it is clear that the processing array may also execute general purpose code and support general purpose or application-specific operating systems, albeit with reduced efficiency as compared to an unbranched signal processing algorithm. Therefore, it is possible to employ a single processor core and memory pool, thus reducing system cost and simplifying system architecture. Indeed, one or more multiprocessors may be dedicated to signal processing, and other(s) to system control, coordination, and logical analysis and execution. In such a case, the functions identified above as being performed in the host processor would be performed in the array, and, of course, the transfers across the bus separating the two would not be required.","The present invention may be applied to various parallel data processing algorithms for independent or interrelated data streams. For example, telephone conversions, sensor arrays, communications from computer network components, image processing, tracking of multiple objects within a space, object recognition in complex media or multimedia, and the like.","One particular advantage of the present architecture is that it facilitates high level interaction of multiple data streams and data fusion. Thus for example, in a telephone environment, the extracted call progress tones may be used by a call center management system to control workflows, scheduling, pacing, monitoring, training, voice stress analysis, and the like, which involve a an interaction of a large number of concurrent data streams which are each nominally independent. On the other hand, in a seismic data processor, there will typically be large noise signals imposed on many sensors, which must be both individually processed and processor for correlations and significant events. Therefore, another advantage of the integration of the real time parallel data processing and analysis within a computing platform, that supports a general purpose (typically non-real time) operating system, is that a high level of complex control may be provided based on the massive data flows through the real-time subsystem, within an integrated platform, and often without large expense, using available computational capacity efficiently.","From a review of the present disclosure, other modifications will be apparent to persons skilled in the art. Such modifications may involve other features which are already known in the design, manufacture and use of telephony engines and parallel processing and which may be used instead of or in addition to features already described herein. Although claims have been formulated in this application to particular combinations of features, it should be understood that the scope of the disclosure of the present application also includes any novel feature or novel combination of features disclosed herein either explicitly or implicitly or any generalization thereof, whether or not it mitigates any or all of the same technical problems as does the present invention.
