title: System and method for adjusting image parameters based on device tracking
abstract: A system for automatically adapting image acquisition parameters based on imaging and/or device tracking feedback is provided. An example system includes a subsystem for acquiring images (e.g., MR) of an object and tracking data for a device (e.g. catheter) inserted into the object and controllably moveable within the object. The system also includes an image processor for processing the images and a device tracking logic for computing device parameters (e.g., speed, direction of travel, rate of speed change, position, position relative to a landmark, device orientation). Based on the images and device parameter computations, a parameter control and adjustment logic can automatically update one or more image acquisition parameters that control the image acquisition subsystem.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 60\/381,204 filed May 17, 2002, entitled System and Method for Adjusting Image Parameters Based on Device Tracking.","The systems, methods, application programming interfaces (API), graphical user interfaces (GUI), data packets, and computer readable media described herein relate generally to the magnetic resonance imaging arts. They find application to methods and systems for acquiring data (e.g., image data and\/or device tracking data) and adjusting acquisition parameters based on tracking information. Although a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system is described herein, other applications and use with other imaging systems (e.g., computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET)) will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.","Locating devices (e.g., catheters) inserted into the human body via MRI is known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,289,233 titled High Speed Tracking of Interventional Devices Using an MRI System describes one method for locating an inserted device (e.g., needle in needle biopsy). Similarly, the article Real-Time Interactive Catheter Tracking by MRI, Panych et. al, International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 1999, Poster 1948, describes tracking catheter position substantially in real time. The Panych method even goes so far as to facilitate repositioning and re-orientation of a scan plane based on catheter position.","Although catheter locating and\/or tracking by different methods has been described elsewhere, these descriptions have not related to making automatic adjustments to image acquisition parameters based on selected motion feed back and\/or feedback of a more general nature (e.g., catheter tip location) acquired during image acquisition. Thus, example systems and methods described herein relate to automatically adjusting image acquisition parameters (e.g. field of view, resolution) based on information derived from tracking catheter motion (e.g., speed, direction of travel, location relative to underlying anatomy), not simply from catheter position. This facilitates reducing and\/or eliminating the need to manually adjust scan plane parameters and\/or image acquisition parameters. Thus, an imager (e.g., physician), can adjust imaging parameters through an automated human\/machine interface substantially in real time, where the human\/machine interface is customizable.","This section presents a simplified summary of methods, systems, data packets, computer readable media and so on for automatically adjusting image acquisition parameters based on motion feedback derived during MRI imaging, to facilitate providing a basic understanding of these items. This summary is not an extensive overview and is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the methods, systems, computer readable media, and so on or to delineate the scope of these items. This summary provides a conceptual introduction in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","In one example, the device tracking and image analysis components of the systems and methods may be software that is executable by one or more computers, computer components, and\/or other processing devices. The software may be stored in a computer readable medium such as a magnetic disk, digital compact disk, electronic memory, persistent and\/or temporary memories, and others as known in the art. The systems and methods may also be implemented as hardware and\/or a combination of hardware and software.","By way of illustration, a catheter insertion speed can be related to a clinician's intentions. For example, a higher catheter speed may indicate that a clinician is interested in guiding a catheter with a resulting desire for survey imaging. The survey imaging may be characterized, for example, by a large field of view (FOV), a high temporal resolution, a lower spatial resolution, a lower signal to noise ratio (SNR), and a contrast that highlights anatomical structures. The guiding may be employed while navigating to a landmark and\/or while surveying for interesting locations, for example. Similarly, a slower catheter speed may indicate that the clinician is interested in detailed inspection imaging. Detailed imaging may be characterized, for example, by a smaller FOV, a lower temporal resolution, a high spatial resolution, a high SNR, and a contrast that facilitates characterizing pathology. In addition, cessation of catheter movement may indicate that the clinician is interested in a highest level of detail in imaging for use in specific tissue characterization. This may be characterized by a sequence of different tissue contrasts acquired at a small FOV, high spatial resolution, and low temporal resolution. Which type of imaging occurs can be related to catheter movement and can be controlled by image acquisition parameter control software. The image acquisition parameters can be set and reset in response to catheter motion information derived from MR signal acquisition, providing improvements over systems that simply identify and\/or describe a catheter position.","Certain illustrative example methods, systems, computer readable media and so on are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These examples are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the methods, systems, computer readable media and so on may be employed and thus are intended to be inclusive of equivalents. Other advantages and novel features may become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","Example systems, methods, computer media, and so on are now described with reference to the drawings, where like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to facilitate thoroughly understanding the methods, systems, and so on. It may be evident, however, that the methods, systems, computer readable media, and so on can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to simplify description.","As used in this application, the term \u201ccomputer component\u201d refers to a computer-related entity, either hardware, firmware, software, a combination thereof, or software in execution. For example, a computer component can be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program and a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be computer components. One or more computer components can reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a computer component can be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers.","\u201cComputer communications\u201d, as used herein, refers to a communication between two or more computers and can be, for example, a network transfer, a file transfer, an applet transfer, an email, a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) message, a datagram, an object transfer, a binary large object (BLOB) transfer, and so on. A computer communication can occur across, for example, a wireless system (e.g., IEEE 802.11), an Ethernet system (e.g., IEEE 802.3), a token ring system (e.g., IEEE 802.5), a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a point-to-point system, a circuit switching system, a packet switching system, and so on.","\u201cLogic\u201d, as used herein, includes but is not limited to, hardware, firmware, software and\/or combinations of each to perform a function(s) or an action(s). For example, based on a desired application or needs, logic may include a software controlled microprocessor, discrete logic like an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or other programmed logic device. Logic may also be fully embodied as software.","An \u201coperable connection\u201d is one in which signals and\/or actual communication flow and\/or logical communication flow may be sent and\/or received. Usually, an operable connection includes a physical interface, an electrical interface, and\/or a data interface, but an operable connection may include differing combinations of these or other types of connections sufficient to allow operable control.","\u201cSignal\u201d, as used herein, includes but is not limited to, one or more electrical or optical signals, analog or digital, one or more computer instructions, a bit or bit stream, or the like.","\u201cSoftware\u201d, as used herein, includes but is not limited to, one or more computer readable and\/or executable instructions that cause a computer or other electronic device to perform functions, actions and\/or behave in a desired manner. The instructions may be embodied in various forms like routines, algorithms, modules, methods, threads, and\/or programs. Software may also be implemented in a variety of executable and\/or loadable forms including, but not limited to, a stand-alone program, a function call (local and\/or remote), a servelet, an applet, instructions stored in a memory, part of an operating system or browser, other executable instructions, and the like. It is to be appreciated that the computer readable and\/or executable instructions can be located in one computer component and\/or distributed between two or more communicating, co-operating, and\/or parallel processing computer components and thus can be loaded and\/or executed in serial, parallel, massively parallel, and other manners. It will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art that the software form may depend, for example, on requirements of a desired application, on the environment in which it runs, and\/or on the desires of a designer\/programmer or the like.","\u201cTR\u201d as used herein refers to repetition time.","\u201cTE\u201d as used herein refers to echo time.","With reference to , one example system that automatically adjusts image acquisition parameters based on device tracking information is shown. A magnetic resonance (MR) system  scans and collects radio frequency signals from an object  being imaged. The scan can be performed, for example, using MR techniques known in the art. The scan is undertaken in accordance with pre-determined, configurable, acquisition parameters  that define settings in the MR system. Example parameters include, but are not limited to, image slice position, slice orientation, slice thickness, slice rotation, scan pattern, table motion, FOV, image resolution, type of acquisition (e.g., spin echo, steady state), tip angle, image contrast, temporal resolution, spatial resolution, bandwidth, trajectory, TR, TE, and so on.","The object  (e.g., human, animal) has a device  (e.g., catheter) inserted into it. The device  is selectively and controllably moved within the object . For example, a physician and\/or operator can position and reposition the device . An image processor  generates images from the collected signal data using one or more transformation techniques known in the art. Device tracking logic  is configured to determine various properties of the catheter, (e.g., position, speed, speed rate of change, direction of travel, orientation, distance from a landmark). In one example, catheter tracking information is obtained by determining the catheter location in one or more first images of the object  obtained by the MR system  and comparing that location to the catheter location in one or more second images. In another example, rather than obtaining catheter tracking information from the imaging data, catheter tracking information is derived from catheter tracking data acquired during the MRI. Thus, a data analysis\/reconstruction system (not illustrated) may be added to the system to facilitate device tracking where the device tracking does not involve image data.","Identifying the time intervals and catheter displacements between images facilitates determining the catheter speed, rate of change of speed, direction of travel, and so on. In one example, the device tracking data sets contain information from which an image can be reconstructed. In another example, the device tracking data sets contain information sufficient to track the catheter but from which an image could not be reconstructed. Thus, less data than is necessary to reconstruct an image may suffice to track the inserted device.","A parameter control and adjustment logic  may dynamically modify the acquisition parameters  for subsequent imaging. The dynamic modification can be based, at least in part, on the catheter position, speed, rate of change of speed, and direction of travel, for example. By way of illustration, if the catheter speed decreases, the image acquisition resolution may be increased. This example correlation is based on a presumption that if the catheter slows or stops moving in a region, it may be in a more interesting region than when the catheter is moving quickly through a region. Thus, higher resolution images may be desired. Other types of correlations and relationships between the catheter properties and the acquisition parameters  based on other presumptions or desires may also be predetermined in a similar manner and stored in the parameter control and adjustment logic . A manual override like a switch (e.g., manual, voice operated, foot operated) may also be included. In general, the system can make automatic adjustments to the image acquisition parameters  based on selected feedback from the acquisition process. The feedback can include, but is not limited to, catheter position, catheter speed, rate of change of catheter speed, catheter direction of travel, local object temperature, and so on. Thus, the systems and methods described herein facilitate novel ways for a user to interface with a scanner. For example, the user can adjust various parameters using only the catheter, whereas conventionally the user may have to employ a keyboard or mouse to interface with the scanner. By way of illustration, rather than modifying an imaging parameter based on catheter speed, the user may adjust contrast or switch pulse sequences by manipulating the catheter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1","2","3","4","5","5","6","5","4","6","7","5","8","9"],"sub":["S","P ","R"]},"The example systems shown in  change how acquisition parameters are updated as compared to conventional systems that change parameters manually. Initial acquisition parameters may be programmed in a configurable manner that attempts to anticipate user needs. Then, values for the acquisition parameters are recomputed based on information that comes back during the acquisition process, in other words, feedback from the acquired images and\/or tracking data. In one example, as a catheter is inserted, it may be desired to have image slices follow the catheter. In this case, the system determines the catheter tip location and, substantially in real-time, reprograms the acquisition parameters. It may also be desired to know the location of a slice and its orientation so that the slice position and orientation can follow the catheter.","One application of the systems and methods described herein is to facilitate characterizing vulnerable arterial plaque via MRI. Unfortunately, the vast dimensions of the vascular tree have conventionally prevented high resolution imaging from being performed at many locations. Using an example system, as a doctor interested in examining arterial plaque inserts a catheter into a patient, the MR system images an artery wall using a first set of image acquisition parameters (e.g., FOV, resolution). This facilitates initially locating candidate sites for vascular disease. The MR system also images the location of the catheter. If the doctor encounters an area that warrants closer inspection, the doctor can slow the catheter movement, or, after passing over an area that looked interesting, can back up to get a closer look. These changes in motion can be identified by device tracking logic and interpreted by parameter control and adjustment logic so that subsequent images are taken with a second set of image acquisition parameters (e.g., smaller FOV, higher resolution). When the close inspection is done, the catheter speed will again increase as the physician travels to a new location, and thus the image acquisition parameters may return to the first set of parameters. For example, when the catheter speed decreases, the parameter control and adjustment logic may interpret the changes as a desire to have the acquisition parameters automatically change to facilitate taking higher resolution images or taking images with different contrast still centered on the catheter location. The system is configured so that the hardware for determining the coil position and orientation, and the software that controls the MR acquisition work interactively to provide feedback information to the system control software that facilitates determining whether changes should be made to how the acquisition is performed.","In another example, if the catheter stops, the system may automatically change the field of view. A smaller FOV facilitates taking more magnified views of the anatomy around the catheter. Thus, in vascular applications, as a user navigates the catheter through a patient, they can \u201czoom in\u201d and \u201czoom out\u201d using a natural, configurable human\/machine interface based on correlating catheter motion with user intention. In this example correlation, the FOV is linked to the catheter speed and\/or motion.","While an MR system is described in , it is to be appreciated that imaging parameters can be recomputed from feedback produced in other systems like CT systems. In CT scanning, a gantry rotates a patient table and moves the patient. Similarly, in one type of MR, the table upon which the object to be imaged is located may move while image acquisition stays at one position, for example. By programming parameter control logic, the acquisition path information can interactively cause the acquisition pitch to change, to speed up or slow down the table motion. Changing table motion parameters is also applicable to other types of imaging systems.","In another example, the systems and methods automatically adjust, substantially in real-time, designated image scanning parameter values, based on the catheter location relative to previously identified underlying anatomy. By way of illustration, as a catheter tip approaches the root of the aorta and coronary artery origin, the systems and methods may automatically decrease the field of view and increase the spatial resolution to facilitate selecting the artery with the catheter tip.","In one example, continuous 3D device localization via fiducial coils is used not only to automatically update scan plane positions, but also to determine the speed of an interventional device (e.g., catheter). The system can then use the device speed to adjust values of designated imaging scan plane parameters substantially in real time. For example, as the movement of the device is slowed, the system can be set to automatically increase the resolution or signal to noise based on the velocity of the device, while simultaneously affecting a decrease in frame rate and\/or FOV.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"The adaptive image parameter capabilities can be incorporated into software in an MR system. The localization feedback from multiple time points is used to calculate the speed of the device. The number of time points used for a given speed calculation is a variable that is adjustable through the scanner user interface, which allows a user to adjust how sensitive the system will be to changes in device speed. The system uses the output of the speed calculation to adjust user-defined imaging parameters. The parameter values are updated before acquiring slice images.","Thus, the process flow in  includes, at , establishing initial image acquisition parameters. For example, parameters  can include, but are not limited to, bandwidth, resolution, FOV, slice thickness, frame rate, and so on. At , an image is acquired. The image can include data associated with a device inserted into an object to be imaged.","At , device localization occurs. As described above, and in references known in the art, localization can be achieved by various manners. Once device localization has occurred, at , scan plan position and other imaging aspects can be updated based, at least in part, on the localization of .","At , device parameters including, but not limited to, speed, rate of change of speed (acceleration), direction of travel, distance from a landmark, device orientation, and the like, can be computed. Based on these computations, at , the parameters  can be updated for the next iteration of the process. In one example, the device parameters are computed from image data. In another example, device parameters are computed from device tracking data, where the device tracking data would likely not suffice for image reconstruction.","In one example, the adaptive scan plane parameter values  are set (e.g., established, updated) according to a sigmoidal function like that illustrated by curve  in . It is to be appreciated that the sigmoidal function illustrated in  is but one example function and that other functions and function types can be used to facilitate adjusting image parameter values. The upper and lower asymptotes Pand Pprevent parameters from being set in ranges that would cause the pulse sequence to exceed hardware limitations. These functions also have static sensitivities S and default set points that can be adjusted via a standard user interface. Mathematically, these properties are characterized by the following equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"V"}},{"msub":{"mi":["P","min"]},"mo":"+","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":["P","max"]},{"mi":["P","min"]}],"mo":"-"},{"mn":"1","mo":"+","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":"-","mi":"S"},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"V","mo":"-","msub":{"mi":["V","o"]}}}],"mo":"*"}}}]}}],"mo":"="}}}},"where V is the device velocity, P(v) is the image parameter value, Vis the velocity set point, S is the static sensitivity of the function, and Pand Pare the lower and upper limits on the acceptable values for the parameter, respectively.

For example, the location in a first image taken at a first, known time, can be compared with its location in a second image taken at a second, known time, and the difference in location coupled with the difference in time can be used to compute speed, acceleration, and so on. The example method may also include automatically adjusting the image acquisition parameters based on the device movement. The acts of establishing parameter values, acquiring images, computing speed\/acceleration, and automatically adjusting values can continue until imaging is complete.","What has been described herein includes several examples. It is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components or methodologies for purposes of describing the systems, methods, computer readable media and so on employed in automatically updating image acquisition parameters based on image feedback. However, one of ordinary skill in the art may recognize that further combinations and permutations are possible. Accordingly, this application is intended to embrace alterations, modifications, and variations that fall within the scope of the appended claims. Furthermore, to the extent that the term \u201cincludes\u201d is employed in the detailed description or the claims, it is intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term \u201ccomprising\u201d as that term is interpreted when employed as a transitional word in a claim.","While the systems, methods and so on described herein have been illustrated by describing examples, and while the examples have been described in considerable detail, it is not the intention of the applicants to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and modifications will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention, in its broader aspects, is not limited to the specific details, the representative apparatus, and illustrative examples shown and described. Accordingly, departures may be made from such details without departing from the spirit or scope of the applicant's general inventive concept."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
