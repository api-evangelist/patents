{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to a system and method for managing communication networks, and more particularly to a system and method for managing communication network issues in an intelligent utility grid system.","2. Related Art","As utilities deploy and operate smart grids, they face the prospect of making substantial investments in new technologies and devices without certainty regarding the levels of return and business benefits. However, a well-informed and closely-targeted application of analytics is beneficial to the financial and operational success of smart grid deployments.","For utilities implementing smart grids, the prime opportunity presented by analytics is to make smarter, faster decisions based on timely and accurate interpretation of smart grid data. Once utilities implement a smart grid, they will immediately face a deluge of grid data generated by a vast array of sensors and devices. The resulting flow of information may inundate the workforce of a utility, leading to a potential failure to analyze the volumes of raw data.","According to one aspect of the disclosure, a system for communication network management of a utility grid may include a database configured to store a grid information data set, where the grid information data set includes network device information for the utility grid. The communication network management system may further include a network management system executable by a processor to perform a number of functions. The processor may be executable to receive an event message from one or more network devices indicative of one or more failures in a communication network of the utility grid. The processor may further be executable to retrieve the grid information data set. The processor may be further executable to identify one or more network devices associated with the failure based on the grid information data set. The processor may be further executable to transmit a request for a response to the identified one or more network devices. The processor may be further executable to determine a response pattern based on responses from the identified one or more network devices in order to identify a cause of the failure based on the response pattern. The identified cause may further be based on the event message.","According to at least a second aspect, the system may include a fault, performance, and configuration management (FPCM) module executable by the processor to communicate directly with each network device along a communication path of the communication network and to determine the cause of the failure based on the response patterns and event messages from respective network devices. The FPCM module may further include a plurality of application program interfaces (APIs) that facilitate communication of the FPCM directly with respective network devices. The FPCM may further include a library access module used to retrieve the grid information data set from the database specific to the identified network devices.","According to at least a third aspect, the system may include an incident management module executable by the processor to generate a single trouble ticket based on a plurality of causes of failure associated with a single network device.","According to at least a fourth aspect, the system may include a service level management module executable by the processor to report penalties that ensure accounting of owned service credits beyond contractual usage levels and to provide power against contractual service level obligations.","According to another aspect of the disclosure, a method for managing a communication network of a utility grid may be executed by a computer have a processor and memory and may include receiving an event message from one or more network devices indicative of one or more failures in a communication network of the utility grid. The method may further include retrieving a grid information data set from a database where the grid information data set includes network device information for the utility grid. The method may further include identifying one or more network devices associated with the one or more failures based on the grid information data set. The method may further include transmitting a request for a response to the identified one or more network devices. The method may further include determining a response pattern based on responses from the identified one or more network devices in order to identify a cause of the failure based on the response pattern.","Other systems, methods, features and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the following claims.","The present disclosure is drawn to a system and methods for communication network management of a utility grid. Utilities that implement analytical software tools and processes will be able to transform volumes of raw data into useful, comprehensible information for business decision making. Real-time decisions critical to the health or stability of a utility grid may mean the difference between success and failure for reasons that will be discussed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","102","103","100","100","104","106"]},"Smart Grid implementation allows the use of intelligent network devices to monitor, report, and control power usage of customers. Use of the intelligent network devices allows real-time information regarding power consumption to be relayed to a control center  of the Smart Grid. The control center  may represent a centralized control center of the Smart Grid  where a topology of the electrical equipment in the Smart Grid \u2014switches, relays, substations, power plants\u2014may be monitored and controlled through use of the intelligent network devices. Access to the information provided by the intelligent network devices may be distributed such that the grid information data sent may be readily available through various types of network configurations.","In one example, some or all of the customers may include end devices  configured to monitor and control various customer devices. The powered devices may be remotely controlled by a utility company through communication with the end devices  allowing terms of a power usage agreement to be observed, for example. Each of the end devices  may communicate over or through a home area network (\u201cHAN\u201d)  also referred to as a customer network . The Smart Grid  may include a customer network  for one or more residential customers  and a customer network  for one or more commercial customers . The HAN  may include typical networking equipment to and between switches and routers, including wireless capability, or may be a hard-wired connection depending on the geographic setup and connection demands of the premises.","Accordingly, the HAN or customer network  may function primarily to provide connectivity between end devices  and corresponding dedicated meters (\u201cM\u201d)  to which the end devices  provide real-time power usage information. In one example, each customer may include a dedicated customer network  used to allow two-way communication with the dedicated meter . Each meter  may determine the total power usage for a respective customer based on information provided by the corresponding end devices  or through other conventional power monitoring means.","Each of the meters  may communicate with the control center  to relay power usage information as well as to receive commands from the control center . In one example, each of the meters  may include a telemetry interface unit (TIU) , which is a device that may include a processor and memory and be responsible for transmitting and receiving meter data. Alternatively, the TIU  may be a stand-alone device that communicates with a respective meter .","Meters  may be associated with one or more local area networks (LANs)  used by the meters  to communicate within the Smart Grid , such as with the control center . In one example, each LAN  may include various types of networking equipment such as network switches, routers, microwave and cellular towers, for example. Each of the meters  may relay meter data to a respective collector . Each collector  may be an intelligent device including a processor, memory, and communication equipment that receives meter data for a number of meters . Each collector  may communicate to the control center  or other areas of the Smart Grid  using a wide area network (WAN) . In one example, each WAN  may provide communication capability through cellular communication towers, microwave towers, network switches, routers, or other communication devices, protocols, and strategies used for long-range communications.","Each WAN  may provide meter data received from the collectors  to a control center interface , also known as a \u201chead end\u201d . The head end  may provide the meter data to enterprise applications  such as an outage management system (OMS) and a demand response management system (DRMS). The head end  may also provide the meter data to a meter data management system (MDMS) , which may include a central repository for storing meter data so that it may be accessed within the Smart Grid  for subsequent use and analysis, such as for customer billing purposes, for example.","Use of such intelligent devices for monitoring and controlling customer power consumption includes various challenges. The relaying of power usage information between the end devices  and the control center  may be wireless, hardwired, or a combination of both. Use of wireless communication may pose difficulties, however. For example, each dedicated customer network  may rely on wireless communication between end devices  and the meters . The meters  may be physically positioned in such a way as to make accessibility difficult. Similarly, the collectors  may communicate wirelessly with the meters , which may be challenging if the meters  are physically positioned in a manner that hinders optimal wireless communication. Communicating with multiple meters may pose challenges for the collectors  including: availability of the network  between meter  and collector  that may impact the availability of the meter data; amount of data transferred from meters  to collectors ; and availability of the collectors  to collect the data from meters .","The NOMS  may be implemented to deal with communication challenges from the end devices  to the control center . As shown in , the NOMS  may include: 1) a fault, performance, and configuration management (FPCM) module ; 2) an incident management (IM) module ; and 3) a service level management (SLM) module . The NOMS  may be implemented on a computer device having a memory  and a processor . The various modules of the NOMS may be operated at one or more terminals by a user. Information provided by the various modules may be displayed on various types of displays such as LCDs, LEDs, plasma, CRT, etc.","The FPCM module  may identify root-cause problems of equipment within the Smart Grid . The root-cause problems may be identified by communicating directly with each device along a communication path and determining the problem based on the response pattern. For example, the NOMS  may be notified that various communication devices are reporting an error, such as meters, collectors, etc., through event messages . The NOMS  may communicate directly with some or all devices along a communication path between the end devices  and the control center . Based on the event messages and the response pattern of the various network devices, the FPCM module  may determine a root cause of the errors.","A number of response pattern rules may be accessed, such as from the grid information database , which includes one or more rules that determine causes of failure based on predetermined response patterns. In one example, the one or more rules may be generalized for any utility grid. In another example, the one or more rules may be customized for a particular customer based on the specific topology of the intelligent power grid of that customer. In yet another example, the one or more rules may come from a combination of generalized and customized rules. The rules may be part of an analytical engine, which receives one or more event messages and determines which rule or rules in the analytical engine to implement based on the received one or more event messages. Examples of the applications of such rules are illustrated in . The rules may be updated if an identified cause turns out to be incorrect or to be only partially correct, so that the FPCM module  thereby becomes trained over time with these specific rules. The FPCM module  may also perform service impact and customer impact analyses based on the identified errors, as well as track and push configuration to the various network devices. One example of the FPCM module  is Ionix by EMC of Hopkington, Mass.","In one example, the FPCM module  may include a library access (LA) module  that may allow the FPCM  to obtain various informational aspects regarding the Smart Grid  during a root-cause analysis in the gird informational database  stored in the memory . Upon receipt of an event report, the FPCM  may determine which devices are reporting such an error. The FPCM  may include a device discovery (DD) module  that includes a number of application program interfaces (APIs)  allowing the FPCM  to communicate directly with the network devices, such as the meters , collectors , databases, routers, servers, and the like included in the network  and\/or .","The IM module  may provide trouble ticketing that supports escalation and workflow and problem management. For example, when multiple error reports are generated, based on the root-cause findings of the FPCM module , the IM module  may only generate a single trouble ticket due to only a single root-cause being responsible for network issues. The IM module  may also provide a configuration management database data model that supports information technology infrastructure libraries (\u201cITIL\u201d) functions such as \u201cchange management.\u201d The IM module  may also provide asset management and knowledge management functions. In one example, the IM module  may be implemented with the Remedy IT Service Management suite by BMC of Houston, Tex.","The SLM module  may be used for penalty reporting that ensures accounting of owned service credits beyond contractual usage levels. The SLM module  may also monitor actual performance of the Smart Grid  in providing power against contractual service level obligations. In one example, the SLM module  may use Service Level Management solutions by Computer Associates of Islandia, N.Y.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["102","100","300","102","200","200","206","302","200","212","304","206","200","306","200","308","102","310","200","115","120","312","200","314","200","316","200"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","200","400","118","114","200","200","122","118","200","123","122"]},"In the example of , the steps of the operation of the FPCM  are numbered for reference purposes. The step order is for exemplary purposes only and additional or fewer steps may be implemented as well. At step , the FPCM  may establish a relationship in which the events reported are correlated to determine where in the Smart Grid  the network issues have arisen. At steps -, the FPCM  may perform a root-cause analysis (\u201cRCA\u201d). The root-cause analysis may involve the FPCM testing network devices such as the relevant meters , collectors , head end , and enterprise applications . The FPCM  may also check the connectivity between the various devices to ensure that the connecting networks (LANs  and WAN ) are functioning. In the example of , the only root-cause analysis operation showing a failure is the availability of the collector . Thus, the FPCM  may determine that the collector  is not functioning properly. In such a case, a single trouble ticket may be issued using the IM module  consolidating what may have otherwise resulted in the multiple trouble tickets to be issued for each of the devices generating event messages. Consolidation allows fewer resources to be expended in diagnosing and correcting network problems.","Furthermore, the steps of the process of identifying a root cause may be iterative in the sense that after analyzing the grid to determine a root cause of any failure, a utility or power grid owner fixes the determine root cause to restore full communication capability with reference to the root cause, and determines yet another root cause for which a residual connectivity or communication issue remains. This can happen where another issue or failure in the grid is masked by the primary or original root cause of the failure, which when fixed, exposes a secondary or additional cause of additional failure or connectivity issues. With implementation of the present disclosure, however, the need for iteration\u2014and certainly the need for simultaneous issuance of multiple trouble tickets\u2014may be significantly reduced.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","200","500","120","118","122","118","122"]},"In the example of , the steps of the operation of the FPCM  are numbered for reference purposes.

At steps -, the FPCM  may perform a root-cause analysis (\u201cRCA\u201d). The root-cause analysis may involve the FPCM testing network devices such as the relevant meters , collectors , head end , and enterprise applications. The FPCM  may also check the connectivity between the various devices to ensure that the connecting networks (LANs  and WANs ). Only the connectivity between the meter  and collector  is shown to be in a state of failure indicating a failure in the LAN , which in one example may include three cellular towers and three network routers. In steps -, the FPCM  may ping each cellular tower and router, and based on the responses in Table 5, only cellular tower  is in a state of failure. Thus, the FPCM  has identified the root-cause. In such a case, a single trouble ticket may be issued using the IM module  consolidating what may have otherwise resulted in the multiple trouble tickets to be issued for each of the devices generating event messages. Consolidation allows fewer resources to be expended in diagnosing and correcting network problems.","Optimal use of analytics that may be performed by the integrated network operations and management system (NOMS)  within a Smart Grid  can help utilities improve customer relationships through more regular and targeted demand response programs, boosting customer loyalty, and minimizing wasted marketing expenditures. The NOMS  may also enhance environmental performance and compliance by enabling more effective tracking of power supply and demand, and incorporation of renewable energy sources into the grid. The NOMS  may further achieve greater network reliability and resilience with real-time, automated updates about grid\/equipment status and operations. Faults and outages can be isolated and addressed more quickly and effectively. This improved responsiveness, in turn, helps to build enhanced and durable customer relationships.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","108","122","102","200","110","114","116","118","600","602","600","600","115","120"]},"In a networked deployment, the computer system  may operate in the capacity of a server or as a client-user computer in a server-client user network environment, or as a peer computer system in a peer-to-peer (or distributed) network environment.
