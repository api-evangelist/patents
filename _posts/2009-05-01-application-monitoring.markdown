{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF INVENTION","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for application monitoring. In particular, but not exclusively, the invention may be implemented in a self-service terminal (SST).","A self-service terminal is generally defined as a device that is suitable for allowing a customer to conduct a transaction or to access information in an unassisted manner (that is, without requiring help from a human) and\/or in an unattended environment (that is, an area that is not constantly supervised by someone physically present to ensure that the SSTs are not being misused). An SST deployer may decide to provide human assistance and\/or supervision for customers of the SST (such as in a retail, airport, or hotel location); however, SSTs are typically designed so that such assistance and\/or supervision is not essential. A common type of SST is an automated teller machine (ATM).","To ensure that an ATM remains operational, it typically includes management software for collating information from modules within the ATM, and status information about applications executing on the ATM. The management software typically notifies a remote management system of any errors or malfunctions that are detected in the ATM together with status information.","It is now common for an ATM owner to use an ATM control application provided by a first vendor on an ATM provided by a second vendor (different from the first vendor). An ATM control application provides transaction processing functions for customers, and module management functions for service personnel (such as engineers).","Transaction processing functions include a sequence of screens displayed to the customer, and associated commands for controlling the modules in response to customer inputs. Module management functions include state of health information and module test routines.","If the second vendor is responsible for servicing and maintaining the ATM, then the second vendor may not have access to information from the control application because this is provided by a different vendor and may not report status information to any entity outside itself (that is, outside of the control application). This makes it very difficult for the second vendor to manage the ATM efficiently.","It is among the objects of an embodiment of the present invention to obviate or mitigate the above problem, or other problems associated with prior art SSTs and\/or the management thereof.","Accordingly, the invention generally provides methods, systems, apparatus, and software for application monitoring.","In addition to the Summary of Invention provided above and the subject matter disclosed below in the Detailed Description, the following paragraphs of this section are intended to provide further basis for alternative claim language for possible use during prosecution of this application, if required. If this application is granted, some aspects of the invention may relate to claims added during prosecution of this application, other aspects may relate to claims deleted during prosecution, other aspects may relate to subject matter never claimed. Furthermore, the various aspects detailed hereinafter are independent of each other, except where stated otherwise. Any claim corresponding to one aspect should not be construed as incorporating any element or feature of the other aspects unless explicitly stated in that claim.","According to a first aspect there is provided a method of monitoring an application executing on a self-service terminal, the method comprising:","registering with a services manager to receive event reports indicative of a change of state relating to the application;","accessing an operating system function to deduce a current status of the application; and","communicating a status of the application to the remote management system, without communicating with the application, to enable the remote management system to manage the self-service terminal more effectively.","The services manager may be an XFS (extensions for Financial Services) manager, a J\/XFS manager, or any other convenient software manager.","By virtue of this aspect of the invention, software can be provided that deduces the state of an SST application without requiring an interface to that application, or any communication (direct or indirect) between that application and the software. This enables the status of a third party application to be conveyed to a remote management system.","The event reports indicative of a change of state relating to the application may comprise event reports relating to a change in state of a physical switch used to change the application from transaction mode to supervisor mode (for example, a supervisor switch on a operator personnel panel).","The physical switch may be depressed by a service engineer. Alternatively, the physical switch may be triggered by opening a door.","The event reports indicative of a change of state relating to the application may comprise event reports relating to a change in state of an open\/closed indicator for indicating to a customer that the self-service terminal is either in-service or out-of-service.","The event reports indicative of a change of state relating to the application may comprise event reports relating to a notification of entry into vendor dependent mode (VDM).","Accessing an operating system function to deduce a current status of the application may comprise ascertaining if the application is listed on an operating system active process list.","Accessing an operating system function to deduce a current status of the application may comprise ascertaining if the application is listed as being in an executing state.","Accessing an operating system function to deduce a current status of the application may comprise ascertaining if a central processing unit on which the application is intended to execute has a current utilization for that application that is non-zero or variable. A zero percent utilization may indicate that the application has \u2018crashed\u2019 or \u2018hung\u2019.","The method may further comprise testing a communications connection to a remote authorization host to deduce the communication status of the application.","Testing a communications connection may be implemented by executing a \u2018ping\u2019 on the internet protocol (IP) address of the remote authorization host. Alternatively or additionally, testing a communications connection may be implemented by monitoring communication packet traffic. Alternatively or additionally, testing a communications connection may be implemented by direct messaging to the monitored application.","According to a second aspect there is provided a monitoring component for monitoring an application executing on a self-service terminal, the monitoring component comprising:","a defined software interface for receiving event reports indicative of a change of state relating to the application;","an operating system interface for accessing an operating system function to deduce a current status of the application; and","a communications interface for communicating a status of the application to the remote management system based on information received from at least one of the defined software interface and the operating system interface, to enable the remote management system to manage the self-service terminal more effectively.","The defined software interface may be an XFS interface, a J\/XFS interface, or the like.","According to a third aspect there is provided a self-service terminal including the monitoring component of the second aspect.","The self-service terminal may be an automated teller machine (ATM), an information kiosk, a financial services center, a bill payment kiosk, a lottery kiosk, a postal services machine, a check-in and\/or check-out terminal such as those used in the retail, hotel, car rental, gaming, healthcare, and airline industries, or the like.","According to a fourth aspect there is provided a computer program comprising program instructions for implementing the steps of the method according to the first aspect.","The computer program may be embodied on a medium (such as an optical disc, a magnetic disc, a solid-state memory, or the like), conveyed on an electrical carrier signal, or the like.","According to a fifth aspect there is provided a method of monitoring an application executing on a self-service terminal, the method comprising:","registering with a management component in the self-service terminal to indicate types of event reports to be received;","receiving event reports indicative of a change of state relating to the application;","periodically polling an operating system function to deduce a current status of the application; and","communicating a status of the application to the remote management system, without communicating with the application, to enable the remote management system to manage the self-service terminal more effectively.","The change of state events may be generated by a service provider associated with a module within the self-service terminal.","According to a sixth aspect there is provided a method of monitoring an application executing on a self-service terminal, the method comprising:","registering with a services manager executing on the self-service terminal to receive event reports indicative of a change of state of the self-service terminal; and","communicating a status of the application to a remote management system in the event of either\n\n","This aspect also has the advantage that a monitoring application can be used to convey updated status information about a control application to a remote management system without needing to communicate with the control application or to use the control application to effect the communication to the remote management system.","These and other aspects will be apparent from the following specific description, given by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings.","Reference will now be made to , which is a schematic diagram showing an SST memory  executing software components. In this embodiment the SST is an ATM. The software components comprise: a control application , a runtime platform , a management application , and a monitor application .","The Control Application ","As is known in the art, the control application  presents a sequence of screens on an ATM display to a customer at the ATM, collates information from the customer (for example, customer account information from a customer's ATM card, transaction request, and the like), obtains authorization for a transaction request from a remote authorization host (not shown in ), and instructs modules within the ATM, as needed, to fulfill an authorized transaction.","As is also known in the art, the control application  also comprises a conventional CEN XFS interface  for communicating with a services manager in the form of an XFS manager (described as box  below) in the runtime platform . In other words, the control application  is a conventional ATM control application having a conventional CEN XFS interface. CEN is the European Committee for Standardization, and XFS is the extensions for Financial Services standard. The current version of this CEN XFS standard is v.3.10.","The Runtime Platform ","The runtime platform  comprises proprietary run-time components (illustrated by the broken line box ), an operating system kernel (illustrated by the broken line box ), an XFS manager , service providers , and a Vendor Dependent Application (VDA)  for providing diagnostic and maintenance functions.","In this embodiment, the operating system is a Windows XP (trade mark) operating system, available from Microsoft Corporation (trade mark). The operating system includes a plurality of device drivers , . . . for interfacing with standard home computing devices such as a magnetic disk drive, a display, a serial port, a parallel port, and such like. As is well known in the art, the operating system kernel  is responsible for memory, process, task, and disk management, and includes routines for implementing these functions.","The proprietary run-time components  are a set of APTRA (trade mark) XFS components, available from NCR Corporation, 1700 S. Patterson Blvd., Dayton, Ohio 45479, U.S.A. The run-time components  provide a range of programming facilities specific to self-service terminal devices and services.","One function of the run-time components  is to enhance the operating system  so that the operating system  and run-time components  together provide high level access to all of the devices and modules, including both standard home computing devices (via the operating system ), and XFS computing devices (via the run-time components ). Thus, the combination of the run-time components  and the operating system  can be viewed as providing a complete ATM operating system.","The run-time components  comprise a plurality of self-service device drivers , . . . that interface with self-service specific devices, together with support files (not shown), to allow each device or module to be operated, tested, maintained, and configured. Although only a few device drivers  are shown, there are many device drivers in the run-time components , one for each self-service specific module, such as a card reader (not shown), a receipt printer (not shown), an encrypting keypad (not shown) and FDKs (not shown), and a cash dispenser (not shown). Furthermore, there are many more devices and modules in an ATM than those described herein, for example there are more standard computing devices such as serial ports (for example, a USB port) and a parallel port, there may also be more self-service devices and modules, such as a statement printer, a cash accept module, and the like. These devices and modules are not discussed herein because they are not essential to an understanding of the invention.","The XFS manager  includes an XFS application programming interface (API) and a service provider interface ","The service providers  communicate with the XFS manager  and also with the device drivers  associated with the modules. Suitable service providers are available from NCR Corporation, 1700 S. Patterson Blvd. Dayton, Ohio 45479, U.S.A.","The service providers  provide a high level of abstraction to allow the control application  to issue standard XFS commands to request functions and services. The service providers  translate these XFS commands for the particular device drivers , used in the runtime platform . Each service provider  is typically associated with one module (such as a cash dispenser module); however, one of the service providers is associated with vendor dependent mode (which is a logical device). A service provider (the Sensors and Indicators Units (SIU) service provider) is associated with switches, microswitches, sensors, and LEDs that are distributed across the ATM.","The Vendor Dependent Application (VDA)  is accessed via the control application  (typically by a service person selecting supervisor mode on the ATM and then selecting a maintenance\/diagnostics mode. When this occurs the control application  goes offline (after concluding any transaction currently in progress) and passes control of the modules to VDA . Control is passed to VDA  once the modules have all entered vendor dependent mode (VDM). This will be described in more detail below.","The Management Application ","The management application  is used for collating management information from the modules within the ATM, and for sending and receiving management messages.","The management application  comprises an SNMP (simple network management protocol) portion  that handles communications, creates traps, sends these traps to a remote management system, and the like. The SNMP portion  also includes one or more non-proprietary objects , one or more proprietary objects , and a CEN object .","The non-proprietary objects  are typically in the form of DLLs and are used for communicating with industry-standard devices and modules within the ATM, such as USB ports, magnetic disk drives, and the like. The proprietary object  is typically also in the form of a DLL and is customized for proprietary modules in the ATM (or modules with proprietary features), such as the card reader, the encrypting keypad, the cash dispenser, and the like. The CEN object  communicates with the XFS manager  (specifically, the XFS API ). The management application  includes conventional components for managing state of health information relating to the modules in the ATM.","The control application , platform , and management application  are conventional and available from ATM vendors, such as NCR Corporation or its competitors. These components can be used in embodiments of the present invention without any modification. The new application provided herein is the monitor application .","The Monitor Application ","The monitor application  is used for deducing the state of the control application  without having any interface to the control application .","The monitor application  comprises: an XFS application programming interface (API) , an operating system interface , a remote management system interface , and a timer .","The monitor XFS API  is used to communicate with the XFS manager  (specifically, the XFS API ). This enables the monitor application  to receive messages from the service providers, such as the VDM service provider and the SIU (the Sensors and Indicators Units) service provider . This is described in more detail below.","The operating system interface  is a conventional interface that allows the monitor application  to query operating system components to ascertain information such as the current active processes executing on the central processing unit (CPU) with which the memory  is associated, the CPU utilization percentage for a particular process, and the like.","The remote management system interface  receives status messages through the monitor XFS API  and the operating system interface , and communicates these to a remote management system (not shown in ).","Reference will now be made to , which is a simplified schematic diagram of an ATM network  including an ATM  incorporating the ATM memory  executing the software components described with reference to .","The ATM  comprises a central processing unit (CPU)  coupled to the memory , a plurality of user interface modules  (not shown in detail, but including a cash dispenser, a card reader, a display, a receipt printer, an encrypting keypad, and the like), a network connection module , and a service operator panel .","The service operator panel  enables diagnostic tests to be performed on, and information to be retrieved from, the modules , within the ATM .","The service panel  includes a physical mode switch  for switching the ATM  between transaction mode and supervisor mode. In supervisor mode, a service engineer can execute the VDA  to enter vendor dependent mode (VDM) and execute replenishment, maintenance, or diagnostic tasks. When the engineer has completed this, then he\/she can exit the VDA component  and press the mode switch  to return control of the modules , to the control application . This is referred to as returning to transaction mode.","The network connection module  enables the ATM  to communicate with a remote authorization host  for authorizing transactions requested by an ATM customer, and also enables the ATM  to communicate with a remote management system  to send status information as requested by the remote management system , and also to send fault signals in response to a fault condition being detected, as will be described in more detail below.","Communication between the ATM , the authorization host , and the remote management system  is achieved using a network .","Deducing Current State of the Control Application","Reference will now be made to , which is a flowchart illustrating steps involved when the monitor application  deduces a current state of the control application . For clarity,  has been split into four flowcharts ().","Initially, the monitor application  registers with the appropriate service providers  via the XFS manager  (step ). In this embodiment, the monitor application  registers with the VDM service provider and the SIU servicer provider . This enables the monitor application  to receive notifications from the VDM service provider that the ATM  is entering or exiting vendor dependent mode (VDM). This also enables the monitor application  to receive notifications of status changes of indicators and switches from the SIU service provider , as will be explained in more detail below.","The next step is for the monitor application  to set the internal timer  to a preset value (step ). The purpose of the timer  is to recreate the effect of a heartbeat for the control application . When the timer  has decremented to zero, then the monitor application  interrogates the operating system  (via the operating system interface ) to obtain evidence that the control application  is still executing.","The initial value to which the timer  is set is not critical. A low initial value (for example, ten seconds) will result in frequent calls to the operating system , which is inefficient. A very high initial value (for example, ten hours) will result in very infrequent calls to the operating system , so the control application may have hung for hours before it is detected by the monitor application . In this embodiment, an initial value of ten minutes is selected for convenience.","The next step is for the monitor application  to detect if an event has been received (step ) from one of the service providers that the monitor application  has registered with. The monitor application  is registered to receive events from the VDM service provider and the SIU service provider ","If an event is received (step ) then the event is processed as described in detail below with reference to .","If an event is not received, then the next step is for the monitor application  to detect if the value of the timer  has decremented to zero (step ).","If the value of the timer  has not decremented to zero then the monitor application returns to step .","If the value of the timer  has decremented to zero, then the monitor application  ascertains if the communications status of the ATM  has changed from operational to non-operational (step ). Details of the sub-steps implemented in step  are shown in  and are described below.","If the communications status of the ATM  has changed then the monitor application  (specifically, the remote management system interface ) sends a message to the remote management system  to indicate the new communication status of the ATM  (step ).","If the communications status of the ATM  has not changed then the monitor application  ascertains if the operating system status has changed (step ). Details of the sub-steps implemented in step  are shown in  and are described below.","If the operating system indicates that the control application  status has changed, then the monitor application  (specifically, the remote management system interface ) sends a message to the remote management system  to indicate the new status of the control application (step ), then the monitor application  returns to step  to reset the timer to the initial value.","If the operating system indicates that the control application  status has not changed, then the monitor application  returns to step  so that the timer  can be reset to the initial value.","Processing a Received Event (Step )","The sub-steps involved in processing a received event (step ) will now be described with reference to , which shows step  in more detail.","When the SIU service provider detects that someone (typically a service engineer) has depressed the physical mode switch , then the service provider sends an event notification to all applications registered with it. Since the monitor application  registered with the service provider during step  (), the monitor application  will receive these notifications. The event notification conforms to the CEN XFS 3.10 standard and indicates that the physical mode switch  state has changed. This takes the form of a WFS_SRVE_SIU_PORT_STATUS event that reports WFS_SIU_OPERATORSWITCH.","Similarly, if the control application  has to stop offering customer transactions for a period of time, then the control application  changes the state of a logical out-of-service indicator from being in-service to being out-of-service. The event notification conforms to the CEN XFS 3.10 standard and takes the form of a WFS_SRVE_SIU_PORT_STATUS event that reports WFS_SIU_OPENCLOSE.","However, in addition to the two events received from the SIU service provider that are described above, an event can be received from the SIU service provider that relates to an indicator that the monitor application  is not interested in (because it does not reflect or relate to a change in state of the control application ).","If the received event relates to the state of the physical mode switch  then this indicates that the control application  has changed between transaction mode (in which a customer can execute a transaction) and supervisor mode (in which a service engineer can operate on the ATM ).","Similarly, if the received event relates to the state of the logical out-of-service indicator then this indicates that the control application  has changed between in-service mode (in which a customer can execute a transaction) and out-of-service mode (in which customer transactions are typically not available on the ATM ).","In addition, an event may be received from the VDM service provider that requires acknowledgement (for example, a request from the service provider to enter or exit vendor dependent mode must be acknowledged by the monitor application ), or that indicates status (for example, vendor dependent mode having been entered or exited).","Every time a status of a switch or indicator on the ATM  changes, then the SIU service provider will send an event notification listing the status of all of the indicators and switches, which will be received by the monitor application  (step ), and many of these will not be relevant to the physical mode switch  or the logical out-of-service indicator. For this reason, when the monitor application  receives an event, it ascertains if the event relates to a switch or indicator that is not relevant (step ).","If the event is not relevant, then the monitor application  ignores the event (step ).","If the event is relevant (that is, it relates to the physical mode switch , the logical out-of-service indicator, or vendor dependent mode), then the monitor application  ascertains if the physical mode switch  status has changed (step ).","If the event notification indicates that the physical mode switch  status has changed, then the remote management system interface  sends a new mode status message to the remote management system  indicating the new mode status of the ATM  (step ).","If the event notification does not indicate that the physical mode switch  status has changed, then the monitor application  ascertains if the logical out-of-service indicator status has changed (step ).","If the event notification indicates that the logical out-of-service indicator status has changed, then the remote management system interface  sends a new service status message to the remote management system  indicating the new service status (in-service or out-of-service) of the ATM  (step ).","If the event notification does not indicate that the logical out-of-service indicator status has changed, then the monitor application  ascertains if the VDM status has changed (step ).","A VDM status change may be indicated by an event that reports WFS_SYSE_VDM_MODEENTERED (indicating that the ATM  is now in VDM mode), or WFS_SYSE_VDM_MODEEXITED (indicating that the ATM  is now out of VDM mode).","If the VDM status has changed then the remote management system interface  sends a message to the remote management system indicating the new status of the control application (step ) since the control application  is in a different status when the ATM  is in vendor dependent mode (VDM).","If the status has not changed, then the relevant event is a request either to enter or exit vendor dependent mode. In response to this request, the monitor application  (via the XFS API ) responds to the request with an acknowledgment (step ) in accordance with the CEN XFS standard. For example, the monitor application  responds to a request to enter VDM with a WFS_CMD_VDM_ENTER_MODE_ACK response.","Testing the Communications Status (Step )","The sub-steps involved in testing the communications status of the ATM  (step ) will now be described with reference to .","The monitor application  \u2018pings\u2019 the IP address of the remote authorization host  (step ) and then receives a response (step ).","If the \u2018ping\u2019 is successful, then the communications at the remote authorization host  are operational. If the \u2018ping\u2019 is not successful, then the communications at the remote authorization host  are not operational.","The communications status is then compared with the previous communications status (as of the last time that an IP address \u2018ping\u2019 was performed on the remote authorization host ) (step ).","If the communications status has changed (for example, from operational to non-operational, or vice versa) then the monitor application  proceeds to step  to indicate the new communications status of the remote authorization host .","If the communications status has not changed, then the monitor application  proceeds to step .","Testing the Operating System (Control Application) Status (Step )","The sub-steps involved in testing the status of the control application as indicated by the operating system (step ) will now be described with reference to .","The monitor application  (via the operating system interface ) interrogates the operating system kernel  to ascertain if the control application  appears in the list of active processes (step ).","The active process status of the control application  is then compared with the previous active process status (as of the last time that the operating system kernel  was interrogated) (step ).","If the active process status of the control application  has changed, then the monitor application  proceeds to step , where the new control application status is transmitted to the remote management system .","If the active process status of the control application  has not changed, then the monitor application  (via the operating system interface ) interrogates the operating system kernel  to ascertain the CPU utilization for the control application process (step ).","The CPU utilization may be in one of two states: a non-working state (indicated by a zero percent utilization of the CPU  by the control application ), or a working state (indicated by a non-zero percent utilization of the CPU  by the control application ).","The CPU utilization state for the control application  is then compared with the previous CPU utilization state (as of the last time that the operating system kernel  was interrogated) (step ).","If the CPU utilization state for the control application  has changed, then the monitor application  proceeds to step , where the new control application status is transmitted to the remote management system .","If the CPU utilization state for the control application  has not changed, then the monitor application  proceeds to step , where the internal timer  is reset.","It will now be appreciated that this embodiment has the advantage that a monitor application  can be used in conjunction with a third party control application  to provide a remote management system  with status information about the control application  without having to interface to the control application . The monitor application  can be used with conventional ATM software without having to modify the conventional ATM software.","Various modifications may be made to the above described embodiment within the scope of the invention, for example, the timer  described above decrements from an initial value to zero, in other embodiments, the timer  may increment from zero to a predetermined value, or any other convenient timing mechanism may be used, for example when a predetermined number of events has occurred.","In other embodiments, the remote management system and the authorization host  may be implemented on the same server.","In other embodiments, the communications status test (step ) may include pinging the local network address to ascertain if there is a problem with the communications software stack on the ATM . In the event of such a problem being detected, however, the monitor application  would not be able to send a message to the remote management system  until the problem was repaired, unless the monitor application  has a separate communications facility (such as a wireless transceiver).","In other embodiments, the communications status test (step ) may include monitoring communication packet traffic.","In other embodiments, the monitor application  may monitor either: events relating to the status of the physical mode switch , or the status of the VDM service provider , rather than monitoring both.","In the above embodiment, the ATM is designed and supplied by NCR Corporation, and the proprietary run-time components  are also scripted and provided by NCR Corporation. In other embodiments, the ATM may be from a different ATM vendor. In such embodiments, the proprietary run-time components would also typically be provided by that vendor. Nevertheless, provided the proprietary run-time components supported XFS then the monitor application  could still be used to deduce the state of the control application .","In other embodiments, the management application  may implement a different protocol to SNMP, such as a different network management protocol.","In other embodiments, instead of providing a physical mode switch , the SST may detect a request to change modes by, for example, sensing a door being opened, a pre-defined key on the supervisor keyboard being pressed, or an icon on a supervisor display being selected.","In other embodiments, the SST may be able to execute customer transactions even when a customer engineer is operating on the SST.","In some embodiments, the user interface modules may also include a physical out-of-service light responsive to the state of the logical out-of-service indicator. This out-of-service light may comprise an LED array that emits green light when the ATM is in-service, and red light when the ATM is out-of-service. This means that a WFS_SRVE_SIU_PORT_STATUS event will change the status of (that is the color displayed by) the out-of-service light.","Although the monitor application flow has been described as a series of steps, these steps may be carried out in any suitable order, or simultaneously where appropriate. The steps described in the above embodiment are intended to illustrate how the monitor application  responds to notifications from service providers  or from information retrieved from the operating system , it is not intended to imply that any particular programming structure is used. For example, the events are received asynchronously and interrupt any processing that is taking place, for example, a received event may be processed during a call to the operating system to ascertain if the control application is executing on the operating system's task list.","The methods described herein may be performed by software in machine readable form on a tangible storage medium or as a propagating signal.","The terms \u201ccomprising\u201d, \u201cincluding\u201d, \u201cincorporating\u201d, and \u201chaving\u201d are used herein to recite an open-ended list of one or more elements or steps, not a closed list.
