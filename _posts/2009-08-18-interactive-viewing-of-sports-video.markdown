{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is related to and claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/189,395 filed Aug. 18, 2008, for \u201cTime Warp Sports,\u201d with inventor Dan R. Olsen, Jr., which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present disclosure relates generally to computers and computer-related technology. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to interactive viewing of sports video.","Television is a powerful cultural force, yet television is a relatively inflexible medium. Viewer choice is confined to deciding whether to watch at all, selecting from at most a few hundred choices and the adaptation of their personal life to the broadcast schedule. The advent of the digital video recorder (DVR) has provided viewers with freedom of timing. In addition, DVRs provide viewers with pause, rewind or fast forward. DVRs give viewers more control but do not significantly change the nature of that viewing experience.","The advent of video over the Internet is starting to change the control relationship between viewer and broadcaster. Early Internet video systems were characterized by long waits for buffers to fill, low resolution and limited ability to select parts of a video stream to watch. However, bandwidth has improved sharply and video protocols have greatly improved. It is now possible to watch video over the Internet that has the following key attributes: high definition (HD) resolution, video startup of just a few seconds, delivery over a digital network to a computing device rather than an analog tuner, and the ability to jump to any point in a video stream in less than two seconds. The immediate benefit of these developments is that viewers can now watch what they want, whenever they want, outside of the control of large institutional gatekeepers. These are great developments, but much more is possible.","The embodiments disclosed herein relate to the interactive exploitation of randomly accessible Internet video streams. More specifically, the embodiments disclosed herein relate to providing interactive viewing of sports video over the Internet where the viewer is not required to prerecord games of interest.","Reference is made to . Video can be understood as a flow of images through time. At any point in a viewing experience there is a current offset  or current position in the timeline which represents the current frame being displayed. Such offsets can be represented as time in seconds from the start of the video or as number of frames from the start. For a current offset  there are one or more other offsets in the video stream that are of potential interest to the viewer.  shows the sports example where the other offsets are the start of the current play , the start of the previous play  and the start of the next play . User interactions may include skipping from the current offset  to some other offset of interest, possibly in a different video stream.","Skipping from the current offset  to some other offset of interest requires that the other points of interest have been identified in some way. In the example of  each point of interest is the start of a play. The points of interest may be marked manually. Alternatively, automatic scene\/play detection may be used.","Reference is now made to . For each sport a sport definition file  may be created that contains information about the structure of the sport. This file need only be created once for each sport and serves to specialize the user interface of the annotation software  and the user interface of the player software  to that particular sport.","Given a sport definition file , a game may be created using the raw video footage  from all of the camera feeds by using annotator software . The annotator  may accept the sport definition file  and specialize its user interface to meet the specific needs of that sport. Using the annotator , broadcast personnel may produce annotation information  for a particular game.","In one implementation, the video streams (raw footage)  may be ingested onto a network server. The game annotation file  may be thought of as including metadata about the game. The game annotation file  contains information about teams\/individuals playing, play boundary times, what happens during the plays, etc. Stated another way, the game annotation file  may include a set of time offsets from the beginning of the game, where each time event may include the type of event (e.g., start of play, end of play, end of quarter, change of possession, etc.), as well as additional data about the event (e.g., yards gained, score, penalties, participants, etc.). The player  may use a network protocol to fetch the game annotation file  and the relevant video  to present to the viewer. HTTP is an example of such a protocol.","Reference is now made to .  shows an analysis of the structure of three different sports: football, baseball, and volleyball. Each of these sports has a hierarchic time structure. For example, a baseball game has nine or more innings, each inning is divided into a top and a bottom half (one for each team), each top or bottom has three or more batters, and each batter gets three or more pitches. The sport definition file  may specify the organization for a particular sport. More specifically, the sport definition file  may include a hierarchy of play periods for a particular sport. Some, not necessarily all, of these play periods may be specified as units of navigation. For example a viewer of a baseball game can ask for next pitch, previous pitch, next batter, previous batter, next top\/bottom or previous top\/bottom. For each play period the sport definition file  may specify the name, how many of such periods there are, whether extra periods are allowed and is this period used for navigation.  shows a partial sport definition file  for the play periods in hockey.","There are also a variety of events that can occur during play. These events are of interest to fans and may be useful to select interesting plays for game summarization. In a sport definition file , each event type may be given a name and an optional value. The value may have a fixed value or an arbitrary value. For example, a field goal in American football is always three points. However, the yards gained on a particular play is an arbitrary value that must be entered after each play. Event definitions in the sport definition file  control the user interface that is presented in the annotator  while encoding an ongoing game.","Events can also be accumulated into statistics. Statistics are calculated from events and other statistics. An additive statistic begins at zero and after each play it adds the value of the corresponding event. Most scores, yards gained, pass completions, number of spikes, etc. fall into this category. There are also average, percentage and ratio statistics that aggregate two statistics or events into a single calculation.","A uniform viewing experience across all sports may be provided. For example, if a viewer has become adept interacting with baseball, it is desirable for the learning transfer for football season to be trivial. The user interface may be made to be completely consistent across sports because the player software  may be the same. This consistency with its corresponding learning transfer from sport to sport may be very advantageous in a relaxation\/entertainment experience.","User interface consistency may also be important for the annotator software . The staff in the broadcast truck doing a basketball game on a given night may have worked a volleyball game earlier in the week and may be doing a soccer game the next day. The annotation process is time critical for live events, and familiarity with the tools may provide significant advantages.","Reference is now made to . The raw camera feeds  and the broadcast feed  that comes from the director's station  may be digitally encoded and then ingested onto a network server . In addition, the broadcast feed  may be passed into the annotator software  where one or more staff members add the necessary annotation information to create the game annotation file  which may also be uploaded to the server . The audio track from the broadcast feed  may also be mixed into all of the other camera feeds  so that all video tracks may have the same audio.","The server  may be in electronic communication with multiple client devices via a network , such as the Internet. A single client device  is shown in . The client device  may be, for example, a television set-top box, a personal computer, etc. Player software  may be running on the client device . The player software  may retrieve the raw camera feeds , the broadcast feed , and the audio track from the broadcast feed  from the server .","For the initial setup of the game annotation process, the annotation operator may ask for the names and logos of the teams\/players as well as the names of the camera views available for the game. The number of cameras may vary from game to game. Adding more cameras increases the potential for interesting shots, but also increases equipment and staff costs. This can vary depending upon the importance of the game to the intended audience. The annotator  may be used to add time markings for the start and end of each navigation unit described in the sport definition file .","The annotator  may be divided into two applications: one for marking navigation unit times and one for marking event information. These two applications may work in series with navigation annotations feeding into the event marking tool.","Reference is now made to .  shows the relationship between a game annotation file  (which corresponds to the metadata  in ), a broadcast feed  (which corresponds to the primary video stream  in ), and multiple camera feeds  (which correspond to the secondary video streams  in ). All of the camera feeds  (secondary video streams ) as well as the mixed broadcast feed  (primary video stream ) are time synchronized. Because of this synchrony the information in the game annotation file  (metadata ) applies to all feeds.","Although the secondary video streams  have been described as corresponding to camera feeds , the scope of the present embodiments should not be limited in this regard.","Reference is now made to .  shows the navigation marking tool specialized for volleyball and basketball. For volleyball, the annotation operator may use the \u201cserve\u201d button  and the \u201cside out\u201d button  to mark when a navigation unit starts and ends. For basketball, the person who is performing the annotation may use the \u201cshot\u201d button  and the \u201cpossession\u201d button  to mark when a navigation unit starts and ends. The user interfaces for these tools may be automatically generated from the sport definition file  by the annotator software .","Reference is now made to .  shows the event logging tool for both volleyball and basketball. Once again, these user interfaces may be generated from the sport definition file . Down the left hand side is a list of all of the events that can occur and across the bottom is the current state of play. The annotation operator may simply click on the various events that have occurred within a play. On occasion an error may be made. In such cases, the annotation operator can pause the video and correct the selections. When the annotation operator logs the play clip, the video may immediately skip to the next clip. If a pause was required, the time may be recovered within the next play clip because it may take less time to record events than most plays require. Thus, the whole process may remain very close to live time.","As can be seen from , tools for annotating sports experiences may be provided that are general (across sports) and can be readily specialized to a particular sport. This uniform tool structure across sports may simplify the production of an interactive sport experience.","Reference is now made to .  shows an example of a controller  that may be used. Other types of controllers may be used instead, such as a traditional remote control, a game controller of the style used in video games, a specialized interactive TV controller, etc. Alternatively still, a single special button on the controller  may be used to provide guidance in how to interact.","Reference is now made to .  shows a control overlay  displayed on the screen during a volleyball game. The control overlay  may be displayed in response to the user pressing a trigger button on the controller . However, it is not necessary to display the control overlay . User activation of a particular button on the controller  causes the corresponding function to be performed whether or not the control overlay  is displayed. Thus, it may be said that the controller  provides a default menu (provided by the buttons on the controller ) with optional visual assistance (provided by the control overlay ). The use of the displayed control overlay  may be used to automatically train the sports user in how to interact with the common controls and smoothes the viewing experience.","The control overlay  looks very much like the face of the controller  and has all of the functions labeled. Presenting a control overlay  that visually corresponds to the physical controller  may greatly simplify the user's learning effort.","Under some circumstances, the player software  may be configured to work with different types of controllers . When a particular controller  is connected, the player software  may detect the type of controller  that is being used, and adapt the organization of the control overlay  to the physical layout of the controller  that is being used. Thus, the user interface may be unique to the controller  that the user is holding. In addition, the user interface may be identical across sports.","Pressing any of the buttons on the controller  may cause a corresponding echo on the screen overlay . The overlay  may disappear when the trigger is released. Other trigger buttons may be pressed to show game statistics or other less popular controls that do not fit on the available buttons of the controller .","A key part of simplifying interactivity is to transfer learning across activities. The interactive techniques should be uniform across a given type of sport, such as football. In addition, interactions may be unified across diverse sports. The mappings of controls to input devices should be the same across football, baseball, basketball, volleyball, etc. Learning interaction on one sport should translate readily to another with little or no training. A uniform set of viewing actions that are universal across all sports may be defined, and these viewing actions may be mapped onto the controller  so that interactive behavior learned in viewing one sport is transferred to another.","Reference is now made to .  illustrates various modules that may be implemented in the player  in order to provide viewer controls. The modules include a standard controls module  (for providing standard controls such as fast-forward, rewind, slow motion, pause, play, audio volume, mute, etc.), a next\/previous action module , a change camera module , a play review module , a social networking module , a fast watching module , a multiple games module , a caching module , and an information filtering module .","The next\/previous action module  will now be discussed. A hierarchy of game events may be defined, and the viewer controls may include accompanying next and previous actions, such as next play, previous play, previous first down, start of quarter, start of game, etc. A large set of sports can be broken into a similar set of periods and associated with standard interactive actions, as shown in .","To provide the next\/previous action controls, the next\/previous action module  may be configured to rapidly (e.g., in two seconds or less) change the play head of the video stream to any time offset. The game annotation file  may include the time offsets for the start and end of any navigation unit defined in the sport definition file . The next\/previous action module  may provide the user with the ability to control when instant replay is displayed. For example, if a user selects \u201cPrevious Play\u201d in a football game, the next\/previous action module  may retrieve the current offset  and then look in the game annotation file  for the time for the play that occurred immediately before the current offset . The next\/previous action module  may then go to that time in the video stream. A typical game annotation file  includes a few hundred annotations, so a simple search of this data structure would be more than fast enough to respond to user input in a timely way.","The change camera module  will now be discussed. The change camera module  may be configured to rapidly (e.g., in two seconds or less) change camera angles in response to user input. In addition, the change camera module  may be configured to automatically restart a play when a user switches camera angles. More specifically, when the viewer selects a new camera feed , the player software  may be given the network identifier necessary to locate that camera's video stream and the offset of the start of the previous play unit. To the viewer, switching camera angles may feel like instant replay from a new view.","The play review module  will now be discussed. The review of play is an example of a specialized form of interactive navigation. In many situations a fan may desire to carefully look at a given sequence of play. This may be to review the call of a foul that the fan disputes, to savor a particularly elegant display of athletics or to understand an unexpected turn of events. The play review module  may permit a user to interactively select a different camera view while reviewing a play. The play review module  may also permit the integration of slow motion (i.e., displaying at least a portion of a play in slow motion), pause and single frame (i.e., stepping through at least a portion of a play frame-by-frame) with the multiple camera views.","A special \u201creview mode\u201d may be defined. While in review mode, the user may change to secondary video streams  without changing play time by means of a single user action. This may allow the user to switch among camera views at will. The user may enter \u201creview mode\u201d either implicitly via a \u201cpause\u201d button on the controller  or explicitly with a review button. When entering review mode the play review module  may save the current time, thereby creating a special time mark in addition to the event marks maintained in the metadata . This time mark allows for a special \u201creturn to mark\u201d action. This mark in conjunction with camera switching and other navigation may allow the user to finely select a time that can be repeatedly reviewed from various viewpoints and excitedly discussed among all the fans in the room.","It may be desirable to insert advertisements at points in time that are the least disruptive to the user's entertainment experience. When a user exits review mode, the play review module  may be configured to interpret this as an indicator of a break in the game flow, and therefore as an appropriate location for an advertisement to be inserted.","The social networking module  will now be discussed. Suppose that a viewer wants to tell a friend about a play. The social networking module  may be configured to provide a quick, easy mechanism for specifying the play in question without resorting to video editing techniques such as single frame adjustment or interactive \u201cscrubbing.\u201d Such effort breaks the flow of the game experience as well as the information sharing experience.","Suppose for example a user sees a play that he feels was incorrectly officiated, and he sends the message \u201cbad call\u201d into cyberspace. However, the user's initiation of the message occurs after the call was made. The play in question has already occurred. The events in the metadata  may be used to automatically select a clip (time period) from game play that is best associated with the message. This greatly simplifies the effort of generating interesting sports-based messages to be shared with friends. The necessary information to generate such a clip is already encoded in the game metadata  that has been described.","The selected clip can be defined as between the current time and the time of the most recent event (for example \u201cstart of play\u201d). More specifically, when a user's request to send a message is detected, the current time (i.e., the point in time when the user's request is made) may be determined. In addition, event information in the metadata  may be used to determine the starting time for the current play. Then, a video clip to accompany the user's message may be automatically selected. The video clip may begin at the starting time for the current play, and the video clip may end at the current time.","The social networking module  may be configured to delay message reception until the receiving user has experienced the relevant point in the game. If, for example, two friends are watching an interactive version of the same game in different parts of the country, the interactivity will almost guarantee that they are not watching the same game play at the same time. If one user initiates a message about a play that then arrives before the other user has seen the play, the excitement of the game may be destroyed by revealing information too soon.","The social networking module  may be configured to delay message reception (perhaps showing an indication of future messages) until the appropriate game play has been viewed by the recipient. For example, when a message is received, a determination may be made about what point in the game the message corresponds to. This may involve comparing the current time (i.e., the point in the game that the user is currently watching) with a timestamp that is associated with the received message. If it is determined that the recipient of the message has not seen the point in the game that the message corresponds to, then the display of the message may be delayed until the recipient of the message has seen the relevant point in the sporting event. In addition, an indication may be displayed of where in the game the message is located, and a recipient can interactively choose to immediately go to the point of play indicated by the message. Also, after the message is viewed, feedback may be provided to the user that initiated the message, indicating that the message has been delivered.","In the context of the present discussion of social networking, the term \u201cmessage\u201d should be interpreted broadly to include an email message, an instant message, a text message, a post to a blog, a post to a social networking website (e.g., Facebook\u00ae), etc.","The fast watching module  will now be discussed. The fast watching module  may be configured to permit a user to watch an abbreviated version of a game. This may be desirable when a user has a limited amount of time to watch a particular game, or when a user starts a game late and wishes to catch up to live time without losing any of the interesting parts of the game. The amount of time that the user wants to spend can vary widely from user to user as well as the portion of the game to be accelerated. The abbreviated version of a game may be computed dynamically for each user.","This dynamic abbreviation of a game can be addressed in two parts: computing \u201cdegree of interest\u201d and summarization. First, it may be assumed that given the metadata , the video can be partitioned into \u201cgame units\u201d. A game unit may correspond to a particular play, a possession of the ball, time between plays (as in football), etc. The summarization process may include selecting game units to be presented and interspersing \u201celision information\u201d when game units are skipped. The selection of a game unit may depend on a DOI (degree of interest) function that may be applied to each game unit.","A user may specify the time that he has available and the portion of the game that he wishes to be abbreviated. This might take the form of \u201cbring me to live game time within 15 minutes\u201d or \u201cshow me the second half of the game in 20 minutes.\u201d Given the game time to be shown and the available time, game units with the lowest DOI value may be removed until the video time is reduced to within the user's available time.","One problem in game abbreviation is the computation of the DOI function. The exact nature of this function will vary from sport to sport. To compute the DOI of a given game unit, there should be a set of feature parameters that are known about the game unit and can be used as inputs to the DOI function.","The fast watching module  may be configured to use statistics about other users' behavior as input features to a DOI function. Because the present disclosure proposes interactive viewing of sports video over the Internet, the interactive behavior of people experiencing a game may be logged. For example, if most users skipped over a game unit, then its DOI should be lower. If many users replayed a game unit, switched camera angles a lot, or played the unit in slow motion, the DOI for that unit should be higher. This information about past viewer behavior can be used as part of the inputs to a DOI function for some present or future viewer.","Of particular interest as features would be game units for which the user initiated some social networking activity such as sending a message or blogging a comment. For example, one or more users' participation in a social networking activity during a particular game unit may be interpreted as indicating an increased level of interest in that game unit. The more users that participate in a social networking activity during the game unit, the higher the level of interest. Then, the increased level of interest may be considered when dynamically abbreviating the game for a particular user. More specifically, the increased level of interest may make it less likely that the game unit will be one of the game units that is removed in order to shorten the video time to the user's available time.","The multiple games module  will now be discussed. With popular sports there are frequently multiple games being played simultaneously. The multiple games module  may permit a user to switch between games without losing his place in either game. When switching into a game, the user may be returned to a point of interest so that the switch makes sense. The point of interest may be the user's previous location in the game or the start of the relevant play prior or subsequent to the user's previous location in the game. Transition information derived from the metadata  may be provided to show what the game state is (e.g., yardage, score, powerplay, etc.). This may help the user to retain context in each game when moving among multiple games. When returning to a game the user can also use the DOI-based skipping to move more rapidly through the plays they missed while watching another game.","The caching module  will now be discussed. In the interactive model for watching video sports disclosed herein, the viewer does not necessarily watch straight through the game. The viewer can select what the next video to be watched will be. This interactivity runs counter to the caching strategies that most Internet video technologies use to prevent gaps and skips in the viewing experience. However, with annotated sports the target times of interactive events are highly focused. At any point in the video there are only a small number of control events that the viewer can perform: \u201cnext play\u201d, \u201creplay\u201d, \u201creplay slow\u201d, \u201cswitch camera and replay\u201d to name a few. The current caching strategy for internet video is to try to retrieve many frames ahead of the current frame.","With an interactive behavior of the type disclosed herein, not only is the next frame highly likely but also the user may request a skip to one of N alternative next frames, where N is small. The set of alternative frames is also coherent across many frames in the straight video sequence. For example, the target frame for \u201cnext play\u201d remains unchanged across an entire play. This interactive structure can be exploited by the caching strategy. There are two cases for alternative next frames: skip back and skip forward.","In the skip forward case the alternative next frame is some time in the video future. In most cases this is not a distant future such as hours or even tens of minutes. In most sports the skip forward cases are less than 10-500 seconds. Once a particular skip forward event becomes possible (as known from the interactive structure of the user interface) the player  can start locally caching those future frames by prefetching them over the network. More specifically, the player  may determine, based on the interactive structure of the user interface, which skip forward events are possible. For example, in the context of football, suppose that the user interface allows three skip forward events: next play, next possession, and next quarter. Then the player  may prefetch the frames that correspond to the next play, the frames that correspond to the first play (or the first few plays) of the next possession, and the frames that correspond to the first play (or the first few plays) of the next quarter.","It should be noted that this prefetching strategy is not merely a matter of prefetching a continuous segment of frames. For example, there may be a gap between the next play and the next possession. The player  may prefetch the frames that correspond to the next play and the first play (or first few plays) of the next possession, without prefetching any frames between the next play and the next possession.","Whenever the frames that correspond to a particular skip forward event change, then the new frames that correspond to that skip forward event may be prefetched. For example, when the user finishes watching the current play, then the next play becomes the current play, and there is a new next play. At this point, frames that correspond to the new next play may be prefetched.","If the user executes an interactive input that targets that skip forward location then there is not a pause or a degradation of video quality because the frames are already cached and available. If the user does not execute the skip forward then eventually the video will reach those frames and play them. Thus no real Internet bandwidth is wasted. In fact, because those frames are already loaded, the time can be used for other predictive caching of frames.","In the skip back case there are only a few such locations in time. In the case of \u201creplay,\u201d for example, the target frame for the replay is known and has already been seen by the viewer. Frames immediately following such a target can be retained in the cache for as long as that target can potentially be selected by the viewer. If those frames are not discarded then replay can begin instantaneously and at full fidelity. All of the frames within a \u201cplay\u201d need not be retained but only those immediately following the target frame at the start of the play. Enough frames should be retained so that the playback can be restarted smoothly while other discarded frames are retrieved over the network.","Because the interactive behavior of viewers is known by the server that is distributing the interactive video, it is possible to log statistics of how often particular interactive actions are taken during specific video segments. The behavior of previous viewers of the game can be used to improve the allocation of caching resources towards those frames that are most likely. It is thus easy to adapt the caching strategy to the most likely behavior. For example viewer data may show that 10% of the time viewers will replay a play and 60% of the time they watch straight through and 30% of the time they skip to the next play. This information can improve cache hit performance. For a particular highly controversial play, however, the data may show that replay was selected 80% of the time. This play-by-play knowledge of the interactive behavior of previous viewers can focus scarce caching bandwidth to create a smooth interactive experience.","The information filtering module  will now be discussed. In some situations, a user may request (e.g., by pressing a button on the controller ) that certain information related to the game (e.g., rules, statistics, etc.) be displayed. The information filtering module  may be configured to filter the information that is displayed to the user based on what happened during the previous play. What happened during the previous play may be determined by reference to the metadata  described earlier. For example, suppose that the user is watching a football game, and he requests that rules be displayed. If the previous play involved a pass interference penalty, then the rules may be filtered so that only the rules relevant to pass interference are displayed.","Reference is now made to .  illustrates a method  for providing interactive viewing of a sporting event. The method  includes providing  a primary video stream  of the sporting event, providing  at least one secondary video stream  of the sporting event, and providing  metadata  corresponding to the primary video stream  and the secondary video stream(s) .

Under some circumstances, a \u201cprocessor\u201d may refer to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a programmable logic device (PLD), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), etc. The term \u201cprocessor\u201d may refer to a combination of processing devices, e.g., a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor, a plurality of microprocessors, one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core, or any other such configuration.","The term \u201cmemory\u201d should be interpreted broadly to encompass any electronic component capable of storing electronic information. The term memory may refer to various types of processor-readable media such as random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM), programmable read-only memory (PROM), erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM), flash memory, magnetic or optical data storage, registers, etc. Memory is said to be in electronic communication with a processor if the processor can read information from and\/or write information to the memory. Memory may be integral to a processor and still be said to be in electronic communication with the processor.","The terms \u201cinstructions\u201d and \u201ccode\u201d should be interpreted broadly to include any type of computer-readable statement(s). For example, the terms \u201cinstructions\u201d and \u201ccode\u201d may refer to one or more programs, routines, sub-routines, functions, procedures, etc. \u201cInstructions\u201d and \u201ccode\u201d may comprise a single computer-readable statement or many computer-readable statements.","The functions described herein may be implemented via one or more instructions on a computer-readable medium. The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d refers to any tangible storage medium that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, a computer-readable medium may comprise RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other tangible storage medium that can be used to store desired program code in the form of instructions or data structures and that can be accessed by a computer.
