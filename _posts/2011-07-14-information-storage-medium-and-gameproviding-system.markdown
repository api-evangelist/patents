Such a network system allows the user to add a friend to a friend list, and allow the friend to read the diary kept by the user, or exchange an e-mail with the user. JP-A-2008-242989 discloses technology in this field.","In recent years, many users enjoy a game provided by the SNS, and notify friends with the game result via an e-mail, or record the game result on the diary or the my page.","The SNS can be utilized from a mobile terminal such as a mobile phone, and the user can enjoy a game provided by the SNS when the user is in transit.","In recent years, a mobile terminal such as a mobile phone generally includes a position information acquisition system (e.g., GPS). Various services have been provided by utilizing such a system.","The user who enjoys a game provided by the SNS using a mobile terminal such as a mobile phone generally plays a game when the user is in transit or in a place other than the home. Therefore, a game rich in variety can be provided by utilizing the current position information acquired by the position information acquisition system as a factor of the game.","Several games utilize the current position information about the user. However, these games are based on a game operation about the current position of the user. Therefore, a game operation about the current position of another user does not influence the user, or a game operation about the current position of the user does not influence another user. Specifically, the user cannot enjoy interaction with another user.","According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a non-transitory computer-readable information storage medium storing a game-providing program that provides a game to a plurality of mobile terminals via a network, the game-providing program causing a computer to function as:\n\n","According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a game-providing system that includes a server that provides game to a plurality of mobile terminals via a network, the game-providing system comprising:\n\n","The invention may provide an information storage medium and a game-providing system that allow a game operation that utilizes the current position of the user to influence a game played by another user by effectively utilizing current position information about a plurality of users.","(1) According to one embodiment of the invention, there is provided a non-transitory computer-readable information storage medium storing a game-providing program that provides a game to a plurality of mobile terminals via a network, the game-providing program causing a computer to function as:\n\n","The current position information may be information about the latitude, the longitude, the address, the nearest base stations, or the like in the real world.","The acquisition section may select a virtual event area linked to position information (in the real world) that indicates a position within a predetermined range from the position indicated by the acquired current position information as the acquisition candidate information. The acquisition section may provide a virtual event area among the selected virtual event areas that satisfies a predetermined condition as the acquisition candidate information. The predetermined condition may be a condition determined by the virtual price of the virtual event area, the game parameter (e.g., money) of the user, and the like.","The visit processing section may select a virtual event area linked to position information (in the real world) that indicates a position within a predetermined range from the position indicated by the acquired current position information as the visit candidate information.","When the virtual event area acquired by the user is included in the selected virtual event areas, the visit processing section may provide the virtual event areas excluding the virtual event area acquired by the user as the acquisition candidate information.","The parameter calculation section may advantageously change the result value or the predetermined game parameter of the user when a visit request for the virtual event acquired by the user has been received from another user. The parameter calculation section may advantageously change the result value or the predetermined game parameter of the user as the visit count of another user increases.","Identification information (ID or code) about the virtual event area may be linked (stored) to identification information (instrument ID of the mobile terminal or user ID designated in the game) as the acquisition information about the user.","The user may be prevented from issuing a visit request for the virtual event area acquired by the user.","For example, the user may be prevented from issuing a visit request when the visit request does not satisfy a predetermined condition.","It is thus possible to provide a game that changes the game result or parameter of the user when another user has visited the virtual event area acquired based on the position of the user in the real world.","This makes it possible to provide an interesting game in which a game operation using the current position information about the user influences the game result and the game parameter of another user, and a game operation using the current position information about another user influences the game result and the game parameter of the user.","It is thus possible to provide a computer-readable information storage medium that stores a program that allows a game operation that utilizes the current position of the user to influence a game result of another user by effectively utilizing the current position information about a plurality of users.","(2) In the information storage medium,\n\n","(3) In the information storage medium,\n\n","(4) In the information storage medium,\n\n","(5) In the information storage medium, the game-providing program may cause the computer to further function as:\n\n","(6) In the information storage medium,\n\n","(7) In the information storage medium, the game-providing program may cause the computer to further function as:\n\n","(8) In the information storage medium,\n\n","(9) In the information storage medium,\n\n","(10) In the information storage medium,\n\n","(11) In the information storage medium,\n\n","(12) In the information storage medium, the game-providing program may cause the computer to further function as:\n\n","For example, the exclusive control section may perform the exclusive control process so that a user who has subsequently issued an acquisition request cannot acquire the virtual event area.","(13) In the information storage medium,\n\n","(14) According to another embodiment of the invention, there is provided a game-providing system including a server that provides game to a plurality of mobile terminals via a network, the game-providing system comprising:\n\n","The game-providing system may be implemented by one server.
