title: Systems and methods of detecting communications fraud
abstract: A telephone fraud prevention system is provided. A fraud application server is in communication with a fraud database and a switch that determines which calls are sent to the fraud application server. A policy function may be integrated with existing fraud detection and correlation systems. When a call is originated and authentication fails, whether that's through a PIN, voice recognition, etc., the fraud application server sends a message indicating that this customer has failed to authenticate. After a number of authentication failures, evidence of high-risk calling is determined. Instead of reactively dealing with the fraud, the risk has been captured at the fraud application server and the switch blocks potential damage from that call and from that user.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure is generally related to communications and, more particularly, is related to communications fraud.","Communication fraud is the theft of communication services (telephones, cell phones, computers etc.) or the use of communication services to commit other forms of fraud. Victims include consumers, businesses and communication service providers. There are several types of communications fraud including identity theft, internet fraud, telemarketing fraud, auction and retail schemes, and money offer scams, among others.","In identity theft, information specific to an individual is misused in order to convince others that the imposter is the individual, effectively passing one self off as someone else. In internet fraud, a scheme is implemented that uses one or more components of the internet\u2014such as chat rooms, email, message boards, or web sites to present fraudulent solicitations to prospective victims, to conduct fraudulent transactions, or to transmit the proceeds of fraud to financial institutions or to others connected with the scheme.","Telemarketing fraud is any scheme used to defraud in which the persons carrying out the scheme use the telephone as their primary means of communicating with prospective victims by trying to persuade them to send money to the scheme. Auction and retail schemes typically attract consumers by purporting to offer high-valve merchandise ranging from expensive jewelry to computers to sport memorabilia at attractive prices. After persuading victims to send money in the form of a personal check, money order, or cashier's check, schemers either send an inferior item or nothing at all.","In money offer scams, potential victims receive, either through e-mail or fax, a request from a purported high ranking government official (with the title of Doctor, Chief, or General) seeking permission to transfer a large sum of money out of their country into the victim's bank account. ATM fraud schemes use a special information storage device to secretly copy the magnetic strip on the back of credit and debit cards during a normal transaction such as an ATM withdrawal or in-store purchase (this may be called skimming).","The advancement of technological tools such as computers, the internet, and cellular phones has made life easier and more convenient for most people in our society. However some individuals and groups have subverted these communication devices into tools to defraud numerous unsuspecting victims. It is not uncommon for a scam to originate in a city, country, state, or even a country different from that in which the victim resides. There are heretofore unaddressed needs with previous communication fraud prevention solutions.","Example embodiments of the present disclosure provide systems of communications fraud detection. Briefly described, in architecture, one example embodiment of the system, among others, can be implemented as follows: a fraud application server (FAS) configured to test calls for compliance with a fraud policy; a database comprising known and assumed fraudulent numbers; a routing engine configured to determine whether a call is to or from a fraudulent number and is to be passed to the FAS; and a router configured to route the call based on the test by the FAS.","Embodiments of the present disclosure can also be viewed as providing methods for communications fraud detection. In this regard, one embodiment of such a method, among others, can be broadly summarized by the following steps: saving known and assumed fraudulent numbers in a database; determining whether a call is to or from a fraudulent number; passing the call to or from a fraudulent number to a fraud application server; testing the call for compliance with a fraud policy; and routing the call based on the testing.","Embodiments of the present disclosure will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which like numerals represent like elements throughout the several figures, and in which example embodiments are shown. Embodiments of the claims may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. The examples set forth herein are non-limiting examples and are merely examples among other possible examples.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","160","145","145","110","130","140","110","120","155","145","150","155","145","110","130","135","110","120","170"]},"Current fraud detection services are examples of reactive systems such as a system to detect credit card fraud, for instance. A communications provider may send \u201ccall data records\u201d from various switches such as telephony switches and collect them, for example, once an hour. That system correlates the information and then notices that there is a problem. For example, a problem may be that this person is making a large number of international calls. However, the detection may take another twenty or thirty minutes to get the case escalated to an appropriate handler, who might place blocks on those accounts. In this example, the delay may be hours or days until a compromised CMTE, for example a customer's PBX is sufficiently secured or blocked, which may result in a significant expense from illegitimate international and long distance calls. The upstream telephony providers bill for any calls they terminate whether the call was fraudulent or not resulting in a large amount of lost revenue by the communications provider of legitimate customer  due to the fraudulent calls.","Example embodiments of the disclosed systems and methods of detecting communications fraud may be instrumental in removing or reducing costs due to fraud. In an example embodiment, user authentication such as a personal identification number (PIN) may be implemented. A database is used to collect information from fraud organizations. Currently some service providers may choose to manually map information from industry databases to switch translations on a periodic basis (for example, once per month. Any new fraud related information during that period will not be included, leading to large delays in recognizing fraud and high fraud-based costs. For this reason, some service entities have blocked some countries entirely. For example, a customer may not be able to call some countries without operator-assistance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","265","275","215","260","245","245","210","225","230","240","225","215","230","240","210","225","220","260","225","230","240"]},"If fraudulent caller  hacks into CMTE  through, for example, network , and a fraudulent call reaches SIP core , it can be determined to be potentially fraudulent, for example, by matching a known fraudulent number in fraud prevention system  or by being to an at-risk country, among other factors. The caller may then be asked for further authentication information. Should incorrect information be input, the call may be blocked, for example, by sending it to a null destination. Alternatively, the call may be treated (for example by an IVR) and terminated by the SIP core. An event notice may be sent from fraud prevention system  to fraud detection and correlation system . Fraud team  may contact legitimate user  so she can address the fraudulent use of the CMTE. After fraudulent destinations have been confirmed, they may be added to fraud prevention system . Although this system was described for detecting and remediating fraud in international communications, it is also applicable for detecting and remediating fraud in domestic long distance and toll communications.","A policy server may be used to implement a fraud mitigation policy. An example policy may escalate an account of originating number that has been determined to have dialed known bad numbers. The account may be escalated to a probationary status. The policy may also include a function for requesting additional authentication information for originating numbers in a probationary status. The additional authentication may include, as a non-limiting example, a pre-defined personal identification number (PIN) that has been assigned or that the user has chosen at the time she signed up. Alternatively, the account may be temporarily shut down through automated means until customer service is contacted.","In yet another example embodiment, a voice-print or other biometric data may be used. When a user initiates a call, the interactive voice response (IVR) system asks for the authentication information. The user may navigate through a menu system. In an example implementation, a SIP-based protocol is used to check the call against the fraud policy. If the call does not meet an element of the fraud policy, then no further authentication is requested and the call is forwarded for normal call processing. If the call does meet an element of the fraud policy, an Identity Management System may be accessed, in which the user's PIN or some other form of authentication information is saved. Alternatively, the call is forwarded to the IVR system, which may require a media server and a controlling application server, as non-limiting examples. In an example implementation, the IVR functions may be housed in an edge\/border device\u2014whether it is a customer edge device, a media\/trunking gateway, or a peering session border controller.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","310","324","302","304","308","302","308","302"]},"Known fraudulent destination telephone numbers may be collected from multiple sources (such as customer database , partner integration fraud database , and shared industry database ), normalized, and stored in the fraud data warehouse (database) . New fraudulent destination numbers may be added in real-time by the fraud team without the need for new switch translations each time new fraudulent destinations have been identified. Access to fraud data warehouse  may be provided to third parties via application programming interface (API) exposure.","Telephony subscribers will place toll calls using customer controlled end-points . These calls traverse the serving telephony switches and are routed to intelligent routing engine  for all long distance or international call completion. All toll calls are routed through intelligent call routing engine , which acts as a single choke point in the network. In an example embodiment, security decisions can be made in intelligent call routing engine  prior to passing the call to a terminating carrier. Intelligent call routing engine  determines that calls destined for particular profiles will be transferred to fraud application server  for special treatment. Such calls may be domestic long distance, international long distance, international to specific countries, etc.","In an example embodiment, fraud application server  enforces policy function  by testing the call for compliance to policy function  prior to passing the call back to intelligent call routing engine  for call completion. Fraud application server  is responsible for looking at outbound calls, analyzing call history and patterns, and enforcing policy function  in real-time. Using the SIP protocol, for example, fraud application server  orchestrates the handling of each call that is sent to it for processing. When appropriate, fraud application server  sends calls to IVR  for media presentation, authentication, or other data collection. Useful data about each call and the associated source and destination phone numbers and accounts are stored in fraud data warehouse . In an example embodiment, fraud application server  updates fraud data warehouse  with call information when appropriate and relies upon it for fast storage and retrieval of prior call and user information.","Fraud data warehouse  and fraud application server  may work together to maintain a trust status for each source phone number and\/or subscriber account. The trust level may be determined by the number and type of policy violations over time as outlined by policy function . Trust levels are variable and may be defined within policy function . In an example implantation, three trust levels may be defined (Trusted, Probation, Suspended). All accounts may be assumed to be \u2018Trusted\u2019 unless their trust level has been escalated to either \u2018Probation\u2019 or \u2018Suspended.\u2019 Intelligent call routing engine  will preferably complete connections for calls that either do not require treatment or have already received treatment and are approved for call completion.","As data comes into fraud application server , fraud application server  queries fraud data warehouse  for information about the recent call history for the source phone number and\/or account. Fraud application server  then uses this data to assess the current call for policy violations. If no violations are found, the fraud application server  documents the trusted relationship and records pertinent information about the call in fraud data warehouse  before passing the call back to the intelligent call routing engine  for completion (marked as approved). If violations to policy function  are discovered, call treatment may be determined by the workflow for that trust level. Violations may cause the trust level to escalate to probation or suspended in accordance with settings in policy function . This may invoke additional authentication or other actions such as collecting information or playing pre-recorded messages to the subscriber. Fraud application server  records the treatment and the associated violations within fraud data warehouse  for future reference. This data may be assigned a time to live or a duration according to policy function  before it is marked for archive and ignored during subsequent policy evaluations. Such data is no longer usable for treatment and policy enforcement decisions but may be retained for historical reference or deleted as defined by policy function .","Customer controlled end-points , either hardware or software based, may interface with a wide array of technologies in order to access features or routing services of a communications system. An end-point may utilize the Internet , wireless networks, or WiFi networks to exchange signaling and\/or media with communication systems. Embedded Multimedia Terminal Adapter (eMTA)  and Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS)  allow an endpoint on a cable provider's network to exchange signaling and\/or media with communication systems. Likewise, Edge or Enterprise Session Border Controller (SBC)  or private branch exchange (PBX)  may also provide end-points with access to communication systems. Edge SBC  may provide Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to Integrated Access Devices (IAD), which may provide time division multiplexing (TDM) interfaces to PBX  systems, or provide IP connectivity to directly to PBX . Core Access SBC  may be utilized as a security device between core network components and equipment facing customers. Media Gateway\/Trunking Gateway ,  may be used to convert IP signaling and media into TDM interfaces to interact with PBX , local exchange carrier (LEC) , or Inter-Exchange Carrier (IXC) .","Alternately, Network SBC , may also be used as a security device between networks if LEC  and IXC  are capable of exchanging signaling and media via IP communications. The same applies to Network SBC ,  for providing IP communications between Long Distance and International Carriers  and Peers . Softswitch  may provide communications features to end-points and may control gateways. Subscriber services such as configuration of authentication credentials may be offered through customer portal  that may leverage identity management system  for authentication and credential storage.","In an example embodiment, call treatment for the \u2018probation\u2019 trust level enacts workflows which present additional authentication challenges (controls) to the caller prior to allowing the call to proceed. These flows may cause fraud application server  to query outside resources such as identity management system  to gather subscriber specific information such as a unique personal identification number (PIN), biometric data (voice print, for example), questions only a legitimate customer could answer, or other authentication mechanisms. In such cases, the call may be redirected to external systems such as IVR  for information presentation and data input collection. Based on policy function  and workflow, additional information may be collected prior to call completion. For instance, the system may collect an alternate form of payment (credit or calling card) or a voice receipt of the customer saying a phrase such as \u201cMy name is [insert customer name here] and I understand and accept the charges for this phone call\u201d. Failure to meet the \u201cprobation\u201d trust level in policy function  may generate notifications to fraud monitoring systems and prevent call completion. Once certain conditions of policy function  have been met, accounts may be escalated to the \u2018Suspended\u2019 trust level whereby all calls from a source number or account will be blocked until the trust level is manually raised by an authorized entity.","In an example embodiment, call treatment at the suspended trust level may provide very limited functionality and\/or limited possibility for successful toll call processing. Fraud data warehouse  continues to record any call attempts. The workflow may play a message to the subscriber asking the caller to call customer service. Policy function  determines how long (if not indefinite) and under what conditions an account or source phone number will remain at a lower trust level before being automatically migrated to a higher level.","All policy violations may generate events that are collected through passive fraud monitoring system . Authorized agents of fraud team  may access, augment, or modify data within fraud data warehouse  and policy function  as necessary and in real time without having to add new switch translations.","Policy function  may comprise a number of policies to be enforced by fraud application server . As an example, if the account or source telephone number has failed to authenticate when requested, a fraud event or alert is generated. The trust level for that account or source telephone number may be decreased to \u2018probation\u2019. Additionally, the trust level is only auto-escalated back to \u2018trust\u2019 if there are no policy violations within a specified time period (e.g. 24 hours).","As another policy example, the account or source telephone number has reached the maximum number of authentication failures within a pre-defined period of time. In this case, a fraud event or alert is generated and the trust level of the source is decreased to \u2018suspended.\u2019","In another policy example, the account or source telephone number has attempted to call a \u2018blacklisted\u2019 destination. In that case a fraud event or alert may be generated and the trust level of the source decreased to \u2018probation.\u2019 Also, the trust level may only be auto-escalated (to trust) if there are no policy violations within a specified time period (e.g. 60 days).","In another policy example, the account or source telephone number has reached the maximum number of attempted calls to \u2018blacklisted\u2019 destinations within a pre-defined period of time. In that case a fraud event or alert may be generated and the trust level of the source decreased to \u2018suspended.\u2019 Also, auto-escalated of the trust level may be prohibited.","In yet another policy example, the account or source telephone number has attempted or completed more than the predefined number of allowed long distance or international calls within a pre-defined period of time for their account class. In this case a fraud event or alert may be generated and the trust level of the source decreased to \u2018probation.\u2019 Also, the trust level may only be auto-escalated (to trust) if there are no policy violations within a specified time period (e.g. 60 days).","In another policy example, the account or source telephone number has reached the maximum defined number of concurrent long distance or international call sessions for their account class. In this case a fraud event or alert may be generated and the trust level of the source decreased to \u2018probation.\u2019 Also, the trust level may only be auto-escalated (to trust) if there are no policy violations within a specified time period (e.g. 24 hours).","In another policy example, the account or source telephone number has reached the maximum defined number of billable minutes over a specified duration of time for their account class. In this case a fraud event or alert may be generated and the trust level of the source decreased to \u2018probation.\u2019 Also, the trust level may only be auto-escalated (to trust) if there are no policy violations within a specified time period (e.g. 24 hours).","In another policy example, the account or source telephone number has reached the maximum defined number of policy violations over a specified duration of time for their account class. In this case a fraud event or alert may be generated and the trust level of the source decreased to \u2018suspended.\u2019 Also, auto-escalation of the trust level may be prohibited.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["410","420","430","440","460","450","470","460"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 5A","b":["5","5","502","504","508","510","506","512","514","516","510"]},"If, in block , the call does match predefined criteria, in block , the call is forwarded to a fraud application server (FAS).
