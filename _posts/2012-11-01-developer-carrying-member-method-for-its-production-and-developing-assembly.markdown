The resin layer  contains an acrylic resin having two units which has specific structures.","Acrylic Resin:","The acrylic resin according to the present invention has the function to improve the triboelectric charge quantity of a negatively triboelectrically chargeable developer. Further, inasmuch as the acrylic resin has a specific cross-linked structure, it can be kept from being affected by humidity. As the result, it can contribute to a high image density without regard to any service environments. The acrylic resin that brings such an effect has a unit represented by the following formula (1) (hereinafter also termed \u201cunit (1)\u201d) and a unit represented by the following formula (2) (hereinafter also termed \u201cunit (2)\u201d).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0028"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"28.79mm","wi":"53.42mm","file":"US08538303-20130917-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1 ","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0029"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00007","num":"00007"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00007","he":"33.70mm","wi":"70.70mm","file":"US08538303-20130917-C00007.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["3 ","4 ","5","6 ","7 "],"sup":"\u2212"},"The unit (1) and unit (2) stand mutually chemically linked at their side chains to have been three-dimensionally cross-linked.

The unit (2) has the part of linking in the vicinity of a quaternary ammonium base, and hence the quaternary ammonium base is kept from coming into motion. The quaternary ammonium base tends to absorb water molecules, and hence the quaternary ammonium base is kept from coming into motion, so that the acrylic resin has less opportunity to come into contact with any moisture present in the atmosphere, thus the moisture is kept from its absorption in the resin layer. As the result, the developer carrying member of the present invention can not easily be affected by environmental moisture and shows a good environmental stability, as so considered. Also, the above motion is accelerated as environments have higher temperature, whereas the acrylic resin the quaternary ammonium base of which has been kept from coming into motion can not easily be affected by temperatures, thus the developer carrying member of the present invention shows a good environmental stability, as so considered.","The unit (2) contributes to improvement in the triboelectric charge quantity of a negatively triboelectrically chargeable developer the developer carrying member holds. R, Rand Rin the formula (2) are each an alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atoms. Inasmuch as they are each an alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, the acrylic resin is kept from being crystallizable, and comes improved in compatibility with solvents.

At least one alkyl group selected from R, Rand Rin the formula (2) may be a long-chain alkyl group having 8 to 18 carbon atoms. This is preferable because the developer carrying member can be more improved in its triboelectricity-providing ability.","A in the formula (2) is an anion in halogens, in inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and nitric acid, and in organic acids such as carboxylic acids and sulfonic acids.

Inasmuch as it is improved in such compatibility, the resin layer can uniformly be formed when the developer carrying member is made up, and makes it easy to control the triboelectricity-providing ability uniformly.

In the case of a monomer in which at least one alkyl group among R, Rand Rin the formula (4) is a long-chain alkyl group having 8 to 18 carbon atoms, the resin layer can more improve the triboelectric charge quantity of a negatively triboelectrically chargeable developer, thus such a monomer is much preferred.","Polymerization Reaction:","The acrylic resin in the present invention may be obtained with ease by carrying out the following polymerization reactions using the above monomer (3) and monomer (4).","Polymerization reaction A: Radical polymerization reaction between monomers selected from the monomer (3) and the monomer (4); and","Polymerization reaction B: Dehydration polycondensation reaction of the hydroxyl group of the monomer (3) and the hydroxyl group of the monomer (4).","The radical polymerization reaction A and the dehydration polycondensation reaction B between hydroxyl groups may be carried out simultaneously, but it is preferable to carry out the dehydration polycondensation reaction B between hydroxyl groups after the radical polymerization reaction A, because any residual monomers can be made less in quantity.","As the radical polymerization reaction A, any known polymerization process such as bulk polymerization, suspension polymerization or emulsion polymerization may be used. In particular, solution polymerization is preferable in view of an advantage that the reaction can be controlled with ease.","As a solvent used in the solution polymerization, what is capable of dissolving the acrylic resin uniformly is suited, and preferred is a lower alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, n-butanol or isopropyl alcohol. Inasmuch as it is such a lower alcohol, a coating material for forming the resin layer can have a low viscosity when it is prepared, easily promising good film-forming properties for the resin layer. Any other solvent may also optionally be mixed when used.","As the ratio of the solvent to the monomer components, which are used in the solution polymerization, the polymerization may preferably be carried out using 25 parts by mass or more to 400 parts by mass or less of the solvent, based on 100 parts by mass of the monomer components.

Usually, the polymerization is initiated with addition of the polymerization initiator to a monomer solution. However, in order to make any unreacted monomers less remain, part of the polymerization initiator may be added on the way of the polymerization. A method may also be employed in which the polymerization is accelerated by irradiation with ultraviolet rays or electron rays. These methods may also be combined.","The polymerization initiator may preferably be used in an amount of from 0.05 part by mass or more to 30 parts by mass or less, and particularly from 0.1 part by mass or more to 15 parts by mass or less, based on 100 parts by mass of the monomer components. Setting within this range the amount of the polymerization initiator to be used enables reduction of any residual monomers and facilitates the controlling of molecular weight of the acrylic resin.

Here, if the dehydration polycondensation reaction B between hydroxyl groups proceeds in excess before the substrate is coated thereon with a coating material containing the acrylic resin solution, the acrylic resin may cross-link to make it difficult for the resin layer to be uniformly formed. Hence, it is preferable for the coating material to be heated after it has been applied onto the substrate.","In order to control the charge-providing ability of the acrylic resin, or in order to control the solubility of the acrylic resin in the solvent, a monomer other than the foregoing may also be used at the time of the radical polymerization.

In such a case, too, an alternating bias voltage formed by superimposing thereon a direct-current voltage component corresponding to a value intermediate between the potential at electrostatic latent image areas and the potential at back ground areas is preferable as the voltage to be applied to the developer carrying member .","Here, in the case of regular development, where the magnetic toner is attracted to an electrostatic latent image having high potential, a magnetic toner triboelectrically chargeable to a polarity reverse to the polarity of the electrostatic latent image is used. In the case of reverse development, where the magnetic toner is attracted to an electrostatic latent image having low potential, a magnetic toner chargeable to the same polarity as the polarity of the electrostatic latent image is used.

Then, in a developing zone D where the developer carrying member  and the photosensitive drum  face each other, the magnetic toner on the developer carrying member  is caused to adhere to the electrostatic latent image so that a magnetic toner image may be formed.","A developing method in such a developing assembly is described below.","The magnetic toner is sent into the developer container  from a developer supply container (not shown) via a developer feed member (such as a screw) . The developer container  is divided into a first chamber  and a second chamber , where the magnetic toner having been sent into the first chamber  is sent to the second chamber  by the aid of an agitating transport member , passing through an opening formed by the developer container  and a partition member . The second chamber  is provided therein with an agitating member , which prevents the magnetic toner from stagnating.","The developer container is fitted with a magnetic blade , the developer layer thickness control member, in such a way as to face the developer carrying member  leaving a gap of from about 50 \u03bcm or more to about 500 \u03bcm or less between them. The magnetic line of force exerted from a magnetic pole N of the magnet roller  is converged to the gap at the magnetic blade, where the developer carrying member is rotated in the direction of an arrow A to form on the developer carrying member  a thin layer of the magnetic toner. Incidentally, a non-magnetic developer layer thickness control member may also be used in place of the magnetic blade .","The magnetic toner gains triboelectric charges which enable development of the electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive drum , as a result of the friction between toner particles one another and between the magnetic toner and the resin layer  at the surface of the developer carrying member . The thickness of the magnetic toner thin layer thus formed on the developer carrying member  may preferably be much smaller than the minimum gap between the developer carrying member  and the photosensitive drum  in the developing zone D.","In order to cause the magnetic toner carried on the developer carrying member , to fly to the electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive drum to develop this latent image, a development bias voltage may preferably be applied to the developer carrying member  from a development bias power source .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0106"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["306","305","302","301","302"]},"A developing method making use of the developing assembly described above is described below.","A developer container  is provided therein with an agitating transport member  for agitating and transporting a non-magnetic one-component developer  (a non-magnetic toner). The developer container is further provided therein with a developer feeding and stripping member (RS roller)  in contact with the developer carrying member , which member is to feed the non-magnetic toner  to the developer carrying member  and also strip off any non-magnetic toner  remaining on the surface of the developer carrying member  after development.","The RS roller  is rotated in the same direction as or in the opposite direction to that of the developer carrying member  to thereby strips off, inside the developer container , any non-magnetic toner  remaining on the developer carrying member  and feeds thereto a fresh non-magnetic toner . The developer carrying member  carries thereon the non-magnetic toner  thus fed and is rotated in the direction of an arrow A to thereby transport the non-magnetic toner to a developing zone D where the developer carrying member  and the photosensitive drum  face each other.","The non-magnetic toner carried on the developer carrying member  is pressed against the surface of the developer carrying member  by a developer layer thickness control member , so that its layer is formed in a uniform thickness. The non-magnetic toner is, as a result of the friction between toner particles one another, the friction between it and the developer carrying member  and the friction between it and the developer layer thickness control member , provided with triboelectric charges sufficient for developing the electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive drum . The non-magnetic toner layer formed on the developer carrying member  may be in a thickness smaller than the minimum gap between the developer carrying member  and the photosensitive drum  in the developing zone.","In order to cause the non-magnetic toner  carried on the developer carrying member , to fly to the electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive drum  to develop the latent image, a development bias voltage may be applied to the developer carrying member  from a development bias power source . As the development bias voltage , it may be either of a direct-current voltage and an alternating bias voltage, and its voltage may also be set at the same voltage as the above.","In the developer container of the above developing assembly, the RS roller  may preferably be an elastic roller made of, e.g., resin, rubber or sponge. In place of the RS roller , a belt or a brush member may be used depending on cases.","It is preferable for the elastic blade  to be also one made of the same material, and having the same curved shape, as those of the elastic blade  of the magnetic one-component non-contact developing assembly shown in , and to be so set as to be pressed against the developer carrying member .","The elastic blade  may be brought into touch with the developer carrying member  at the same touch pressure as that in the case of the elastic blade  against the developer carrying member  in the magnetic one-component non-contact type shown in . This is preferable for the like reasons.","The above example is a non-magnetic one-component non-contact type, which, however, may also preferably be used in a non-magnetic one-component contact developing assembly, in which the non-magnetic one-component developer layer on the developer carrying member is formed in a thickness not less than the gap distance between the developer carrying member and the photosensitive drum in the developing zone D.","Developer:","The developer (toner) according to the present invention has a binder resin which contains a colorant, a charge control agent, a release agent, inorganic particles and so forth. It may be either of a magnetic toner, which contains a magnetic material as an essential component, and a non-magnetic toner, which does not contain any magnetic material. The toner may preferably have mass-average particle diameter within the range of from 4 \u03bcm or more to 10 \u03bcm or less. This is because the triboelectric charge quantity of the toner or the image quality and image density can be well balanced. As long as the toner has a mass-average particle diameter of 10 \u03bcm or less, any microdot images can be kept from being formed in a low reproducibility. On the other hand, as long as the toner has a mass-average particle diameter of 4 \u03bcm or more, any density decrease due to faulty triboelectric charging can be kept from occurring.","As the binder resin of the toner, usable are vinyl resin, polyester resin, polyurethane resin, epoxy resin and phenol resin. Of these, vinyl resin and polyester resin are preferred. For the purpose of improving triboelectric charge characteristics, a charge control agent may be used in the toner by incorporating the former in toner particles (internal addition) or blending it with toner particles (external addition). Such a charge control agent facilitates control of optimum charge quantity in accordance with developing systems.","Where the toner is used in a one-component developing assembly, the toner the charge quantity of which has been controlled as above may be used as the developer, whereby the effect of improving the charge-providing ability of the developer carrying member of the present invention can be obtained with ease.","In the following working examples, \u201cpart(s)\u201d and \u201c%\u201d refer to \u201cpart(s) by mass\u201d and \u201c%\u201d by mass\u201d, respectively, unless particularly noted.","1. Methods for Measuring Physical Properties","Measuring methods concerning the present invention are described first.","(1) Acrylic Resin Analytical Method:","Polymer structure of the acrylic resin was determined by analyzing with a pyrolytic GC\/MS analyzer \u201cVOYAGER\u201d (trade name; manufactured by Thermo Electron Inc.) a sample obtained by shaving off the resin layer of the developer carrying member. The analysis was made under conditions of pyrolytic temperature: 600\u00b0 C.; column: HP-1 (15 m\u00d70.25 mm\u00d70.25 \u03bcm); inlet: temperature 300\u00b0 C.; split: 20.0; injection rate: 1.2 ml\/min; heating: 50\u00b0 C. (4 minutes) up to 300\u00b0 C. (20\u00b0 C.\/min).","(2) Volume Resistivity of Resin Layer:","A resin layer of 7 \u03bcm to 20 \u03bcm in thickness was formed on a PET sheet of 100 \u03bcm in thickness, and its volume resistivity was measured with a resistivity meter \u201cLORESTAR AP\u201d (trade name; manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation), using a four-terminal probe. It was measured in an environment of a temperature of 20\u00b0 C. to 25\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 50% RH to 60% RH.","(3) Arithmetic-Mean Roughness Ra of Developer Carrying Member Surface:","The arithmetic-mean roughness Ra of the developer carrying member surface was measured according to JIS B 0601 (2001), using a surface roughness meter \u201cSURFCORDER SE-3500\u201d (trade name; manufactured by Kosaka Laboratory, Ltd.). It was measured under conditions of a cut-off of 0.8 mm, a measurement distance of 4 mm and a feed rate of 0.5 mm\/s. It was also measured at the positions of 3 spots in the axial direction (at the middle and at positions of 80 mm each toward both ends from the middle) and 3 spots in the peripheral direction (at intervals of 120 degrees), i.e., 9 spots in total. Then, the average value of measured values was taken as the arithmetic-mean roughness Ra of the developer carrying member surface.","(4) Layer Thickness of Resin Layer:","To measure the layer thickness of the resin layer, a controller \u201cLS-5500\u201d (trade name; manufactured by Keyence Corporation) and a sensor head \u201cLS-5040T\u201d (trade name; manufactured by Keyence Corporation) were used which were of a laser dimension measuring instrument which measures the outer diameter of a cylinder by using laser light. A sensor was separately fastened to an instrument fitted with a developer carrying member fastening jig and a developer carrying member feed mechanism, where the outer diameter size of the developer carrying member was measured. It was measured at 30 spots on the developer carrying member divided into 30 areas in its lengthwise direction, and then the developer carrying member was rotated by 90 degrees in the peripheral direction, and thereafter its outer diameter was further measured at 30 spots, 60 spots in total. The average value of measured values thus found was taken as the outer diameter size of the sample member. The outer diameter size of the substrate was beforehand measured and, after the resin layer was formed, the outer diameter was again measured, where a difference between them was taken as the layer thickness of the resin layer.","2.

Conductive Particles","As the conductive particles used in the developer carrying member, the following particles were used.\n\n","2-3. Unevenness-Providing Particles","As the unevenness-providing particles used in the developer carrying member, the following particles were used.\n\n","(1) Production of Developer Carrying Member D-1:","A developer carrying member D-1 was produced in the following way. First, the following materials were mixed, and the mixture obtained was dispersion-treated by means of a sand mill \u201cHorizontal-type Ready Mill NVM-03 (trade name; manufactured by AIMEX Co., Ltd.) (glass beads of 1.0 mm in diameter, in a packing of 85%) to obtain a coating fluid.\n\n","One having the same shape as a cylindrical pipe made of aluminum, of a developer carrying member fitted to a pure-part cartridge \u201cLASER JET Q5942A Print Cartridge Black\u201d (trade name; manufactured by Hewlett-Packard Co.) of \u201cLASER JET 4350n\u201d (trade name; manufactured by Hewlett-Packard Co.) was readied as a substrate.","This substrate was masked at its both end portions by 6 mm each, and thereafter the substrate was so placed that its axis was parallel to the vertical. Then, this substrate was rotated at 1,500 rpm, and was coated with the coating fluid while a spray gun was descended at 35 mm\/second, to form a coating in such a way that it came to be 7 \u03bcm in thickness as a result of hardening. Subsequently, the coating was hardened by heating it for 30 minutes in a temperature 150\u00b0 C. hot-air drying oven, to obtain a developer carrying member, D-1.","(2) Setup of Electrophotographic Image Forming Apparatus, and Image Evaluation Making Use of the Same:","A magnet roller was set in the developer carrying member D-1 obtained, and this was fitted to a cartridge \u201cLASER JET Q5942A Print Cartridge Black\u201d (trade name; manufactured by Hewlett-Packard Co.) to make up a developing assembly. This was mounted to a printer \u201cLASER JET 4350n\u201d (trade name; manufactured by Hewlett-Packard Co.) to make the following image evaluation. Incidentally, the printer \u201cLASER JET 4350n\u201d is an electrophotographic image forming apparatus having the magnetic one-component non-contact developing assembly shown in . That is, this developing assembly has a magnetic one-component developer and also has an elastic blade as the developer layer thickness control member. Also, the developer carrying member is provided in its interior with a magnet.","The image evaluation was made in three environments, a high-temperature and high-humidity environment (H\/H), a normal-temperature and normal-humidity environment (N\/N) and a low-temperature and low-humidity environment (L\/L). The evaluation in the high-temperature and high-humidity environment was made in an environment of temperature 32.5\u00b0 C. and humidity 80% RH after the developing assembly was left to stand for 2 weeks in an environment of temperature 40\u00b0 C. and humidity 85% RH. The evaluation in the normal-temperature and normal-humidity environment was made in an environment of temperature 23\u00b0 C. and humidity 50% RH after the developing assembly was left to stand for 2 weeks in the like environment. The evaluation in the low-temperature and low-humidity environment was made in an environment of temperature 15\u00b0 C. and humidity 10% RH after silica gel and the developing assembly were put into a desiccator and this was left to stand for 2 weeks at a temperature of 15\u00b0 C.","In the above respective environments, letter size sheets \u201cBUSINESS 4200\u201d (trade name; available from Xerox Corporation; 75 g\/m) were used, and character images with a print percentage of 3% were continuously printed on up to 100 sheets in A4-size longitudinal feed, and thereafter images were evaluated.","Evaluation item was image density. Using a reflection densitometer \u201cRD918\u201d (trade name; manufactured by Macbeth Co.), the density of solid black areas when solid black images were printed was measured at 5 spots, and an arithmetic-mean value thereof was taken as the image density. Also, a percentage change in image density between that in the low-temperature and low-humidity environment and that in the high-temperature and high-humidity environment was calculated. The results of evaluation are shown in Table 4.","Developer carrying members D-2 to D-22 and d-1 to d-4 were produced in the same way as Example 1 except that those respectively shown in Table 3 were used as coating fluids. These were fitted to the cartridges, which were then each mounted to the printer to make evaluation.
