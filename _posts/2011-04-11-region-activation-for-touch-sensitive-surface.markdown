title: Region activation for touch sensitive surface
abstract: One or more regions of a touch sensitive surface can be activated individually by a user. A region defines an active input area for processing touch input events. Any touch event associated with a beginning touch event that is detected in the active area is processed for display. Any touch input event detected outside the active region that is not associated with the beginning touch event is excluded from the processing. Once a writing gesture is started in the active region, the writing gesture can extend outside of the active region so long as the writing gesture is associated with the beginning touch event.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Exemplary Active Region for Touch Sensitive Surface","Exemplary Process Flow","Exemplary Device Architecture"],"p":["This disclosure relates generally to devices having touch sensitive surfaces.","Modern mobile devices (e.g., electronic tablets) can run applications that allow a user to capture handwritten notes using a touch sensitive surface. While handwriting on the touch sensitive surface, a typical user may rest their palm or side of their hand on the touch sensitive surface for support, causing the device to register a touch input. To avoid such inadvertent touch input, the user can elevate their hand above the touch surface when writing. This workaround can be awkward and tiring to the user.","One or more regions of a touch sensitive surface can be activated individually by a user. A region defines an active input area for processing touch input events. Any touch event associated with a beginning touch event that is detected in the active area is processed for display. Any touch input event detected outside the active region that is not associated with the beginning touch event is excluded from the processing. In some implementations, a region can be visually delineated by horizontal rule lines of a virtual notebook page. A selector\/indicator can be displayed at the left or right end of the region for activating the corresponding region. Once a writing gesture is started in the active region, the writing gesture can extend outside of the active region so long as the writing gesture is made without interruption. When a region is activated by a user touching the selector\/indicator, the selector\/indicator can be visually augmented to indicate that its corresponding region is active. When the writing gesture is completed by the user, the writing gesture displayed in the active region can be captured and stored for use with other applications.","Particular implementations of region activation for a touch sensitive surface, provides one or more of the following advantages. A user can independently activate one or more regions of a touch sensitive surface to avoid registering inadvertent touch inputs outside the active region. The active regions can be captured and stored for use with other applications.","The details of one or more disclosed implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages will become apparent from the description, the drawings and the claims.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","100","102","105","102"]},"In the example shown, a user interface element  is displayed on the left end of each region . User interface element  is a selector\/indicator that can be touched by a user to activate the corresponding region . For example, the user can touch user interface element  to activate corresponding region . Activating a region means that touch events (e.g., writing gestures) initiated in region  can be detected and processed for display by a processor of the device, resulting in an immediate, real-time display of the user's handwriting. That is, touch events (e.g., writing gestures) are detected and processed for display in real-time to create the appearance that the user is handwriting on touch sensitive surface .","In general, touches started outside of active region  are ignored, while touches initiated within active region  are used to start a currently active path. The continuation of a touch started within active region  (e.g., a writing gesture) causes curves to be added to the currently active path using, for example, a cubic B\u00e9zier path generator as described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/084,355, for \u201cHandwriting Capture Techniques,\u201d filed even date herewith. At any given time, only one active path is recognized by the device as a continuation of a touch gesture.","In some implementations, touch screen driver software translates touch signals from hardware (e.g., a capacitive touch screen) into touch events, which can be aggregated into touch gestures using a touch input model. The touch events or gestures can be provided to an operating system or other applications through an Application Programming Interface (API) where the touch events can be further processed.","Generally, user interface element  can be any size or shape and located anywhere on touch sensitive surface . In the example shown, user interface element  is a circle that is visually augmented (e.g., filled with color) when selected to indicate its selection and the active status of its corresponding active region . Visually augmenting user interface element  can include, but is not limited to changing the color, shape or size of the element, animating the element, highlighting the user interface element or its background, or the like. In some implementations, selection of region  can be indicated by audio or force feedback (e.g., a vibration) in addition or in lieu of visual augmentation.","In some implementations, user interface element  can be displayed at left or right ends of each region  to facilitate selection by left or right-handed users. A settings menu or similar input mechanism can allow users to select the location of user interface element  on touch sensitive surface . In some implementations, user interface element  can be a hardware button.","When the user is finished writing in active region , the user can select the \u201cAccept\u201d button  to capture the handwritten note in active region  and stored in a digital image format (e.g., .png). Only the content drawn within active region  is captured. Once captured and stored, the content can be used with other applications. Upon acceptance, active region  can be deactivated automatically. A \u201cClear\u201d button  can be used to clear the entire active region  of its contents.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","204","202","100","202","202","202","202","202"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["300","300","400"]},"In some implementations, process  can begin by receiving input selecting region(s) of touch sensitive surface for activation (). In some implementations, the touch sensitive surface can be a touch sensitive display of a device (e.g., computer, mobile phone, electronic tablet). A region can be selected by touching a selector\/indicator corresponding to the region, as described in reference to .","The user interface element can be visually augmented to indicate selection of its corresponding region. Other feedback is also possible. For example, audio or force feedback (e.g., a vibration) can be used to indicate selection of a region. A region can be any portion of a touch sensitive surface and have any shape or size. In some implementations, a region can be the writing area between two horizontal rule lines of a virtual notebook page, as shown in . Generally, the user interface element for selecting a corresponding region can be located anywhere on the touch sensitive surface and can be any size or shape. In the notebook example of , a user interface element is displayed at the left end of each region to facilitate easy selection by a right-handed user.","Process  can continue by activating the selected region(s) (). Once activated, any touch input in the active region will be detected and processed by the device for display.","Process  can continue by detecting a beginning touch event in the active region (). A beginning touch event can occur when the user first touches the active region with a finger, stylus or other writing instrument.","Process  continues detecting and processing additional touch events in active region(s) associated with the beginning touch event (). The processing excludes additional touch events detected outside the active region(s) that are not associated with the beginning touch event in the active region(s).","Process  continues by receiving input accepting the processed touch events (), and capturing and storing the processed touch events (). A user can accept touch events by selecting a virtual button or providing other detectable input. Upon acceptance, the content in the active region can be captured into a digital image and stored (e.g., stored in a container object) for use by other applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-5"],"b":["400","400","402","404","406","402","404","406"]},"Sensors, devices, and subsystems can be coupled to peripherals interface  to facilitate multiple functionalities.
