{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["A head-end is a facility featuring equipment for receiving television signals, processing them and feeding them for distribution over a television network. Cable television service providers receive the signals and distribute them to subscribers in the form of one or more channels. Typically, set-top boxes (STBs) are configured at the residence, business or other location of the subscriber to enable playback of content via the one or more channels. Unfortunately, when connectivity to the head-end system is lost for any reason, users are not able to access on-demand access to scheduled programming via the channels, use interactive widgets, play games or perform other normal functions of the STB.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach to effectively address the loss of head-end connectivity.","A preferred apparatus, method, and software for simulating a connection to a head-end system to enable execution of content and features of a set-top box are described. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the preferred embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, that the preferred embodiments may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the preferred embodiments of the invention.","Although various exemplary embodiments are described with respect to a set-top box (STB), it is contemplated that these embodiments have applicability to any device capable of processing audio-video (AV) signals for presentation to a user, such as a home communication terminal (HCT), a digital home communication terminal (DHCT), a stand-alone personal video recorder (PVR), a television set, a digital video disc (DVD) player, a video-enabled phone, an AV-enabled personal digital assistant (PDA), and\/or a personal computer (PC), as well as other like technologies and customer premises equipment (CPE).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","103","113","105","107","119"]},"In this manner, media service provider (MSP)  may provide (in addition to their own media) content obtained from sources, such as one or more third-party content provider systems , one or more television broadcast systems , etc., as well as content available via one or more communication networks , etc. In addition, the content may include television programming for presentment via one or more channels at varying times. The content is provided to the set-top box by way of a head-end system , which processes video signals for distribution into the television broadcast system . Control signals are also generated and transmitted by the head-end system to enable set-top box connectivity. A variety of equipment is used at the head-end system  for supporting content and control signal generation and transport, including antennas and satellite dishes to receive signals, preamplifiers, frequency converters, demodulators and modulators, processors, and scrambling and de-scrambling equipment.","It is observed that television remains the prevalent global medium for entertainment and information as individuals spend a great deal of time tuning into both public television programs as well as paid televised media (e.g., cable television). Set-top boxes are often configured for use with television displays, home entertainment systems and media processing equipment to enable viewers to receive, tune and even interact with or manipulate television content. Capabilities supported may include enabling the selection of specific programs and channels, the playing games, the activation of various widgets (e.g., an interactive clock), etc. However, the set-top box does not function without its connection to the head-end system. A connection may be lost, for example, due to a faulty coaxial cable or improper configuring of the set-top box to the service provider network . When connectivity loss occurs, the user cannot enjoy the benefits of the STB.","Thus, the approach of system  is configured to enable viewers to access content and execute the various features of the set-top box  regardless of the level of connectivity to the head-end system . By way of example, a simulation platform  operates in connection with the set-top box  to generate the necessary control signals for simulating connectivity between the STB  and the head-end system . As such, when a lost connection  between the STB  and the head-end system  occurs for any reason, the viewer is still permitted to access television programs and broadcasts through the various channels, load program guide data, execute video-on-demand, operate widgets and perform other enhanced features. The simulation platform  simulates (mimics) the STB  to head-end  connectivity by providing various control data signals for indicating a connection. These control signals may include, for example, timing information, dynamic data, and channel map data; all of which are required to enable the playback of content data as received during an instance of an actual connection to the head-end system .","In certain embodiments, the simulation platform  operates in connection with the STB  to persistently store (e.g., cache) the various control data signals and associated content data during a period of connectivity. For example, when the coaxial cable connected to the STB  for detecting and receiving head-end signals is active, the platform  caches the control signal data and associated content to data store and respectively, which are accessible to the platform  and thus the STB . The content data as stored includes past content data, future content data, or both, while the various control data signals correspond to the content data accordingly. Storage may be performed on a scheduled basis, such as whenever a connection is available or at a predetermined frequency\u2014i.e., once per day. In addition, the platform  may be configured to cache content data up to a specific duration in time and\/or up to a specific buffer amount. Hence, the designated time period or specified buffer may enable 24 hours worth of past or future content data to be stored from the time of head-end access. It is noted that the configuration settings may correspond to a factory, manufacturer, service provider or television broadcast provider defaults, one or more user settings, or a combination thereof.","Per the caching execution of platform  during connectivity, the STB  may access the following information from the head-end: Timing information, Channel Map Data, and Dynamic Data. In one embodiment, timing information includes data for indicating a last recorded time of accessing of the head-end control data signals. Hence, the control data signals are stored and time stamped accordingly during periods of scheduled caching (storing) when STB  to head-end connectivity is active.","Channel Map Data, in one embodiment, includes data for indicating which programs\/content correspond to which channel. The channel map data may also specify programming data for indicating a scheduled time of play of content data . For example, the scheduled time data may be used to segment the channel map into programs\/content intended for different time slots. One program may be scheduled to occur, for example, at 3 pm-4 pm, while another is set for the 4 pm-5 pm time slot. Hence, the platform  utilizes channel map data to map specific content data to the organized scheduled time data accordingly. In addition, the platform analyzes the scheduled time data against current time data, the available timing information, or a combination thereof in order to regulate playback of the recorded content data relative to real-time conditions. Hence, depending on the current time and the timing information, content corresponding to the scheduled time slot is accessed.","According to one embodiment, Dynamic Data include information that is asynchronously changed as further updates to the content data (e.g., metadata), channel map data, and other information becomes available. Updates in data may occur at any time, with periods of inactivity in between, as the content data is being cached. By way of example, the dynamic data may include program changes as indicated by the television broadcast system provider (e.g., cable television provider) or media service provider  for affecting configuration of the channel map data. As another example, the dynamic data may be cached for supporting on-demand execution of widgets, games and content-based features via the STB, etc. Under this approach, dynamic data is therefore made available in the form of input provided by the user\/viewer during execution of a widget or any other interaction with the various features of the STB . This includes instances where the user selects a particular action button, enters a text string, activates a dynamic web link directly from content data , places a call, etc.","Concurrent with the storing of the above described control data signals to data store , the platform  also records the associated content data . The content data may be cached, for example, as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) content, a common data format used by cable television providers and the like for encoding and transmitting content. As described above, the content data is mapped to a specific channel via the channel map data, for playback on demand or upon accessing of a particular channel based on the specified time as live television content. Also, in certain embodiments, content data may include graphic primitives, textual data, executable data and configuration data required for supporting the operation of widgets and other features of the STB . By way of example, this may include one or more menus, buttons, text boxes, icons, control panels, screen-in-screen controls, instructions, digital media, games, social networking utilities, sounds, and other content that is invoked or processed in connection with the various features of the STB .","It is noted that the channel map data, timing information and dynamic data may be used to indicate the specific content data required to be retrieved and subsequently stored relative to a given user profile. For example, a user having a platinum package according to their service contract may have access to more channels and thus content data , requiring retrieval of more content as specified by the channel map data. Alternatively, a user having a basic package may have access to only limited content data as specified for retrieval via the channel map data.","Storing of the above described control signal data in conjunction with content data enables playback of the content, on demand, regardless of a loss of connectivity  of the STB  to the head-end system . When a connection is determined to fail, i.e., connection , the content data as stored may be played back as television programming or executed in real-time for supporting STB  functionality without direct connect to the head-end system . In certain embodiments, the simulation platform  also supports remote or \u201con-the-go\u201d execution of STB  functionality from one or more user devices, whether the devices are located inside the user premise  or outside. For example, the platform  may interact with a mobile device  belonging to the user\/viewer that is configured to access the control signal data and content data as stored by way of a playback application . The playback application  may be a media player, television broadcast software or any other like utility having the appropriate application programming interfaces (APIs) for accessing the simulation platform , enabling the execution of content data and invoking the various features of the STB . Per this execution, in response to a request for access to particular content or execution of an STB feature (e.g., activation of a game), the data and from the platform  as stored is provided to the playback application  at the wireless device . Under this scenario, the playback application  may be configured to support on-demand, remote accessibility to the functions and features of the STB  by way of a communication network . In addition, the playback application  supports access to content and STB features with or without direct access to the head-end system .","It is noted that user devices  or  may be any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), smartphone or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the devices  and  can support any type of interface for supporting the presentment or exchanging of data, including content related to the STB . Still further, user devices  and  may facilitate various input means for receiving and generating information, including touch screen capability, keyboard and keypad data entry, voice-based input mechanisms and the like. Any known and future implementations of user devices for supporting access to a communication network  are applicable.","Communication network  can include: a public data network (e.g., the Internet), various intranets, local area networks (LAN), wide area networks (WAN), the public switched telephony network (PSTN), integrated services digital networks (ISDN), other private packet switched networks or telephony networks, as well as any additional equivalent system or combination thereof. These networks may employ various access technologies including cable networks, satellite networks, subscriber television networks, digital subscriber line (DSL) networks, optical fiber networks, hybrid fiber-coax networks, worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) networks, wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks, other wireless networks (e.g., 3G or 4G wireless broadband networks, mobile television networks, radio networks, etc.), terrestrial broadcasting networks, provider specific networks (e.g., fiber optic networks, cable networks, etc), and the like. Such networks may also utilize any suitable protocol supportive of data communications, e.g., transmission control protocol (TCP), internet protocol (IP), file transfer protocol (FTP), telnet, hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS), asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), socket connections, Ethernet, frame relay, and the like, to connect set-top boxes  to various sources of content data, such as one or more third-party content provider systems . Although depicted in  as separate networks, communication network  may be completely or partially contained within service provider network . For example, service provider network  may include facilities to provide for transport of packet-based communications.","According to certain embodiments, devices at a premise  may also be configured to communicate over one or more local area networks (LANs)  corresponding to the user (e.g., viewer). In this manner, routers (not shown) may be used for establishing and operating, or at least connecting to, a network such as a \u201chome\u201d network or LAN , and is used to route communications among various interconnected devices . For example, set-top box  may be communicatively coupled to LAN  via a router and a coaxial cable, whereas devices ,  and  may be connected to LAN  via a router and a wireless connection, a network cable (e.g., Ethernet cable), and\/or the like. It is noted, however, that in certain embodiments set-top box  may be configured to establish connectivity with LAN  via one or more wireless connections. A determined loss of connectivity between the set-top box  and the LAN , illustrated as lost connection , may trigger the invoking of the above described head-end simulation process. Further, set-top box , wireless device  and computing device  may be uniquely identified by LAN  via any suitable addressing scheme. For example, LAN  may utilize the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) to dynamically assign \u201cprivate\u201d DHCP internet protocol (IP) addresses to set-top box  and devices  and , i.e., IP addresses that are accessible to the devices that are part of the LAN  facilitated via a router.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 6"],"b":["101","101","203","205","207","209","211","213","101","215","111","111"],"i":["a ","b. "]},"By way of example, the user profile data  may include data for identifying the user and\/or viewer of content provided by a set-top box. Thus, the user profile data  may include data specifying the name, address and other contact details of the user along with a unique identifier of the user. In addition, the profile may indicate a specific content package and available programming features associated with a given user (e.g., platinum level user versus premium channel user). Still further, the user profile data  specifies the one or more user devices  that are able to access the simulation platform  for on-the-go access to the capabilities of the STB . For example, the user may specify that a wireless enabled laptop  be given permission to connect to the platform  and thus access any control signal data and content data available to the STB .","In certain embodiments, the authentication module  enables the maintenance of the above described user profile data  as well as the handling of initial registration requests. Registration requests may be handled by the authentication module  pursuant to a subscription arrangement between a user of the STB  and a provider of the platform  (e.g., a communication services provider or television broadcast service provider). In addition to initial registration management, the authentication module  may also operate in connection with a communication interface  to detect the receipt of requests for operation of the STB  in accordance with a head-end simulation mode. Requests may be received from one or more registered devices, in connection with a profile, by a device within the user premise  or externally located (e.g., laptop  of ).","In certain embodiments, the data caching module  retrieves the various control signal data as well as content data required for simulating a connection of the STB  to a head-end system. The data caching module  first detects the presence of the head-end by way of various connectors at the STB . A connection detection module  may enable dielectric connectivity detection, control signal data transfer verification, etc, for detecting the presence of the proper control signal data . When the required control signals are detected, a determination is made that connectivity to the head-end is active, and the control signal data is stored as control signal data . In addition, content data is stored during the time of connection to the head-end. For certain implementations, the control signal data and content data are cached to support immediate access to the data required for simulated playback execution. It is noted, however, that the data caching module  may further support the storing of data and to a permanent memory location, such as for the building of a video library, maintenance of a certain reached level of a game, storing of notes, bookmarks or links as generated by a user, or other storage requirements.","The data caching module  retrieves data and on a predetermined basis. For example, the module  may be set to retrieve data n number of times per day upon detection of an active connection, only upon initial boot-up or activation of the STB  or at other intervals. In addition, the amount of data and to be consumed during the time of detected STB  to head-end connectivity is predetermined. For example, the user profile  may indicate the size of the content data buffer to be maintained. Alternatively, the profile  may indicate a specific amount of programming to be cached. In the latter scenario, for instance, the user profile  may specify 24 hours worth of programming is to be cached, thus enabling the user to store the prior\/or forward 24 hours worth of content. Control data signals , including timing information, channel map data and dynamic data are also stored in association with the content data during periods of determined head-end connectivity. It is noted that the frequency of data retrieval and rate of data consumption may also be set by the television broadcast system provider, communication service provider, or the like.","In certain embodiments, the kiosk module  invokes a head-end simulation process in response to: (1) a determined loss of connectivity between the STB  and the head-end system, as determined by a connection detection module ; (2) a request for access to the features and functions of the STB  by a remote device (on-the-go execution), as determined by the authentication module  in conjunction with a communication interface ; or a combination thereof. By way of example, when a sudden loss of connectivity is determined, the kiosk module  retrieves the stored control signal data and presents it to the STB . Upon receipt of this data , execution of the STB  is permitted; the control data signals  being sufficient for indicating a presence of the head-end with respect to the STB .","As a result of the simulated connectivity (head-end simulation process), the user is provides access content data , albeit on a limited basis, despite the determined lack of connection of the STB  to the head-end system. Hence, the kiosk module  facilitates playback, at the STB , of the stored content data respective to programming preferences as detailed via channel map data. In addition, the kiosk module  enables the STB  to respond to various user commands and interactions based on the simulated connection to the head-end, including enabling users to select a particular channel for enabling viewing\/accessing of programming, launching games or widgets, viewing content descriptions, enabling video-on-demand features or other STB  capability.","It is noted that the kiosk module  relays the control signal data and content data to the STB  for enabling STB  execution, but does not execute the various functions of the STB . Rather, the kiosk module  provides an interface to the required control signal data for enabling operation of the STB , and the STB  then executes the various functions and features associated with its implementation. More regarding the exemplary implementation of the STB  is described later on with respect to . By way of example, when a request for access to a specific channel is requested, the channel map data, timing data, and dynamic data is presented to the STB  by the kiosk module  to support playback of content data by the STB  in accordance with the proper time and\/or channel selection. Hence, the kiosk module  matches the current time at which a request is received to the program\/content time slot data as indicated via the channel map data; enabling the execution of content on the STB  to be carried out seamlessly.","As noted, playback of the stored content data in the absence of head-end connectivity is limited to that which was previously recorded such as via a DVR, or that was downloaded as content data . The extent of playback of the content data by the STB  or playback application  is therefore also dependent on the timing information\u2014i.e., last recorded time of accessing of the head-end control signals. As such, the STB  or playback application  can only playback content that occurred X hours before or after the timestamp.","In certain embodiments, the connection detection module  determines whether or not a current connection to the head-end is available and feeds this information to the kiosk module . When a connection is determined\u2014i.e., specific control signal data is available\u2014the kiosk module  remains inactive (head-end simulation process not invoked) while the data caching module  actively stores\/caches data (on the basis of predetermined schedule). When no connection is determined, however, the kiosk module  is activated (head-end simulation process invoked) while the data caching module  is set to inactive. As noted previously, the connection detection module  may employ various signal verification techniques, dielectric connectivity detection techniques, and other methods relative to the various interfaces and connectors to the STB .","In one embodiment, a communication interface  enables formation of a session over a network  between the simulation platform  and\/or the set-top box  and the playback application . This may include execution of various protocols and data sharing techniques for enabling collaborative execution between respective devices operating the playback application  and the platform  over networks  or  for receiving a request for access to the set-top box . Request authorization may be regulated by the authentication module  as it operates in connection with the interface ; the request being based on the user profile data . It is noted that the communication interface , therefore, supports on-the-go accessibility to the features and\/or operation of the set-top box  in the absence of head-end connectivity of the STB, of the requesting device, or a combination thereof.","Also, in one embodiment, a control module  is configured to regulate the communication processes between the various other modules for simulating a connection to a head-end system to enable execution of content and features of a set-top box. For example, the controller module  generates the appropriate signals to control the communication interface  for facilitating transmission of data over the network . Also, while not shown, the controller module  may access various monitoring systems for regulating operation of the simulation platform . This may include systems for detecting current data traffic levels, error conditions, data exchange rates, network latencies, resource allocation levels and other conditions associated with the operation of the platform , such as to ensure its effective use respective to a calling playback application .","While specific reference will be made to the above described implementation, it is also contemplated that platform  may embody many forms and include multiple and\/or alternative components. For example, the components of platform  may be combined, located in separate structures, and\/or separate locations. By way of example, platform  may be implemented in accordance with a cloud-based server implementation or as a hosted solution provisioned by a service provider. As another example, several of the components of the platform  may be integrated within a set-top box  for communication with various other components of the platform. In certain embodiments, a control module  regulates the execution and interaction of the various components of the platform  accordingly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3D","FIG. 1"]},"In step  of process , the simulation platform  stores, in association with a set-top box, a plurality of control data signals associated with a head-end system. As mentioned, the control data signals may include timing information, dynamic data and channel map data. In another step , the platform  determines a loss of connectivity to the head-end system , such as due to improper configuration to the set-top box, a faulty coaxial cable, etc. Per step , a head-end simulation process is invoked by the simulation platform  in response to the determination. The head-end simulation process, which is activated based on the presence of the control signal data, facilitates operation of the set-top box, execution of a feature of the set-top box, or a combination thereof.","In step  of process  (), the platform  receives an input signal for executing a feature of the set-top box. Features may include the selecting of a channel, the launching of a programming guide, the activating of video-on-demand, the activating of a widget, the playing of a video game, etc. In certain embodiments, the input signal may be provided by way of a remote control device, manual input and data entry, or a playback application . In another step , the platform  associates the input signal with stored content associated with the set-top box based on one or more of the control data signals. Per step , playback of the stored content and\/or execution of the feature of the set-top box is initiated by the platform  based on the association.","In step  of process  (), the platform  determines a match between a current time, the timing information and\/or the channel map data. In another step , the platform  determines a relationship between a feature as requested for execution, the dynamic data and\/or the input signal. With regard to steps  and , by way of example, consider a scenario wherein a user wishes to view a cooking show whose corresponding time slot on the channel map is 2 PM to 3 PM. The user may initiate the process of retrieving the appropriate content data pertaining to the show by activating a feature of the set-top box  for selecting the appropriate channel. The simulation platform  also notes the current active time of request for the channel as 2:34 PM. Using the timing information and current time data as a reference, the platform  is able to retrieve only the content data that relates to the show in question and that corresponds to the elapsed period of time since the show was scheduled to begin (e.g., from 2:34 PM to 3:00 PM). This execution corresponds to step , wherein the platform  selects stored content for playback based on the match and\/or the relationship.","In another step  of process  (), the platform  receives a request over a network  and\/or network  for access to the set-top box  from a device associated with a user of the set-top box . This corresponds to on-the-go execution of the features of the set-top box , as initiated by a playback application  operable by the device. As mentioned previously, the platform  may execute an authentication process for ensuring proper accessibility of the device to the set-top box  or features thereof. The playback application , in certain embodiments, presents an interface for depicting a display to the features of the set-top box . This may include, for example, a television display, channel selection buttons, volume buttons, menu selection buttons and other features corresponding to operation of the set-top box . It is noted that the device running the playback application  need not be within physical proximity of the set-top box , nor does the set-top box need to be presently configured to the head-end , to support execution of content and set-top box features.","The above processes and associated arrangement, in certain embodiments, advantageously permits viewers to continue experiencing a program, even though connectivity to the head-end system  may be lost. By contrast, traditional systems do not provide any such capability, resulting in disruption of service. Such disruption can negatively impact viewership (which, beyond mere inconvenience to the viewers, can result in diminished effectiveness of advertisements for the broadcast systems ). Further, the service provider, which is responsible for service and maintaining the set-top boxes, may lose subscribers, and thus, revenue.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIGS. 4-6","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","103","125","403","401","103","101","111"]},"The content data may include broadcasted, televised, pre-recorded, live, streaming media or other content data as provided by way of a media service provider . In addition, the content data includes interactive content \u2014i.e., content embedded within or associated with the televised, broadcasted or otherwise presented content data for invoking additional actions and features with respect to the content \/. The simulation platform  enables the set-top box  to gain access to the stored content data for supporting execution of content. Hence, content data  is presented along with various widgets, including a menu or control panel widget  and a time widget . The menu or control panel widget , when activated by user touch, remote control, or other input means invokes presentment of a menu or control panel that features various control functions of the set-top box  relative to the content . The time widget , which is positioned atop content , presents the current time. As mentioned, execution of the widgets may be supported by way of the dynamic data as stored in the control signal database , and thus made available to the set-top box .","In , a display  of a user device  operating a playback application for remotely accessing the features of a set-top box is shown. The playback application  supports on-the-go execution of the features of a set-top box  as facilitated by way of a request process handled by the simulation platform. Fulfillment of the request permits the user device  to access the set-top box, or at least execute the features of the set-top box and playback content data. By way of example, the content data  is divided into various frames of content, including a football scoreboard (section ), a current game being played between opposing teams (section ), a section for specifying the current channel and title of the broadcasted content data , etc. It is noted the content as presented in this example, featuring the various sections or frames of content, may be invoked for presentment by activation of the menu or control panel widget . Furthermore, it is noted that the playback application  enables the same essential capabilities of the set-top box to be performed regardless of the proximity of the device  to the set-top box or the connectivity of the set-top box  to the head-end system .","In , a television guide widget  is presented as content to the touchable display  of a laptop device . As before, the laptop  is authorized to engage with the STB for on-the-go execution of its functions and features by way of a playback application . Thus, as the laptop  is not itself configured as a set-top box  to the head-end system , the simulation platform  enables remote simulation modes to be invoked. In this manner, the user may provide various inputs at the touchable display  of the laptop device  for interacting with the widget , including permitting entry of search criteria to a show finder widget . Search capability is made possible by comparing a text string entered into a text entry field  to the stored programming and content data maintained in association with the set-top box, i.e., by the simulation platform . In addition, current time data, such as presented by way of a digital clock widget  may be used as reference data for matching or comparing against time slot information maintained per the channel map data. By way of this comparison or matching process, only the most relevant stored content data per the widget  is presented to the user. Still further, input provided to the simulation platform  based on the selection of a particular program or channel by the user, may be used as criteria for retrieving the appropriate content data ","As mentioned previously, the extent to which playback of content data is possible depends on the last recorded time of accessing of the head-end control signals. Hence, in certain embodiments, the simulation platform  can limit the playback of content to that occurring before the timestamp (timing information), such as in instances where the fetching of content ahead of the timestamp is not possible. The extent to which content may be retrieved and subsequently stored during the time of set-top box to head-end connectivity may vary from one user to another depending on subscription details and other factors. In addition, the buffer capacity of the platform  as it operates in connection with a set-top box for caching of content data may also affect the amount of programming capable of being stored. A message may be presented to the display in cases where no content is able to be played back in instances where content is not available for a selected time frame or channel. Alternatively, the user may be presented with the option of executing a different program (content data) or channel at that time as stored in the content database .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 2"],"b":["700","119","121","105","107","727"]},"According to various embodiments, device  may also include inputs\/outputs (e.g., connectors ) to a display  and DVR , as well as to audio system . In particular, audio system  may comprise a conventional audio-video receiver capable of monaural or stereo sound, as well as multichannel surround sound. Audio system  may include speakers, ear buds, headphones, or any other suitable component configured for personal or public dissemination. As such, set-top box , display , DVR , and audio system , for example, may support high resolution audio and\/or video streams, such as high definition television (HDTV) or digital theater systems high definition (DTS-HD) audio. Thus, set-top box  may be configured to encapsulate data into a proper format with required credentials before transmitting onto one or more of the networks of  and de-encapsulate incoming traffic to dispatch data to display  and\/or audio system . In addition, the set-top box may permit the embedding or overlay of dynamic content data in connection with television or broadcast content data.","In an exemplary embodiment, display  and\/or audio system  may be configured with internet protocol (IP) capability (i.e., includes an IP stack, or is otherwise network addressable), such that the functions of set-top box  may be assumed by display  and\/or audio system . In this manner, an IP ready, HDTV display or DTS-HD audio system may be directly connected to one or more service provider networks  and\/or communication networks . Although set-top box , display , DVR , and audio system  are shown separately, it is contemplated that these components may be integrated into a single component, or other combination of components. Pursuant to this integration, the simulation platform  may also be integrated within the set-top box  or accessed by it to enable control of the display , DVR , and audio system  relative to the head-end simulation process.","An authentication module  may be provided by set-top box  to initiate or respond to authentication schemes of, for instance, service provider network , third-party content provider systems , or various other content providers, e.g., television broadcast systems , etc. Authentication module  may provide sufficient authentication information, e.g., a user name and password, a key access number, a unique machine identifier (e.g., MAC address), and the like, as well as combinations thereof, to a corresponding communications (or network) interface  for establishing connectivity, via LAN , and to seamless viewing platform . Authentication at set-top box  may identify and authenticate a second device (e.g., computing device ) communicatively coupled to, or associated with the set-top box , or vice versa. Further, authentication information may be stored locally at memory , in a repository (not shown) connected to set-top box , or at a remote repository (e.g., user profile repository ) as maintained by the simulation platform . As noted previously, on-the-go access to the features of the set-top-box  is facilitated by the communication interface  and authentication module  as it engages the playback application .","Authentication module  may also facilitate the reception of data from single or disparate sources. For instance, set-top box  may receive broadcast video from a first source (e.g., MSP ), signals from a media application at second source (e.g., computing device ), and a content data stream from a third source accessible over communication networks  (e.g., third-party content provider system ). As such, display  may present the broadcast video, media application, and content data stream to the user, wherein set-top box  (in conjunction with one or more media applications) can permit users to experience various sources of content data traditionally limited to the data domains. This presentation may be experienced separately, concurrently, in a toggled fashion, or with zooming, maximizing, minimizing, or trick capabilities, or equivalent mode. Such capability may be performed even in the absence of head-end connectivity by way of the simulation platform, i.e., given the availability of stored control signal data and content data. In other exemplary embodiments, authentication module  can authenticate a user to allow them to interact with one or more third-party subscriber account features associated with third-party content provider systems .","Presentation module  may be configured to receive content data streams (e.g., audio\/video feed(s) including content data retrieved over a data network) and output a result via one or more connectors  to display  and\/or audio system . In this manner, presentation module  may also provide a user interface for a media application via display . Aural aspects of media applications may be presented via audio system  and\/or display . In certain embodiments, media applications, such as media manager , may be overlaid on the video content output  of display  via presentation module . The content data streams may include content received in response to user input specifying content that is accessible by way of one or more third party content provider systems  and, thereby, available over at least one data network (e.g., network  and\/or ), wherein the content data may be retrieved and streamed by set-top box  for presentation via display  and\/or audio system . Accordingly, presentation module  may be configured to provide lists of search results and\/or identifiers to users for selection of content data to be experienced. Exemplary search results and\/or identifiers may include graphical elements, channels, aural notices, or any other signifier, such as a uniform resource locator (URL), phone number, serial number, registration number, MAC address, code, etc. The above described search capability, selective streaming of content and other features are simulated by the platform  as connectivity to the head-end system is lost.","Connector(s)  may provide various physical interfaces to display , audio system , as well as other peripherals such as the head-end system. The physical interfaces may include, for example, RJ45, RJ11, high definition multimedia interface (HDMI), optical, coax, FireWire, wireless, and universal serial bus (USB), or any other suitable connector. The simulation platform  may be configured to employ signal detection techniques relative to the connectors  for determining the connectivity of the set-top box  to a head-end system.","The presentation module  may also interact with a control device  for determining particular content data that a user desires to experience. In an exemplary embodiment, control device  may comprise a remote control (or other access device having control capability (e.g., computing device ), a wireless user device, mobile phone, etc.) that provides users with the ability to readily manipulate and dynamically modify parameters affecting the content data being viewed. In other examples, set-top box  may be configured for voice recognition such that set-top box  may be controlled with spoken utterances. All of these capabilities may be facilitated as well by way of a playback application  having the appropriate instructions and application interfaces for controlling the set-top box .","In this manner, control device  may include (not shown) a cursor controller, trackball, touch screen, touch pad, keyboard, and\/or a key pad for activating a media application, navigating through broadcast channels, search results, and\/or content data identifiers, as well as performing other control functions. For instance, control device  may be utilized to maximize a media application, navigate through displayable interfaces, locate\/specify\/retrieve content data, modify set-top box  parameters, or toggle through broadcast channels and\/or content data identifiers. Control device  may also include functional actuators (e.g., buttons, keys, icons, etc.), such as power on\/of, play, pause, stop, fast-forward, reverse, volume up\/down, channel up\/down, menu, ok\/enter, record, info, my content, search, edit, or exit, as well as any other suitable control trigger, such as alphanumeric buttons, shift, control, back, symbols, and the like. These functions may be further integrated for use within the media application associated with the playback application .","Input interface  may support any type of wired and\/or wireless link, e.g., infrared, radio frequency (RF), BLUETOOTH, and the like. Thus, control device  may store user preferences with respect to content data, such as favorite sources, etc. Alternatively, user preferences may be tracked, recorded, or stored at set-top box  or at a network user profile repository . The preferences may be automatically retrieved and activated by a user at any time. It is noted that control device  may be separate from set-top box  or may be integrated within set-top box , in which case certain input interface hardware and\/or software may be superfluous.","Particular embodiments enable users, via control device , to populate or otherwise configure a user profile. For instance, a user profile application may be provided or accessed by set-top box  to enable users to populate various entry fields with user information. A user profile may include one or more customized or personalized settings that affect any aspect of content data accessible via set-top box . More specifically, the profile may include: information relating to the simulation feature of the set-top box, subscription information (account number, user name, password, avatar, moniker, etc.), subscriber demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, location of residence, zip code, school district, community, socioeconomic status, religion, marital status, ownerships, languages, mobility, life cycles, etc.), group\/organizational affiliations (e.g., political), memberships, interests, buddies, friends, cohorts, system configurations, policies, associated users\/devices, etc., as well as any other like personal information. Additionally, a user profile may include a \u201cwhitelist\u201d specifying one or more accessible content data sources\/subjects, a \u201cblacklist\u201d specifying one or more content data sources\/subjects, as well as other equivalent customized settings, such as color schemes, sound effects, etc.","In other embodiments, the user profile may be established using the additional access devices described earlier (e.g., computing device , etc.) or via the simulation platform . As such, user profile information may be stored at set-top box , e.g., at memory , and\/or at the simulation platform . Additionally or alternatively, profile information may be stored in a network-based repository (e.g., remote user profile repository), control device , and\/or any other storage medium. Similarly, set-top box  may store a collection of digital audio, video and\/or image content accumulated by a user\u2014i.e., by way of dynamic content data. This collection may also include identifiers, links, search results, or bookmarks to content data accessible by way of the content data as stored.","It is noted, in the foregoing discussion of , that references to the set-top box accessing the various service providers (e.g., MSP ) via the network pertains to instances of determined connectivity to the head-end system. When such connectivity is lost or not available, however, the same executions are simulated by virtue of the stored control signal data and content data maintained by the simulation platform . The exemplary techniques and system presented herein enable normal operation of a set-top box as described regardless of the state of connectivity of the set-top box to a head-end system.","The processes described herein for simulating a connection to a head-end system to enable execution of content and features of a set-top box may be implemented via software, hardware (e.g., general processor, Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chip, an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc.), firmware or a combination thereof. Such exemplary hardware for performing the described functions is detailed below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","801","803","801","800","805","801","803","805","803","800","807","801","803","809","801"]},"The computer system  may be coupled via the bus  to a display , such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display, active matrix display, or plasma display, for displaying information to a computer user. An input device , such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to the bus  for communicating information and command selections to the processor . Another type of user input device is a cursor control , such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys, for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor  and for adjusting cursor movement on the display .","According to an embodiment of the invention, the processes described herein are performed by the computer system , in response to the processor  executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions can be read into main memory  from another computer-readable medium, such as the storage device . Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory  causes the processor  to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory . In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the embodiment of the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.","The computer system  also includes a communication interface  coupled to bus . The communication interface  provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link  connected to a local network . For example, the communication interface  may be a digital subscriber line (DSL) card or modem, an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card, a cable modem, a telephone modem, or any other communication interface to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of communication line. As another example, communication interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card (e.g. for Ethernet\u2122 or an Asynchronous Transfer Model (ATM) network) to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links can also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface  sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information. Further, the communication interface  can include peripheral interface devices, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface, a PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) interface, etc.","The network link  typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, the network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer , which has connectivity to a network  (e.g. a wide area network (WAN) or the global packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d) or to data equipment operated by a service provider. The local network  and the network  both use electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals to convey information and instructions. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link  and through the communication interface , which communicate digital data with the computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves bearing the information and instructions.","The computer system  can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), the network link , and the communication interface . In the Internet example, a server (not shown) might transmit requested code belonging to an application program for implementing an embodiment of the invention through the network , the local network  and the communication interface . The processor  may execute the transmitted code while being received and\/or store the code in the storage device , or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, the computer system  may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to computer-readable storage medium ((or non-transitory)\u2014i.e., non-volatile media and volatile media), and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as the storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory, such as main memory . Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic, optical, or electromagnetic waves, such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, CDRW, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, optical mark sheets, any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example, the instructions for carrying out at least part of the embodiments of the invention may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario, the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory, from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"],"b":["900","900","900","900","900"]},"In one embodiment, the chip set or chip  includes a communication mechanism such as a bus  for passing information among the components of the chip set .
