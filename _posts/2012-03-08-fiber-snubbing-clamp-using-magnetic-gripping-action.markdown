title: Fiber snubbing clamp using magnetic gripping action
abstract: A device, assembly and method for clamping single fibers that utilizes snubbing surfaces simultaneously with magnetic gripping action are described. The device can be fabricated at miniature sizes with very low mass and volume, which are desirable requirements for testing of small fibers in highly sensitive force-transducing load frames. Advantageously, the combined use of snubbing surfaces and magnetic gripping greatly reduces the probability of slippage or fiber failure at the grip during testing.

Single fiber testing can be used to isolate trends and modes of failure for materials, such as for fundamental materials investigations or product-line quality control testing. During development of new fiber materials, the new fibers are often available in very small quantities due to complex processing or exotic materials. In these cases, multi-filament yarn-level testing is not practical. Instead, it is desired to generate mechanical properties of individual filaments.","Developments in capacitive load cells, electromagnetic load cells, and stepper motor technology have led to the commercialization of compact load frames with extremely sensitive force (for example, nanoNewton (nN) sensitivity) and displacement (for example, nanometer (nm) sensitivity) measurement capabilities. These miniature load frames are ideally suited for testing single fibers.","Standard testing procedures for single fibers call for directly gripping single fibers in clamping action grips, or gluing the fibers onto cardboard tabs that are then gripped in clamping action grips. The first technique, direct clamping, concentrates stresses at the grip point and often leads to failure at the fiber grips. Grip failure is undesirable during fiber characterization, and these results are generally not accurate, and, thus, are not reportable. The second technique, bonding fibers onto cardboard tabs, relies on strong bonding between the fiber and a dollop of adhesive. For fibers that are difficult to bond to, such as aramid, polyethylene, or ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene, it is common to observe fiber slippage from the adhesive. These results are also not accurate and, thus, are not reportable, and generally prevent loading the fiber to failure. In addition, the time and complication associated with utilizing curable adhesives adds considerable inconvenience, especially considering that many test repetitions are required to establish statistically significant data. Accordingly, there is a need for a method, a device and\/or an assembly for clamping or otherwise securing a fiber in a tensile testing device.","For testing yarns, it is common to use capstan grips (also called roller grips) or contour\/horn grips (also called half-capstan grips). In these designs, from the primary loading gage section of the yarn the yarn is passed over a series of \u201csnubbing\u201d surfaces which gradually reduce the tensile load on the yarn due to frictional interactions of the yarn with the snubbing surfaces. The snubbing surfaces are curved gently to induce normal forces on the yarn without creating stress concentrations that can fail the yarn. After passing over these snubbing surfaces, the yarn is gripped mechanically, typically using mechanical or pneumatic clamping action. Because the tensile loading on the yarn has been gradually reduced, the total stress on the yarn at the grip point is significantly less likely to lead to failure at the grip.","The present invention improves upon previous single fiber techniques by providing a single fiber clamping device that can reliably grip single fibers and decrease slippage and\/or failure at the grips. In addition, no adhesive is required, so that gripping is fast and uncomplicated. Furthermore, the device uses magnetic clamping action to grip the fibers, so that the total mass and volume of the clamping device are minimized. Maintaining low clamping device mass is desirable for operation in sensitive load frames, since the total load limits (including clamp weight) are typically very low for these miniature load frames (for example, 1 N maximum force capacity). For these applications, traditional clamping approaches such as mechanical action or pneumatics are undesirable because they are either impractical or cumbersome to implement.","The present invention is a single fiber clamping device that utilizes capstan style snubbing surfaces to gradually reduce fiber tension as it approaches the clamping point, similar to the capstan-style grips used for testing of yarns. Magnetic forces are used to provide the clamping action on the fiber after the snubbing surfaces. The geometry of the device can be optimized for compactness, low mass, and manufacturability.","In addition, a method for determining a mechanical property of a fiber or a yarn or other group of fibers is provided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1"],"b":["14","14","10"]},"An assembly of the present invention includes two devices, for example an upper specimen holder and a lower specimen holder, where each device includes a base . A feature of base  is a toroidally contoured hole . Hole  may be machined into base component . Desirably, base  is composed of or otherwise includes a magnetizable alloy, for example an alloy or metal that will attract a magnet such as free-machining steel. The base may include only a surface portion that includes or is composed of a magnetizable alloy so that at least a portion of a surface of base  can be used to attract a magnet. A fore edge  of the base  device  is desirably machined to a rounded, semi-cylindrical contour. To grip a fiber , a fiber from the gage direction of a testing system is passed over a portion of first face  of base  through the hole . The fiber  is then passed over a second face \u2032 of base  and routed back towards the gage direction. A smooth, low mass clamping magnet , such as a polished rare earth permanent magnet, is then placed on top of the fiber . In certain embodiments the magnet can be an electromagnet or a non-metallic ceramic magnet. The magnetic attraction of the clamping magnet  to a surface of the base component  provides clamping action. A threaded rod (not illustrated) is mounted to the aft edge  of the base component via a threaded hole . The threaded rod can then be mated to the load frame using standard mechanical hardware.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIGS. 2A and 2B"],"b":["20","2","6","2","1","3","1","3","9","2","1","2","1","3","9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIGS. 1 and 3"],"b":["3","20","2","4","20","3","3","9","1","9","8","9","3","4"],"i":"a"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["4","10","2","4","10","3","3","9","1","9","8","9","3","2","2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIGS. 3A and 3B"],"b":["5","20","3","4","3","1","3","9","1","2","1","9","8","9","1","9","3","9","4"]},"Further embodiments of this design, assembly and\/or method can be easily envisioned including, but not limited to, embodiments utilizing longer or more complex routing paths.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["6","6","6","3","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B"],"b":["17","3","5","3"]},"It may be desirable to polish the snubbing surfaces of the base component, as well as the faces of the magnet, to eliminate sharp edges or other stress concentrations that may prematurely lead to fiber failure.
