title: System and method for acquisition management of subject position information
abstract: A system and method for acquisition management of subject position information that utilizes radio frequency identification (RF ID) to store position information in position tags. Tag programmers receive position information from external positioning systems, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), from manual inputs, such as keypads, or other tag programmers. The tag programmers program each position tag with the received position information. Both the tag programmers and the position tags can be portable or fixed. Implementations include portable tag programmers and fixed position tags for subject position guidance, and portable tag programmers for collection sample labeling. Other implementations include fixed tag programmers and portable position tags for subject route recordation. Position tags can contain other associated information such as destination address of an affixed subject for subject routing.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under Contract DE-AC0676RLO1830 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates generally to systems and methods associated with subject position information and more particularly to acquisition management of subject position information.","2. Description of the Related Art","Systems and methods for acquisition management of subject position information conventionally have wide application in daily commerce. These conventional systems include recordation of prior positions occupied, identification of present position, and guidance regarding future positions of a subject. Implementation details vary according to the particular conventional system.","Technology of the conventional systems can include optical, magnetic, or visual scanning of a subject, a subject's printed address, or a track of a subject's intended path. These approaches generally require close proximity, predetermined orientation, and high visibility of the subject to the system, inflexible plans for subject position guidance, manual intervention with recordation, identification, and guidance, and other performance reducing requirements. Conventional integration of the recordation, identification, and guidance functions can also include requirements, that may increase weight, size, and cost of the systems involved.","Other conventional systems use external reference systems, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) managed by the United States Department of Defense, to provide position reference data. Unfortunately, these external reference systems are not always as useful as hoped due, in part, to problems related to signal interference, such as found inside buildings and geological structures, and less than sufficient resolution of subject position provided by the external reference system.","The disclosed embodiments of the invention are directed to acquisition management of subject position information. In one embodiment, a position tag is provided having a memory configured to store position information, at least one radio frequency antenna, and a receiver circuit coupled to the at least one radio frequency antenna. The receiver is configured to receive control signals and position request signals via the at least one radio frequency antenna, and to send signals containing position information via the at least one radio frequency antenna responsive to the position request signals. The memory is configured to store position information in response to the control signals and to recall position information in response to the position request signals.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a position tag programmer is provided having at least one radio frequency antenna, a receiver configured to receive position information radio signals from an external position reference system via the at least one radio frequency antenna, and a tag program transmitter coupled to the receiver. The tag programmer transmitter is configured to transmit position information control signals via the at least one radio frequency antenna to a position tag for storage in the position tag of the position information received from the external position reference system.","In accordance with yet another embodiment of the invention, a position tag reader is provided having at least one radio frequency antenna, a transmitter coupled to the at least one radio frequency antenna and configured to transmit a position information request signal to a position tag via the at least one radio frequency antenna, and a receiver coupled to the at least one radio frequency antenna. The receiver is configured to receive a signal containing position information from the position tag requested through the position information request signal sent by the transmitter to the position tag.","In accordance with one of the method embodiments of the present invention, a method of programming a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag is provided including receiving position information from an external positioning system, and sending control instructions and the position information via radio signals to the RFID tag to store the position information in the RFID tag.","Implementations of a system and method for acquisition management of subject position information are described herein. The position acquisition management system uniquely applies radio frequency technology to challenges involved with recordation of prior positions occupied, identification of present position, and guidance regarding future positions of a subject. Radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, whose general use is known in the art, are uniquely used to store and retrieve position information of designated subjects at given moments of subject travel.","Some implementations will program position tags with predetermined architectural, geological, geographical, or other position information to be later used as position references to assist in guiding travel of users, robots, vehicles, or other subjects. Other implementations use position tags configured to store multiple position identifications to record information regarding routes taken by given subjects. In certain implementations, addressed position tags are attached to subjects to indicate destination information for delivery of the subjects. These addressed position tags can contain other information such as identification of the origination, sender, and receiver of the subjects. Implementations can use portable programmers to program position tags with position information including that obtained from external positioning systems such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) managed by the Department of Defense. Stationary programmers can be used to program position tags, such as with route recordation, as the position tags pass pre-designated positions.","As shown in , a basic RFID system  includes two components: an interrogator or reader , and a transponder (commonly called an RF tag) . The interrogator  and RF tag  include respective antennas , . In operation, the interrogator  transmits by a transmitter component (not shown) through its antenna  a radio frequency interrogation signal  to the antenna  of the RF tag . In response to receiving the interrogation signal , the RF tag  produces a modulated response signal  that is transmitted back to the interrogator  through the tag antenna  by a process known as continuous wave backscatter and is received by a receiver component (not shown) of the interrogator .","The substantial advantage of RFID systems is the non-contact, non-line-of-sight capability of the technology. The interrogator  emits the interrogation signal  with a range from one inch to one hundred feet or more, depending upon its power output and the radio frequency used. Tags can be read through a variety of substances such as dispersions, fog, ice, paint, dirt, and other visually and environmentally challenging conditions where bar codes or other optically-read technologies would be useless. RF tags can also be read at high speeds, in most cases responding in less than one hundred milliseconds.","RF tags are divided into three main categories: Beam-powered passive tags, battery-powered semi-passive tags, and active tags. Each operates in different ways.","The beam-powered RFID tag is often referred to as a passive device because it derives the energy needed for its operation from the interrogation signal beamed at it. The tag rectifies the field and changes the reflective characteristics of the tag itself, creating a change in reflectivity that is seen at the interrogator. The battery-powered semi-passive RFID tag operates in a similar fashion, modulating its RF cross-section in order to reflect a delta to the interrogator to develop a communication link. Here, the battery is the source of the tag's operational power for optional circuitry. Finally, in the active RF tag, a transmitter is used to create its own radio frequency energy powered by the battery.","The range of communication for such tags varies according to the transmission power of the interrogator  and the RF tag . Battery-powered tags operating at 2,450 MHz have traditionally been limited to less than ten meters in range. However, devices with sufficient power can reach up to 200 meters in range, depending on the frequency and environmental characteristics.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the response signal  is used to send position information from a unique type of RF tag known herein as a position tag . The position tag  is configured to contain information regarding one or more positions, which can be programmed into and retrieved from the position tag through use of RF signals. The position information could be stored in a memory of the position tag . Alternatively, a pointer in the position tag  could point to a position-related reference. With some implementations, the position tag  contains additional information, also referred to herein as position information. Position information for the position tag  could also include information associated with a position, such as, time of day that a position was achieved, and characteristics of the tagged subject, such as type (vehicle, robot, individual, etc.), owner identification, origination, destination, intended recipient, associated cost, product constituents, warranty information, associated purchaser, location of sale, seller identification, recycling information, instructor identification, associated warnings, storage information, and destruction instructions.","As shown in , the position tag  includes a position tag antenna  to receive position information request signals , to receive position information programming control signals , and to send requested position information . Multiple antennas can be used in some implementations as the tag antenna . A receiver  is communicatively linked to the position tag antenna  and a control circuit  to process the position information request signals , to respond with the requested position information  retrieved from a memory , and to process the position information programming control signals  to store position information into the memory . The receiver  is configured to enable the position tag  to return the requested position information  as a radio signal shown in FIG. . Some implementations include the functions of the control circuit  either being performed by the receiver , the memory , or both.","In some implementations, a portable programmer  is used to program position information into the position tags . Some implementations of the portable programmer  include programming one position (1P) position tags  having the memory  sufficiently sized to contain information regarding one position (1P) such as shown in FIG. . The portable programmer  includes a tag program transmitter  that is coupled to a transmitting antenna  to transmit the position information programming control signals  to the position tags .","Position information to be programmed into one of the position tags  is inputted to the portable programmer  and stored, such as in the tag programmer . In one embodiment, broadcast position information  is received by the portable programmer from an external positioning system (EPS)  through a receiving antenna  and an EPS receiver . The Global Positioning System (GPS) managed by the Department of Defense, with its satellite-based broadcast of position information, is one example of the external positioning system . Other examples of the external positioning system  include systems broadcasting other position information such as time and position coordinate information associated with one or more architectural structures, geographical points of interest, or geological structures. Alternatively, a local input , such as a keypad or other input device, could be used to manually input position information into the portable programmer . Although the portable programmer  is shown in  to include both the EPS receiver  and the local input , some implementations of the portable programmer only have one way of inputting position information into the portable programmer. Other implementations of the portable programmer  can include use of a single antenna or multiple antennas that are functionally equivalent to the combined functions of the transmitting antenna  and the receiving antenna . Some implementations of the portable programmer  also include a control  that coordinates input of position information into, and transmission of position information from, the portable programmer.","In some implementations, such as shown in , a stationary programmer  is used to program position information into the position tags . Some implementations of the stationary programmer  include programming multi-position (MP) position tags  having the memory  sufficiently sized to contain information regarding more than one position. The stationary programmer  includes a tag program transmitter  that is coupled to a transmitting antenna  to transmit the position information programming control signals  to the position tags .","Position information to be programmed into one of the position tags  can be inputted to the stationary programmer  via several methods, including use of the broadcast position information  received by the portable programmer  from the external positioning system (EPS) . The portable programmer  transmits a position information signal  containing the broadcast position information  to the stationary programmer . The position information signal  is received by a receiving antenna  and processed by a receiver  coupled to the receiving antenna. The receiver  could also be configured similarly as the EPS receiver  of the portable programmer  to directly receive the broadcast position information , but this may increase unit cost of the stationary programmer  to possibly impact deployment of large numbers of the stationary programmer.","Alternatively, a local input , such as a keypad or other input device, could be used to manually input position information into the stationary programmer . Although the stationary programmer  is shown in  to include both the receiver  and the local input , some implementations of the stationary programmer only have one way of inputting position information into the stationary programmer. Other embodiments may have an adapter to receive a detachable input device. The stationary programmer  may include use of a single antenna or multiple antennas that are functionally equivalent to the combined functions of the transmitting antenna  and the receiving antenna . Some implementations of the stationary programmer  also include a control  that coordinates input of position information into and transmission of position information from the stationary programmer.","An exemplary use of the portable programmer  in conjunction with the 1P position tags  for position labeling of collection samples is shown in FIG. . In this example, the 1P position tags  are affixed to samples  found in a collection site . The portable programmer  is then used to program each of the 1P position tags  to indicate either absolute or relative position of each of the samples  with respect to their original positions at the collection site . The samples are then moved, indicated by arrow , to a sample repository  to be further studied. Additional study of the samples  can be aided by the programmed 1P position tags  since they contain either the relative or absolute original position of the samples in the collection site . For instance, it is possible that the collection site  could be either physically or virtually reconstructed through use of the position information contained within the 1P position tags  identifying repositioning of the collected samples . Examples of the collection site  include, but are not limited to, archeological sites, construction sites, excavation sites, disaster sites, battlefields, accident sites, crime scenes, arson sites, geological sites, and any other site or other collection in which the original relative or absolute position of collected samples of the collection site  is of interest.","Another exemplary use of the portable programmer  in conjunction with the 1P position tags  for position guidance of subjects such as robots, individuals, or vehicles is shown in FIG. . The 1P position tags  are positioned in an area , such as an interior area of a building. In this example, the area  also includes an obstacle . The 1P position tags  are shown in  to have a substantially regular spacing order; however, in other implementations, spacing of the 1P position tags can be of an irregular nature. The 1P position tags  can also include position information regarding particular attributes of the area  with respect to the particular positions of the 1P position tags. For instance, the 1P position tags  shown as being positioned in or near the corners of the obstacle  could contain information identifying the obstacle. Other position information could include that generally discussed above regarding additional information including information related to the position identified by one of the 1P position tags , related to a purpose for the area , and related to a purpose for the subject. For instance, if the area  was a warehouse for storing items to be later gathered and the subject was a gatherer, one or more of the 1P position tags  could contain identification information related to the type of items located near the position of the 1P position tag. Alternatively, additional information could be related to particular positions identified by the 1P position tags  through a database on board or separate from the subject.","Once the 1P position tags  are properly positioned in stationary locations in the area , the portable programmer  is used to program each of the 1P position tags with their respective positions, either absolute or relative, with respect to the area. After transitioning from an initialization phase to an operation phase, as indicated by an arrow , a subject, such as a robot , using a unique one of the interrogators  configured to request and receive position information from the 1P position tags , shown hidden in the operation phase of , is used to navigate a path . The interrogator  and the 1P tags  are so chosen and positionally oriented regarding strength of signals transmitted and received such that the subject receives position information from the 1P position tags appropriate to the position of the subject as it receives the position information. Depending upon the implementations and subject involved, the path  can be predetermined or can be determined in real time. Position guidance based upon position information obtained from the 1P position tags  could include range and bearing.","Other examples of the area  include, but are not limited to, warehouses, factory floors, jogging or hiking trails, bicycle paths, shopping malls, office parks, airports, rail stations, bus stations, tourist attractions, amusement parks, local roadways, state and interstate highways and freeways, fairs, theaters, exhibit halls, sports stadiums, museums, art galleries, farms, drilling or mining sites, construction sites, battlefields, ocean liners, cargo ships, oil tankers, airplanes, naval vessels, drilling rigs, elevators, racetracks, golf courses, bodies of water including harbors, lakes, docking areas, ship canals, railyards, airplane runways, schools, universities, libraries, hospitals, grocery stores, pharmacies, department stores, tool houses, wrecking yards, spacecraft, and any other area in which position guidance of a subject is of interest.","An exemplary use of a group of the stationary programmers  in conjunction with one of the MP position tags  affixed to a moving subject , such as a robot, an individual, or a vehicle, for route recordation of the moving subject  is shown in FIG. . Initially, each of the stationary programmers  are programmed with information regarding their positions. In implementations, the stationary programmers  are positioned along a path  to be taken by the moving subject  to allow the MP position tag  of the moving subject to receive the position information programming control signal  from each stationary programmer as the moving subject passes within the vicinity of each stationary programmer.","After completing the path , the MP position tag  of the moving subject  contains position information for each of the stationary programmers  found along the path. This position information can then be requested and received by a special interrogator  configured to transmit the position information request signals  to the MP position tag  of the moving subject  and to receive the requested position information  from the MP position tag of the moving subject. In this example, the requested position information  would include for each of the stationary programmers  a fixed position near the stationary programmer and its absolute or relative position and the relative or absolute times that the moving subject  passed by the fixed position.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["110","12","12","112","114","112","110","134","114","114","112","38","110","114","112","114","110","112","114","112","114","110","114"]},"From the foregoing it will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention.
