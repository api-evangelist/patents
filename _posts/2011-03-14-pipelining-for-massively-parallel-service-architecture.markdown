title: Pipelining for massively parallel service architecture
abstract: Various systems and methods are described that may allow a server to control various other servers performing services on media assets, such as a video file, which may need to be encoded then copied to a plurality of servers. A first server may be aware of what service needs to be performed on a media asset next. The first server may then notify a second server that this service is to be performed. Once the service has been performed on the media asset, the first server may be notified that the service has been completed. The first server may then determine which, if any, other service needs to be performed on the media asset. The first server may determine and instruct other servers on what services to perform for large numbers of other media assets while the media asset is having a service processed using it.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This disclosure is related in general to cloud-based processing, and, but not by way of limitation, to parallel processing of multiple services by multiple computing devices.","In some computer systems, processing may be linear. In such systems, before a second process begins, the entirety of a first process may need to be completed. Take for example the transcoding and transfer of large media files. If a computer system is transcoding (e.g., converting media files from one format to another) and transferring a number of large media files, the process may involve several steps, such as: 1) transcode the first file; 2) transfer the first file; 3) transcode the second file; and 4) transfer the second file. This process may continue for every how many files need to be transcoded and transferred. Further, a step may not be performed until the previous step has finished in its entirety. In this example, the transcoding of the second file may not begin until the first file has been completely transferred.","Such a process may result in significant inefficiencies. For example, if it takes a significant amount of time to transfer the first file (perhaps due to the size of the file, network congestion, or some other factor), processing resources may sit idle and the amount of time to complete the process of transcoding and transferring may be high.","In some embodiments, a content processing system for performing processing of multiple services using a media asset is present. The content processing system may include a first server system. The first server system may be configured to receive a notification from a second server system, wherein the notification is linked to the media asset, determine a second service to be processed using the media asset, wherein: the second service is at least partially determined by the first server system using a workflow script and a task; and the workflow script comprises a plurality of tasks; the task is part of the plurality of tasks; each task of the plurality of tasks identifies one or more services to be processed using media assets; the task of the plurality of tasks of the workflow script indicates that the second service is to be processed using the media asset; determine a third server system to process the second service, and notify the third server system to process the second service, wherein: the notification indicates that the second server system has processed a first service using the media asset. The content processing system may include the second server system, which is configured to: perform the first service, and send the notification to the first server system that indicates when the first service using the media asset is complete. The content processing system may also include a third server system configured to process a second service using the media asset and notify the first server system when the second service has been processed.","In some embodiments, the first service is a transcoding service that converts the media asset from a first format to a second format. In some embodiments, the second service is a file replication service that transfers a copy of the media asset to a fourth server system. In some embodiments, the fourth server system is a content delivery network. In some embodiments, the first server system, second server system, and third server system are three physically distinct server systems. In some embodiments, the second server is configured to process only the first service; the third server is configured to process only the second service; and the first service and the second service are different services. In some embodiments, the first server is configured to perform additional determinations and notifications linked to other media assets while the third server is processing the second service using the media asset. In some embodiments, the third server system is comprised of multiple servers and a master server, the third server system is further configured to: receive, by the master server, the notification from the first server; receive, by the master server, statuses from at least some of the multiple servers; and determine, by the master server, at least partially based on the statuses received from at least some of the multiple servers, which of the multiple servers will process the second service using the media asset. In some embodiments, each of the multiple servers of the third server system has a queue configured to determine an order of media assets on which to perform the second service.","In some embodiments, a method for processing multiple services using a media asset is described. The method may include receiving, at a first server, a notification, wherein: the notification indicates that a first service processed using the media asset has been completed by a second server, and the performance of the first service results in a processed media asset being created. The method may include determining, by the first server, a second service to be processed using the processed media asset, wherein: the second service is at least partially determined by the first server using a workflow script and a task; and the workflow script comprises a plurality of tasks; each of the plurality of tasks identifies one or more services to be processed using media assets; the task, of the plurality of tasks, indicates that the second service is to be processed using the processed media asset. The method may include transmitting, by the first server, a notification to a third server responsible for processing the third service using the processed media asset, wherein the notification indicates that the second service is to be processed using the processed media asset. The method may further include receiving, by the third server, the notification transmitted by the first server. The method may include receiving, by the third server, a plurality of status updates from a plurality of servers that process the second service. The method may include selecting, by the third server, at least partially based on the plurality of status updates, a fourth server from the plurality of servers to process the second service using the processed media asset. Also, the method may include notifying, by the third server, the fourth server to process the second service using the processed media asset.","In some embodiments, a system for multi-server processing may be present. The system may include a kernel server system that is configured to: receive a first notification linked to a media asset from an ingest server system, determine a file replication service needs to be processed using the media asset, and notify, using a second notification, a file replication master server to have the file replication service processed using the media asset, wherein the first notification received by the kernel server system indicates that the ingest server system has received the media asset from a client. The system may include the ingest server, which is configured to: receive the media asset from the client, and send the notification to the kernel server system after receiving the media asset from the client. The system may include the file replication master server, wherein the file replication server is configured to receive the second notification from the kernel server system and determine at least one of a plurality of file replication servers to process the file replication service using the media asset.","In the appended figures, similar components and\/or features may have the same reference label. Further, various components of the same type may be distinguished by following the reference label by a dash and a second label that distinguishes among the similar components. If only the first reference label is used in the specification, the description is applicable to any one of the similar components having the same first reference label irrespective of the second reference label.","The ensuing description provides preferred exemplary embodiment(s) only, and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability or configuration of the disclosure. Rather, the ensuing description of the preferred exemplary embodiment(s) will provide those skilled in the art with an enabling description for implementing a preferred exemplary embodiment. It is understood that various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the spirit and scope as set forth in the appended claims.","In a computing arrangement, rather than waiting for a first process to complete before starting a second process, it may be more efficient to allow various processes to be performed in parallel by multiple computing devices, such as servers, possibly located in different physical locations. Such an arrangement may involve a central computer coordinating various services to be performed by other computing devices. The central computer, possibly referred to as a kernel server, may not be aware of how to perform various processes or even an entire workflow of processes that needs to be performed on a particular piece of data. Rather, the kernel server may only be aware of what service needs to be performed next and\/or in what order future services should be performed on the data. The kernel server may then inform an appropriate server that a particular service needs to be processed using the data, which may be some form of a media file. Once the appropriate server has been notified as such, this server may process the service or assign another server to process the service. While the service is being processed, the kernel server may not need to process anything related to this service or data. Rather, the kernel server may direct other servers to perform the same or different services on the same or different pieces of data files.","Once the service has been processed using the data, the kernel server may be notified that the service has been completed. The kernel server may then determine another service, if any, that is to be processed using the data file. The kernel server may then inform the same or a different server to process this next service using the data (which may have been modified by the first service). Such a process may continue until all services necessary to be processed using the data have been completed.","While a kernel server may inform one or several servers to process various services using pieces of data, in some embodiments, vast numbers of pieces of data or data files may have services processed using them by a large number of geographically dispersed servers. Hence, such a system may be referred to as a pipelining system for massively parallel service. In some embodiments, a piece of data or data file may be a media asset, alternatively referred to as a media asset. This media asset may be a video and\/or audio file. Further, this video or audio file may be large, possibly several megabytes or gigabytes in size. A media asset may be linked to a data object stored at another location. Such a data object may contain data linked to the media asset, such as a title, owner name, a universal resource locator linked to the media asset, and\/or other data related to the media asset. Two possible services that may be processed using a media file may be transcoding, which may be the conversion of a media asset from one format to another, and transferring (which may be the making or copying of a media asset from one location to another).","For example, once an end user has uploaded a media asset, the kernel server may determine (or be notified) that the media asset needs to be transcoded into six different formats and transferred to fifteen servers scattered throughout the world. The kernel server may determine that the first service to be processed is transcoding the media asset. The kernel server may then notify another server, such as a master transcoding server, to process the transcoding. This may end the kernel server's involvement in the transcoding of the media asset. The kernel server may continue to process other tasks, such as determining how other media assets should be processed. The master transcoding server may then, in turn, notify one or more transcoding servers to transcode the media asset into the six different formats. The master transcoding server may assign one transcoding server to complete all of the transcoding or may split up the transcoding, such as by having six transcoding servers each transcode the media asset to one format. Whether one or multiple transcoding servers transcode the media asset may depend on how busy the transcoding servers are.","Following transcoding of the media asset being completed, the kernel server may be notified that some or all of the transcoding to the various formats has been completed. The kernel server may then determine the next appropriate service to be processed. This may involve the kernel server accessing a kernel workflow to determine the next appropriate service to be processed. Such a workflow may be a simplistic set of instructions that identifies what services should be performed on media assets under certain conditions. In this case, the service may be for the media asset (that has been transcoded into some other format(s)) to be transferred to one or more different servers. The kernel server may then notify a server, possibly a master file replication server, that the (transcoded) media asset needs to be transferred to various servers. This may again end the kernel server's involvement in the transferring of the media asset. The remaining steps of the media asset being transferred may be handled by the master file replication server and other file replication servers in communication with the master file replication server. The kernel server may be notified once some or all of the transferring of the various transcoded versions of the media asset have been completed.","Such an arrangement may allow the kernel server to only be responsible for determining what services need to be processed using media assets at particular times. As such, the kernel server may not need to know how to process any of the services. For example, if media assets are being transcoded to a new file format, the kernel server may be able to receive requests for the media asset to be transcoded to this particular format without knowing what needs to be done with the media asset to process the transcoding. Rather, the kernel server may inform a transcoding server or the master transcoding server as such and allow it to process the transcoding.","Further, such an arrangement may allow for a service to be quickly and efficiently scaled to match demand for that particular service. For example, if an increased number of media assets need to be transcoded, more transcoding servers may be added to the system, thereby allowing the kernel server (and, possibly a master transcoding server) to assign such servers to transcode media assets. Further, it may be possible to convert servers to perform different services. For example, a server that typically transfers media assets, such as by processing a file replication service, may be converted to be a transcoding server if the need arises.","Another advantage of such arrangements may be that if a particular service is taking a significant amount of time to complete, other services may continue to be processed unabated. For example, network congestion may slow down file replication servers processing transfers of media assets. However, such a slow down may not affect transcoding services because the transcoding is being handled by different servers.","As those with skill in the art will recognize, the previous example involving transcoding and transferring services being processed is not intended to be limiting. Servers or other computing devices in communication with a kernel server may process a variety of different services using media assets, or more generally, data files. For example, a similar arrangement of a kernel server and various other servers may be used to perform services on data files that are not media files.","Such a pipelining system for processing parallel services may be performed by a variety of different systems. Such a pipelining system may be part of a media servicing system.  is a block diagram illustrating a media servicing system , according to some embodiments of the present invention. The system can deliver media content to the end user  through a network such as the Internet . A media asset provided by a content provider  can be processed and indexed by cloud-hosted integrated multi-node pipelining system (CHIMPS) , and further stored on content delivery network (CDN) . Additionally or alternatively, the CHIMPS  may also be adapted to store the media asset.","The media servicing system further enables a content provider  or other entity to gather information regarding user behavior during media playback. For example, a content provider  can be provided with data indicating that end users tend to stop watching a video at a certain point in playback, or that users tended to follow links associated with certain advertisements displayed during playback. With this data, a content provider  can adjust factors such as media content, advertisement placement and content, etc., to increase revenue associated with the media content and provide the end user  with a more desirable playback experience.","End user  can request a media asset to hear and\/or see with a client program running on a personal computer or other electronic device connected to Internet . The client program can be, for example, a media player, browser, or other application adapted to request and\/or play media assets. In response to a request for a media asset, the CHIMPS  can utilize any number of application centers  and\/or kernel application center(s)  to provide the client program with a data object concerning the requested media asset. The data object can include information about the media asset, including where the media asset can be located, such as within the CDN  or within the CHIMPS  itself. Location information may be provided by Universal Resource Indicator (URI), a Universal Resource Locator (URL) or other indicator. During playback of the media asset, the CHIMPS  can collect data regarding the playback through beaconing provided by a client program executed on a devices operated by the end user  and\/or indexing service from within the CHIMPS and\/or CDN. The CHIMPS  can subsequently provide the data and\/or any analytics information derived from the data to the content provider .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["111","1","110","1","111","1","112","120","140","112","111","1","112","110","1","270","112","111","1"]},"Components within the kernel application center - can communicate through network , such as a local area network (LAN), and can include one or more origin servers  and a storage array  with which data objects and\/or media assets may be stored and distributed. The storage array  may also be utilized by services running on processing server(s)  and\/or transcoding server(s)  that may require temporary or long-term storage. Kernel server  can utilize processing server(s) , transcoding server(s)  to provide various functional capabilities to the CHIMPS .","For example, as described in more detail below, the CHIMPS - can provide transcoding service for media assets provided by a content provider  for syndication. Such a service can allow a content provider  to upload a media asset to an application center , after which the application center  would notify the kernel server  that the media asset has been uploaded. The kernel server can then notify services running on the processing server(s)  of the upload. These services can utilize transcoding server(s) to transcode the media asset, which can then be moved to a CDN and\/or stored locally by storage array  and origin server(s) . Services running on the processing server(s)  can also update the associated data object stored by the storage array  and origin server(s) .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["111","2","112","111","2","112","111","2","111","2","260","112","110","112","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["112","112","330","310","360","330","310","360","320","130","370","310","111","112","340","350","350","310","111"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A"],"b":["400","1","110"]},"Media can be ingested into the CHIMPS  when a content provider  uploads a media asset to ingest server(s)  in an application center  by utilizing a client . The client  can be a stand-alone application or browser based, for example, and can communicate with ingest server(s)  through an application programming interface (API) configured for the ingestion of media assets.","Ingest server(s)  can communicate with devices in the kernel application center  executing programs such as kernel server  and file replication service . The kernel server  can be configured to organize the workflow among services, such as transcoding  file system manager , and other services  (e.g., analytics, dynamic API, etc.) Upon a particular event, for example, the kernel server can be configured to notify the relevant services of the event, causing the services to process tasks associated with the event.","The file replication service , under direction of the kernel server , can coordinate the movement of the media assets between services. For example, retrieving the uploaded media asset from the ingest server(s)  and storing it on the file archive , or retrieving transcoded media assets from transcoding service(s)  and storing them in the media asset origin.","The data object updater  keeps the data object origin  up to date in response to any changes in the system. When, for example, a file is uploaded, transcoded, and stored in media asset origin , the location and other metadata concerning the transcoded media assets need to be created or updated in the data object origin  to ensure an end user who accesses the object in the data object origin  has the correct information regarding the related media asset. Because the data object updater  receives updates from the kernel server  (which is notified when a transcoded media asset is stored in the media asset origin , the system ensures the data objects in the data object origin are constantly up to date.","The upload of a media asset to the ingest server(s) , as described above, can provide an example of how the kernel server  may coordinate workflow. For instance, in response to the upload, the ingest server(s)  can notify the kernel server  that a media asset has been uploaded. The kernel server  informs the file replication service  of the uploaded media asset, and the file replication service  moves the uploaded media asset into the file archive  and notifies the kernel server  of the move. In response, the kernel server  notifies the file replication service , the file system manager , and the transcoding master  of the move. The file replication service  then will know it can delete the uploaded media asset from the ingest server(s) , the file system manager  will update the file system accordingly, and the transcoding master  will notify transcoding service(s)  of different transcoding tasks to be performed. The transcoding service(s)  can then retrieve the uploaded media asset from the file archive  to create transcoded media assets. The transcoding service(s)  notify the kernel server  once transcoding is complete, and the kernel server  relays this information to the file replication service . The file replication service  then takes the transcoded media assets from the transcoding services  and moves them to the media asset origin . Once the file replication service  notifies the kernel server  of the move, the kernel server , in turn, notifies the file replication service  and the data object updater . The data object updater  which updates the data object origin  accordingly, and the file replication service  deletes the transcoded media assets from the transcoding services .","The modular nature of the system enables all tasks associated with an event to be completed quickly. As illustrated in the example above, workflow relating to a particular event, such as a media asset upload, can be spread among the various services simultaneously. Moreover, because the system's modularity enables it to be scaled to accommodate differing hardware capacities, and because the system can be configured to dynamically allocate hardware to different services according to the needs of the system, the speed of completing tasks relating to a particular event can further be increased.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":["400","2","110","400","2","400","1","455","400","2","455","150"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 4C","b":["400","3","110","400","3","400","1","455","400","3","455","150"]},"Specifically directed to embodiments of the pipelining system for processing parallel services,  illustrates an embodiment of a pipelining system  that may allow a kernel server to have other servers process services using a media asset.

Alternatively, kernel server  may represent some other kernel server. The kernel server  may determine what services need to be performed on media assets. For example, upon receiving a particular type of media asset, kernel server  may have instructions (possibly referred to as a kernel workflow) that indicate services to be processed using the media asset. In some embodiments, an end user may provide instructions to the kernel server that indicate what services should be processed using a media asset. For example, an end user may specify that a media asset should be transcoded to a particular file format. Kernel server  may be in communication with multiple groups of servers. These groups of servers may be dedicated to performing particular services.","Kernel server  may communicate with a first group of servers . The first group of servers  may be dedicated to performing a particular service, such as a file replication service. For example, first group of servers  may perform file replication service  of . A file replication service may involve moving or copying media assets from a server to one or more other servers, possibly located in different geographic locations. The kernel server  may communicate with first group of servers  directly or via a network. Accordingly, first group of servers  may be physically local to kernel server  or may be geographically separated. If a network is used for communication between kernel server  and first group of servers , the network may be public, such as the Internet, or private, such as a corporate intranet or local area network. Besides a file replication service, first group of servers  may instead perform some other service.","First group of servers  is illustrated as including two file replication servers (- and -). This is for simplicity only. As those with skill in the art will understand, it may be possible for first group of servers  to include many more servers. The first group of servers  may receive a notification from kernel server  when a media asset is be processed by the file replication service. Such a notification may include an indication (possibly in the form of a universal resource indicator, such as a universal resource locator) of the location of the media asset. While the media asset may be stored with the kernel server  and\/or may be transmitted to first group of servers  (such as at the time of the notification being sent), a media asset may also be stored at a remote storage server (such as file archive  of  or media asset origin ).","Kernel server  may determine which file replication server of first group of servers  is to perform the file replication service on the media asset. In some embodiments, kernel server  may request a status notification from file replication server - and file replication server - to determine which one is available (or will be available sooner) to process the file replication service. Based on the results of the status notification, the kernel server  may send the request for the media asset to have the file replication service processed to a particular file replication server of first group of servers . In some embodiments, kernel server  may send the request for the media asset to have the file replication service performed to a queue. This queue may be accessed by first group of servers , thereby allowing the first file replication server (- or -) to become available to satisfy the request for the file replication service to be processed using the media asset.","Once the file replication service has been processed by first group of servers , the media asset may be modified or a new version of the media asset may have been created. Kernel server  may then be notified by the file replication server (- or -) that performed the file replication service on the media asset that the file replication service has been completed. The notification may also include an indication of where the new version or modified version of the media asset resides. If such an indication is present, it may be in the form of a universal resource indicator, such as a universal resource locator.","Once kernel server  has received a notification that file replication service has been processed using the media asset, kernel server  may determine if another service is to be processed using the media asset. If there is another service to be processed using the media asset, the kernel server  may then determine what service is to be processed. This next service to be performed on the media asset may be a transcoding service. Such a transcoding service may be performed by a second group of servers .

As those with skill in the art will understand, it may be possible for second group of servers  to include many more servers. Second group of servers  may receive a notification from kernel server  when a media asset is to have the transcoding service processed on it. Such a notification may include an indication of the location of the media asset. This media asset may have already been processed by another service, such as the file replication service. While the media asset may be stored with the kernel server  and\/or may be transmitted to second group of servers , a media asset may also be stored at some remote storage server, such as those previously described.

For example, in some embodiments, the number of file replication servers in first group of servers  may be varied by adding or subtracting file replication servers. More file replication servers may be added if a large number of media assets require processing the file replication service. Similarly, if few media assets require the file replication service to be processed using them, some of the first group of servers  may be removed, shutdown, or assigned to another group of servers performing some other service.","A master transcoding server  may also be present. Master transcoding server  may represent the same server as transcoding master  of , or may represent some other server. Master transcoding server  may function similarly to master file replication server . Kernel server  may transmit a notification to master transcoding server  that indicates a media asset that is to have the transcoding service performed on it. This may be the same media asset that previously had the file replication performed on it. Therefore, this may be a modified or otherwise processed media asset. The notification may include a universal resource indicator that indicates where the media asset is located. The universal resource indicator may be in the form of a universal resource locator.","Master transcoding server  may request a status update from some or all of the second group of servers . The second group of servers  may send a response to master transcoding server  that indicates their individual availability. Based on the responses received from second group of servers , master transcoding server  may assign one or more servers of second group of servers  to process the transcoding service using the media asset. In some embodiments, master transcoding server  may randomly or in a predetermined pattern assign the media asset to have the file replication processed using it to a transcoding server of second group of servers . Master transcoding server  may assign the media asset to a transcoding server differently than master file replication server  assigns media asset to file replication servers .","Once a transcoding server (-, -, -, or -) of second group of servers  has completed the transcoding using the media asset, that transcoding server may send a notification that the transcoding service has been completed on the media asset to either the master transcoding server  or kernel server . If the notification is sent only to master transcoding server , master transcoding server  may transmit a notification that the transcoding service has completed processing the media asset to kernel server .","As will be understood by those with skill in the art, while the second group of servers  illustrate four transcoding servers (-, -, -, and -), fewer or more transcoding servers may be present among second group of servers . For example, in some embodiments, the number of servers in second group of servers  may be varied by adding or subtracting transcoding servers. More transcoding servers may be added if a large number of media assets need to be transcoded. Similarly, if few media assets require the transcoding service to be performed on them, some of second group of servers  may be removed, shutdown, or assigned to another group of servers performing some other service.","While pipelining system  refers to transcoding and file replication services, it should be understood that these are only examples of possible services that servers may perform. In some embodiments, the first group of servers  may process the transcoding service, and the second group of servers  may process the file replication service. Other services may be processed using media assets, or more generally, using data files. Additionally, it should be understood that the servers used in pipelining system  may be geographically distributed. As an example, kernel server  is illustrated in a first location . Master file replication server  may be in a second location . The second location  may represent a different building, city, state, country, or continent from first location . Master transcoding server  may be in a third location  with the second group of servers . This third location may represent a different building, city, state, country, or continent from first location  and second location . The first group of servers  may be in the same or different location from master file replication server . Further, individual file replication servers and transcoding servers may be located in different positions from other file replication servers and transcoding servers, respectively.","In some embodiments of a pipelining system  for performing parallel services on media assets more than two groups of servers configured to perform various services are present.  illustrates kernel server  interacting with four sets of servers configured to each process a service. Kernel server  communicates with master file replication server , master transcoding server , a master ingest server , and a master \u201cother\u201d service server . Kernel server  may communicate with some or all of master servers  via a network -. In pipelining system , kernel server  is depicted as communicating only with master file replication server  via network -. However, in some embodiments, some or all of master servers  may communicate with kernel server  via network - or some other network. Network - may represent a public network, such as the Internet, or a private network such as corporate intranet or local area network.","In pipelining system , the second group of servers  contains six transcoding servers. The second group of servers  may include an increased number transcoding servers (an addition of transcoding servers - and - over pipelining system ) because a large number of media assets need to be transcoded.","In addition to the first group of servers  and the second group of servers , pipelining system  contains two other groups of servers controlled by master servers. A master ingest server  controls a third group of servers  comprised of ingest server - and ingest server -. These ingest servers may perform the functions of ingest server  of . As illustrated, only two ingest servers are in the third group of servers . This may be because few media assets require ingesting. In some embodiments, it may be possible to convert a server processing a particular service to a server processing a different service. By way of example only, if the third group of servers  originally had four ingest servers, however not many media assets required ingesting, two of these ingest servers may have been converted to be transcoding servers (such as - and -) because a large number of media assets required the transcoding service to be processed using them. Therefore, it may be possible to convert servers to perform a different service, and possibly convert those servers back to their original functionality if the need or desire arises. Further, if a server that is part of a group of servers, such as transcoding server - of second group of servers because unavailable for some reason (e.g., crashes), it may not adversely affect the rest of the system  because other servers are processing other media assets.","A fourth master server, master other service server , may interact with a fourth group of servers  through a network -. This may be the same network as network -, or may represent some other network. While only master other service server  is illustrated as communicating with a group of servers via a network, it should be understood that any of master servers  may communicate with a respective group of servers via network -, or some other network. Fourth group of servers  may include four other service servers. These other service servers may represent the same servers as depicted by other services  of . Alternatively, the fourth group of servers  may refer to some other group of servers.","As was described in relation to pipelining system  of , it should be understood that the various servers of pipelining system  of  may be geographically scattered. For example, various master servers  may be located in different locations. Also, master servers  may or may not be located in the same physical location as the group of servers they control. Further, servers within groups of servers may also be located at disposed locations. For example, file replication server - may be located in a different geographic location than file replication server -.","In order for kernel server  to be able to determine what service is appropriate to process a media asset, it may have stored or otherwise have access to a workflow script.  illustrates a simplified block diagram of an embodiment  of kernel server . In some embodiments, kernel server  includes storage , interpreter , processor , and task engine . Storage  may represent various forms of tangible computer readable storage mediums, such as one or more hard drives or random access memory. Stored on storage  may be workflow script . While  illustrates workflow script  as stored by storage , it should be understood that workflow script  may be stored remote from kernel server  and accessible via a network connection.","Workflow script  may include a set of tasks that identify various subtasks that the kernel server should perform following receiving a notification. Workflow script  may identify various tasks (in , tasks  through n are present) that are performed depending on the status of a media asset. For example, a particular task may be that if a file replication server notifies kernel server  that a media asset has been moved to a particular location, the kernel server  should notify master transcoding server  of  to process the transcoding service using the media asset. Workflow script  may be simplistic: each task may not identify how to perform various services, rather tasks may identify only what services need to be notified in particular situations. Based on this, kernel server  may notify the appropriate server to perform the appropriate service.","Notably, workflow script  may be modified whenever the order or type of service needed to be performed on a media asset changes. Because kernel server  may only receive notifications, determine another server to perform a service, and notify an appropriate server, significant flexibility may be provided in reworking workflow script  (or programming a new workflow script) for different services to be performed on media assets.","Further, different clients may use different workflow scripts. For example, a first client may wish for certain services to be performed on a media asset in a particular order. However, another client may require different services, or services in a different order, to be performed on its media assets. This may be accommodated by having different workflow scripts for different clients, or by having tasks that are only executed for particular customers. For example, the same notification received from a server performing a particular service may result in a different service being performed next, depending on the client.","Workflow scripts may also comprise basic programming. For example, if-then statements may be evaluated and executed in various tasks within workflow script . Each task of workflow script  may evaluate certain basic parameters received for a media asset. These parameters may include: what media asset is being evaluated, what client the media asset linked to, and what service has been performed on the media asset.","Below, an example workflow script is presented:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Notification",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Received by",{},"Other Service in"]},{"entry":["Task","Kernel Server","Service(s) to Perform","Parallel?"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Task 1","Notification","Notify (master) file","No"]},{"entry":[{},"received","replication server."]},{"entry":[{},"from ingest"]},{"entry":[{},"server."]},{"entry":["Task 2","Notification","If transcoding required,","Other transcode"]},{"entry":[{},"received","then Notify (master)","services."]},{"entry":[{},"from (master)","transcoding server."]},{"entry":[{},"file repli-","Otherwise perform task 3."]},{"entry":[{},"cation server."]},{"entry":["Task 3","Notification","Notify (master) file","Yes."]},{"entry":[{},"received","replication server to"]},{"entry":[{},"from (master)","distribute processed media"]},{"entry":[{},"transcoding","asset to media asset origin"]},{"entry":[{},"server.","servers."]},{"entry":["Task 4","Notification","Notify a first service and","\u2014"]},{"entry":[{},"received","notify a second service."]},{"entry":[{},"from other"]},{"entry":[{},"service server."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The above table illustrates an exemplary workflow script that may be executed by kernel server . For example, in task one, if a notification is received from an ingest server that a client has uploaded a new media asset, the kernel server  may notify a file replication server or master file replication server. The kernel server  may also send a link to the location of the media asset to the (master) file replication server. The kernel server  may also inform the file replication server where to copy or move the media asset to. In some embodiments, the file replication server may have its own workflow script that indicates that when a new media asset is identified by the kernel server, the media asset is to be transferred to a particular location. As another example from Table 1, task four informs the kernel server  that if a notification is received from some other service server (such as other service  of ), a first and second service are to be performed on the media asset.","Various tasks may also identify whether or not some other service may be performed in parallel while the service identified by the task is being performed. For example, while the file replication service is being performed using the media asset, it may not be possible (or desirable) for another service to also be performed on the media asset. However, referring to task two, where a transcode service is being processed using the media asset, it may be possible for other transcode services to be processed using the same media asset. Also, referring to task three, while the media asset is being moved to an origin server, it may be possible for other services to be performed on the media asset. Whether a service may be performed in parallel may be determined by what the service does (e.g., whether the service modifies the media asset). For example, a service that modifies the media asset may not be possible to be performed while some other service is being performed, however a service that only copies a version of the media asset from one location to another may be possible to be performed.","Various tasks of workflow script  may be decoded and presented to processor  by interpreter . Processor  may inform task engine  via interpreter  of the service that needs to be performed. Task engine  may then transmit a notification to the appropriate server that performs the service. This notification may indicate the media asset that requires the service to be performed on it. The notification may also include other information, such as what client the service is to be performed for. The notification may also include a link, such as a universal resource indicator, that indicates the location the location of the media asset. Task engine  may also receive notification from servers performing services that indicate when the services are complete. Task engine may decode and relay the notification to processor  via interpreter . Processor  may then access workflow script  via interpreter  to determine the next appropriate service to be performed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIGS. 5-8","FIG. 7"],"b":["900","500","600","700","900","910","425","740","1"]},"At block , a workflow script, possibly particular to the client who uploaded the media asset, may be loaded by the kernel server. At block , the workflow script may be read by the kernel server. At block , the appropriate task to be performed by the kernel server. Alternatively, the notification received by the kernel server from the ingest server (or some server sending the notification on behalf of the ingest server) at block  may contain an indication that instructs the kernel server what service needs to be processed using the media asset. At block , the kernel server may perform various subtasks related to the task identified at block , such as evaluating if-then statement, and determining if some other service may be performed in parallel. The remainder of method  uses a transcoding service as an exemplary service to be processed using the media asset.","Whether the kernel server determines transcoding is the appropriate service to perform by consulting a workflow script or is notified of such by the ingest server, the kernel server may send a notification to a master transcoding server (such as  of ) that coordinates performance of the transcoding service at block . This notification may include a link, such as a universal resource indicator, to the media asset that is to be transcoded being transmitted to master transcoding server.","At block , the notification transmitted by the kernel server may be received by the master transcoding server. In some embodiments, the master transcoding server may identify one or more transcoding servers available to process the transcoding service using the media asset at block . This may involve the master transcoding server sending a request for a status update from one or more of the transcoding servers (such as transcoding servers -, -, -, -, -, and - of ). The transcoding servers may respond to indicate whether or not they are available to process the transcoding service and\/or may indicate when they will become available to process the transcoding service. Based on the status updates, the master transcoding server may determine one or more transcoding servers to process the transcoding service using the media asset. In some embodiments, as opposed to requesting and receiving a status update from each transcoding server, the master transfer server may assign media assets to be transcoded to each transcoding server based on a predetermined pattern or in a random pattern.","At block , the one or more transcoding servers that were selected to process the transcoding service may be notified by the master transcoding server. This notification may include a link (such as a universal resource indicator, or, more specifically, a universal resource locator) to the media asset. If the transcoding server is currently busy, no further action may be performed until the transcoding server becomes available. Then, at block , the transcoding server may process the media asset. This may involve the transcoding server modifying the media asset and\/or creating one or more new versions of the media asset.","Once the (one or more) transcoding servers have completed processing the transcoding service on the media asset, the kernel server may be notified that the transcoding service is complete at block . This may involve the transcoding server notifying the kernel server directly. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the transcoding server may notify the master transcoding server that the transcoding service is completed. Then, the master transcoding server may inform the kernel server that the transcoding service has completed.","The kernel server may then determine whether another service is to be processed on any of the versions of the media asset at block . If no more services are to be performed on or using any of the versions of the media asset, the method may conclude at block . At this point, one or more of the versions of the media asset may be stored in some location, such as file archive  or media asset origin . However, returning to block , if another service is to be performed, the method may return to block  and the kernel server may determine what next service should be performed using one or more of the versions of the media asset.","While method  refers to a transcoding service being performed, it should be understood that the references to a transcoding service are for or example purposes only. Any other of the previous services described may also be performed using such a method on the media asset. Alternatively, it may be possible to conduct services not discussed on the media asset. Even more generally, as opposed to a media asset being processed and\/or modified using method , some other form of data or data file may instead be used.","Further, it should be appreciated that while method  is being performed, the kernel server may be receiving notifications and sending notifications as to various services being processed using other media assets. For example, a similar method to method  may be used for thousands of other media assets involving the kernel server at the same time. In such a way, a single kernel server may be able to coordinate various services being performed on vast numbers of media assets at the same time.","It should be noted that the methods, systems, and devices discussed above are intended merely to be examples.
