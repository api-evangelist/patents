title: Recovery of DTMF tones in the presence of periodic interference and obstruction
abstract: While a dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signal can be easily processed if cleanly obtained, difficulties can arise if the DTMF signal is not cleanly obtained. In one example, part of the signal can be cleanly obtained, but part of the signal can be obstructed. In order to determine the content of the DTMF signal the parts that are cleanly obtained can be compared with known DTMF signals, such as DTMF signals that correspond with buttons on a telephone keypad. A classification of a closest matching known DTMF signal can be identified and that classification can be assigned to the partially obtained DTMF signal. Thus, without clearly obtaining the whole DTMF signal a content of the DTMF signal can be ascertained.

The DTMF signal can be cleanly obtained and analyzed. Based on a result of this analysis, content of the DTMF can be determined. This content can then be used to determine a number of a keypad designated by a user.","A system is disclosed comprising a comparison component, an identification component, and a processor. The comparison component is configured to compare a signal part group of a dual tone signal against a known signal set to produce a comparison result, where the signal part group is less than the signal.

In one example, underlying ideas disclosed herein can be used in extracting a signaling data string in cordless phones, non-message-oriented signaling of public switched telephone networks, etc.","Aspects disclosed herein can be used with regard to solving the following situation. A system can be transmitting DTMF tones. The transmitted signal, during propagation, can be subjected to periodic obstructions (e.g., interference, fades, etc.) that can be man-made or natural. As a result, only a few segments of the signal, such as of length tand spaced Tseconds apart, are usable at a receiver. Since a minimum continuous signal length for extraction of signal characteristic features, while depending upon bandwidth, is usually more than t, it can be beneficial to determine how these small disjoint segments that are outside of obstructions should be selected and concatenated so that the DTMF tones can be recovered correctly.","DTMF tones which are periodic signals can be evaluated. A receiver can collect a few useful segments of the signal that can be of length t(e.g., for an individual segment) and spaced Tseconds apart. For these segments, tmay or may not be the same as t. Similarly, different editions of Tmay not be the same. In one embodiment, they may be randomly distributed between two values. Since these segments are so small that the characteristic features of the signal may not be able to be uniquely determined from a single segment, an iterative algorithm (or other embodiment) can be employed that shows how the disjoint segments should be selected and concatenated so that the receiver can correctly identify the transmitted key (e.g., tone of the signal).","The algorithm can begin choosing one of the segments arbitrarily, and then computing a metric that indicates how different this segment is from other segments. A few of these segments, the ones in which the metrics are among the largest, are concatenated.","The algorithm can begin choosing one of the segments arbitrarily, and then computing a metric that indicates how different this segment is from other segments. A few of these segments for which the metrics are among the largest are concatenated.","The algorithm then computes a Fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the concatenated signal, and determines a key whose tones are closest to the frequencies indicated by the FFT. Once a key has been found, an error between the DTMF tones of the key and the frequencies indicated by the FFT is minimized by creating a window out of the concatenated segments and then sliding the window one sample at a time to the right. If a key cannot be determined or if the frequencies of the FFT are outside a specified region, a different set of segments can be selected and the process is repeated.","If the received signal is aperiodic, selection of the small segments to be concatenated to form the required length can be rather straightforward, because no matter which segments are selected, their information contents are different, and therefore, the concatenated segments of a correct length would yield distinctive features of the signal with a high probability. If, on the other hand, the signal is periodic in nature, concatenation of improperly selected segments or improperly selected samples may result in redundant information, and therefore a given width of the concatenated signal may not reveal the characteristic features of the signal.","A DTMF signal can be represented as\n\n()=cos(\u03c9)+cos(\u03c9)\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere \u03c9and \u03c9are, respectively, the lower and upper frequencies.

The selected segments are then concatenated. This concatenated signal can be noted as Sand Scan be appended to S.  illustrates one embodiment of a breakdown  of a signal, such as S.","The FFT of the resulting signal can be taken, and a digit key whose tones are closest to the frequencies indicated by the FFT can be found. If the digit key is not found and if the number of iterations are below a threshold, another segment can be selected as a reference segment, again calling it S, and this process is repeated. If the digit key is found, the algorithm can continue with constructing a window of length t\u2212tstarting from the first sample of S.","The window can be slid by one sample to the right, and then appended to S. The resulting signal is passed through an FFT computer, and the error between the tones of the key and frequencies indicated by the FFT is calculated. More exactly, the error is defined as follows. The following two tones\u2014\u03a9and \u03a9\u2014are respectively the lower and upper tones detected in the FFT, and fand fare the lower and upper frequencies of the key. The error is taken to be |\u03a9\u2212f|+|\u03a9\u2212f|. The algorithm can keep sliding the window one sample at a time and repeat until the error is minimum or until the last sample of Sis included in the window. If this difference is below a threshold, then the algorithm has obtained the desired concatenated signal.","To demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, in one example DTMF tones corresponding to various keys can be transmitted over an FM carrier. The transmitted signal encountered obstructions for varying lengths of time. The discussion below uses key 5 (e.g., tones 770 Hz and 1336 Hz) in a hypothetical situation. The spacing between adjacent segments that are 1 ms long can be uniformly distributed between 5 and 15 ms. However, other implementations are possible such as the width of each segment could also be random. The signal-to-noise ratio of the useful segments can be 20 dB.","Segment 1 of the breakdown  can be arbitrarily selected. To select the other segments for concatenation, their metrics with respect to segment 1 can be computed using expression (2) that is shown in the graph  illustrated in . Those segments can be selected whose metrics were among the highest. Seven such segments can be designated 46, 24, 49, 14, 6, 28, and 36. Segments that give the closest match to a DTMF key can be: 1, 24, and 36 or 1, 14 and 36. Following the algorithm, the transmitted key can be found to be key 5 (e.g., of keypad with 0-9, *, #, and A-D). Frequencies of the FFT are seen to be 797 Hz and 1282 Hz, hence the error between these frequencies and the actual DTMF tones of this key is 81 Hz. The demodulated signal and its FFT are shown in 20 as illustrated in graphs  and .","To reduce the error between the detected and actual frequencies of this key, a 2-ms window can be constructed by concatenating segments 46, 14 and 49 in that order. Sliding the window one sample at a time, it was appended to segment 24. , and in turn graph , shows how the error varies with the number of samples, say, n the window is slid through. A minimum error, which occurs in this example at n=40, is 19. This time the frequencies as indicated by the FFT are found to be 781 Hz and 1344 Hz compared to actual frequencies of 770 Hz and 1336 Hz for key 5.","The innovation presented in this disclosure has various applications. Examples include detecting signals that are usually transmitted in a number of short, disjoint bursts, radar signals, extracting signaling information in cordless phones, non-message-oriented signaling of public switched telephone networks, etc. Aspects disclosed herein can be practiced in these various applications."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Incorporated herein are drawings that constitute a part of the specification and illustrate embodiments of the detailed description.
