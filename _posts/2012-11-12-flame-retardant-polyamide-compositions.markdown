The invention achieves a combination of flame retardancy and processability by melt mixing, without significantly detracting from strength, modulus, dyeing and thermal stability of the unmodified host polyamide.","Not applicable.","Before the present compositions and methods are described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular processes, compositions, or methodologies described, as these may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used in the description is for the purpose of describing the particular versions or embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention, which will be limited only by the appended claims. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of embodiments of the present invention, the preferred methods, devices, and materials are now described. All publications mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the invention is not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention.","It must also be noted that, as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, and \u201cthe\u201d include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to \u201ca combustion chamber\u201d is a reference to \u201cone or more combustion chambers\u201d and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth.","As used herein, the term \u201cabout\u201d means plus or minus 10% of the numerical value of the number with which it is being used. Therefore, about 50% means in the range of 45%-55%.","The terms \u201cflame retardant,\u201d \u201cflame resistant,\u201d \u201cfire resistant,\u201d or \u201cfire resistance,\u201d as used herein, means that the composition exhibits a limiting oxygen index (LOI) of at least 27. \u201cFlame retardant,\u201d \u201cflame resistant,\u201d \u201cfire resistant,\u201d or \u201cfire resistance,\u201d may also refer to the flame reference standard ASTM D6413-99 for textile compositions, flame persistent test NF P 92-504, and similar standards for flame resistant fibers and textiles. Fire resistance may also be tested by measuring the after-burning time in accordance with the UL test (Subject 94). In this test, the tested materials are given classifications of UL-94 V-0, UL-94 V-1 and UL-94 V-2 on the basis of the results obtained with the ten test specimens. Briefly, the criteria for each of these UL-94-V-classifications are as follows:","UL-94 V-0 the total flaming combustion for each specimen after removal of the ignition flame should not exceed 10 seconds and none of the test specimens should release and drips which ignite absorbent cotton wool.","UL-94 V-1: the total flaming combustion for each specimen after removal of the ignition flame should not exceed 30 seconds and none of the test specimens should release any drips which ignite absorbent cotton wool.","UL-94 V-2: the total flaming combustion for each specimen after removal of the ignition flame should not exceed 30 seconds and the test specimens release flaming particles which ignite absorbent cotton wool.","Fire resistance may also be tested by measuring after-burning time. These test methods provide a laboratory test procedure for measuring and comparing the surface flammability of materials when exposed to a prescribed level of radiant heat energy to measure the surface flammability of materials when exposed to fire. The test is conducted using small specimens that are representative, to the extent possible, of the material or assembly being evaluated. The rate at which flames travel along surfaces depends upon the physical and thermal properties of the material, product or assembly under test, the specimen mounting method and orientation, the type and level of fire or heat exposure, the availability of air, and properties of the surrounding enclosure. If different test conditions are substituted or the end-use conditions are changed, it may not always be possible by or from this test to predict changes in the fire-test-response characteristics measured. Therefore, the results are valid only for the fire test exposure conditions described in this procedure.","A number of approaches have been investigated to impart flame retardancy to polyamides and copolyamides with varying degrees of success. In general, it has been extremely challenging to impart flame retardancy to polyamides and copolyamides without detracting from other important properties in particular from melt processability. First, one needs to select a flame retardant additive that is miscible with the polyamides or copolyamides and\/or that can be homogeneously dispersed in the polyamide of copolyamide matrix. Secondly, often there is an unacceptable increase in the melt viscosity of the polyamide during processing that is caused by the flame retardant additive. In the worst case, a chemical reaction occurs between the flame retardant and the polyamide, and the composition rapidly hardens and melt processability is lost. In addition to maintaining melt processability it is important that other important properties such as strength, modulus, dye-ability and thermal stability of the host polyamide are not significantly diminished.","Recently phosphinate salts either alone or in combination with nitrogen compounds such as melamine derivatives have been the focus of flame retardant additives. Red phosphorus has also been used as a flame retardant because in can tolerate the high processing temperatures associated with polyamides and copolyamides. In both approaches the amount of additives required to achieve acceptable flame retardant behavior in polyamides is sufficiently high so as to cause an increase in melt viscosity of the composition. In the case of the metal phosphinates and melamine derivatives, they are small nonreactive molecules that can leach out of the resin into the surrounding environment. In the case of red phosphorus, it is highly reactive at elevated temperature and is toxic and dangerous to handle.","Other approaches to imparting flame retardant properties to polyamides have involved the use of phosphorus containing polymers combined with melamine derivatives or polyphosphonamides. Since these approaches use a high molecular weight unreactive polymer, and the loading level required to achieve flame resistance is high, the melt viscosity of the composition is typically increased which is undesirable and limiting.","Thus, there is a need to provide flame retardancy to polyamides and copolyamides without detracting from melt processability, strength, modulus, dyeing, and thermal stability as compared to the unmodified polyamide.","Embodiments of the invention are directed to phosphonamide oligomers that can be combined with known polyamides to produce flame retardant polyamide compositions that overcome toxicity, melt stability, and migration problems associated with metal containing additives while satisfying standardized fire resistance requirements and without detracting from mechanical and processing properties. In other embodiments, the flame retardant compositions may further include one or more additional additives such as, but not limited to, flame retardant additives, fillers, dyes, antioxidants, anti-dripping agents, lubricants, Csalts such as perfluorobutane sulfonic acid sodium or potassium salts and other additives typically used with polyamides and copolyamides can be used. Further embodiments are directed to methods for preparing the flame retardant polymer mixtures by, for example, melt mixing the phosphonamide oligomers described herein with one or more polyamide.","Embodiments are not limited to particular phosphonamides.

In certain embodiments, each \u2014NH\u2014X\u2014NH\u2014 may be derived from the same amine containing monomer, and in other embodiments, each \u2014NH\u2014X\u2014NH\u2014 may be derived from two or more different amine containing monomers. Exemplary amine containing monomers include alkanediamines, alkanetriamines, arylamines, cycloalkylamines, or any combinations thereof, and in various embodiments, the alkanediamines, alkanetriamines, arylamines, cycloalkylamines may have from about 6 to about 12 or about 20 carbon atoms. In particular embodiments, the alkanediamines, alkanetriamines, arylamines, cycloalkylamines may have from about 6 to about 8 carbon atoms. More specific non-limiting examples of suitable diamines, triamines, and polyamines include m-xylylenediamine, di(4-aminophenyl)methane, di(4-aminocyclohexyl)methane, 2,2-di(4-aminophenyl)propane, 1,4-diaminobutane, 1,3-bis-(aminomethyl)-cyclohexane, 1,4-bis(aminomethyl)-cyclohexane, 2,5-bis(aminomethyl)-bicyclo-[2,2,1]heptane and\/or 2,6-bis-(aminomethyl)-bicyclo[2,2,1]heptane, bis-(4-aminocyclohexyl)-derivative of an alkane having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and p-xylylene-diamine 2,2-di(4-aminocyclohexyl)propane, and triamine derivatives of these diamines, any mixtures, or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, \u2014NH\u2014X\u2014NH\u2014 may be derived from polyether amine or Jeffamine, which are described herein below.","The weight average molecular weight (Mw) of these phosphonamide oligomer can vary based on the number of monomers incorporated into the polymer chain and can be from about 200 g\/mole to about 10,000 g\/mole or about 500 g\/mole to about 7,500 g\/mole in embodiments (all expressed against polystyrene (PS) standards). The phosphonamide oligomer s of various embodiments may include at least 50% of the available end groups include an amine group, and in some embodiments, the phosphonamides may have from about 50% to about 100%, about 60% to about 90%, about 60% to about 80%, or any range between these exemplary ranges amine end groups based on the total number of available end groups.","The phosphonamide oligomers of such embodiments may be prepared by combining an amine containing monomer and a phosphonate monomer and heating this mixture under vacuum. In some embodiments, the reaction mixture may further include a polymerization catalyst such as, for example, magnesium chloride. In general, the vacuum may be sufficient to remove volatile components, such as phenol, produced as the phosphonamide oligomer is made. In some embodiments, the vacuum may be applied in a step wise manner, in which the vacuum is increased and the pressure of the reaction is reduced one or more times, during the polymerization process, and in other embodiments, the pressure may be gradually reduced throughout the polymerization. In still other embodiments, the vacuum may be increased and the pressure reduced both step wise and gradually in the same polymerization method. For example, in some embodiments, the vacuum may be applied to produce an initial pressure of from about 250 mmHg to about 50 mmHg and the pressure may be reduced gradually, in a step wise manner, or both to from about 10 mmHg to about 5 mmHg. In other exemplary embodiments, the initial pressure may be from about 250 mmHg to about 150 mmHg, and this pressure may be reduced to from about 40 mmHg to about 80 mmHg and then reduced again to about 20 mmHg to about 5 mmHg to produce a method with 3 vacuum steps. Other methods may include more than 3 steps, and still other methods may include less than 3 steps, for example, pressure may be gradually reduced throughout polymerization from about 250 mmHg or 150 mmHg to about 10 mmHg or about 5 mmHg.","The temperature of the reaction may be maintained at any temperature at which polymerization may occur. For example, in some embodiments, the reaction temperature may be from about 175\u00b0 C. to about 300\u00b0 C., and in other embodiments, the reaction temperature may be from about 200\u00b0 C. to about 250\u00b0 C. or 275\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, a constant reaction temperature may be maintained throughout the polymerization, and in other embodiments, the reaction temperature may change at various times throughout the polymerization reaction. In particular embodiments, the reaction temperature may be increased at steps as the pressure is decreased. For example, in the context of the exemplary embodiments above, the initial reaction temperature may be about 175\u00b0 C. to about 220\u00b0 C. when the pressure is from about 250 mmHg to about 150 mmHg. The reaction temperature may be increased to from about 200\u00b0 C. to about 230\u00b0 C. when the pressure reduced to from about 40 mmHg to about 80 mmHg, and the reaction temperature may be increased to from about 220\u00b0 C. to about 275\u00b0 C. when the pressure is reduced to about 20 mmHg to about 5 mmHg.","The reaction time may be any amount of time necessary to provide sufficient polymerization and may vary with reactants, catalysts, reaction temperatures and pressures, and so on. The skilled artisan may vary the reaction time according to such considerations. In general, the total reaction time may be from about 10 hours to about 40 hours, and in some embodiments, the total reaction time may be from about 15 hours to about 25 hours. The reaction time for various steps or temperature and pressure intervals may also vary, and each step or interval may individually be from about 2 hours to about 20 hours. In certain embodiments, a lower temperature, higher pressure first step or interval may be from about 2 hours to about 6 hours in length, followed by a longer 10 hour to 25 hour step or interval where the temperature is increased and the pressure is reduced. As discussed above, the reaction time for each step or interval may vary and can be determined by the skilled artisan.","In some embodiments, the amine containing monomer may be provided in a molar excess to increase the number of amine end-groups on the phosphonamide oligomers. As discussed above the amine containing monomer may be any diamine, triamine, or polyamine known in the art. In particular embodiments, the amine containing monomer may be provided in a molar excess of at least 10%, and in other embodiments, the amine containing monomer may be provided in a molar excess of from about 10% to about 50%, about 10% to about 30%, or about 10% to about 25%. Without wishing to be bound by theory, when an amine containing monomer is combined with a phosphonic acid diester and is provided in a molar excess of 10%, the resulting oligomeric phosphonamide may have about 5% excess amino end-groups versus phosphonate ester end groups. In still other embodiments, the reaction mixture may include a branching agent, and the ratio of amine to alkyl diarylphosphonate containing monomers may be adjusted to ensure excess amine end-groups in the resulting oligomeric phosphonamide.","In addition to the methods described above, amino terminated phosphonamides can be prepared from the reaction of diamines, triamines, and polyamines, and phosphonic acid dihalides.","In various embodiments, amine containing monomer may be any known diamine, triamine, or polyamine containing monomer.

Prior to blending, the polyamides and the phosphonates were dried under vacuum in an oven overnight at 65 and 80\u00b0 C., respectively.

A specimen vertically clamped at its upper end was burned by application of standard flame to its lower end for 10 seconds.

The time required for the test specimen to burn until the fire goes out was measured (the second flame out time). The measurement was repeated for four test specimens. A summary of the melt mixing conditions and flame retardancy test result is provided in Table 2. The flame out times of all blends ranged from <1 second to 63 seconds indicating an inhomogeneous distribution of the phosphonate polymer in the polyamide matrix as a result of an incompatibility of the phosphonates with the polyamide. Apparently, when specimens were ignited in an area that was rich in phosphonates, a short flame out time was observed indicating the effectiveness of phosphonates as flame retardant additives. However, in some cases, very long flame out times were recorded that can only be explained by a low concentration of phosphonate moieties in the specific part that was ignited. This incompatibility of phosphonates with polyamides was already visually observed when the phosphonate oligomers were mixed with the polyamides as described above. Although this phase separation was not observed when the phosphonate polymer was mixed with the polyamides, still an inhomogeneous mixture was obtained with some areas rich and other areas depleted in phosphonates as evidenced by the large range of flame out times for these blends. These results are very different from the results from Example 5 where all samples showed very short flame out times indicating a homogeneous mixture of the polyamides and the phosphonamides.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Melt Mixing Conditions"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Compar-","Compar-","Compar-"]},{"entry":[{},"ative","ative","ative"]},{"entry":[{},"Example","Example","Example"]},{"entry":[{},"6A","6B","6C1C"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Melt Mixed Formulation",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["PA 6,6 (g)",{},"40","40"]},{"entry":["PA 6,6 GF (g)","40",{},{}]},{"entry":["Irganox B 900 (g)","0.1","0.1","0.1"]},{"entry":["Nofia HM1100 (g)","10",{},{}]},{"entry":["Nofia OL5000 (g)",{},"10",{}]},{"entry":["Nofia OL1001 (g)",{},{},"10"]},{"entry":["% P in final formulation","1.5","2.0","2.5"]},{"entry":["Brabender Processing Conditions",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Temp (\u00b0 C.)","270","270","270"]},{"entry":["Speed (RPM)","50","50","50"]},{"entry":["PA 6,6 melt time (min)","3","3","3"]},{"entry":["PA + Phosphonate mix time (min).","5","5","5"]},{"entry":["Flame retardancy",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Flame times (sec.)","<1~20","<1~55","<1~63"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
