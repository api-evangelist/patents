Field of the Invention","This invention is related in general to the field of network control systems. More particularly, the invention is related to an Internet control system communication protocol and method.","2. Discussion of the Background","In a fully automated environment, appliances that change the various parameters of the environment can be inked to a control area network (CAN) and a controller. The appliances may include heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, lighting systems, audio-visual systems, telecommunications systems, security systems, surveillance systems, and fire protection systems, for example. One or more easy-to-use user interface, such as a touch panel, may be electronically linked to the control area network to accept user input and display current system status. AMX LLC of Dallas, Tex. designs and manufactures such networked appliance control systems.","In accordance with the present invention, a system and method of Internet control network is provided which eliminates or substantially reduces the disadvantages associated with prior control systems.","In one aspect of the invention, the boundaries between the Internet and the control area network are made transparent and the Internet becomes a device on the control area network. The Internet is controllable by user input entered on the user interface, such as touch panel. The Internet is further capable of receiving commands from the master controller in the control area network.","In another aspect of the invention, Internet applications such as web browsers and applications executing on web servers of information content providers become devices on the control area network. The Internet applications are capable of sending commands to and receiving commands from the control area network.","In yet another aspect of the present in invention, a communication protocol is provided. The communication protocol comprises a packet protocol. The packet protocol has a protocol field for indicating the type of protocol, a length of data field for listing the length in bytes of the data field, a data field containing sub protocol data, and, a checksum for determining the integrity of the packet.","In yet another aspect of the invention, a dynamic message protocol generator is provided to enable a scripting language such as VBScript or JavaScript capable of directly communicating on any TCP\/IP network connection.","In yet a further aspect of the invention, a method for controlling communications between a control area network and a data network comprises receiving user input at a controller coupled to the control area network from a node coupled to the data network, receiving user input at the controller from a node coupled to the control area network, and instructing an internet appliance coupled to the control area network to perform a command based on at least one of the received user inputs.","In yet a another aspect of the invention, a controller for controlling communications between a control area network and a data network comprises a first module that receives user input from at least one of: a node coupled to the data network, and a node coupled to the control area network, and a second module that instructs an internet appliance coupled to the control area network to perform a command based on at least one of the received user inputs, wherein the controller is coupled to the control area network, and wherein the controller and the internet appliance are specified by a unique address.","In yet a further aspect of the invention, a computer readable medium comprises instructions for: receiving, by a web server, data from an internet appliance, instantiating, by the web server, one or more processes to handle the data, sending, by the process, a message containing the data to a recipient's software logical device, storing the sent data, by the software logical device, in an indexed position in a data structure, turning on, by the software logical device, an input channel associated with the indexed position, receiving, by a master controller, a state associated with the input channel, and sending, by the software logical device via an output channel, the stored data to the master controller.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10"]},"System  includes a control network portal  coupled between the Internet  and one or more control area networks  and . Control area networks  and  are local area networks operating under transport protocols such as Ethernet, and AXLink and PhastLink of AMX LLC (Dallas, Tex.), the assignee of the present invention, that interconnect a variety of devices, appliances and\/or equipment. The underlying network connectivity  may be wired, wireless, power line carriers, or any suitable transmission medium. Coupled to control area networks  and  are a plurality of devices, appliances and\/or equipment, including control area network user interfaces (CAN UI\/F) , master controllers , and Internet appliances -. Some devices may be coupled to control area networks  and  via additional intermediate communications devices, such as an RS 232 controller (not shown).","Control area network user interface device  is any device that is capable of receiving user input and displaying or indicating control network status. For example, a touch panel, a computer terminal with a monitor, keyboard and pointing device, and any device with similar functionalities may serve as control area network user interface . As described in detail below, with the use of control area network portal  of the present invention, Internet applications are also capable of functioning as control area network user interface devices without the use of custom and dedicated applications on the user's end.","Master controller  is generally a CPU-based controller that controls the communications among user interface  and Internet appliances -. It is operable to receive user inputs received by user interface devices, such as commands, and instruct the appropriate Internet appliance to act according to the command. Master controller  may also poll each device in control area network  periodically to monitor its status. The system status and\/or the status of each device may be sent to control area network user interface devices for display.","Internet appliances - are devices that can receive commands from master controller  and operate or act according to the command. Internet appliances - may include equipment that affect or monitor the various parameters of the premises. For example, Internet appliances - may include heating and air conditioning, lighting, video equipment, audio equipment, sprinklers, security cameras, infrared sensors, smoke detectors, etc. in a residential or commercial control area network. Household appliances, such as a hot tub, fireplace, microwave oven, coffee maker, etc. may also be Internet appliances coupled to the network. Internet appliances - may also be capable of providing a current status of its operational state to master controller , such as on\/off, temperature settings, current ambient temperature, light intensity settings, volume settings, threshold settings, and predetermined alphanumeric strings reflective of operational states.","Master controller  is also operable to receive user input from nodes of the Internet  via control network portal . Connected to Internet  are content providers  and , which may also function as control area network user interface devices. Content providers  and  are typically web servers that generate and provide static and\/or dynamic information and content in the form of web pages. Content provider applications executing on the web server are able to mine data stored in databases (not shown). The web pages are typically developed with hypertext markup language (HTML), and various other scripting languages and programming environments such as Microsoft\u00ae Active Server Pages (ASP), Common Gateway Interface (CGI), Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI), JAVA, ActiveX, Cold Fusion, etc. that make the web pages more dynamic and interactive.","Also connected to the Internet  are web browsers  and  that may also serve as control area network user interfaces. Web browsers  and  are application programs that can be used to request web pages from content providers  and  and decode the web pages. Web browser applications include NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR\u00ae and MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER\u00ae, for example. Typically, a user executes a web browser application on her personal computer and accesses the World Wide Web via a dial-up connection to an Internet service provider. The Internet or World Wide Web may also be accessed via other means such as cable modems and digital subscriber lines (DSL). The user makes a request for a particular web page or particular web site by entering or specifying a uniform resource locator (URL). The URL is associated with an Internet protocol (IP) address of the specified web site. Every computer connected to the World Wide Web and Internet has a unique IP address. This address is used to route message packets to specific computers and users. Internet protocol or IP is the message transport and communications protocol of the Internet and World Wide Web.","When the web browser requests a certain URL, a connection is first established with a web server of a content provider that is addressed by the URL. A hypertext transport protocol (HTTP) request is then issued to the web server to download an HTML file. The web server receives the request and sends a web page file to the web browser, which decodes the file to display information in specified format on the screen. Web pages with dynamic content provided by gateway interfaces such as CGI and ISAPI are executable applications that are run by the web server upon user request. The executing gateway application is able to read parameter information associated with the request and generate an output in the form of an HTML file in response to the parameter values. Another way to add dynamic and interactive content to web pages uses ASP. ASP scripts are server-side executable scripts that are directly incorporated in the HTML web pages. Upon request for the page, the web server executes the ASP script in response to input parameter values and generates the web page with dynamic content.","Using control network portal , users may access control area networks  and  via web browsers  and  accessing web pages provided by control network portal  or value-added web pages provided by content providers  and . For example, a user who has a control area network deployed in her luxury residence to control various aspects of the home environment may use a web browser application to remotely monitor her home. She may change the temperature setting to decrease energy use, for example, because she will be leaving on a business trip straight from work. She may also use the surveillance cameras to visually ensure security has not been breached. She may even be able to remotely program her VCR to record certain favorite programs that will be broadcast while she is away.","An example of value-added web pages provided by content providers is the provision of an interactive version of the television programming web page, www.tvguide.com. A user may request this web page, determine available program choices, and click on a certain program. Options may be provided to enable the user to turn on the television and tune to a particular channel scheduled to broadcast the selected program or to program the VCR to record the selected program.","Another example of value-added web pages provided by content providers is the provision of a secured web page that an electric company may access to slightly raise the temperature settings of the air conditioning systems of its participating customers in anticipation of high demand brown out conditions. Yet another example is a web page that a security company may use to access, monitor and control the security, surveillance and fire protection systems of its customers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","12","13","22","13","14","40","40","30","50","51","52","53","54","30","55","36"]},"It may be noted that control network portal  may be implemented by a single stand-alone system that has sufficient memory and processing power or several separate systems with distinct functions as shown in . Web server  is operable to receive requests of web pages from web browser  and to respond by generating and providing the requested web pages. The information content of the web pages may be dynamically obtained by communicating with IA server , which is operable to communicate with master controller  via control network server  to obtain status and other information. Control network server  is used only if there is protocol conversion or other control issues needed to operate the control area network. It may be thought of, logically, that IA server  is directly coupled to the network and functions as a device on the network. Commands entered at a web browser are sent to web server , which relays the commands to master controller  via IA server  and control network server . Master controller  then instructs appropriate appliances and\/or systems in the control network to act according to the received command.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["13","14","13","70","76","13","14","13","76","82","13","14","82","82"]},"IA server  includes a CGI handler , which communicates with CGI process , and an ASP handler , which communicates with ASP process . Handlers  and  are operable to provide a translation function from IP to a protocol used in the control area networks, such as PhastLink or AXLink in AMX LLC control area networks. IA server  is operable to spawn a software logical or virtual device that is representative of or associated with a physical device directly connected to a control area network or a content provider coupled to the Internet. Multiple software logical devices may be connected to a single control area network or content provider, if needed. Devices, whether physical or logical, are assigned a system identifier (system ID) and a unique device identification number (device ID) used to indicate the destination or origination of messages. One or more protocol converters  may be provided to translate from the protocol used internally in IA server, such as ICSP, to other protocols used in the control area networks, such as AxLink or PhastLink. A protocol converter is not necessary if the protocols employed in IA server  and a control area network  are the same.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["72","78","90","86","90","92","94","14"]},"By the use of software logical devices, Internet applications such as web content providers appear to IA server  no different than devices connected to a control area network. Therefore, it appears that Internet applications like content providers on the web are able to directly communicate with the master controllers of the control area networks to issue commands to devices in the control area networks. Similarly, Internet applications appear to be devices on the control area network that can be controlled by the master controller. The master controller is able to issue commands to the Internet applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["90","90","100","100","110","100","112","90","102","104","106","102","104","106","104"]},"Referring to , which shows a flowchart of an embodiment of a process  in which a command entered at a CAN user interface is delivered to a content provider on the Internet according to the present invention. A user enters data on a user interface device coupled to a control area network, as shown in block . The user interface device may be a touch panel or a computer terminal with a monitor, keyboard and mouse, for example. The user may enter an alphanumeric string, click on a button icon on the screen, push a button on the touch panel, or effect any other suitable input. The data entry may require the user to also submit the entered data, such as pushing a Submit or Enter button, as shown in block . The user interface device then forms a control system message incorporating the entered data and the sender and recipient of the message, as shown in block . The master controller then sends the message onto the control area network, as shown in block . The sender and recipient are specified by a unique combination of system ID and device ID. The recipient may be determined by the data entered by the user. For example, the user may have pushed a button associated with updating the web page of the content provider. The content provider is previously assigned a unique combination of system ID and a device ID.","The master controller on that network receives the message and processes the message, as shown in block . An output channel state associated with the submit button of the user interface device is turned ON by the master controller to indicate that the data is being sent. The ON state of the output channel of the submit button is conveyed to the user interface, which may highlight the submit button or display a predetermined character string as a means of feedback to the user. In block , the master controller then forwards the message to the protocol converter associated with the recipient software logical device in the IA server. The protocol converter then translates the message from the sender protocol to the recipient protocol, as shown in block . Note that protocol conversion is not necessary or is null if the sender protocol is the same as the recipient protocol.","In block , the translated message is then sent or otherwise conveyed to the software logical device that represents the recipient convent provider. The recipient software logical device receives the message and stores the message content in a data structure at a specific location specified by an index value, such as a number, which corresponds to the channel number of the recipient software logical device, as shown in block . The stored message is accessible by specifying the index number. The software logical device then changes the state of an output channel of the same channel number to ON, as shown in block . It may be noted that each device, whether physical or logical, may have one or more channels, each indicative of a specific function, parameter or property. Further, each channel may have an input and an output channel state.","Periodically or at its discretion, the recipient Internet application checks the output channel states of the software logical device associated therewith, as shown in block . The Internet application recognizes that an output channel state is ON and therefore the data associated with that channel has been changed. In block , the Internet application queries the software logical device for the data by specifying the index value. In response, the software logical device sends the message to the Internet application, as shown in block . The Internet application receives the message and uses and acts according to the data in an appropriate manner. The software logical device turns OFF the input channel state, as shown in block , and turns ON the output channel state of the same index value, as shown in block .","The master controller recognizes a change in the input channel state of the software logical device representing the Internet application, as shown in block . In response, the master controller turns OFF the output channel of the user interface device, which is used to notify the user that the requested action has been completed, as shown in block .

Message handler  receives the messages. Message handler  is responsible for receiving the message and sending the message to the appropriate port .","Port  is a control output or input on the device that is discreetly addressable. An example of a port could be an infrared generator device. There can be multiple ports in a device. Each port  would be numbered separately. Ports  can communicate with the outside world through an RS-232 interface , different interfaces or no interface at all.","As part of a port , channels  are provided. A channel is a part of port  and can take on a binary value of either on or off. In one embodiment, each port  can have up to 65,535 channels . Channels  are typically connected to relays  which can be in an on or off condition. Relay  is connected to a contact out , which allows on or off control of whatever port  is connected to. Channels  are bi-directional and can be input channels, output channels, or input\/output channels.","Levels  are in some ways similar to channels. The main difference is that levels can take on any number of values instead of just a binary 0 or 1. Typical uses for levels include setting volume level, setting light level, etc.","Thus, the purpose of message in this protocol is to send and receive controls for devices, which are attached to control area network as well as send and receive status and routing information. For example, for the device shown above, a message could be sent to device , which would turn on a television, set a volume level for the television, and then perhaps scroll some information across television screen. This could be accomplished by a message sent to device  and interpreted by message handler . The message may have a command to turn the television set on and that would be sent to the channel, which would then control the relay to turn the television on. To set the volume level, the message command to set the level at a certain value is received at message handler . The command goes to level  and then to the voltage regulator  which in turn would then set the level by two-pin connector . The scrolling message might then go through the port  through the RS-232 port and displayed on the television connected to serial port DB-9 .","A device can be a user interface or a controlling device, or both. User interfaces are things such as touch panels, one way wireless handheld transmitter, or custom panels. The controlling device provides the control methods for a device. For example, IR generators are controlling devices that can control a VCR, television, or other item.

ICSP connection manager  is coupled to ethernet driver  via TCP\/IP stack  and IP port connection manager . RS-232 driver  provides connectivity to RS-232 devices and Ethernet driver  provides connectivity to devices attached to an Ethernet connection.","ICSP connection manager  is coupled to ICSP message dispatcher . ICSP message dispatcher  can send messages to different managers including a diagnostic manager , a device manager  or a configuration manager .","PL to ICSP protocol conversion  converts from phastlink (PL) to ICSP and vice versa. In some embodiments PL to ICSP protocol conversion  is operable to de-multiplex incoming multiple messages into multiple messages destined for ICSP connection managers and multiple outgoing messages into a single packet for PL devices. AXlink to ICSP protocol conversion  converts messages between devices that use the AXlink protocol to ICSP protocol and vice versa.","ICSP connection manager  is operable to provide routing functionality. ICSP connection manager can route to local masters, local devices, remote masters and remote devices. Routing is accomplished by first routing a message to the appropriate system master and then to the correct device. The destination will be contained in the header of the packet as discussed below.","IP port connection manager  is operable to manage all EP connections, except standard Internet protocols. Standard Internet protocol  provides for standard protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMNP and SMTP.","ICSP message dispatcher  determines the category of the message, such as diagnostic message, device specific messages and configuration messages and routes them to their specific message managers. These include the diagnostic manager , the device manager , and the configuration manager  and any other managers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["670","672","674","674"]},"Destination system field  allows for the addressing of the message to reach a specific system. A system is, in one embodiment, a complete control area network with a single master. Thus, message can be directed to one of many different control area networks. In one embodiment control system field is two bytes in size. Destination device field  lists the number the device that the message is being sent. The device range can be anywhere between 0 and 65,535. Destination port field  lists the specific port of the device that the message is destined for. In one embodiment the protocol supports up to 65,535 ports on the device.","Source system field  is the number of a system where the message originates. Source device field  lists the device that the message originated from. If the device number is 0, this indicates that the master of that control area network is the enunciator of the communication. Source port field  lists the port where the message originated.","An important aspect of addressing is the sequencing of messages. There are certain messages and circumstances under which messages must be delivered in the order intended. This requires that each device be guaranteed the correct order for delivery. However, while messages destined for a certain device must be delivered in the order intended, out of order messages are possible when destined for different devices.","Allowed hop count field  indicates how many hops can occur before the message is purged from the system. Each time a message passes through a master, the allowed hop count field is decremented by one and checked to see if it reaches zero. Once the count reaches zero, the master generates an error message indicating that the message has not reached the sender with an air. Message I.D. field  contains the unique identification number for a message. This message I.D. is used by low level communication algorithms to correlate in the original message with its acknowledge and response.","Message command field  and message data  represent the actual message being sent in the packet. Each packet is decoded by reading the message field  and performing the appropriate functions. Some commands are designed for communication between a device manager located in the master and other ones are intended for communication with the connection manager located in the master. TABLE A below lists exemplary messages that are valid between a device manager and the device or master. First column lists the command, the second column lists the value of the command, the third column lists the valid response from the device for that command, and the fourth column lists the valid response for the master of that command and the fifth column lists the description of the command. For example, command input channel OFF status is sent from a device to a master, which sends the input channel off status to the master. The value of the command sent in the command value of the command field  is 0x0085. Because the device is sending the message there is no response for the device.

Thus, this message can be sent by a TCP\/IP protocol over any connection or by a lontalk protocol, which is based on the phastlink protocol developed by AMX Corporation. This protocol can also be carried over on RS232\/PPP connections. This protocol supports master to master, PC to master and PC to device communication.","Communication components are usually represented using the seven-layer ISO model. Operating Systems such as Windows NT\/9x provide most of these layers with a powerful object oriented abstraction at the application layer. Under Windows, at the application layer, the software developer is presented with a Berkley Sockets interface. With this interface, the developer can establish two-way communication using an object known as a \u201cSocket\u201d. Applications can choose to be clients or servers. Though this is a powerful abstraction, there is no facility to help the application developer formulate a protocol in terms of the packets of information sent back and forth on the wire. The services that are available deal with namespace resolution and sending and receiving of blocks of binary data. Typically, the client and server portions of the application are written to understand each other's messages on the wire. The messages consist of structures of binary information. To formulate such messages, the developer usually has to program in a low-level language such as C or C++.","The Internet has given rise to a whole new species of developers called \u201cWeb developers\u201d. On an average, they are not low-level programmers who can code in C or C++ and instead use some combination of HTML, Java, JavaScript and VBScript. Except for the full Java language, the other languages are \u201cscripting languages\u201d.","They do not provide the developer with services and facilities of a full programming language.","The primary goal of the AMX Corporation dynamic messaging components invention is to make a scripting language such as VBScript or JavaScript (or even Visual Basic) capable of directly communicating on any TCP\/IP network connection. This means that these dynamic messaging components have to give the script writer the ability to: (i) form binary messages and transmit them on a network connection; and (ii) receive binary messages from a network connection, understand their format and \u201cunpack\u201d them to extract individual fields in the message. As explained later in this document, it will be seen that apart from these two basic requirements, current communication protocols require more complex features that these components now provide.","To meet the primary goal explained above, the dynamic messaging components were chosen to be implemented using the Microsoft Component Object Model or COM. This is primarily because presently no other programming model allows a scripting language to use self-describing objects with such ease of use. COM objects are well-understood by the developer community and the model is mature and stable. However, other suitable programming models may be used if desired.","To effect the requirements enumerated above, three distinct objects or components are provided. They include a binary message descriptor\/layout manager object, a message instance object that represents one network message, and a transport object that manages the buffered network transmission issues.","The message descriptor\/layout manager object allows a script to define the structure of binary messages that represent packets of information sent back and forth on a network connection. The message structures are identified using unique names. Once defined, these structures can later be used to form instances of messages or define more complex structures, which contain embedded structures in them. Referring to  for an example of the message descriptor\/layout manager object, which includes a binary message structure  that may be sent or received according to the communication protocol. The packet structure includes a message header structure that is an embedded structure within the message. The message header includes a packet protocol identifier (2 bytes) , a packet size in bytes (4 bytes) , a packet version (2 bytes) , and a packet type (2 bytes) . Message structure  further includes a message body, which contains data according to the message type. For example, the message body may include an element  (2 bytes) , an element  (a variable length element whose size is specified by element ) , and an element  which is a NULL terminated string.","To further describe this message structure, two additional message structures are defined: the message header and the entire message. The entire message contains the header structure as an embedded structure within itself.

The element type is specified as \u201cLONG\u201d meaning it is an integer 4 bytes in size. Adding elements to a message has to be done within a \u201cBeginDefineLayout-EndDefineLayout\u201d pair of operations. This indicates to the layout manager when a new message structure definition begins and ends. Once a message structure is defined completely, it may be used as an element type in further message definitions. In the example above, the \u201cAddStruct\u201d operation was used to make \u201cPacket Header Structure\u201d an element in the structure definition of message \u201cPacket Type 1\u201d. Embedding structures within structures allows for definition of very complex messages.","The example also illustrated yet another important concept. This is the ability to define variable length elements within a message structure. The element named \u201celement \u201d is of variable length. It is a byte (char) array whose length is specified within the message by the preceding element named \u201celement \u201d. Dynamically sized elements of this type are pretty common in many communication protocols.","Due to their very nature, some dynamically sized elements do not have to have an explicit element specify their size. An example of such an element type is a NULL terminated string. A NULL terminated string is a sequence of bytes in which the byte value of 0 is a special value indicating the end of the sequence. Since the end of the sequence is specified by this special value, its length does not have to be explicitly stored. The example shows that \u201celement \u201d is a NULL terminated string and the operation \u201cAddSZString\u201d is used to add it.","The following examples enumerate the operations (methods) provided by the layout manager.","Message Descriptor\/Layout Manager Object Methods","BeginDefineLayout\u2014starts definition of a new message (cannot be called while already defining a message).","EndDefineLayout\u2014ends definition of a current message (cannot be called if not currently defining a message).","IsDefinedLayout\u2014checks for existence of a message definition and returns TRUE\/FALSE.","AddPrimitive\u2014adds a primitive element to a message structure.

Primitive elements includes characters (1 byte), 2 byte integers, 4 byte integers, floating point numbers (4 bytes) and double precision floating point numbers (8 bytes).","AddPrimitiveArray\u2014adds an array of primitive elements to a message structure.","AddPrimitiveDynamicArray\u2014adds a dynamic array of primitive elements to a message structure. The array does not have to be fixed in size, rather, the name of another (integer type) element is used to contain the actual length of this element inside a specific instance of this message structure. The size element has to have been already defined within the message structure. In other words, the length of this dynamic element is specified by an element within the message and that element should be stored in a position physically above the dynamic element.","AddStruct\u2014adds a structure element to a message structure. The structure element must already have been defined.","AddStructArray\u2014adds an array of structure elements to a message structure.","AddStructDynamicArray\u2014adds a dynamic array of structure elements to a message structure.

The message instance object of the dynamic messaging component allows a script to create an instance of a previously defined message in memory, fill the message with values for the individual fields of the message, and then with the help of transport object (which is described in the next section), transmit the message over a network connection.

The code to actually transmit the message is described below.","The first operation performed is the \u201cCreateMessage\u201d operation. This operation allows a script to create a message of a given type. The message type is previously defined within this (or some other) script using the message descriptor\/layout manager object. The meaning of the second boolean argument (FALSE in this case) is explained below. Following the creation of the message, two operations are performed to set the lengths of the two dynamic fields within the message. The two fields are \u201celement \u201d and \u201celement \u201d. \u201celement \u201d is a dynamic array of characters and \u201celement \u201d is a NULL terminated string. After a message is created, sizes of all dynamic elements within the message have to be specified because that is how the Message Instance object knows how much memory this message will occupy. If there are no dynamic elements in the message, this step can be completely avoided.","The third step is actually setting the values of the various fields (elements) in the message. In this message, there are two parts: header and body. The various operations supported by the Message Instance object provide scripts extreme flexibility in writing values of elements into a message. In this instance, methods like \u201cSetInt2\u201d, \u201cSetInt4\u201d, \u201cSetCharArray\u201d and \u201cSetSZString\u201d are used. Also, once all dynamic elements have been explicitly sized, the Message Instance object knows what the entire size of the message is, so the \u201cGetMessageSize\u201d operation can be used to get the size. This operation is used in writing the message size into the \u201cPacketSize\u201d element of the header. The sequence of set operations has to be enclosed within a pair of \u201cBeginSetLayout-EndSetLayout\u201d operations so that the Message Instance knows when a message is ready to be transmitted.","Now that a complete example of a message instance has been illustrated, the following section enumerates all the operations (methods) provided by the Message Instance.","The message\/layout instance object includes the following methods:","CreateMessage\u2014creates an instance of a message, given its type.

When an incoming message is partially formed or contains more than a full message, the partial message bytes can be \u201cpushed\u201d back into the transport object which can be retrieved later.","Message layout and message instance creation are set forth above. The final step in network connectivity is the actual transport. Message layout and message instancing are actions that give rise to blocks of bytes in the memory of the web server (or wherever the script is being executed). To be able to communicate on a network, a live connection has to be made to be able to send and receive data. The third object inside the AMX Corporation dynamic messaging components module is a transport object implemented specifically to handle TCP\/IP networks. The two previous objects do not in anyway assume what kind of a network connection they are communicating over. The transport object's interface is specified independent of the nature of the network. The transport object has a built-in asynchronous message handler that can fire scripts when messages arrive outside of a script's \u201cReceive\u201d method call.","Examples of the transport object methods includes:","Connect\u2014connects to a given remote computer given its network address and end-point (port).","Close\u2014closes an existing connection.","GetLastSocketError\u2014returns the last error that occurred on the network connection.","SetScriptPath\u2014Sets the path of the script that will be executed on incoming asynchronous messages.","DisableAsyncHandler\u2014during some operations, it is desirable not to have the asynchronous message processor fire external scripts\u2014this method allows a script to disable the asynchronous message processor, during which time all incoming messages are buffered up.","EnableAsyncHandler\u2014enables the asynchronous message processor\u2014from this point onward, every incoming asynchronous message will result in an external script being executed.","IsConnected\u2014returns whether the transport object is connected to a remote computer or not.","GetHost\u2014returns the network address of the remote computer to which the transport object is currently connected.","GetPort\u2014returns the port on the remote computer to which the transport object is currently connected.","The sequence of operations to create and send a message instance is given in the exemplary pseudo-code below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0470","num":"0469"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00110","num":"00110"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\/\/ Create a transport object and connect it to a remote computer"]},{"entry":[{},"Transport = CreateObject(\u201cTransport\u201d)"]},{"entry":[{},"Transport.Connect(\u201cabc.com\u201d, 10000)"]},{"entry":[{},"MessageInstance = CreateObject(\u201cLayoutInstance\u201d)"]},{"entry":[{},"\/\/ create message of type \u201cHelloWorldPacket\u201d -"]},{"entry":[{},"previously defined using Layout Manager"]},{"entry":[{},"MessageInstance.CreateMessage(\u201cHelloWorldPacket\u201d, FALSE)"]},{"entry":[{},"\/\/ setup length of dynamic fields"]},{"entry":[{},"MessageInstance.SetDynamicArraySize(\u201cElement2\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"StringLength(\u201cHello\u201d))"]},{"entry":[{},"MessageInstance.SetSZStringLength(\u201cElement3\u201d, 0,"]},{"entry":[{},"StringLength (\u201cWorld\u201d))"]},{"entry":[{},"\/\/ set values for elements"]},{"entry":[{},"MessageInstance.BeginSetLayout ( )"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\/\/ setup message header fields"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003MessageInstance.SetInt2(\u201cPacketHeader.Protocol\u201d, 1)"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003MessageInstance.SetInt4(\u201cPacketHeader.PacketSize\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"MessageInstance.GetMessageSize( ))"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003MessageInstance.SetInt2(\u201cPacketHeader.PacketVersion\u201d, 1)"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003MessageInstance.SetInt2(\u201cPacketHeader.PacketType\u201d, 3)"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2002\u2009\/\/ setup message body fields"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2009MessageInstance.SetInt2(\u201cElement1\u201d, StringLength(\u201cHello\u201d)"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\/\/ set dynamic array element (Element2)"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003MessageInstance.SetCharArray(\u201cElement2\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003StringLength(\u201cHello\u201d), \u201cHello\u201d)"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\/\/ set NULL terminated element (Element3)"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003MessageInstance.SetSZString(\u201cElement3\u201d, \u201cWorld\u201d)"]},{"entry":[{},"MessageInstance.EndSetLayout( )"]},{"entry":[{},"\/\/ transmit message instance using the transport object \u201cTransport\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"MessageInstance.Send(Transport)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The dynamic messaging components are used in the communication between the ASP-based web server and the Internet appliance server.
