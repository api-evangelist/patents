title: Registering software management component types in a managed network
abstract: Embodiments relate to systems and methods for registering management software component types in a managed network. In embodiments, a central registration server can scan a managed network to identify different types and configurations of target machines. The registration server can, for instance, perform an authorization process on some or all targets in a network, and determine a management software component type required by or compatible with each target. The Different target machines may have requirements for different management software component types depending, for instance, on the operating system or other resources installed on each target. Once a management software component type has been identified, the registration server can take an inventory of further resources hosted on the target, as well as identify types of management agents that can be distributed to the target to registration to remote management services, such as configuration management or performance monitoring services.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND OF RELATED ART","DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present teachings relate to systems and methods for registering software management component types in a managed network, and more particularly to platforms and techniques for initiating an automatic scan of target machines in a network and identifying required or compatible types of software management components for those targets, such as configuration management or performance monitoring agents, and storing the identified types to a database.","In large, heterogeneous networks, a variety of different types of clients, hosts, and\/or other nodes may be present. In terms of performing network management tasks on those diverse machines, each target in a managed network can have a different set of installed resources, including operating systems, and therefore require different types of management agents and installation procedures in order to link to desired network services. Those network services can include, for example, configuration management services, performance monitoring services, security services and others, all of which can typically be hosted and supported in remote management servers.","In conventional networks, an administrator may need to manually inspect or register target machines to assign the machines an appropriate or compatible management software component type, indicating what kind of local management agents are required to connect and register with remove management servers. While it may be possible and relatively convenient to identify the necessary management software component type at the time a target machine receives its original installation, in part because constituent operating system, application, and other details are know, it is difficult at downstream times to configure targets for proper management software component types, since their operating system type or version, as well as other configuration details, may change. It may be desirable to provide methods and systems for registering software management component types in a managed network, in which the types and\/or classes of management software components required by or compatible with diverse machines can be automatically scanned, identified and stored to a database.","Embodiments of the present teachings relate to systems and methods for registering software management component types in a managed network. More particularly, embodiments related to platforms and techniques for the automatic scanning of target machines and\/or other nodes in a managed network, to identify a management software component type to be associated with a given target. For instance, target machines running the Linux\u2122 operating system can require or be compatible with a certain set of management agents to connect to remote management servers and their associated services. For instance, target machines and\/or other nodes may desire to register or connect to configuration management services, performance monitoring services, security services, authentication services, and\/or other remotely hosted network management services or resources, and each type of service may require a different or distinct type of local management agent or daemon to be installed on the target machine to install or run those desired services. In embodiments in certain regards, a central registration server according to the present teachings can invoke or access a registration tool and\/or other logic to probe the manage network to discover the identity of the constituent target machines and\/or other nodes, and determine the necessary management software component type required or compatible with each detected machine. The registration tool can also interrogate individual target machines to develop an inventory of resources hosted or present on that machine, such as hardware, software, communications, and\/or other resources. The result profile including target identifier, management software component type, inventory of resources, and other data can be stored to a registration store. In embodiments, the registration tool and\/or other logic can generate a link, association, channel, or other connection to a stored set of the corresponding management agents, for instance to permit target machines to automatically download those agents, independently of any package management platforms associated with the target, its operating system, and\/or other configuration details. Once one or more management agents are installed in a given target, that target can invoke remote management services over the network, and perform updates related to those services as desired.","Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the present teachings, which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Where possible the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","110","102","110","102","104","112","110","102","120","110"]},"Managed network  can include or host a set of resources including a set of targets , and\/or other nodes, machines, or resources. In embodiments, set of targets , and\/or other nodes or resources of managed network  can be or include virtual machines, as well as hardware-based or hardware-implemented machines. In embodiments, set of targets  and\/or other resources of managed network  can be or include resources instantiated from or based on cloud-based networks. Set of targets  can be or include, for example, server machines, client machines, portable computing devices, wireless communication devices, and\/or other clients, machines, or devices.","More particularly, and as shown in , registration tool  hosted in registration server  can generate a registration probe  to transmit to one, some, or all of the target machines in set of target machines  in managed network . In aspects, registration probe  and\/or the targets to which registration probe  is transmitted can be automatically generated by registration tool , for instance using network pings or \u201cnmap port\u201d scans or commands, as understood by persons skilled in the art. In embodiments, targets or networks can be entered manually by a user of registration tool . In aspects, registration probe  can initially attempt to identify targets and\/or other nodes in managed network , for instance to generate a list or map of machines and\/or nodes present in managed network . In embodiments, the initial detection or scan of targets can determine a management software component type required by or compatible with each target, for instance, based on the operating system installed on each target, if detected.","In aspects, after identification of each target or at other times, registration tool  can transmit or update the same or an additional registration probe  to gain entry into each target system being registered to registration database . In aspects, registration probe  can attempt to present security credentials or use security mechanisms to log into or otherwise gain access to one or more targets in set of target machines , such as presenting common passwords\/credentials for each system, invoking kerberized secure shell (SSH) service, SSH authorized keys, invoking Windows\u2122 trusted domains, or presenting known username\/passwords, depending on the type of target or platform.","As shown for instance in , once access is established, registration tool  can collect information regarding the inventory of resources installed or present in each subject target in set of target machines . In embodiments, registration probe  or further or updated interrogation exchanges between a given target in set of targets  and registration tool can provide an identification of hardware, software, communications, and\/or other resources present in the target. In embodiments, for example, systems such as \u201c\/proc\u201d or \u201cHAL\u201d under the Linux\u2122 operating system, or systems or commands such as those used with a \u201cWMI\u201d interface under the Windows\u2122 family of operating systems, can be used to interrogate the subject target or targets regarding installed resources. In embodiments as shown, resource inventory data  can be returned to registration server  indicating the resources hosted or installed on a subject target. In embodiments as likewise shown, registration tool  can receive that information and associate a target identifier, management software component type, resource inventory data , and\/or other data for storage and registration in a target registration file  hosted in registration database. In aspects, the entry for a given target can include an identifier such as an internet Protocol (IP) address, one or more management software component type, an inventory including installed applications, hardware, communications resources such as ports and service levels, and\/or other resources. In embodiments, target registration file  can include links, addresses, or other mappings or identifiers to one or more management agent repository  that can contain one or more management agent  corresponding to one or more management software component type.","In aspects, registration tool  and\/or other logic can initiate the transmission and\/or installation of one or more management agent  to a given target in set of target machines , based on the requirements of management software component type, any installed applications, and\/or other resources. In embodiments, one or more management agent  can be pushed to a target at time of registration or at other times, using transmission techniques compatible with the types of agents involved. For instance, for transmission to a Linux\u2122 target, an \u201cscp\u201d command to perform or invoke a Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) or \u201cdeb\u201d process can be used, or a tarball can be unzipped, as understood by persons skilled in the art. For instance, for transmission to a target running the Windows\u2122 family of operating systems, an \u201cexe\u201d file can be executed or a Windows Installer (MSI) process can be run, as understood by persons skilled in the art. For instance, for transmission to a target running the Unix\u2122 operating system, a \u201cpkg\u201d command can be run, or a tarball can be unzipped, as understood by persons skilled in the art. A target can thereby receive and install a compatible management agent , and invoke, install, and\/or update services and\/or applications hosted by set of management servers , such as configuration management services, performance monitoring services, security services, and\/or other network management or configuration services hosted by those servers. It may be noted that the ability to access and\/or update those services via management agent  registered and generated to a target according to techniques described herein can be independent of the need to invoke any proprietary or associated package management platforms or tools related to targets, agents, or services.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["102","10","116","112","102","124","126","130","130","124","104","124","128","110","124","120","102","102","102","102","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["402","404","120","102","406","112","110","408","120","410","104"]},"In , an authorization procedure can be invoked for some or all machines in set of target machines , as appropriate, including, for instance, exchange of user ID\/password, digital certificates, or other information. In , registration tool  can interrogate each registered target to identify a set of resources present in or installed on the subject target, including, for instance, hardware resources, software resources, communications resources, and\/or other resources. In , registration tool  can associate information including the management software component type, the set of target resources, and the target identifier for each registered target in registration database . In , the information stored in registration database  can be exposed to one or more applications in set of target machines  or otherwise via an application programming interface (API), as appropriate. In , registration tool  can generate a link or association to one or more management agent  and\/or related resources for each registered target. For instance, a link to a management agent  corresponding to an operating system class hosted in a target can be stored or associated in registration database . In aspects, registration tool  can initiate or provide selections to initiate the installation of management agent  in the subject target. In , registration tool  can perform an updated scan of set of target machines  and\/or update the stored management software component type and related data, as appropriate. In , processing can repeat, return to a prior processing point, jump to a further processing point, or end.","The foregoing description is illustrative, and variations in configuration and implementation may occur to persons skilled in the art. For example, while embodiments have been described which operate in a network incorporating one registration server  communicating with managed network , in embodiments, more than registration server  or related hosts can be used. Other resources described as singular or integrated can in embodiments be plural or distributed, and resources described as multiple or distributed can in embodiments be combined.
