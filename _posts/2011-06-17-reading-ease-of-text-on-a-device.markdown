{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Computer-based presentation of text for reading by a user may be provided in a variety of ways and for a variety of purposes. For example, enterprise-based documents, contracts, technical specifications, etc. are often presented on a computer monitor, where the user may view large sections of the document at a time, may provide edits, and\/or adjust presentation parameters of the displayed text. As another example, e-readers are typically designed to present books (e.g., novels, text-books), newspapers, and magazines to the user in a format that the user may be used to when reading these items in paper form. As another example, handheld device and smart phones are also used to view text, which may range from enterprise-based documents, to books, and online pages. In this example, the smaller portable device may provide certain limitations when attempting to read text (e.g., text size, amount on screen, etc.).","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Reading text can be a complex process that is different for respective users (readers), involving a variety of factors that may influence reading performance and\/or reading ease. As an example, two different users of the same text on a same device may have different reading experiences, where one is able to read faster and\/or comprehend more, than the other based on how the text is presented. Display devices often enable a great deal of flexibility in how the text is displayed. For example, a creator of the text and\/or the user (e.g., or some other party) may select a font size, margin size, line spacing, etc. to accommodate a desired reading ease. These choices may serve to set a style and\/or mood of the text, and may affect an \u201cease\u201d with which the text can be read by the user.","As an example, when consuming large quantities of text (e.g., when reading a book), it may be assumed by most reading applications that the user should select parameters to optimize reading ease. However, users typically have little way of knowing what they may actually find most comfortable, for example. There can be a trade-off between text size and a number of words that are displayed on a page, for example, without needing to advance to a next page. Further, as an example, smaller text may be less readable on a per-word basis but may increase overall reading speed by reducing a time and cognitive load of paging.","Additionally, typical reading applications (e.g., or devices) merely provide one or a few options that are user-adjustable; and a fully flexible system, which may include many tunable parameters is likely to overwhelm most users. Previously, solutions to improving reading ease may have either relied on the content creators to set the display parameters (e.g., typically based on traditional practices from the print world), or may have left it up to the end-user to make desired adjustments.","Accordingly, one or more techniques and\/or systems are disclosed that provide a solution to the problem of choosing these factors, for example, by automatically providing desired display parameters that may be used to adjust the displayed text to improve reading ease, such as reading speed, for a user. Information about how a user typically interacts with text (e.g., user reading characteristics) can be identified, as well as typical display characteristics of a device (e.g., or device type, or a plurality of devices), and used to create a reading model. The reading model may be able to identify desired display parameters for a particular device (e.g., or general device group(s)), for a particular user, which can be used to adjust the display of the text to improve reading ease (e.g., reading speed and\/or reading comprehension).","In one embodiment of improving reading ease of text displayed by a device, reading-related feedback can be received for a user of the device, and one or more display-related characteristics can be received for the device. The reading related feedback may indicate how fast the user reads the text and\/or how much the user comprehends the displayed text. Further, a reading model can be created, based at least in part upon the reading-related feedback and the one or more display-related characteristics, where the reading model may indicate desired display parameters for displaying the text on the device. Additionally, reading ease of the text displayed by the device for the user can be improved by applying the reading model.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","It will be appreciated that the term \u201ctext\u201d is not intended to limit the techniques or systems described herein to any particular embodiment. The terms \u201ctext\u201d can comprise a character, characters, a number, numbers, a symbol, symbols, and\/or other articles that may be displayed on a display coupled with or part of a device. In the techniques and\/or systems described herein, the respective characters, numbers, symbols, and other articles displayed may be expressed as \u201ctext\u201d or \u201ctexts,\u201d but are not merely limited to traditional notions of text.","Accordingly, as provided herein, a method may be devised that provides for identifying and improving reading ease of text on device displays (e.g., electronic devices, such as smart phones, e-readers, monitors, etc.). A user's ease of reading text on a display, which may comprise reading speed and\/or reading comprehension, may be deduced from user interactions with the device and\/or text while reading. Other reading-related characteristics (e.g., characteristics that may affect reading ease) can be identified, and a reading model can be created and used to identify desired display parameters for a particular display of text. In this way, for example, the reading ease of the user may be improved by applying the desired display parameters to the device. It may be appreciated that reading ease and\/or the like as used herein is meant to have a broad interpretation. For example, reading ease may be related to performance at least in that something that is easier to read may allow a user to perform better (e.g., read faster, have increased comprehension, etc.). Reading ease may similarly be related to how enjoyable, comfortable, effortless, etc. something is for a user to read.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","110","112"]},"In one aspect, one or more users can provide reading-related feedback for one or more different devices. In one embodiment, one or more users can provide reading-related feedback for an individual device, a plurality of devices of a same device-type (e.g., e-readers) as that of the device, and\/or a plurality of different devices of different device types (e.g., smart phones, e-readers, laptops, computer monitors, television monitors, (hard copy) print out, etc.). The reading-related feedback can indicate a reading ease for the user of the device (e.g., or device-type, or generally), for example. The reading ease may comprise indications of how fast the user can read the text (reading speed) and\/or how much information the user understands\/recalls from the text (reading comprehension). That is, for example, a faster reading speed and\/or an increased reading comprehension, can indicate an improved reading ease.","It will be appreciated that an increase in reading speed may not always indicate improved reading ease. For example, where reading comprehension may be a more desired factor, the user may need to decrease their reading speed in order to improve their reading comprehension. Either way, in one embodiment, an improvement in reading ease may be indicated by an improvement in reading speed and\/or reading comprehension, which may be achieved by utilizing the reading model to adjust display characteristics for the text on the display.","In one embodiment, the reading-related feedback may comprise user (e.g., or users) actions and\/or user input when reading text on a display of the device (e.g., or a plurality of the same or different types of devices). For example, when reading text on a display the user typically scrolls down the page when they get to an end of displayed text, or may switch to (e.g., turn to) a next page. In this example, the indication of scrolling and\/or switching may provide an indication of reading speed. As another example, a user's action may be observed, such as by an eye movement detector (e.g., camera built into the device\/display), that can observe the user's actions, such as how their eyes move across a page, and\/or on which words they are focused. The user's actions may help indicate a reading speed and\/or a reading comprehension (e.g., user looking back at previous text to find words).","As another example, the user (e.g., or users) may input information as reading-related feedback that provides an indication of reading speed and\/or reading comprehension. For example, a user may input a beginning and end time for reading the text, which can indicate a reading speed. Further, for example, the user may be asked a series of questions related to the content of the text to test for reading comprehension. As an illustrative example, students using a device to display text related to a subject may be asked to take a quiz after reading the text to determine reading comprehension (e.g., test results, test performance, etc.).","Display-related characteristics for a device can comprise things that affect how the user views text being displayed by the device, for example. In one embodiment, the display may comprise alterable and\/or unalterable display characteristics. For example, a display's brightness, text font size, text spacing, kerning, text font type, text color, line spacing, margins, and\/or other characteristics may (e.g., or may not) be alterable by the user and\/or by the device (e.g., as default settings). Further, as an example, a display's pixel density, screen size and resolution, brightness capability, color fidelity, and or other characteristics may not (e.g., or may) be able to be altered. In one embodiment, one or more of these characteristics may comprise or rather be comprised by the phrase display-related characteristics and\/or the like, for example, which may affect reading ease for the user.","Additionally, in one embodiment, display-related characteristics for a device may (also or alternatively) comprise information about the text and\/or information about a current viewing page of the text. For example, information about the text can comprise subject matter, date of publication, certain statistics, such as vocabulary difficulty (e.g., using a vocabulary histogram), average sentence length, word length, sentence structure and\/or other information. As another example, information about the current viewing page can comprise a number of words on the page, number of paragraphs, and other statistics about the page makeup. In one embodiment, one or more of these text and\/or page characteristics may comprise or rather be comprised by the phrase display-related characteristics and\/or the like, for example, which can also affect reading ease for the user. It may be appreciated that such features, characteristics, etc. related to content (e.g., sentence length, sentence structure, etc.) are intended to be comprised by the terms display-related characteristics (for a device) and\/or the like as used herein at least for purposes of simplicity. That is, although it may be more conventional to refer to merely brightness, contrast, sharpness, etc. as display-related characteristics for a device, other features, attributes, aspects, etc. (e.g., vocabulary terms) related to the subject matter, content, text, etc. that is being displayed (and less related to the characteristics, settings, etc. of the device upon which it is displayed) are nevertheless intended to be comprised within the verbiage display-related characteristics for a device and\/or the like as used herein to, among other things, have nomenclature that can be used\/referenced to encompass any one or more of these items that can affect reading ease, for example. Thus, even though such usage may be expansive and\/or less conventional, such a broad interpretation is nevertheless intended herein, at least for purposes of explanation, conciseness in discussion, etc.","In one embodiment, creating a reading model can comprise using machine learning to train a classifier, such as by training the classifier over reading-related characteristics, resulting in model that may predict a desired reading ease metric, for example. In another embodiment, a statistical model may be created using the reading-related characteristics. In this embodiment, for example, the statistical model may be used to predict desired characteristics for improving the reading ease (e.g., based on averages, standard curves, or other statistical measures). It will be appreciated that the reading model (e.g., creation thereof) is not limited to any particular embodiment, merely that the model utilize the reading-related feedback and display-related characteristics to help identify reading ease characteristics, for example, which may be used to improve reading ease for a user of the device.","As an illustrative example, the reading model can be used to identify desired characteristics (e.g., optimized for reading ease) for the particular user of the device, for a group of users of the same device-type, and\/or for a group of users of a plurality of device types (e.g., a general model). In this example, the desired characteristics may comprise ways to display the text on the device, such as a particular brightness level, contrast level, font type, font size, font color, line spacing, character spacing, words per line, words per page, background color, etc. Further, the desired characteristics may be applied to the display of the text on the device, for example, such that the reading ease for the user is improved (e.g., as compared to other manners of displaying the text, such as over the standard display version of the text). That is, for example, the displayed text can be optimized for the user (e.g., or group of users) based on their how they read text, and on how the device displays text (e.g., each device displays text differently).","As an illustrative example,  illustrates an example embodiment  of different devices displaying a same text. In the example embodiment , a smart phone , an e-reader , and a computer monitor , respectively display a portion of text  on their display. In this example embodiment , the displayed text  comprises a passage, the entirety of which can be displayed by the monitor , but merely a portion of which can be displayed, respectively, by the e-reader  and smart phone . Further, in this example , the text  comprises a same font type, size, spacing, etc. when displayed on the respective devices , , .","As an example, each display may have advantages and disadvantages for reading the text . For example, the monitor  may be able to display more text, but the text is may be difficult to read, for some users, due to the type, size and spacing. As another example, the text on the smart phone may be easier to read, even though it comprises the same display characteristics, but continual reading of the passage can become more difficult due to the small number of words, and arrangement of words, on the display.","In one embodiment, the display characteristics of the respective devices , , , along with the reading-related feedback of the user of the device (e.g., how they interact with the text), may be used by the reading model to identify desired display characteristics for the device that can improve the reading ease for the user. In this example, the desired characteristics can be applied to adjust how the text  is displayed, such that the respective devices , ,  comprise different ways to display the text  to improve reading ease for the user (e.g., improving reading speed, and\/or reading comprehension). For example, the size of the text may be reduced for the smart phone , while the spacing between words may be increased for the e-reader  and\/or the monitor .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302"]},"In one embodiment, the reading-related characteristics may pertain to user and device characteristics  that may be received for one or more users of the device (e.g., multiple users of the same device), comprising reading-related feedback for the user(s) of the device and display related characteristics for the device. In one embodiment, reading related feedback for one or more users of the device may be identified by a training service (e.g., installed locally on the device and\/or residing remotely from the device), for example, which may present \u201ctraining text\u201d with which the user(s) may interact (e.g., read, scroll, switch pages, etc.). In this embodiment, the user(s) can interact with the \u201ctraining text,\u201d for example, and the training service can collect interaction feedback for the respective one or more users of the device.","In another embodiment, the reading-related characteristics may pertain to characteristics for a particular device type  that may be received for one or more users of a set of devices comprising a device type (e.g., smart phones), of which the device is member (e.g., the device is a smart phone). In this embodiment, the reading-related characteristics may comprise reading-related feedback for the user(s) and\/or display-related characteristics for the devices in the device-type set. For example, in order to create a device-type reading model (e.g., one that can be applied to respective devices that are members of the device-type set), reading-related characteristics may be used for a plurality of users and a plurality of devices from the device-type set (e.g., smart phone). In this way, for example, a larger sampling of data may be identified for use in creating the device-type reading model.","In another embodiment, the reading-related characteristics may pertain to characteristics for different device types  that may be received for one or more users of one or more different devices types (e.g., smart phones, e-readers, handheld devices, laptops, and\/or computer monitors). In this embodiment, the reading-related characteristics  may comprise reading-related feedback for the user(s) of the device(s) and\/or display-related characteristics for the device(s) in different device-type sets. For example, a first general reading model may be developed for a first type of device, a second general reading model may be developed for a second type of device, etc., where the first model may be applied to a device that is of the first type, the second model may be applied to a device that is of the second type, etc. In this example, reading-related characteristics may be collected from a plurality of users and a plurality of device types, and applied to create the general reading models.","At  in the example embodiment , a reading metric can be determined, for example, using one or more of the reading-related characteristics. As an example, a simple, apparent reading speed may comprise a reading metric that identifies reading ease. That is, for example, a faster reading speed may indicate a more desirable reading ease than a slower reading speed. As another example, a reading comprehension measurement may comprise a reading metric that identifies reading ease. For example, an increased reading comprehension may indicate a more desired reading ease metric. As another example, a combination of reading speed and reading comprehension may comprise the reading metric that identifies reading ease. In this example, a faster reading speed and\/or an increased reading comprehension may indicate a desired reading ease metric.","At , the reading model can be created. In one embodiment, creating a reading model can comprise combining one or more sets of characteristics that affect reading of the text on the device to create a set of desired characteristics for displaying the text on the device.

In another embodiment, creating a reading model can comprise combining one or more sets of characteristics that affect a user reading comprehension of the text on the device to create a set of desired user comprehension characteristics for displaying the text on the device.","As an example, a statistical model (e.g., or trained classifier) may be identified using one or more of the sets of reading-related characteristics (e.g., from one device, a device-type, and\/or a plurality of device types). In this example, the user reading speed characteristics that provide a desired reading speed and\/or the user reading comprehension characteristics that provide a desired comprehension level can be identified by the statistical model. Further, these identified, desired reading-related characteristics may be applied to the text displayed on the device, to provide a desired reading ease improvement for the user.","In one embodiment, the created reading model may comprise a device reading model . For example, the reading model may be created merely for the device and\/or merely for the user of the device. In another embodiment, the created reading model may comprise a device-type reading model .
