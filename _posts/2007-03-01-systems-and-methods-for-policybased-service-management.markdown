title: Systems and methods for policy-based service management
abstract: Systems and method for policy-based service management are provided. An exemplary system includes a rule definition interface module configured to receive a plurality of rule definitions and a separate policy management interface module configured to allow a user to define a rule instance from an existing rule definition instance and to define a policy instance based on the defined rule instance. A policy may be simply expressed via the policy management interface as “perform the following set of action if all of the following rule instances are true unless any of the following rule instances are true.” Additionally, policies may be associated with a context at a specific a level in a context hierarchy having multiple levels. The policy may therefore inherit rules from contexts at a higher level in the hierarchy.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","1. Separation of Rule Definition from Policy Creation","2. Generic Simple Policy Expression Method","3. Policy Interface Extensibility Methods","4. Policy Interface Automatic Synchronization Method","5. Conclusion"],"p":["This application relates generally to network-based service management.","Subscribers use networks to access applications and resources such as voice, video, gaming, and conferencing from their communication devices such as phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), laptop, and desktop computers. Providers of these applications and resources utilize policies to determine whether a subscriber is authorized to access the requested service or application.","Because of the complexity of creating policies in current rule-based approaches, many of these current rule-based systems limit a service provider to a simple yes or no answer when access to a specific application or resource is attempted. The ability to specify additional actions or parameters associated with an access attempt is limited or non-existent in these systems.","Furthermore, rule definition is tied directly to policy creation. For example, in these systems, a rule engine is used to define and enact subscriber policies. Typical rule engines have a rule definition interface that allows rules to be defined as predicate statements such as \u201cIf condition then action\u201d or as decision trees that use a flow-chart format. However, to define a policy based on conditions, a rule engine-based interface requires that each step be defined in a step-by-step fashion. As conditions and path variations increase, the complexity and difficulty of entering policies increases. In addition, when rules change in a rule-engine, applications interacting with the rule engine may need code changes or end-user interaction (e.g., in the form of application restarts), in order to update the applications. Furthermore, current rule engines do not allow for the extension of existing rule definitions to new rule instances. Instead, new rule flows must be created for each rule instance.","What is therefore needed are systems and methods which separate rule definition from policy definition.","What is further needed is a simple, extensible method for expressing policies, particularly at a subscriber-level basis.","The present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, like reference numbers can indicate identical or functionally similar elements. Additionally, the left-most digit(s) of a reference number may identify the drawing in which the reference number first appears.","The policy-based approaches to service management described herein allow providers to offer personalized and tiered services to subscribers. Policies define network and application behaviors which may be based on the individual characteristics and\/or entitlements of a subscriber. A policy may be associated with a context such as subscriber, a provider, or an individual resource. For example, policies may define access to applications based on criteria such as subscription levels, age, location; may define the quality of service such as bandwidth, jitter, and delay based on subscription and application requirements; may specify charges based on network access, quality of service, application access, special offers; and\/or may specify security based on criteria such as authentication strength and risk assessment.","1.1 Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","192","194","192","102","194"]},"A policy defines, for example, whether a subscriber can access a specific network, application, service, or other resource, the level of access to be provided to a subscriber, the quality of service to be provided, and\/or other network or service parameters or behaviors. For ease of description, content (e.g., video, audio, or multi-media), services, applications, or other network hardware and\/or software resources are referred to herein as a \u201cresource.\u201d A policy includes a set of actions (e.g., allow access, provide high QOS, etc.) and a set of rule instances for determining whether the set of actions should be performed. A rule instance contains one or more conditions. For example, a rule definition may be \u201callow access on a weekday.\u201d The condition is therefore that the day must be a weekday.","In conventional rule-based service management systems, policies are hard-coded into program logic prior to deployment of the logic in the network. Policy decision domain  of , in contrast, allows for the creation and modification of policies after deployment.","Policy decision domain  includes a rule definition interface module , a rule repository , and a policy management interface subsystem . Rule definition interface module  interfaces with rule engine  and is configured to allow a user such as a system administrator to create rule definitions. A rule definition is a template for a rule. The rule definition includes one or more conditions. A condition may include an element, a comparator, and a variable. A rule variable is a placeholder for a value which is entered by a user when defining a policy instance. For example, in the rule condition: subscriber age is greater than AGE, the condition element is \u201csubscriber age\u201d, the comparator is \u201cgreater than\u201d and the variable is \u201cAGE.\u201d","Rule repository  stores the rule definitions. Rule repository  may be any type of data storage including, but not limited to, a database.","The policy management interface subsystem  is separate from the rule definition interface module . Policy management interface subsystem  includes policy decision interface module , data repository , and policy management interface module .","Policy management interface module  is configured to allow a user to create instances of rules and to define policies by applying one or more rule instances. In an embodiment, policy management interface module  includes a graphical user interface (GUI). In addition or alternatively, policy management interface module  includes an application programming interface (API). For example, an instance of a rule includes a set of values to be applied to a variable in a rule condition for a specific policy. For example, an instance of the rule defined as \u201callow access on a weekday\u201d is \u201callow access on Tuesday.\u201d In an embodiment, policy management interface module  uses a generic simple policy expression method to define policies. The generic simple policy expression method is described in further detail in section 2 below.","In current rule-based systems, rule instances are created and values are specified at the same time the rule is defined. In contrast, in the system of , policy creation is separated from rule definition allowing a user to create new policies from existing rule definitions without the need to access rule engine  directly.","Data repository  is configured to store the defined policies and data upon which the defined rules operate. Data repository  may be any type of data storage including, but not limited to, a database.","Policy decision interface module  includes rule engine . Rule engine  is configured to enact subscriber policies based on configurable logic statements and other data. Policy decision interface module  receives a request for a service management decision and interacts with rule repository , data repository , and optionally network control system  to obtain information necessary to make the requested decision.","As would be appreciated by persons of skill in the art, the components of policy decision domain  do not have to be implemented in separate devices. A portion or all of the components may be implemented in the same device.","Policy enforcement domain  may include one or more subscriber devices , network systems , one or more servers , and one or more network control systems . Subscriber devices  access the network or network resources via network systems . Network systems  may be any type of communication network including a wireless network, a public data network such as the Internet, a private data network, and\/or the public switched telephone network. The interface between subscriber devices may be a wireless interface or a wired interface ","Server  may include one or more resources (e.g., subscriber applications ). Server  is also configured to mediate access by a subscriber or subscriber device to the network and\/or one or more resources. Server  communicates with policy decision interface module  to request a service management decision when a subscriber attempts access to the network or a network resource.","Network control system  is configured to store information associated with subscribers. In an embodiment, network control system  includes a session storage facility.","1.2 Method for Defining Policy Instances at Run-Time",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 200"],"b":["200","200"]},"Prior to step , one or more rule definitions are created in rule engine  using rule definition interface module . In an embodiment, the rule definitions are templates in which variables may be used to indicate that a value substitution will be required by the policy decision interface module  and a value specification will be required from policy management interface module . These rule definitions are stored in rule repository  and made available to policy management interface module .","In addition, prior to step , policy management interface module  presents the user with a graphical user interface including a mechanism for creating a new policy instance.","In step , policy management interface module  receives a request to create a policy instance or modify an existing policy instance. In response to the request, the policy management interface module  presents the user with a graphical user interface including a set of existing rule definitions and optionally a set of predefined actions.","In step , the user of the policy management interface subsystem  associates the policy instance with a context. Examples of contexts include, but are not limited to, content stream (service\/application provided by the network), service package (grouping of services\/applications) or subscriber. For example, a policy instance may be created for a subscriber when the subscriber registers for a service or application. Note that step  may occur at any point during flowchart .","In step , a selection of an existing rule definition from the set of rule definitions is received. In response to the selection, the policy management interface module  displays the rule definition in the graphical user interface. If the rule definition includes a variable, a set of possible values for the variable is also displayed in the graphical user interface. In an embodiment, the set of possible values is predefined by a user.","In step , an instance of the rule and condition values associated with the rule instance are received. The condition values are selected from a set of values for the variables. As described above, the set of values may be predefined by a user. For example, the user of the policy management interface subsystem  may create an instance of the subscriber age rule (e.g., subscriber must be older than \u201cVARIABLE\u201d) and associate a value of 21 with the rule variable.","In step , a determination is made whether any additional rule instances are to be created. For example, the user may activate a link, button, or similar mechanism to indicate to policy management interface module  that an additional rule instance is to be associated with the policy instance. If an additional rule instance is to be created, operation returns to step . If no additional rule instances are to be created, operation proceeds to step .","In step , one or more actions are received and associated with the policy instance. This step is optional. An action may include any action that an entity requesting a policy-based service management decision can take. Exemplary actions include provide access, provide a certain QOS, or route the subscriber to a specific web page or application. Note that step  may occur at any point during flowchart .","1.3 Method for Enforcing Policies",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 300"],"b":["300","300"]},"In step , a request for access to the network or a network resource is received from a subscriber device  at a policy enforcement entity (e.g., server ). Additionally or alternatively, a subscriber may request access to a specific resource. For example, a user may turn-on a mobile or data device or attempt access to a network. As a function of activating the device or requesting access to the network, a listing of the applications or services available (e.g., streaming content) for the subscriber may be requested.","In step , a network entity (e.g., server ) transmits a service management request to the policy decision interface module . In an embodiment, the service management request identifies the subscriber and\/or subscriber device  and the network or resource for which access is requested. The request may also include additional information about the subscriber, the subscriber device, and\/or the resource requested.","In step , the policy decision interface module  interfaces with the rule repository , the data repository , and optionally the network control system  to obtain information necessary to make the requested service management decision. In an embodiment, policy decision interface module  may access the rule repository  to obtain one or more rule definitions associated with a request. Alternatively, a set of rule definitions may be received beforehand (e.g., at the start of the day or at periodic intervals) and cached at the policy decision interface module . In an additional alternative, the policy decision interface module  may obtain a first group of rule definitions from the rule repository  when a request is received (e.g., if rule is based on subscriber age) and may download and cache a second group of rule definitions in advance (e.g., if rule is based on day of week).","In step , rule engine  determines that a value substitution is required for one or more variables in a rule definition and indicates the required value substitution(s) to the policy decision interface module .","In step , the policy decision interface module  provides the values to rule engine . In an embodiment, the policy decision interface module  accesses data repository  to obtain the values to be applied to the variable in the rule instance. For example, the values may be specified in the rule instances found in the policy instance being evaluated.","In step , the values are substituted in real-time for the variables in the rule definition and a determination is made whether the action(s) defined in the policy are allowed.","In step , the decision is transmitted to the requesting entity. The decision may direct the entity to perform a set of actions specified in the policy such as whether requested access is authorized, the level of service to provide to the subscriber or other service parameters, and\/or additional actions to take prior to providing access to the resource (e.g., routing subscriber to another web page for entry of additional information). Alternatively, the decision may direct the entity to deny access to the subscriber.","The generic simple policy expression method provides a mechanism for defining policy instances, which is simpler to understand and configure than policy and rule expressions defined via a typical rule definition interface. As discussed above, a rule-engine-based interface requires that each step be defined in a step-by-step fashion. This definition technique becomes complex and convoluted for a user when many conditions and many path variations exist.","The following is an example of a policy instance defined using a typical rule-engine-based definition technique.
