{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This disclosure generally relates to presenting search results organized in hierarchies.","Certain types of electronic devices, especially mobile or handheld devices such as mobile or smart telephones and notebook or netbook computers, have relatively small displays due to the relatively small sizes of the devices themselves. Consequently, not much information can be presented within such a small display area concurrently. There are different designs that help organize and display multiple information items within a relatively small display area. For example, a large set of information items may be divided into multiple subsets, each containing a small number of information items. Each subset of information items is displayed on a different screen, and a user may page through multiple screens to review multiple subsets of information items.","This disclosure generally relates to presenting information items organized in hierarchies.","In particular embodiments, identify a set of search results in response to a search query; display the set of search results; receive a user interaction in connection with a first search result from the set of search results; and in response to the user interaction, if the first search result is associated with one or more first information items, then expand the first search result, comprising display the one or more first information items associated with the first search result.","These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure are described in more detail below in the detailed description and in conjunction with the following figures.","This disclosure is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of this disclosure. However, this disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps and\/or structures have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure this disclosure. In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the disclosure to the described embodiments. To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.","In particular embodiments, information items organized in a hierarchy are displayed on a mobile device. When a user interacts with (e.g., selects or clicks on) a specific information item, that information item is expanded so that its child nodes or elements are displayed. The user does not need to page through multiple screens. When an information item is expanded, its children are displayed on the same screen where the information item itself is displayed.  illustrates an example method for presenting information items organized in a hierarchy (e.g., on mobile devices).","Any number (i.e., two or more) of information items may be organized into a hierarchy, which may indicate various relationships between the individual information items. As an example,  illustrates a portion of a hierarchy. In this case, each node may correspond to a specific information item. There may be any number of levels in a hierarchy, and any number of nodes at each level. Each node, except the root node, has a parent node. Thus, each information item, except the one corresponding to the root node, has a parent information item. Each node, except the leaf nodes, may have any number of children. Thus, each information item, except the ones corresponding to the leaf nodes, may have any number of child information items. In addition, when two nodes share the same parent, they are considered siblings of each other. In , with respect to node , node  is its parent, nodes  and  are its siblings, and nodes , , and  are its children. Note that any portion of a large hierarchy is itself a hierarchy.","There may be various types of information items, and this disclosure contemplates any applicable type of information items. For example and without limitation, an information item may be an email, a message, a notification, a post, a web page, a clickable link, an icon, a news story, a search result, an action, a user, an image, a video, a telephone number, an address, and so on. A hierarchy may consist of a collection of information items all of the same type (e.g., a hierarchy of emails, a hierarchy of notifications, a hierarchy of contact information) or a combination of information items of different types (e.g., a hierarchy of emails, messages, news stories, and notifications).","To present a hierarchy of information items on a mobile device (e.g., a mobile or smart telephone or a netbook or notebook computer), particular embodiments may display a list of information items, as illustrated in STEP . It is not necessary that the presentation always starts with the root of the hierarchy, although it can. When applicable, the presentation may start at any level in the hierarchy. For example, the list of information items may be a set of siblings that shares a common parent (e.g., nodes , , and ) at a specific level in the hierarchy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["311","312","313","314","311","312","313","314"]},"Suppose that a user interacts with one of the information items (e.g., information item ) by, for example, clicking or tapping on it, as illustrated in STEP . Mobile devices provide various methods that enable their users to provide inputs to the devices. For example, some mobile devices incorporate touch-sensitive screens so that their users may provide inputs by touching the screens with their fingers or styluses. Other mobile devices incorporate keys or trackballs, which may be used to provide user inputs. This disclosure contemplates any applicable means to provide user inputs to mobile devices.","Depending on the nature, type, or current state of information item  as well as its siblings, the user interaction may result in several different responses.","First, if information item  has any child (i.e., corresponds to a non-leaf node) and is currently in collapsed form, then information item  may be expanded so that its children may be displayed. In some implementations, among a set of siblings that shares a common parent, only one sibling can be expanded at a time. In this case, if any sibling of information item  is currently in expanded form, that sibling is automatically collapsed, as illustrated in STEP . Alternatively, in other implementations, among a set of siblings that shares a common parent, any number of siblings may be expanded at the same time. In this case, there is no need to collapse any sibling of information item , even if the sibling is currently in expanded form, and STEP  is not performed. Alternatively, in yet other implementations, given a set of information items at the same level of the hierarchy, only one information item can be expanded at a time, regardless of whether or not these information items are siblings and share a common parent. In this case, if any information item at the same level of the hierarchy as information item  is currently in expanded form, that information item is automatically collapsed.","Information item  is expanded and each of its children is displayed, as illustrated in STEP .  illustrates an example presentation where information item  has been expanded and its children, information items , , , . . . , are displayed. The children of information item  are displayed (i.e., inserted) between information item  and information item , which immediately follows information item  in . To make room for the children of information item , those information items that follow information item , including information items  and , are pushed further down the display. Again, in particular embodiments, when the hierarchy of information items (e.g., information items , , , , , , , . . . ) is displayed on a screen of a client device (e.g., a mobile device), the information items may consume approximately the entire width of the display screen. Similarly, when the hierarchy of information items is displayed within a designated area on a screen of a client device (e.g., a mobile device), the information items may consume approximately the entire width of the designated area of the display screen.","The following example pseudo code illustrates expanding an information item and displaying its children. This example assumes that among a set of siblings sharing a common parent, only one sibling (i.e., one information item) can be expanded at a time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\/\/ performed upon expanding an information item"]},{"entry":[{},"on expand:"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\/\/ collapse all siblings of the information item"]},{"entry":[{},"for each sibling:"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"sibling.collapse( )"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\/\/ display all children of the information item"]},{"entry":[{},"for each child:"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"child.show( )"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\/\/ indicates whether an information item should"]},{"entry":[{},"\/\/ display itself and its children"]},{"entry":[{},"if (parent is expanded)"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"return TRUE;"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"else"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"return FALSE;"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"In particular embodiments, an icon is associated with each information item, which indicates whether it is currently in the expanded or collapsed form. For example, in , information item  is currently in the expanded form. Icon  is associated with information item . The user may click on icon  to collapse information item . On the other hand, information item  is currently in the collapsed form. Icon  is associated with information item . The user may click on icon  to expand information item .","Once information item  is expanded and its children, information items , , , . . . , are displayed, the user may interact with any one of the children, similarly as the user interacting with the parent. The children form another list of information items at another level of the hierarchy, and the steps illustrated in  may be similarly applied at that level of the hierarchy.","For example, suppose that the user clicks or taps on information item , which is one of the children of information item . Depending on the nature, type, or current state of information item  as well as its siblings, the user interaction may result in several different responses. The responses are similar to those of information item . For example, if information item  has any child and is currently in collapsed form, then information item  may be expanded so that its children, information items , , . . . , may be displayed, as illustrated in STEP . Again, in some implementations, among a set of siblings sharing a common parent, only one sibling can be expanded at a time. In this case, all siblings of information items , including information item , are automatically collapsed, as illustrated in STEP  .  illustrates an example presentation where information item  is expanded, and information item , a child of information item , is also expanded.","Second, if information item  is currently in expanded form, then information item  may be collapsed, as illustrated in STEP . For example, suppose that the first time the user interacts with information item , the interaction results in information item  being expanded and its children being displayed. The second time the user interacts with information item  again, the interaction may result in information item  being collapsed. The user may thus toggle between expanding and collapsing an information item.","Third, if information item  does not have any child (i.e., information item  is a leaf node), or if a call-to-action is associated with information item , an action associated with information item  may be performed, as illustrated in STEP . In particular embodiments, a leaf information item may be associated with an action. When the user interacts with such a leaf information item, the action associated with that leaf information item is performed.","Fourth, if information item  is associated with another list of information items, the new list of information items may be displayed, replacing the current list of information items, as illustrated in STEP . In particular embodiments, the other list of information items may also be a part of a hierarchy. In addition, the two lists of information items may belong to the same hierarchy or to different hierarchies. The user may thus jump between different hierarchies of information items.","In particular embodiments, an animated sequence may illustrate each transition. For example, when an information item is expanded or collapsed, the transition from one state to another may be illustrated using an animated sequence. In particular embodiments, data pre-fetching may be implemented to improve performance. For example, for each information item that is currently displayed, its children are pre-fetched into cache so that if and when the user interacts with a specific information item, its children are readily available to be displayed.","To further explain some of the steps illustrated in , consider the following examples.","First, in , suppose that information items , , , , . . . , all share a common parent and thus are siblings. Information item  has been expanded. Further suppose that the user now interacts with information item  (e.g., by clicking or tapping on it), which causes information item  to be expanded as well and its children to be displayed. In some implementations, information item  is not automatically collapsed. Thus, both information items  and  are expanded, and their respective children are displayed at the same time, as illustrated in . Alternatively, in other implementations, information item  is automatically collapsed, and only information item  is expanded and its children are displayed, as illustrated in . In either case, the children of information item , information items , , . . . , are displayed immediately below information item . Those information items that are siblings of information item  but are displayed below information item (e.g., information item ) are pushed further down to make room for the children of information item .","Second, for some types of information items, their children may be actions that users may perform in connection with the information item. As one example, an information item may be an email, and its children may include actions such as \u201cread\u201d, \u201creply\u201d, \u201cforward\u201d, and \u201cdelete\u201d. By expanding the email, the children that are actions that a user may perform in connection with the email may be displayed, and the user may interact with any one of the children to perform the corresponding action. As another example, an information item may be an invitation, and its children may include actions such as \u201caccept\u201d, \u201cdecline\u201d, \u201ctentative\u201d, and \u201cRSVP\u201d. Again, by expanding the invitation, the children that are actions that a user may perform in connection with the invitation may be displayed, and the user may interact with any one of the children to perform the corresponding action. As a third example, an information item may be a person's name, and its children may be information about the person, such as his or her email address, telephone number, mailing address, etc. By expanding the person, the person's information may be displayed. The user may interact with a child to perform an action in connection with the person. For example, by interacting with the person's email address, the user may compose and send an email to the person; and by interacting with the person's telephone number, a call may be initiated to the person's telephone or the user may compose and send a text message to the person's telephone.","Third, some types of information items may be linked to other hierarchies of information items or other objects. As one example, an information item may be a link to a web page. When the user interacts with the link, the web page itself may be displayed, replacing all the currently displayed information items. As another example, an information item may be a news feed, which includes a collection of news stories arranged in another hierarchy. Expanding the news feed may cause the collection of news stories to be displayed, replacing all the currently displayed information items. The user may thus jump from a node in one hierarchy to another hierarchy. Similarly, an information item may be an address book, which includes a collection of names, telephone numbers, addresses, etc., arranged in a hierarchy. Expanding the address book may cause a list of names to be displayed, replacing all the currently displayed information items.","In particular embodiments, the information items may reside on the mobile device where they are displayed or may be retrieved or received from remote devices (e.g., servers or databases) via suitable communications networks. In particular embodiments, the user of the mobile device may be a member of an online social network. In this case, some of the information items may be information associated with the online social networking system. A social network, in general, is a social structure made up of entities, such as individuals or organizations, that are connected by one or more types of interdependency or relationships, such as friendship, kinship, common interest, financial exchange, dislike, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge, or prestige. In more recent years, social networks have taken advantage of the Internet. There are social-networking systems existing on the Internet in the form of social-networking websites. Such social-networking websites enable their members, who are commonly referred to as website users, to perform various social activities. For example, the social-networking website operated by Facebook, Inc. at www.facebook.com enables its users to communicate with their friends via emails, instant messages, or blog postings, organize social events, share photos, receive news of their friends or interesting events, play games, etc. The user may receive messages, notifications, invitations, friend requests, etc., from other member of the online social network, and each of these may be an information item in the hierarchy.","In particular embodiments, the method of presenting a hierarchy of information items as described above may be applied to presenting a hierarchy of search results. The Internet provides a vast amount of information. The individual information items may have various formats, such as, for example and without limitation, texts, audios, videos, images, web pages, documents, executables, etc. The information items are stored at many different sites, such as on computers and servers, in databases, etc., around the world. These different sites are communicatively linked to the Internet through various network infrastructures. Any person may access the publicly available information items via a suitable network device (e.g., a computer, a smart mobile telephone, etc.) connected to the Internet.","However, due to the sheer amount of information available on the Internet, it is impractical as well as impossible for a person (e.g., a user) to manually search throughout the Internet for specific information items. Instead, most network users rely on different types of computer-implemented tools to help them locate the desired information items. One of the most commonly and widely used computer-implemented tools is a search tool or a search engine. To search for information relating to a specific subject matter or topic, a user typically provides a short phrase or a few keywords describing the subject matter, often referred to as a \u201csearch query\u201d or simply \u201cquery\u201d, to a search tool. The search tool conducts a search based on the search query using various search algorithms and generates a set of search results that are most likely to be related to the search query. The search results are then presented to the user.","Sophisticated search tools implement many other functionalities in addition to merely identifying the relevant search results as a part of the search process. For example, a search tool usually ranks the identified search results according to their relative degrees of relevance with respect to the search query, such that the search results that are relatively more relevant to the search query are ranked higher and consequently are presented to the user before the search results that are relatively less relevant to the search query.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 9"],"b":["801","900","910","920","910","920","900","900","900"]},"In particular embodiments, in response to the search query received from the user, the search tool may conduct a search using appropriate searching algorithms to identify and compile a set of search results considered relevant to the search query, as illustrated in STEP . The search results may be obtained from various informational sources, such as information stored locally on the client device used by the user, information publicly available on the Internet, and\/or information associated with a website or a system. For example, if the user is a member of a social-networking website, the search results may include information stored with or associated with the social-networking website. The search results may have various formats, such as texts, audios, videos, clickable links, executables, web feeds, etc. Search results obtained from different informational sources may be combined together to compile the set of search results. Optionally, the search results may be ranked based on various criteria, such as their relative degrees of relevance to the search query, their respective popularities, the user's personal preferences or interests, social-networking information relevant to the user, etc.","In particular embodiments, the set of search results may be presented to the user, as illustrated in STEP .  illustrates user interface  where a number of search results , , , . . . , which has been identified in response to a search query  received from the user, is displayed in output area . The user may interact with any one of the displayed search results (e.g., by clicking or tapping on it). For example, suppose that the user interacts with search result . Depending on the nature, type, or current state of search result  as well as the other search results in the set, the user interaction may result in several different responses.","First, suppose that there are additional information associated with search result . In this case, search result  may be expanded so that the additional information associated with search result  may be displayed, as illustrated in . In , a number of information items , , , , . . . , which is associated with search result , is displayed below search result . Consequently, search results , , . . . , are pushed further down to make room for information items , , , , . . . . Different search results may be associated with different information items. For example, suppose that the user has entered the word \u201cpizza\u201d for search query , and search result  is a pizza restaurant. In this case, information item  may be the address of the pizza restaurant; information item  may be customer reviews of the pizza restaurant; information item  may be a map of the pizza restaurant; and information item  may be a telephone number of the pizza restaurant. When search result  is expanded as a result of the user interacting with it, the individual information items , , , , . . . associated with search result  are displayed in close proximity to (e.g., below) search result .","The user may choose to interact with any one of information items , , , , . . . in a similar manner as interacting with search results , , , . . . . For example, the user may choose to interact with information item , which includes the customer reviews of the pizza restaurant. By clicking or tapping on information item , information item  may be expanded so that the individual customer reviews of the pizza restaurant are displayed. The user may then read each review. The user may choose to interact with information item , which is the telephone number of the pizza restaurant. Information item  may be associated with a predefined call-to-action so that when the user clicks or taps on information item , a telephone call to the pizza restaurant is initiated.","In some embodiments, only one search result in a set of search results may be expanded at a time. In this case, when the user interacts with search result , if there is any other search result in the set that is currently in expanded form, that search result is automatically collapsed so that no information item associated with that search result is displayed. Only information items , , , , . . . associated with search result  are displayed. Alternatively, in other embodiments, multiple search results in a set of search results may be expanded concurrently. In this case, when the user interacts with search result , if there is any other search result in the set that is currently in expanded form, that search result remains expanded so that information items associated with that search result, if any, are displayed as well.","In particular embodiments, an icon is displayed in connection with each search result , , , . . . as well as each information item associated with a search result (e.g., information items , , , , . . . ). The icon indicates whether the associated search result or information item is currently in expanded or collapsed form. For example, in , search result  is currently in expanded form and is associated with an icon . On the other hand, search results  and  are currently in collapsed form and are each associated with an icon . In particular embodiments, when a user interacts with icon , it causes the associated search result or information item to be collapsed. When the user interacts with icon , it causes the associated search result or information item to be expanded.","It is possible that a search result is not associated with any additional information item. In this case, when the user interacts with such a search result, the search result is not expanded because there is no information item associated with the search result to display to the user.","Second, suppose that search result  is already in expanded form when the user interacts with it. In this case, the user's interaction with search result  once again causes search result  to be collapsed so that no information item associated with search result  is displayed, as illustrated in STEP . In particular embodiments, a search result or information item may be toggled between expanded form and collapsed form when a user interacts with it. For example, the first time the user interacts with the search result or information item, it causes the search result or information item to be expanded. The second time the user interacts with the search result or information item, it causes the search result or information item to be collapsed. And so on.","Third, suppose that search result  is associated with a call-to-action. In this case, the user's interaction with search result  may cause the underlying action of the call-to-action associated with search result  to be performed, as illustrated in STEP . For example, if a call-to-action associated with search result , which may be a pizza restaurant, is making a reservation at the restaurant, then when the user interacts with search result , a reservation at the restaurant may be made on behalf of the user.","It is possible that a search result may be associated with multiple calls-to-action. Each call-to-action may be displayed in connection with the search result (e.g., as an icon), and each call-to-action has a predefined underlying action. The user may choose which call-to-action to invoke by interacting with (e.g., clicking or tapping on) the appropriate icon.","Fourth, suppose that search result  is a link to another information item (e.g., a web page). In this case, the user's interaction with search result  may cause the linked information item to be displayed, as illustrated in STEP . In some embodiments, the linked information item may be displayed in place (e.g., in situ) below search result . In this case, search result  is expanded. Search results , , . . . may be pushed further down to make room for the linked information item. This may be more suitable if the linked information item has a relatively small amount of information and can be displayed within a relatively small area. In other embodiments, the linked information item may occupy the entire screen of the client device, replacing search results , , , . . . all together. This may be more suitable if the linked information item has a relatively large amount of information and require a relatively large area to display, such as in the case of a web page.","The user may interact with any one of search results , , , . . . similarly. In some embodiments, user interface , which includes a set of search results as illustrated in , may occupy substantially the entire screen of the client device. In other embodiments, user interface  may be displayed within a specific area within the screen of the client device. When there are more search results or information items that can be fitted within the screen or the designated area within the screen of the client device, the user may scroll or page up or down so that additional search results or information items may be displayed.","Particular embodiments may be implemented on one or more computer systems.  illustrates an example computer system . The information items may be displayed on a display screen coupled to computer system . In particular embodiments, one or more computer systems  perform one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein.

In particular embodiments, software running on one or more computer systems  performs one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein or provides functionality described or illustrated herein. Particular embodiments include one or more portions of one or more computer systems .","This disclosure contemplates any suitable number of computer systems . This disclosure contemplates computer system  taking any suitable physical form. As example and not by way of limitation, computer system  may be an embedded computer system, a system-on-chip (SOC), a single-board computer system (SBC) (such as, for example, a computer-on-module (COM) or system-on-module (SOM)), a desktop computer system, a laptop or notebook computer system, an interactive kiosk, a mainframe, a mesh of computer systems, a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a server, or a combination of two or more of these.

One or more computer systems  may perform at different times or at different locations one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein, where appropriate.","In particular embodiments, computer system  includes a processor , memory , storage , an input\/output (I\/O) interface , a communication interface , and a bus . Although this disclosure describes and illustrates a particular computer system having a particular number of particular components in a particular arrangement, this disclosure contemplates any suitable computer system having any suitable number of any suitable components in any suitable arrangement.","In particular embodiments, processor  includes hardware for executing instructions, such as those making up a computer program. As an example and not by way of limitation, to execute instructions, processor  may retrieve (or fetch) the instructions from an internal register, an internal cache, memory , or storage ; decode and execute them; and then write one or more results to an internal register, an internal cache, memory , or storage . In particular embodiments, processor  may include one or more internal caches for data, instructions, or addresses. This disclosure contemplates processor  including any suitable number of any suitable internal caches, where appropriate.
