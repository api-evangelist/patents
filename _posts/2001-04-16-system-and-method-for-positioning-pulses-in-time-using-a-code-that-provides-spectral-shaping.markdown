Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to ultra-wide band impulse transmission systems and more particularly to applying time-hopping codes (THC) to ultra-wide band impulse transmission systems.","2. Related Art","For numerous reasons both technological and regulatory including, e.g., interference rejection and suppression, it is desirable that transmitters such as, e.g., Ultra Wideband (UWB) transmitters, be able to modify the spectral properties of the pulse trains they emit through the use of time-hopping codes (THC) to achieve a desirable spectral response.","As the availability of communication bandwidth in the increasingly crowded frequency spectrum is becoming a scarce and valuable commodity, UWB technology provides an excellent alternative for offering significant communication bandwidth, particularly, for various wireless communications applications. Because UWB communication systems are based on communicating extremely short-duration pulses (e.g., pico-seconds in duration), such systems are also known as impulse radio systems. Impulse radio systems were described in a series of patents, including U.S. Pat. No. 4,641,317 (issued Feb. 3, 1987), U.S. Pat. No. 4,813,057 (issued Mar. 14, 1989), U.S. Pat. No. 4,979,186 (issued Dec. 18, 1990), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,363,057 (issued Nov. 8, 1994) to Larry W. Fullerton, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,927 (issued Oct. 14, 1997), U.S. Pat. No. 5,687,169 (issued Nov. 11, 1997), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,832,035 (issued Nov. 3, 1998) to Larry W. Fullerton, et al. These patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","Multiple access impulse radio systems are radically different from conventional Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) systems. Unlike such systems, which use continuous sinusoidal waveforms for transmitting information, a conventional impulse radio transmitter emits a low power electromagnetic train of short pulses, which are shaped to approach a Gaussian monocycle. As a result, the impulse radio transmitter uses very little power to generate noise-like communication signals for use in multiple-access communications, radar and positioning applications, among other things. In the multi-access communication applications, the impulse radio systems depend, in part, on processing gain to achieve rejection of unwanted signals. Because of the extremely high achievable processing gains, the impulse radio systems are relatively immune to unwanted signals and interference, which limit the performance of systems that use continuous sinusoidal waveforms. The high processing gains of the impulse radio systems also provide much higher dynamic ranges than those commonly achieved by the processing gains of other known spread-spectrum systems.","Impulse radio communication systems transmit and receive the pulses at precisely controlled time intervals, in accordance with a time-hopping code. As such, the time-hopping code defines a communication channel that can be considered as a unidirectional data path for communicating information at high speed. In order to communicate the information over such channels, typical impulse radio transmitters use position modulation, which is a form of time modulation, to position the pulses in time, based on instantaneous samples of a modulating information signal. The modulating information signal may for example be a multi-state information signal, such as a binary signal. Under this arrangement, a modulator varies relative positions of a plurality of pulses on a pulse-by-pulse basis, in accordance with the modulating information signal and a specific time-hopping code that defines the communication channel.","In applications where the modulating information signal is a binary information signal, each binary state may modulate the time position of more than one pulse to generate a modulated, coded timing signal that comprises a train of identically shaped pulses that represent a single data bit. The impulse transmitter applies the generated pulses to a specified transmission medium, via a coupler, such as an antenna, which electromagnetically radiates the pulses for reception by an impulse radio receiver. The impulse radio receiver typically includes a single direct conversion stage. Using a correlator, the conversion stage coherently converts the received pulses to a baseband signal, based on a priori knowledge of the time-hopping code. Because of the correlation properties of the selected time-hopping codes, the correlator integrates the desired received pulses coherently, while the undesired noise signals are integrated non-coherently such that by comparing the coherent and non-coherent integration results, the impulse receiver can recover the communicated information.","Conventional spread-spectrum code division multiple access (SS-CDMA) techniques accommodate multiple users by permitting them to use the same frequency bandwidth at the same time. Direct sequence CDMA systems employ pseudo-noise (PN) codewords generated at a transmitter to \u201cspread\u201d the bandwidth occupied by transmitted data beyond the minimum required by the data. The conventional SS-CDMA systems employ a family of orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal spreading codes, with a pilot spreading code sequence synchronized to the family of codes. Each user is assigned one of the spreading codes as a spreading function. One such spread-spectrum system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307 entitled SPREAD-SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS by Gilhousen et al.","Unlike direct sequence spread-spectrum systems, the time-hopping code for impulse radio communications is not necessary for energy spreading, because the monocycle pulses themselves have an inherently wide bandwidth. Instead, the impulse radio systems use the time-hoping codes for channelization, energy smoothing in the frequency domain, and interference suppression. The time-hoping code defines a relative position of each pulse within a group of pulses, or pulse train, such that the combination of pulse positions defines the communications channel. In order to convey information on such communications channel, each state of a multi-state information signal may vary a relative pulse position by a predefined time shift such that a modulated, coded timing signal is generated including a train of pulses, each with timing corresponding to the combination of the time position coding and the multi-state modulation. Alternatively, or additionally, other modulation techniques may be employed.","In one conventional binary approach, pulses are time-modulated forward or backward about a nominal position. More specifically, each pulse is time modulated by adjusting its position within a time frame to one of two or more possible times. For example, in order to send a \u201c0\u201d binary bit during the time frame, the pulse may be offset from a nominal position of the time frame by about \u221250 pico-seconds. For a \u201c1\u201d binary state, the pulse may be offset from the nominal position by about +50 pico-seconds. Conventional coders that generate the time-hoping code do so in response to a periodic timing signal that corresponds to the data-rate of the multi-state information signal. The data rate of the impulse radio transmission may for example be a fraction of a periodic timing signal that is used as a time base or time reference.","In practice, decoding errors are minimized using distinctive time-hopping codes with suitable autocorrelation and cross-correlation properties. The cross-correlation between any two time-hopping codes should be low for minimal interference between multiple users in a communications system or between multiple target reflections in radar and positioning applications. At the same time, the autocorrelation property of a time-hoping code should be steeply peaked, with small side-lobes. Maximally peaked time-hopping code autocorrelation yields optimal acquisition and synchronization properties for communications, radar and positioning applications.","Various coding schemes with known correlation characteristics are available. For example, algebraic codes, Quadratic Congruential (QC) codes, Hyperbolic Congruential (HC) codes and optical codes have been suggested in the past for coding in impulse radio systems. Generally, based on known assumptions, the coding schemes guarantee a maximum number of pulse coincidences, i.e., hits, for any defined time frame or time frame shift during which the codes are repeated. For example, HC codes are guaranteed a maximum of two hits for any sub-frame or frame shift.","McCorkle in U.S. Pat. No. 5,847,677 discloses a random number generator for generating a pseudo-random code for use with jittered pulse repetition interval radar systems. The code is generated by a random number generator that possesses certain attributes desirable for a jittered radar. As disclosed, the attributes related to a flat frequency spectrum, a nearly perfect spike for an autocorrelation function, a controllable absolute minimum and maximum interval, long sequences that do not repeat, and a reasonable average pulse rate.","One known coding technique for an impulse radio is disclosed by Barrett in U.S. Pat. No. 5,610,907, entitled \u201cUltrafast Time Hopping CDMA-RF Communications: Code-As-Carrier, Multichannel Operation, High data Rate Operation and Data Rate on Demand.\u201d According to the disclosed techniques, two levels of coding are used: major orthogonal codes are applied to provide multiple channels, and forward error correction (FEC) codes are applied to information data before transmission. The disclosed system relies on dividing time into repetitive super-frames, frames and sub-frames. As disclosed, a super-frame corresponds to a time interval of about 1 millisecond, representing one repetition of a code pattern, where as a frame is defined as a time interval of about 1 microsecond divided according to a code length. A sub-frame corresponds to a short time interval of about 1 nano second during which a pulse is time positioned.","It is desirable that systems, methods, computer program products and apparatuses be provided that could prevent a radio transceiver from interfering with or being interfered with by narrow band systems.","Regarding transmitters, it is desirable to prevent interfering with other transmitted signals in a particular frequency band, such as, e.g., frequencies in which, e.g., air traffic control systems, global positioning system (GPS), or medical equipment communicate.","Regarding receivers, if a device is emitting a signal, broadcasting on a particular frequency band near a receiver, such as, e.g., a cell phone at 2.4 MHz, it would be desirable to avoid having the receiver be interfered by the signal. For example, it might be desirable to notch out a frequency between the 1 MHz and 3 MHz frequency band to avoid interference. Similarly, in the case of Personal Communication System (PCS) phone systems which communicate at the 1.8 to 1.9 MHz frequencies, it could be desirable to provide a notch in the spectrum at the 1.8 to 1.9 MHz frequency band.","It is also desirable, in the case of radar systems, to provide transceivers that avoid frequency bands of a jamming radar system. For example, where a jammer attempts to interfere with a radio, it is desirable to selectively notch out the interfering jamming radar signal.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,002,708 ('708) to \u201cSpread Spectrum Localizers,\u201d to Fleming et al., filed May 23, 1997, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,748,891 ('891) to \u201cSpread Spectrum Localizers,\u201d to Fleming et al., filed Jul. 22, 1994, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, disclose a localizer that uses cancellation nulling using pairs of opposite polarity pulses separated by a fixed period of time.","The '708 and '891 patents disclose localizers that use cancellation nulling of multiple pairs of adjacent opposite polarity pulses where the time difference between the opposite polarity pulses in a pair of pulses must be a fixed time period to in the time domain, for each of the pairs. The localizers of the '708 and '891 patents, require that the pulses in a pair of pulses must have opposite polarity. Also, the distances between the two opposite polarity pulses of a pulse pair must remain constant among all pairs of pulses. Thus, unfortunately, the '708 and '891 patents do not provide for a method of canceling pulses that allows for all pulses to be of the same polarity. Also, the '708 and '891 patents do not allow for non-constant time differences between pulses in a pulse pair.","Therefore, there exists a need for a system and method of selectively shaping or notching out particular frequency bands in spectra that overcomes the shortcomings of conventional solutions.","The present invention is directed to a method, system, apparatus and computer program product for producing time-hopping codes (THC) whose power spectral density (PSD) is low at a predefined frequency f. The time-hopping codes are referred to as notched codes, and their spectra are called notched spectra.","In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a method for positioning pulses in time can include (a) positioning the pulses within a specified time layout in accordance with one or more codes to produce a pulse train having a predefined spectral characteristic, where a difference in time position between adjacent pulses positioned to produce a spectral characteristic differs from another difference in time position between other adjacent pulses positioned to produce the spectral characteristic.","In one embodiment a code spectrum can be shaped in accordance with a spectral template such that a predefined code characteristic is preserved.","The predefined code characteristic can be a spectral property or a correlation property characteristic.

In the drawings, like reference numbers generally indicate identical, functionally similar, and\/or structurally similar elements. The drawing in which an element first appears is indicated by the leftmost digits in the corresponding reference number.","A preferred embodiment of the invention is discussed in detail below. While specific implementations are discussed, it should be understood that this is done for illustration purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other components and configurations may be used without parting from the spirit and scope of the invention.","Overview of the Present Invention","The present invention discloses a system, method, and computer program product that in an exemplary embodiment produces a family of time-hopping codes C=(T; 0\u2266k\u2266N\u22121), 1\u2266i\u2266M, such that each of the codes in the family produces pulse trains that have spectral notches at some pre-defined frequency f. In an exemplary embodiment, the notched codes can be combined with other conventional coding methods including, e.g., time-hopping codes with suitably defined spectral, auto-correlation and cross-correlation properties.","The spectrum of a sequence of identical pulses positioned according to a time-hopping code (T, 0\u2266k\u2266N\u22121) is given by\n\n()=()()\n","where f denotes frequency, s(f) is the spectrum of each of the individual pulses in the pulse train, and M(f) is the code-spectrum: \n\n","The formula relates the positioning of the pulses in time to the frequency domain characteristics of the code. Note that s(f) is a function of an individual pulse only, while M(f) is independent of the pulse type, and depends only on frequency and the time-hopping code. Thus, the spectral effects of the time-hopping code are isolated in the code-spectrum. Each time-hopping code element Tcontributes one term to the sum comprising M(f); the total number of terms in M(f) is equal to the length of the time-hopping code. (It can be assumed for simplicity of description that all pulses in the train have identical pulse shape, although this restriction may be relaxed.)","An exemplary embodiment of the present invention generates a family of time-hopping codes C=(T; 0\u2266k\u2266N\u22121), 1\u2266i\u2266M, with otherwise desired properties, such that for each i=1, 2, . . . M, the spectral multiplier term M(f) associated with code Cis minimized or can be shaped when f\u2248f, where f, is a notch frequency within the spectrum.","In this way, by requiring that all N of the terms in M(f) have a small sum when f\u2248fcan result in a spectrum of the pulse train that can have a notch at fwhen the spectrum is measured over a time-span corresponding to one full code-length. In many cases, it can be desirable for the notch to appear over much shorter time-spans. In order to reduce the time-span during which a spectral notch appears, i.e., \u201cquick notching\u201d all contiguous sub-sums of M(f) can also be designed to be minimized when f\u2248f. For \u201cquick notching,\u201d M(f) can be defined as follows: \n\n","As already noted, it can be desirable that a family of time-hopping codes C=(T; 0\u2266k\u2266N\u22121), 1\u2266i\u2266M, be produced with desired properties, such that for each i=1,2, . . . M, and for each pair N, N\u03b5{0, 1, . . . N\u22121} with N<N, the spectral multiplier term M(f, N, N) associated with code Ccan be small when f\u2248f.","Note that the quick notching exemplary embodiment is also a solution to generic notching that generates a notch within the spectra, but not conversely.","The terms in the sum comprising M(f) are sometimes referred to as phasers. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, phasers represent vectors on a unit circle in the complex plane, and M(f) itself is the vector-sum of these phasers. In order to achieve a spectrum notch, in accordance with the present invention, it is desirable that the sum M(f) and all associated sub-sums, be minimized or shaped in magnitude for values of f near f. In order to accomplish achieving a minimized sum, i.e., to shape, the time-hopping code elements Tcan be chosen so that adjacent terms in the sum represent opposite phasers on the unit circle when f=f. Diametrically opposite phasers (i.e., phasers on opposite ends of a line intersecting a diameter of a unit circle) have an angular separation of 180 degrees, and thus a pair of opposite phasers automatically sums to 0.","Advantageously, according to the present invention, if a time-hopping code (T, 0\u2266k\u2266N\u22121) can be chosen so that adjacent code elements correspond to opposite phaser pairs as often as possible, then the time-hopping code can produce a pulse train whose spectrum has a notch at a desired frequency.","All of the methods of the present invention, discussed below, are based on the following observation. Suppose that f\u03b5[0,1), 0\u2266k\u2266N\u22121 is a collection of N numbers in the interval [0,1), satisfying \n\n\nIf a time-hopping code C=(T; 0\u2266k\u2266N\u22121), 1\u2266i\u2266M can be defined where \n\n\nand where \u03c3 is any permutation of {0, 1, . . . N\u22121}, and n(\u2022) is any increasing mapping from {0, 1, . . . N\u22121} into the integers, then the code-spectrum M(f) satisfies \n\n\nHence the time-hopping code C will have a notch in its spectrum at the frequency f=f.\n\nImpulse Transmission Systems\n","A basic signal produced by an impulse transmission ultra-wideband system is a \u201cpulse.\u201d Various types of pulses exist including, e.g., a doublet, and a triplet. Graphed with voltage on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal, the pulses shown in  are illustrative of exemplary pulse types that can be used in an impulse transmission system.  depicts an exemplary embodiment of a doublet pulse . Another pulse type that can be produced by an impulse transmission system is a triplet , also referred to as the \u201cW\u201d pulse type. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, other signals and pulse types can also be used within the scope of the present invention. For example, a digital, or square wave (not shown) is another pulse type.","Another useful pulse type is an ideal pulse  also illustrated in FIG. A. The ideal pulse  can also be referred to as a model pulse, an impulse, a delta function, or a spike. As is known, other pulse types ,  can be represented as a convolution of the ideal pulse  with a real shape. In the development of time-domain analysis techniques, an integral known as the convolution integral arises. A signal can be found by convolving a system characterizing function with a system input to obtain the system output. In this description, the ideal pulse  is used for analysis purposes. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that any pulse type can be used by producing a corresponding real pulse shape from the ideal pulse.","An impulse transmission system can transmit a sequence of pulses referred to as a \u201cpulse train.\u201d  depicts an exemplary pulse train  including the sequence of pulses occurring over time. The pulse train  is drawn irregular to indicate the application of time-hopping on positioning of pulses over time. Frequency characteristics of the UWB signal corresponding to a pulse train  have to do with the type of pulse being transmitted, and a time-hopping code that is used to position the pulses within the pulse train .","The present invention generates time-hopping codes that produce desirable spectral properties, including, e.g., properties that avoid a particular frequency.

Exemplary transmitters and receivers whose signals could be avoided using a spectral notch can include narrow band systems. Narrow band systems can have frequency bands orders of magnitude smaller, such as, e.g., 4-10 Mhz wide for GPS bands, or kHz wide for audio bands, in comparison to a gigahertz power spectrum of the UWB transceiver. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, a frequency span of the notch can be a couple MHz, or 0.001 of the 2 GHz bandwidth.","The frequency span of the spectral notch , in an exemplary embodiment can be relatively small, determined by factors outside of a time hopping code designer's control. For example, the UWB transceiver equipment in an exemplary embodiment can operate at a certain average pulse repetition frequency (PRF) rate, which normally can not be changed, since the PRF rate can be dependent on the transceiver hardware, which can affect the width of the pulse.","Thus, the present invention advantageously, based on selection of a particular frequency f, can notch out the frequency and can attenuate some nearby frequencies within a frequency span using what can be referred to as a \u201chigh Q filter.\u201d According to the present invention, a desired spectral characteristic can be produced for a pulse train by shaping the code spectrum according to a spectral template to obtain the illustrated spectral notch.","A Spectrum Notch of the Present Invention","The present invention advantageously relates the time hopping code (THC) to the frequency graphs, i.e., through a Fourier transform. The THC defines positions of a series of pulses where the pulses can be thought of as a signal of delta functions. The transmitted signal is represented by a sum of the pulses T-T. The positioning of the pulses -are dependent on the THC. \n\n","Referring to Equation 1, the signal s(t), where N is the length of the THC Tof the delta functions of , is a summation from k=0 to N\u22121 of a function f (t\u2212T). Signal s(t) is a functional representation of the pulse train  that the impulse radio transceiver equipment generates. According to the present invention, a Fourier transform (FT) can be performed on the signal s(t) in order to obtain a functional representation of the frequency spectrum of the signal s(t). \n\n","Equation 2A illustrates that the FT of signal s(\u03c9) is the integral of the signal s(t) against a kernel which is a trigonometric exponential edt. When the integral of Equation 2A is performed, substituting in the expression of Equation 1 results in Equation 2B. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, simplifying, Equation 3 is obtained, where code spectrum S(f) is a sum of the transforms of the delta functions. The delta functions can sample the values at the time values that can make the time value equal to zero. Equation 3 is a frequency domain representation of the signal s(t), i.e., a code spectrum, S (f), which is a function of frequency.","Graphing the spectral magnitude (i.e., |S(f)|) of Equation 3 results in graph  depicted in chart  of FIG. . The graph  is the same as if a spectrum analyzer were coupled to the transceiver equipment generating the signal s(t).","The present invention desires to notch out, shape, or minimize the spectral magnitude at a frequency f of a portion of code spectrum S(f)  yielding a spectral notch .","Given a frequency fand a code length N, the present invention generates a THC T, that defines pulse positions of length N, where 0\u2266k\u2266N\u22121, such that, the associated frequency code spectrum S(f)  is zero at frequency f. Thus, according to the present invention, one assumes that at a frequency fof interest, it is desirable that the spectrum be shaped, minimized, or equal to a small value approaching, or equal to 0. The present invention yields the desired spectrum equal to 0 at frequency fby recognizing the dependence of Equation 3 on the periodicity of the exponential. The time hopping code Tcan be selected such that S(f)=0. The present invention supposes that an N number of frequencies (f, i.e., f, f, f. . . f) could be found, strictly between zero and one, (0,1), such that the vector sum of Equation 4 from k=0 to N\u22121 of e to the \u22122\u03a0ifpower would be minimized, shaped, or equal to 0. \n\n","Equation 4, graphically can be represented as phasers on a unit circle as shown in diagram  of FIG. . The exponential e to the power of \u22122\u03a0ifof Equation 4 can be represented as e to the i\u0398.","It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that complex numbers can be represented as a point in 2 dimensional (2D) space a point (x,y) on the Cartesian plane. That is to say, complex numbers are vectors in 2D space. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the exponential e is equal to the sum of cos \u0398 and i sin \u0398. It is axiomatic that as \u0398 is varied, the vector corresponding to the exponential travels around a unit circle of diagram  of , i.e., a circle of radius one. Each of the \u22122\u03a0fof Equation 4 is one of these angle \u0398s. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the individual terms are called phasers. The present invention selects a number of points on the unit circle, such that the vector sum of the selected points adds to 0. Accordingly, the present invention relies on the vector sum of all these phasers being minimized, shaped, or equal to zero.","The present invention, in an exemplary embodiment, begins with the unit circle, and can initially involve choosing a value on the unit circle f. The present invention advantageously, according to an exemplary embodiment, can include choosing a point f diametrically opposite point f on the unit circle, creating a pair of opposite phasers (f, f) that sum to zero. The pair of opposite phasers can cancel one another out.","The present invention, in an exemplary embodiment, can include continuing by adding opposite phaser pairs, such as, e.g., (f, f) or (f, f), that can continue to cancel. In the phaser diagram  of , for example, f and f cancel; f and f cancel; and f and f cancel.","Advantageously, in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, any evenly spaced configuration, such as, e.g., 4 phasers evenly spaced around the unit circle, such as, e.g., f, f, f, and f; or 3 phasers evenly spaced around the unit circle (i.e., forming an equilateral triangle, not shown); would still have a vector sum of zero. Thus any number such as, e.g., 5, 10, 50, 100, or more evenly spaced phasers, or an odd or even number, (none of which are shown in ) would still sum to zero.","An exemplary embodiment of the present invention can include randomly choosing a first phaser f, and then adding its diametric opposite phaser f. In accordance with the present invention, everytime one adds a first phaser, one can add a canceling phaser. Advantageously, this process can generate a robust notch, i.e., it will be difficult not to detect the notch. The process of the exemplary embodiment can include immediate cancellation, rather than having to wait, e.g., 5 pulses, for cancellation of phasers of an exemplary embodiment using 5 phasers evenly spaced about a unit circle.","In one embodiment, the pulses of a signal s(t) can emanate from an antenna. If measurement equipment is set up even slightly wrong, and one relies on, e.g., 5 phasers evenly spaced, to cancel each other out, it is possible that the intended result of fully canceling phasers to yield the spectrum notch  might never be accomplished. When phasers are selected to cancel one another out, the energy from the canceling phasers does not disappear, the energy instead is moved out of one space, and into another. If, according to the present invention, one uses a very regular structure, using, e.g., 3 phasers evenly spaced, where the spacing is not quite perfectly even, cancellation in the code spectrum can work well at first, but eventually a big spike can occur somewhere else and also, possibly, no cancellation could occur at an intended spectrum notch frequency span. For example, if, e.g., 3, 4, 5, etc. phasers evenly spaced are used and just a slight shift is manifested, because of, e.g., a malfunction of equipment, then cancellation potentially might not occur, leading to, e.g., no notch, or a suboptimal notch, since the energy of the phasers remains but is shifted to other frequencies.","Since the present invention including selection of canceling groups of phasers can provide the desired frequencies f, the present invention can also provide a desirable time-hopping code (THC). Using the phasers fobtained as described above, the present invention enables generation of various THCs out of that sequence of phasers f.","Recall from above that it is desired that the code spectrum at fbe equal to zero, i.e., S(f)=0. Thus, it is desirable that the THC formula of Equation 3, be minimized, shaped, or set to zero as shown in Equation 5 below. \n\n","If the angle from the THC of Equation 5, \u22122\u03a0fT, were equal to angle \u22122\u03a0fof Equation 4, then the desired notch of the present invention results. Mathematically, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that e is equal to the sum of cos \u0398 and i sin \u0398. Since both the sine and cosine functions are periodic with period 2\u03a0, the angles \u22122\u03a0fTand \u22122\u03a0fneed only be equal for an integer multiple nof 2\u03a0. Thus an integer multiple 2\u03a0ncan be added to the \u22122\u03a0fand the angle can be set equal to \u22122\u03a0fTto obtain Equation 6.\n\n\u22122\u03a0=\u22122\u03a0+2\u03a0\u2003\u2003Equation 6.\n","The integer ncould be positive or negative, so multiplying by \u22121 on both sides of the equation can result in positive terms and the 2\u03a0 coefficient can cancel out of all terms resulting in Equation 7 below.\n\n\u2003\u2003Equation 7.\n","Since all variables in Equation 7 are known but T, solving for Tresults in Equation 8 below.\n\n=(1\/)(), where is any integer.\u2003\u2003Equation 8.\n","According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, where it is desired that the code spectrum at frequency f, be notched out, one can choose an nto vary the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of the THC. In an exemplary embodiment, if nis a random value with a mean of a certain value such as, e.g., 50, then a PRF of a certain value results. If the mean was instead made 25, then the result would be half as much distance between pulses, or twice as large a PRF than the certain value of the exemplary case. No matter what nis, the spectrum is still zero at f. The value of ncan be dependent on the transceiver hardware used.","In summary, the basic technique of an exemplary embodiment of the invention, given a frequency fat which it is desired that the code spectrum be minimized, and shaped, and given a code length n, can include:","Step 1 including choosing a set of pairs of phasers f, for k=0 to N\u22121, an exemplary method can include selecting diametrically opposite canceling phaser pair approach, with the approach's inherent randomness feature; alternatively, a higher even number of equally spaced canceling phasers could be used; or alternatively, if an odd number of pulses is desired, such as, e.g., 9, then a number of even phasers (e.g., 6) could be chosen using the random opposite phaser pair approach, and then the last three phasers could be equally spaced on the unit circle (i.e., forming an equilateral triangle around the unit circle); and","Step 2 including forming the time hopping code Twhere T=(1\/f+n), and where nis any integer which may be constrained by hardware requirements. The ncould be selected randomly, but, perhaps, e.g., out of a predefined group. The hardware and an ncorresponding to the properties of the transceiver hardware can determine the width of the spectral notch . The PRF can be typically fixed for a given application, and the PRF dictates the n.","It is important to note that the present invention has been described generating notches by positioning a sequence of pulses in time using a time-hopping code. The pulses have been drawn (e.g., as in ) using an ideal pulse type . When the pulses are not mathematically perfect, the same desired notch can result. No matter how imperfect the pulses are, the resulting code spectrum will have a spectral notch at the desired frequency f. This is because, as will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant art, the code spectrum of the real pulse train is related to the spectrum of the ideal pulse train  by convolution. This means that one can convolve the spectrum of an individual pulse with the code spectrum to get the real spectrum using known methods.","In another exemplary embodiment, to generate notches, the positioning of the pulses using a time-hopping code can be varied specifying temporal characteristics, but can also be varied in terms of non-temporal characteristics such as, e.g., polarity of the pulse. Persons having ordinary skill in the art will realize that a spectral notch can be accomplished according to the present invention where other non-temporal characteristics are varied, including, e.g., pulse type, pulse amplitude and pulse width. According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a pulse train  that has both a time hopping code temporal characteristic component and a non-temporal characteristic such as polarity can be used to obtain a similar desired spectral notch ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0134","num":"0135"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 5A"],"b":["500","502","504","506","508","510","506","518","516","512","5","514","518"],"sub":["1 ","2 ","2\u2032","3 ","4 ","k ","k","2\u2032","2\u2032","2 ","1 ","2\u2032"]},"Exemplary Simulation Results",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0135","num":"0136"},"figref":["FIG. 7A","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B","FIG. 7B"],"b":["700","700","702","702","204","204"],"i":["d ","d "],"sub":"null "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0136","num":"0137"},"figref":["FIG. 7C","FIG. 7C"],"b":["704","702","706","706","706","708","706","706","706","706"]},"Exemplary transmitters and transceivers are discussed in greater length below with reference to , after the descriptions of .

Also, the distances between two pulses in a pair must remain constant among all pairs of pulses.","The present invention has several important differences from the pulse pair cancellation approach disclosed in '708 and '891. The spectrum notching technique of the present invention advantageously does not require notching on a pulse pair by pulse pair basis. Further, the present invention does not require that each pulse be accompanied by an opposite polarity pulse. In fact, as already described, all pulses can have the same polarity according to the present invention. Moreover, unlike the required fixed distance in time between the pulses of each of the pulse pairs of the '708 and '891 patents, the distance between a first pair of two adjacent pulses, and the distance between another pair of adjacent pulses, according to the present invention, need not be constant.

Also suppose, e.g., that these time-hopping codes specify time slots within which pulses are to be positioned, but do not specify precise time positions within the slots. Given that the width (in time) of the slots used in a given time layout is generally a design issue, slots may be used that are wider than the width of pulses, thereby providing some freedom in the exact positioning of pulses within slots. The present invention takes advantage of this concept of freedom of positioning within slots to produce spectral notches.","According to an exemplary THC it can be desired that pulses be transmitted in each of several time intervals. A time-hopping code having desired correlation properties can subdivide time intervals into a number of frames  and slots , as shown in an exemplary embodiment of FIG. . In an exemplary embodiment, there can be frame boundaries and one pulse can occur per frame, and each frame can include 4 slots. To guarantee desired correlation properties, the pulses are placed in the slots , , , and of each respective frame  as dictated by the time-hopping code. Furthermore, if the width of the slots , , , and is sufficiently wide, a degree of freedom in which to position pulses may be used by the present invention to create a notch.","Various numerical code generation techniques are described further below.

The time base  typically comprises a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), or the like, having a high timing accuracy and low jitter, on the order of picoseconds (ps). The voltage control to adjust the VCO center frequency is set at calibration to the desired center frequency used to define the transmitter's nominal pulse repetition rate. The periodic timing signal  is supplied to a precision timing generator .","The precision timing generator  supplies synchronizing signals  to the code source  and utilizes the code source output  together with an internally generated subcarrier signal (which is optional) and an information signal  to generate a modulated, coded timing signal .","The code source  can include a storage device such as a random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), or the like, for storing suitable time-hopping codes and for outputting the time-hopping codes as a code signal . Alternatively, maximum length shift registers or other computational means can be used to generate the time-hopping codes.","An information source  supplies the information signal  to the precision timing generator . The information signal  can be any type of intelligence, including digital bits representing voice, data, imagery, or the like, analog signals, or complex signals.","A pulse generator  uses the modulated, coded timing signal  as a trigger to generate output pulses. The output pulses are sent to a transmit antenna  via a transmission line  coupled thereto. The output pulses are converted into propagating electromagnetic pulses by the transmit antenna . In the present embodiment, the electromagnetic pulses are called the emitted signal, and propagate to an impulse radio receiver , such as shown in , through a propagation medium, such as air, in a radio frequency embodiment. In a preferred embodiment, the emitted signal is wide-band or ultrawide-band, approaching a monocycle pulse as in FIG. A. However, the emitted signal can be spectrally modified by filtering of the pulses. This filtering will usually cause each monocycle pulse to have more zero crossings (more cycles) in the time domain. In this case, the impulse radio receiver can use a similar waveform as the template signal in the cross correlator for efficient conversion.","Receiver","An exemplary embodiment of an impulse radio receiver  (hereinafter called the receiver) for the impulse radio communication system is now described with reference to FIG. . More specifically, the system illustrated in  is for reception of digital data where one or more pulses are transmitted for each data bit.","The receiver  comprises a receive antenna  for receiving a propagated impulse radio signal . A received signal  from the receive antenna  is coupled to a cross correlator or sampler  to produce a baseband output . The cross correlator or sampler  includes multiply and integrate functions together with any necessary filters to optimize signal to noise ratio.","The receiver  also includes a precision timing generator , which receives a periodic timing signal  from a receiver time base . This time base  is adjustable and controllable in time, frequency, or phase, as required by the lock loop in order to lock on the received signal . The precision timing generator  provides synchronizing signals  to the code source  and receives a code control signal  from the code source . The precision timing generator  utilizes the periodic timing signal  and code control signal  to produce a coded timing signal . The template generator  is triggered by this coded timing signal  and produces a train of template signal pulses  ideally having waveforms substantially equivalent to each pulse of the received signal . The code for receiving a given signal is the same code utilized by the originating transmitter  to generate the propagated signal . Thus, the timing of the template pulse train  matches the timing of the received signal pulse train , allowing the received signal  to be synchronously sampled in the correlator . The correlator  ideally comprises a multiplier followed by a short-term integrator to sum the multiplier product over the pulse interval.","Further examples and details of correlation and sampling processes can be found in commonly owned U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,641,317, 4,743,906, 4,813,057, and 4,979,186, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, and commonly owned and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/356,384, filed Jul. 16, 1999, entitled \u201cBaseband Signal Converter Device for a Wideband Impulse Radio Receiver,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The output of the correlator , also called a baseband signal , is coupled to a subcarrier demodulator , which demodulates the subcarrier information signal from the subcarrier. The purpose of the optional subcarrier process, when used, is to move the information signal away from DC (zero frequency) to improve immunity to low frequency noise and offsets. The output of the subcarrier demodulator  is then filtered or integrated in a pulse summation stage . The pulse summation stage produces an output representative of the sum of a number of pulse signals comprising a single data bit. The output of the pulse summation stage  is then compared with a nominal zero (or reference) signal output in a detector stage  to determine an output signal  representing an estimate of the original information signal .","The baseband signal  is also input to a lowpass filter  (also referred to as lock loop filter ). A control loop comprising the lowpass filter , time base , precision timing generator , template generator , and correlator  is used to generate a filtered error signal . The filtered error signal  provides adjustments to the adjustable time base  to time position the periodic timing signal  in relation to the position of the received signal .","In a transceiver embodiment, substantial economy can be achieved by sharing part or all of several of the functions of the transmitter  and receiver . Some of these include the time base , precision timing generator , code source , antenna , and the like.","While various exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation.
