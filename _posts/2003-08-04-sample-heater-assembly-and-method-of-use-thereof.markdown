title: Sample heater assembly and method of use thereof
abstract: A sample heater assembly which permits the detection of low volatility agents by existing chemical agent detectors is described. Existing chemical agent detectors often lack the capability to accurately detect low volatility agents, such as the chemical warfare agent VX. The sample heater assembly provides this capability by heating low volatility agents to vaporization and interfacing with the existing chemical agent detector. The sample heater assembly comprises a sample containment reservoir for holding the low volatility agent sample, which can be attached to the chemical agent detector, and a heating element which attaches to the sample containment reservoir for heating the sample.

No. 60\/407,358, filed on Aug. 29, 2002.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, licensed, and used by or for the U.S. Government.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention provides a sample heater assembly that provides an enhanced ability to detect low volatility agents, such as particular chemical warfare agents.","2. Brief Description of the Related Art","Low volatility agents (LVA), particularly in the chemical warfare agent nerve agent class of VX, pose a very toxic and persistent hazard to conventional military forces and possibly to civilian populations. Commonly known as a weapons of mass destruction (WMD), these chemical warfare agents are potentially employed as a tactical or terror weapon in various military scenarios, such as being deployed in military actions for effective terrain denial using a variety of dissemination mechanisms including grenades, mortars, mines, rockets, bombs and long-range projectiles and missiles. Likewise, terrorists employing these or other dispersal devices could also disperse these hazardous compounds. Although these low volatility agent hazards normally produce minimal vapor inhalation hazard, if properly configured, high explosive mechanisms and special configuration sprayers can produce airborne droplets and aerosols in addition to significant liquid ground deposition contamination. In such forms, these hazards are generally liquids and exhibit physical\/chemical properties quite different from respiratory hazard chemical warfare agents (CWAs), e.g. Sarin (GB). Low vapor pressure hazards, such as low volatility agents, are difficult to detect using currently known fielded vapor detectors.","These low volatility agents, because of their low vapor pressures, are difficult to detect with the current chemical vapor detection systems such as the Improved Chemical Agent Monitor (ICAM) and the M256A1 Chemical Agent Detector Kit. The M256 detector Kit, for example, detects Sarin (GB) to a sensitivity level of 0.005 mg-min\/musing a very specific eel enzyme cholinesterase. This enzyme is similar to human acetyl cholinesterase and its activity is reduced with exposure to organophosphorus hazards, such as Sarin (GB) or VX. As Sarin is approximately 2000 times more volatile than VX, to accomplish VX binding in the vapor state to the eel enzyme cholinesterase in the M256 Chemical Detector Kit, more vapor molecules are necessary to effect detection. The M256A1 Chemical Agent Detection Kit, including its pertinent M256 Chemical Agent Detector, is described in Department of the Army Technical Manual, TM 3-6665-307-10, titled A Operator=s Manual for Chemical Agent Detector Kit, M256 (6665-01-016-8399) and M256A1 (6665-01-133-4964)@, September 1985, which also describes the Mustard Agent Heater Assembly (MAHA) of the M256A1 Chemical Agent Detection Kit. Additionally, the Improved Chemical Agent Monitor (ICAM) is described in Army Technical Manual TM 3-6665-331-10, and the M8 Chemical Agent Detection Paper is described in army supply Bulletin SB 3-6665-2. The disclosure of each of these references for the M256A1 Chemical Agent Detection Kit, M256 Chemical Agent Detector, Mustard Agent Heater Assembly, Improved Chemical Agent Monitor, and M8 Chemical Agent Detection Paper are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","As the threat of these chemical warfare agents being used exists, and the proliferation of such chemical weapons continues, there is a need in the art to develop improved methods to detect and sample these hazards. The present invention addresses this and other needs.","The present invention includes a sample heater assembly, preferably for use with a M256 Chemical Agent Detector, having a heating element and a sample containment reservoir conductively attached thermally to the heating element to effectively vaporize one or more low volatility agents for detection thereof. The sample heater assembly of the present invention advantageously enables detection of low volatility hazardous contaminants in a simple manner by modifying existing equipment. After the hazardous contaminants are placed in the sample containment reservoir, the heating element heats the low volatility hazardous contaminants at effective heating rates that are variable, in part, by adjusting the distance between the heating element and low volatility hazardous contaminants. Heating rates additionally vary with the number and timing of using individual heat sources within the heating element. The heated low volatility hazardous contaminants are kept isolated in the space between the sample containment reservoir and the detection window, with selection of the appropriate detection window generally determined from known or generated intelligence information.","The present invention also includes a M256 Chemical Detector in combination with the sample heater assembly.","Additionally, the present invention includes a method for detecting low volatility agents comprising the steps of providing a sample heater assembly having a heating element and a sample containment reservoir conductively attached thermally to the heating element to effectively vaporize one or more low volatility agents for detection thereof, placing one or more low volatility agents into the sample containment reservoir and heating the sample containment reservoir effectively to vaporize the low volatility agents for detection. A detection paper, such as M8 paper, may be used to initially detect a liquid chemical warfare agent. This wetted detector paper when indication is positive can be inserted into the sample heater assembly with the liquid hazard directly vaporized from the M8 paper. As such the M8 paper serves a dual role as an initial liquid hazard detector, and also serves immediately as a sampling swatch to be inserted into the sample heater assembly for vapor detection with the M256 Detector Kit. A detected chemical warfare agent product results from the method.","Furthermore, the present invention includes an improved M256 Chemical Detection kit that incorporates the sample heater assembly.","The present invention provides for a novel sample heater assembly (SHA) useful in field-expedient sampling and detection of low volatility agents, also known as low volatility hazards (LVH), particularly when employed as part of currently fielded chemical vapor detection instruments, such as an improved M256 Chemical Agent Detection Kit, that is integrated with the sample heater assembly. Many fielded vapor detection instruments do not have the capability to perform detection of especially low volatility samples, and the combination of the sample heater assembly as an adjunct to the existing M256 detection kit affords an expanded and needed detection capability through this combined system. The sample heater assembly, method of and product thereby, enhance the detection capabilities of the currently fielded M256 Chemical Agent Detector Kit through use of the novel sample heater assembly, as taught herein. With the addition of the sample heater assembly, this heater\/sample component allows low volatility hazardous liquids to be detected in a field environment particularly in a chemical warfare scenario. As the M256 kit was initially developed to detect a variety of chemical warfare agent vapors or gases, detection of low volatility hazards is problematic for the M256 kit because of the low vapor pressures of these low volatility hazards. The use of the sample heater assembly with the M256 allows detection of chemical composition not previously detectable by the M256 kit. Additionally, the present invention may be used to enhance the detection of low volatility agents using the Improved Chemical Agent Monitor (ICAM). One preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a M256 Chemical Detector in combination with the sample heater assembly. The enhancement of the standard M256 Chemical Agent Detector Kit, as taught herein, to include low volatility liquid sampling and detection imparts a major product improvement that facilitates the detection of a wider range of hazardous chemicals in both battlefield and civilian environments. In addition, the present invention includes the effective and unique integration of the currently fielded M256 Chemical Agent Detector Kit and the M8 Chemical Agent Detector Paper, which constitutes another preferred embodiment of the sampling and detection system of the present invention.","As used herein, the terms low volatility hazards (LVH) and low volatility agents (LVA) are used interchangeably. Although the two terms, low volatility hazards and low volatility agents, are technically distinct including where low volatility agents are the conventional military hazards, the low vapor pressure (or low volatility) of these two types of samples result from the physical\/chemical properties of these chemicals, or a combination of the particular chemical sample and the environmental sample matrix in which it is contained. Low volatility agents include chemical warfare agents, such as blister agents, blood agents and nerve agents, including VX. Vapor pressure, usually measured in mm Hg or pascal in SI units, denotes the tendency of liquids to vaporize. Volatility, however, is a quantitative term that includes molecular considerations and is used to describe the concentration of a vapor above a liquid under equilibrium conditions in a closed system at a specific temperature (usually measured in mg\/m). Additionally, meteorological conditions impart significant influence on how easily these low volatility liquids are detected, for example colder environments tend to lower the vapor pressure of these hazards.","As seen in , the present invention expands the field detection capability of the M256 Kit with the use of a sample heater assembly . The sample heater assembly , shown individually in  and in combination with other components in , increases the effective vapor pressure of low volatility hazardous liquids, particularly chemical warfare agents such as VX. The combination of the sample heater assembly  and an M256 detector  (shown in ) provides the M256 with expanded capability to detect additional chemical warfare agent, such as VX, or mustard agent, such as HD. The sample heater assembly  of the present invention includes a heating element  and a sample containment reservoir , with the sample containment reservoir  conductively attached thermally to the heating element  in a manner to effectively vaporize one or more low volatility agents for detection of the low volatility agents thereof.","In a preferred embodiment the sample heater assembly  includes a small, lightweight structure constructed of materials that are not degraded by the thermal heating or by the chemical sample being vaporized and detected. Such materials include stainless steel, hardened polymeric compositions, plastic polymers, metals, metal alloys, composites and the like, with selection of the appropriate material determinable by those skilled in the art through ordinary experimentation in light of the disclosure herein, including considerations of interfering chemical breakdown products or other interferents generated from either the thermal heating process, or interactions with the chemical samples themselves, thus interfering with the resultant vapor detection on the M256 detector . Variations and subsequent changes to the sample containment reservoir , or the sample heater assembly , may include optimized designs, or redesigns, for production and marketing, such as for example without limitation, changes in the size or geometry of the sample compartment reservoir  or the sample heater assembly  to enhance performance, production rates, compatibility, convenience, etc., with designs, adjustment or changes preferably completed to maximize diffusion of the heated low volatility sample vapors to afford a more rapid time period and\/or accurate detection by the detector, generally by optimizing sample diffusion after heating and detection. Preferably the sample heater assembly  includes a size of from about 1 into about 5 in, more preferably from about 2 into about 3 in, with the sample containment reservoir  having a receptacle or containment area of from about 0.5 into about 2 in, more preferably from about 1 into about 1.5 in.","The heating element  of the present invention includes any appropriate heating mechanism for effectively vaporizing the low volatility agent for detection. The heating element  preferably includes the Mustard Agent Heater Assembly  of the M256 Chemical Agent Detector Kit. As the difficulties in detection of a variety of low volatility hazards increases, thermal sources for vaporization of the chemical warfare samples may require improvement beyond that which is resident in the existing M256 Chemical Agent Detector Kit (i.e., the Mustard Agent Heater Assembly ). This may require other thermal energy sources (with possibly more control or more energy) to increase the vapor pressure of samples placed into the present invention. Although use of the Mustard Agent Heater Assembly  is preferred, as it already exists as a component of the M256A1 Chemical Agent Detector Kit, as the direct heating source for assistance in vaporizing low vapor pressure liquids and possibly solid samples, other possible thermal vaporizing sources could be used, as well, in the present invention as the heating element . For example, without limitation, some samples may require specialized heating profiles distinct from the detached Mustard Agent Heater Assembly , including the possible requirement for additional thermal energy, such as more reactants being employed, or the pyrotechnic components. Pyrotechnic components include for example without limitation, selective oxidation\/reduction reactions to provide more heat energy, or to provide heat energy at a faster rate by manipulation of the reactive chemistries. Additionally, using high-density batteries, as an electrical resistive source of thermal energy, may also be applied. Preferably, any alternate thermal sources would be inexpensive, lightweight and small in size. As seen in , an example of a thermal energy output profile from functioning two of the Mustard Agent Heater Assembly ampoules  (shown in ) at the same time is depicted. As the currently fielded M256 Kit already has a pyrotechnic heater assembly that facilitates blister agent detection, this heater assembly is detached and used as the thermal source for increasing the vapor pressure of sampled low volatility hazards in the sample containment reservoir . The thermal energy for enhanced vaporization of the low volatility agents can be varied by crushing, at different time intervals, one and\/or two ampoules  from the Mustard Agent Heater Assembly  that constitutes part of the currently standard M256 kit, with the ampoules  located to the right of the mustard agent detection in the standard M256 kit. Generally, the Mustard Agent Heater Assembly , previously detailed, is comprised of two reactant vials containing cupric chloride (0.4 grams\/ampoule) and a pad containing aluminum powder (0.285 grams\/pad). When the cupric chloride ampoules are broken a chemical reaction results, producing heat. The ampoules  are encased in a plastic cover on front to contain the reaction components with an aluminum foil backing to assist in effective heat transfer of the chemical reaction to a chemical warfare sample.","The heating profile of the heated sample can be adjusted through changing the spacing between the sample containment reservoir  and the heating element , separately or in combination with activating two or more heating units at the same or different times, e.g., crushing the two heater ampoules  in the Mustard Agent Heater Assembly  at different times. As used herein, the term \u201cheating profile\u201d describes the effective heating from a variety of heating mechanisms as well as methods to apply this heating using various techniques such as time and spatial adjustments of different heating sources.","When low volatility agents are adsorbed onto material surfaces, their effective vapor pressure may be further reduced. Appropriate thermal ramping (vaporization) of the contaminated sample may be used to overcome this problem. A variety of different sample types, such as without limitation, soil, paper, liquid puddles, clothing and other like surfaces or materials, can be detected by this induced vapor pressure increase of low volatility agents, such as nerve agents. Different agents in different sample matrices may require different thermal ramping profiles in order to maintain sample integrity and sufficient mass transfer rate, with the proper amount of thermal ramping determinable by those skilled in the art through ordinary experimentation.","Referring to , the sample heater assembly  can be inserted over the M256 detector nerve agent window  or other detection windows  (mustard or blood gas) such as those having key sampling and detection components, collectively referred to herein as detection windows . Different sample types and manifestations of low volatility agents may be used in conjunction with the present invention, including for example without limitation, soil, droplets, clothing, and the like, for detection using the M256 detector  or other appropriate detector. Preferably, the sample heater assembly  has a slotted connector  to attach to the M256 detector  that enables the sample heater assembly  to slide the sample over the appropriate M256 detector window . Generally, determination of whether the nerve agent window , or other window , is selected first varies depending on known intelligence of the area or capabilities, or previous detector information collected by first responders or hazardous material teams at a suspected chemical warfare (CW) site, including intelligence information such as signs and symptoms; or from other field detection systems already being deployed. Once the appropriate nerve, blood or blister agent M256 detector window  is selected, the sample heater assembly  is clipped in place over the selected M256 detection window .","Preferably, the sample heater assembly  includes a screened section  of the sample containment reservoir . More preferably, the sample heater assembly  is configured with a screened section of a fine mesh screen  that allows the low volatility agents, e.g., chemical warfare agent samples,  to be deposited in the sample containment reservoir . Examples of this fine mesh screen  include compositions of nylon, Teflon, polypropylene, ABS resins, etc. that are configured in a manner to allow diffusion of the heated vapors to react on the detection windows. Screens may be configured in various ways, preferably such as to contain the sample but allow vapors or gasses through an array, such as a  hole by  hole array (270 holes) at 1\/32 of an inch in diameter in a sample heater assembly  with gross dimensions of about 44 mm in length, 38 mm in width and 15 mm in height having a sample containment reservoir of about 3.75 cm. Preferably this screen  precludes direct contact with the detection windows  of the M256 detector . On the sample heater assembly , shown as directly above the sample containment reservoir , an attaching mechanism  accommodates the heating element , preferably the Mustard Agent Heater Assembly  detached from M256 detector . The sample heater assembly  preferably comprises the attaching mechanism  effective to place the heating element  above the sample containment reservoir , such as a slotted channel or other like mechanism for fixing the heating element  over the sample containment reservoir . In one embodiment of the slotted attaching mechanism , the slot provides a pinching action onto the heating element  to fix the heating element  in place. This attaching mechanism  on the sample heater assembly  allows for the insertion and positioning of the Mustard Agent Heater Assembly  above and apart from the sample containment reservoir  using the foiled backing of the Mustard Agent Heater Assembly  and the contents in the sample containment reservoir . Preferably the attaching mechanism  provides a means for adjusting the distance of the heater element  to the sample containment reservoir . The preferred heating element  comprises one or more parts of the Mustard Agent Heater Assembly . With the Mustard Agent Heater Assembly  inserted into the sample containment reservoir , the heater ampoules face the operator of the sample heater assembly  and the aluminum foil backing of the heater ampoules is adjacent to the sample containment reservoir . The heating element  may be adjusted, as desired, to various standoff distances between the Mustard Agent Heater Assembly  and the sample containment reservoir , to optimize or modify heating profiles. With adjustment of the distance between the Mustard Agent Heater Assembly  and the sample containment reservoir , thermal vaporization rates may be varied by beyond selection of the number or amount of the heat source, e.g., how many Mustard Agent Heater Assembly  ampoules are crushed by the operator such as crushing either one or two heater ampoules  of the Mustard Agent Heater Assembly , and the time period in between each crushing function. Additionally, in one embodiment, a heat sink may be used to modify the heating profile. When positioned in various close adjacent position distances to the sample containment reservoir , the Mustard Agent Heater Assembly  provides effective heating to vaporize low volatility agents  that have been placed in the sample containment reservoir .","The sample heater assembly  may further include a slotted channel  effective to place the sample heating assembly  over an appropriate detection window, with the detection window preferably part of an M256 Chemical Detector. The slotted channel  may include a pinching action, e.g. a decreasing width of the slot where the sample heater assembly  attaches firmly to the M256 Detector , to ensure that diffusion of the thermalized vapors from the sample containment reservoir  are contained locally in the small volume space between the sample containment reservoir  of the sample heater assembly  and the M256 detection window . Any leakage, particularly high leakage rates, out of the M256\/sample heater assembly detection volume space substantially reduces the amount of vapor hazard reaching the reactants on the M256 detection window . As such, the effectiveness of the sample heater assembly  increases with increased containment of these vapors. As the heated sample is kept isolated in the sample containment reservoir\/M256 detection window volume space, preferably by a clip on the sample heater assembly  to attach directly over the appropriate detection window  of the current M256 detector , the vapor diffusion sampling and detection normally conducted by the M256 detector  occurs to analyze the vapor\/gas product of the low volatility hazardous materials resulting from the use of the sample heater assembly .","In one preferred embodiment, the sample heater assembly  integrates the M256 detector  with chemical detection paper, preferably M8 Chemical Agent Detection Paper,  by detecting and analyzing low volatility hazardous materials. This unique integration of these detection systems to expand their capabilities may include use of the M8 Detection Papers  (Paper, Chemical Agent Detector, VGH, ABC-M8) with its three dyes impregnated therein that evidence the presence of liquid hazards only. The three impregnated dyes detect G agents (nerve), liquid VX (nerve), and liquid mustard agents (H). The M8 Detection Papers  are used to determine the possible presence of the individual chemical warfare agents by changing specific colors due to how the different agents react with three colored dyes embedded in these papers. A preferred use of the present invention uses the M8 Papers  as an initial screening\/sampling tool for determining the presence of liquid nerve (G or V) or mustard agents (H). After an operator or user dips a swatch of the M8 Paper  into a suspect liquid, any particular color change is matched to the color presented with an agent color key. Any color match indicates the possible presence of an agent hazard. After a color change from the M8 Paper , the user inserts the M8 Paper  into the sample heater assembly  which is then clamped in place to the appropriate detection window  of the M256 detector  to further analyze the suspect agent hazard. In this embodiment, preferably a color-coded legend is added to the M256 detection windows , allowing the operator to select, or confirm, the appropriate detection window  with the color code. More preferably, any color coding of the M256 detection window  is adjacent to the individual windows of the M256 detector . For example, color coding of the detection windows using colored block legends, e.g., if the M8 paper  turns gold or green then as per the color legend the sample heater assembly  would be placed over that detection window, e.g., a starred window, and then the appropriately colored M8 paper  would be inserted for desorption to a vapor. If the M8 paper  turns red, then the sample heater assembly  would be placed over the blister agent detection window, e.g., a square window, and desorbed as stated above.","The integration of the previously independent M256 Chemical Agent Detector  and the M8 Detector Papers  is operationally advantageous. The M8 Papers , when operationally used in conjunction with the M256 and sample heater assembly , provides the user with presumptive chemical hazard detection, i.e., low vapor pressure liquid sampling. It also provides a method to sample and confirm M8 Paper  presumptive detection of low vapor pressure hazards by rapid, logical calorimetric analysis using the attributes of the M256\/sample heater assembly integration.","Although the sample heater assembly  may be considered a low cost and expendable item, sample heater assembly  may be effectively field decontaminated for subsequent reuse. As an inexpensive, small and lightweight device, the sample heater assembly  can be included and packaged in the current M256 field containers. With the Mustard Agent Heater Assembly  already in use and attached to the current M256 kit, there exists an immediate heating capability in the fielded units. However, because the individual heaters in the Mustard Agent Heater Assembly  are small, additional heaters may be added to a modified M256 kit.","When detecting low volatility agents , one or more low volatility agents  are placed into the sample containment reservoir  of the sample heater assembly  and the sample containment reservoir  is heated to effectively vaporize the low volatility agents  for detection by an appropriate detection device. Preferably, the low volatility agents  placed into the sample containment reservoir  have been detected as chemical warfare agent with chemical detection paper, such as M8 Detection Paper,  with the M8 Detection Paper  (with detected absorbed chemical warfare) inserted into the sample containment reservoir . In operation, the integrated sample heater assembly  and M256 detector , functioning as a combined system, provide for a tight fitting, small volume sample containment reservoir  which precludes extraneous diffusion of the low vapor pressure sample vapors outside the sample containment reservoir  area. This enhancement of field operated detection devices, particularly currently used detection devices significantly increases the usefulness of these devices in detection of low volatility hazards. The method of the present invention results in a detected chemical warfare agent product.","The sample heater assembly  of the present invention may be incorporated into a kit, such as an M256 Chemical Detection kit.","An M256 detector kit sample heater assembly for the M256 Detector Kit was designed and fabricated. The sample heater assembly was constructed of a polypropylene material, with the dimensions of 0.269 cubic inches internal volume, 0.095 inch slotted channel for attaching the M256 detector, and 0.075 slot for the attaching mechanism for attaching the heating element. The sample heater assembly was 1.750 inches in length, 1.619 inches in width and 0.710 inches high. The screen within the sample heater assembly had 293 holes at 0.032 diameter each (293\u00d7.032).","A theoretical assessment of the thermal desorption and mass transfer kinetics were calculated for the sample heater assembly configuration of Example 1 using the low volatility nerve agent VX as the target hazardous liquid. Given the detection limit of the M256 detector as 0.005 mg\/m, and assuming the mustard agent heater assembly achieve a temperature over 100\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes when both ampoules are broke, the present invention was determined to detect low volatility agents like VX (assuming typical battlefield contamination densities) in less than one second. This results in the heated detection probe and sampling vessel for the modified 256 Kit and eel enzyme detection technology as having the potential to detect VX vapors when operated at an elevated temperature of approximately 100\u00b0 F.","The present invention provides an enhanced Improved Chemical Agent Monitor (ICAM) or M256 Chemical Agent Detection System for general-purpose low vapor pressure sampling and detection in field environments. The sample heater assembly of the present invention is simple to use, disposable, and versatile enough to detect a variety of field samples on site that have either low volatilities or adsorbed in an environmental sample matrix that precludes adequate vaporization. Additionally, toxic industrial hazards may be detected using the sample heater assembly in combination with appropriately configured detection kits, permitting detection of low volatility hazards in the commercial and\/or industrial area.","The foregoing summary, description, and examples of the present invention are not intended to be limiting, but are only exemplary of the inventive features which are defined in the claims. Alternative materials and configurations as those described herein for the present invention may be used."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
