title: Reusable sample holding device permitting ready loading of very small wet samples
abstract: A reusable sample-holding device for readily loading very small wet samples for observation of the samples by microscopic equipment, in particular in a vacuum environment. Embodiments may be used with a scanning electron microscope (SEM), a transmission electron microscope (TEM), an X-ray microscope, optical microscope, and the like. For observation of the sample, embodiments provide a thin-membrane window etched in the center of each of two silicon wafers abutting to contain the sample in a small uniform gap formed between the windows. This gap may be adjusted by employing spacers. Alternatively, the thickness of a film established by the fluid in which the sample is incorporated determines the gap without need of a spacer. To optimize resolution each window may have a thickness on the order of 50 nm and the gap may be on the order of 50 nm.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Under paragraph 1(a) of Executive Order 10096, the conditions under which this invention was made entitle the Government of the United States, as represented by the Secretary of the Army, to an undivided interest therein on any patent granted thereon by the United States. This and related patents are available for licensing to qualified licensees. Please contact Bea Shahin at 217 373-7234.","Nanotechnology of materials, related microbiological means of manipulation, and synthetic biology require a means to directly observe nanoscale interactions and classify nano-material morphological properties in solution on a small scale. More specifically the lack of particle and colloid size descriptors and in situ nanoscale imaging techniques are detrimental to advancing the state of the art because it inhibits the ability to verify the reproducibility of nano-fluid preparation necessary for research groups to compare properties.","Using and relying only on more conventional imaging techniques such as a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) raises several concerns. TEM and SEM samples are dried and exposed to vacuum before being imaged which changes the observed fundamental properties of the sample. Further, when using a wet cell with a TEM, images should be taken immediately since the energy of the beam quickly de-hydrates the small amount of fluid within the sample. Using conventional techniques, this does not lend itself to accurate particle and agglomerate size characterization much less quantification of other physio-chemical properties.","Besides standard TEM use, the current suite of options available to observe objects at the nanoscale in situ includes the electron cryo-microscope, dynamic light scattering (DLS), small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), small angle neutron scattering (SANS), and others adapted for more specific applications. The electron cryo-microscope presents drawbacks to drying similar to the TEM and SEM as the sample must be flash frozen into vitreous ice. The procedure distorts the image as well as limiting sample thickness that may be addressed. Moreover, it is undesirable to freeze a sample because the properties of the solution, including species interaction and separation, change. Dynamic light scattering is a very reliable way to determine particle size. DLS works with a broad range of materials in most instances. However, DLS does not work well with non-spherical species such as carbon nanotubes or DNA. Like DLS, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) are broadly used in research and industry. SAXS has a rather low observable size limit, not able to detect the length of most carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and is best suited for analyzing the surface and bulk properties of larger samples. SANS shares some of the undesirable traits of SAXS and adds the threat of sample damage via neutron-particle interaction. This degrades observation of the extent of colloidal agglomeration, for example.","Existing methods, devices, developments and publications are inherently limited. U.S. Pat. No. 4,071,766, to Kalman et al., employs a film-sealed micro-chamber to hold a wet sample. There are bores or pipes to introduce fluid to this micro-chamber. However, the large chamber or gap height (the length that the electron beam needs to traverse) makes it impractical for use in transmission electron microscopy. For medium high-voltage TEMs, typical sample thickness which is transparent to electron beam is below 700 nm.","Fukami et al. use a design similar to Kalman et al. but with an assembly comprising multiple parts to form the chamber instead of one integral part. A. Fukami and K. Fukushima, Proc. Eighth European Congress on Electron Microscopy, Budapest, pp. 71-80, 1984. A Fukami, K. Fukushima and N. Kohyama, Observation Techniques for Wet Clay Minerals Using Film-Sealed Environmental Cell Equipment Attached to High-Resolution Electron Microscope, In: Microstructure of Fine-Grained Sediments from Mud to Scale, R. H. Bennett, W. R. Bryant, M. H. Hulbert (eds.), New York: Springer-Verlag, pp. 321-331, 1991. Carbon films supported by copper grids are used as the sealing film. Again, the spacing between the films is large. The film is easily broken which can result in extreme damage to microscopy equipment.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,406,087, to Fujiyoshi et al., describes a specimen-holding device that is quite similar to the Fukami et al. design. Two polymer films are pressed together directly by backing copper grids and the samples are trapped between the films. The polymer films and the thin copper grids tend to deform making it impossible to form thin liquid films over relatively large areas. Further, the film is easily broken which can result in extreme damage to microscopy equipment. Moreover, the design does not have any element to control the size of the gap and requires accurate alignment of the grids, which is difficult.","Williamson et al. construct a wet cell by gluing two SiN\u2014coated silicon wafers face to face. M. J. Williamson, R. M. Tromp, P. M. Vereecken, R. Hull, and F. M. Ross, -, Vol. 2, pp. 532-536, August 2003. Each wafer has a SiNthin film membrane window formed by selective etching. The wafers are adhered to one another around the edges and a gap between the wafers is created with a deposited SiOspacer element. Liquid is loaded into the cell through ports on one wafer. The cell is sealed by gluing sapphire plates over the ports. This invention involves a tedious and time-consuming process involving multiple gluing and curing steps. Further, the glue tends to enlarge the gap. This device does not provide for a sample that is thin enough for observation of desired characteristics.","The following U. S. patents suffer from similar drawbacks as discussed above: U.S. Pat. No. 7,476,871 to Chao et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 7,304,313 to Moses et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 7,253,418 to Moses et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 7,230,242 to Behar et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 7,219,565 to Fischione et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,992,300 to Moses et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,989,542 to Moses et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,412,211 to Knowles; U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,964 to Knowles et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,097,134 to Kimoto et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,705,949 to Grimes et al.","A process capable of allowing one to analyze in situ samples of a broad nature mitigates many of the above limitations of conventional methods. Further, it would be advantageous to have a sample holding device with the following characteristics: self-aligning windows on holder pieces and wafers, thus providing for ease of assembling the sample in the holder; a controllable sample volume (gap) thickness via modifying spacer (integral to the wafer or separate) thickness; uniform sample volume thickness; improved spatial resolution resulting from reduced gap (sample volume) thickness; improved resolution resulting from use of ultra-thin (<100 nm) membranes as windows, in particular SiN\u2014coated membranes; durable and reliable sealing of the sample combined with a window pattern that provides reinforcement resulting in safe use in vacuum environments.","A reliable readily implemented in situ imaging technique embodied in select embodiments of the present invention has the above characteristics and allows direct examination of nano-fluid samples without affecting basic characteristics, such as nano-particle dispersion.","Select embodiments of the present invention comprise a reusable sample-holding device for readily loading very small wet samples for observation of the samples, in particular in a vacuum environment. Select embodiments of the present invention may be used with an electron microscope, such as a transmission electron microscope (TEM), an x-ray microscope, optical microscope, and the like. Select embodiments of the present invention provide a small volume formed between two silicon wafers for holding the sample via use of a \u201cspacer,\u201d such as a washer, for separating the wafers. This volume may be adjustable by employing spacers of different thicknesses. The spacers may be integral with one side of one or both of the silicon wafers or may be separate pieces. Alternatively, the thickness of the film established by the fluid in which the sample exists may determine the volume (gap) without need for use of a spacer.","Each silicon wafer is provided with a transparent thin-film silicon nitride (SiN) membrane that serves as a transparency affixed over an opening (window) in a center section in each silicon wafer. A portion of the center of each wafer is removed, e.g. by etching, to provide for affixing the membrane on one side of the center portion of each wafer, the membrane, e.g. one of SiNless than about 100 nm thick, preferably about 50 nm thick. Thin membranes assure high resolution although at the expense of being somewhat fragile at a thickness less than 100 nm. In select embodiments of the present invention, high vapor pressure fluid is held in the small volume, typically a uniform gap established between the two silicon wafers by the spacer or spacers. In select embodiments of the present invention, a uniform gap may be maintained by inserting a washer between the silicon wafers and centering the washer on the window (opening) in the center of each wafer.","In select embodiments of the present invention, a sample may be observed through either side of the transparent thin-film membranes incorporated in each of the silicon wafers although the top section of the device may be specifically configured to interface with specialized instruments such as a TEM and thus optimize viewing through a configuration integral with the top of the device. In select embodiments of the present invention, the openings (windows) in similarly shaped silicon wafers are automatically aligned during assembly since the windows are centered in each of the silicon wafers and the wafers are the same shape and length (along their perimeter) as a depression in the lower part of select embodiments of the present invention (i.e., the sample holding device) for retaining the silicon wafers and spacer or spacers.","Select embodiments of the present invention successfully and reliably seal fluid, typically a liquid, between the silicon wafers through use of seals such as O-rings. Further, select embodiments of the present invention are compatible with a high vacuum environment as is found in electron and x-ray microscopy.","Select embodiments of the present invention permit quick and easy studies of samples placed in a fluid. In select embodiments of the present invention, maintaining a consistent gap between two identical \u201cwindowed\u201d silicon wafers assures uniform thickness of the sample while providing very thin transparent membranes as the window material ensures high resolution. Select embodiments of the present invention further may be employed with \u201clab on a chip\u201d designs that incorporate electrodes and fluidic elements for detecting and recording changes that may be imposed on the sample during viewing, such as temperature and pressure changes, electrical and magnetic field changes, and the like.","Select embodiments of the present invention are employed by sandwiching a fluid containing the sample of interest between two silicon wafers incorporating thin-film membrane windows in the center of the side of each wafer abutting the fluid containing the sample. The thin-film membrane preferably comprises SiN. Thin-film membranes are available from Structure Probe, Inc., P.O. Box 656, West Chester, Pa. 19380. Preferably the thin-film membrane \u201cwindows\u201d are fabricated by etching the center of a silicon wafer of original thickness about 200 \u03bcm to a thickness less than about 100 nm and coating the resultant thinned portion of the etched section with SiNto create a thin-membrane SiNwindow for observing samples immersed in a fluid or wet samples. Preferably this thin-membrane SiNwindow is of a thickness about 50 nm.","Select embodiments of the present invention comprise as major components a two-piece configuration of a top and bottom section that abut upon final securing of a sample. The bottom section further comprises an \u201cimpression\u201d with an opening in its center that coincides with the openings (windows) of the two silicon wafers separated by one or more spacers to be placed therein. The impression holds and \u201cindexes\u201d the spaced apart wafers so that the center-located windows of the wafers are aligned with each other and the openings in the top and bottom sections. The impression also incorporates a circular slot for each of an inner and outer O-ring. These O-rings are secured upon affixing the top section to the bottom section. The opening (window) in the center of each silicon wafer is covered with a transparent thin-film membrane, e.g., a membrane of SiN4 that is affixed to the side of the wafer abutting the sample. Preferably the thin-film membranes are of a thickness of less than about 100 nm. The windows are aligned to permit viewing of the sample from either the top or the bottom of the holder device although select embodiments of the present invention embodiments are specifically configured to interface with existing systems for viewing only from the top. In select embodiments of the present invention, various materials, sample holder sizes, and thicknesses may be employed to address specific user requirements. In select embodiments of the present invention, a wafer \u201csandwich\u201d is placed in a sample holder comprised at least in part of non-magnetic material and incorporates O-rings that create a seal holding a vacuum for the fluid containing the sample placed in the device. Emplacing and securing a wet sample in an embodiment of the present invention takes 10-15 minutes. For select embodiments of the present invention, no alteration to the viewing instrument, such as a microscope or a TEM unit, is necessary.","A method of employing select embodiments of the present invention to allow microscopic observation of a sample comprises: acquiring and sizing the sample to be observed; inserting the sample in a fluid; positioning the top and bottom pieces for the holder device for cleaning; cleaning the top and bottom pieces with a suitable solvent such as isopropyl alcohol; placing a first O-ring in the slot in the bottom piece, placing a first silicon wafer incorporating a first SiNthin-film membrane in its center in the impression in the bottom piece; placing fluid containing the sample of interest on the center of the first silicon wafer with a pipette or similar device; placing a spacer centered over the center of the first silicon wafer if neither the first or second silicon wafers have an integral spacer or an integral spacer of sufficient depth; placing a second silicon nitride wafer incorporating a second window, the second window abutting the fluid containing the sample in the impression, the second silicon wafer self-aligning in the impression with the first silicon wafer; placing a second inner O-ring in a slot encircling the window in the top piece; placing an outer O-ring in a slot in the top piece, the outer O-ring capable of encircling the entire impression of the bottom piece; placing the top piece with inserted O-rings over the bottom piece, aligning screw heads in the bottom piece with slots in the top piece; rotating the top piece to align it under the screw heads and tightening the screw heads as necessary for retention of the seals made by the O-rings, and emplacing the resultant sample holding device in proximity to the viewing device, indexing the holding device with the viewing device as necessary.","Refer to  depicting a vertical slice longitudinally through a select embodiment of the present invention, specifically detailing the center section of the embodiment.

The bottom piece  is etched completely through its center creating a centered opening D and includes an etched rectangular slot  centered over the opening D. The rectangular slot  is configured to contain silicon wafers ,  and \u201cindexes\u201d the wafers ,  in the sample holder  via a matching fit of the wafers ,  to the sidewalls A of the etched rectangular slot . Prior to final assembly of the sample  in the sample holder , a first O-ring  is placed in a circular slot B centered within the etched rectangular slot .

Alternatively, the spacer  may be incorporated in either or both of the silicon wafers ,  by etching or the like to meet a user's requirements. The sample  is placed upon the SiN\u2014coated window A and a second silicon wafer  configured like the first silicon wafer  in size and dimension to include a SiN\u2014coated window A centered thereon is placed, with the SiN\u2014coated window A abutting the sample , upon the spacer  in the rectangular slot . A second O-ring  is placed in a slot C circumscribing the rectangular slot . A third O-ring  with a diameter similar to the first O-ring  is placed in a slot B in the top piece , the top piece  incorporating an opening D similar to that of the bottom piece  and aligned therewith upon final assembly of the sample holder . The top piece  is affixed to the bottom piece  via suitable fasteners inserted in threaded holes , compressing all O-rings , ,  to form a seal suitable for operation in a vacuum. The sample holder  may incorporate a tab  incorporating a hole A for indexing in observation equipment, such as an SEM or a TEM, or for hanging on a hook in a storage container.","Refer to , a perspective top view of major parts of an alternative embodiment of the sample holder  of , further depicting relative size compared to a dime . The top (abutting) side of the bottom piece  and the bottom (abutting) side of the top piece  is shown, both top and bottom ,  pieces differing from the embodiment of  in that the large O-ring  is incorporated in the slot  of the top piece  in the embodiment of . The slots  in the top piece  are configured to permit rotating the top piece  once fasteners (machine screws)  are loosened. To install the top piece , the wide part of the slots  is placed over the fasteners  and then rotated to the narrow part of the slot . The fasteners  are then torqued to bring the bottom of the top piece  in contact with the top of the bottom piece , compressing the O-rings , ,  in the process. This slot configuration  further facilitates both placement and removal of samples  quickly and easily without potential for losing fasteners (machine screws)  that otherwise would need to be completely removed to assemble or disassemble the sample holder . In , the silicon wafers ,  are shown separately from the sample holder  for perspective.
