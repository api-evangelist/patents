title: Quantum repeater and system and method for creating extended entanglements
abstract: An iterative method is provided for progressively building an end-to-end entanglement between qubits in first and second end nodes () of a chain of nodes whose intermediate nodes () are quantum repeaters. At each iteration, a current operative repeater () of the chain merges an entanglement existing between qubits in the first end node () and the operative repeater, with a local entanglement formed between qubits in the operative repeater and its neighbor node towards the second end node (). For the first iteration, the operative repeater is the neighbor of the first end node (); thereafter, for each new iteration the operative repeater shifts one node further along the chain toward the second end node (). A quantum repeater adapted for implementing this method is also provided.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention relates to quantum repeaters and to systems and methods for creating extended entanglements.","In quantum information systems, information is held in the \u201cstate\u201d of a quantum system; typically this will be a two-level quantum system providing for a unit of quantum information called a quantum bit or \u201cqubit\u201d. Unlike classical digital states which are discrete, a qubit is not restricted to discrete states but can be in a superposition of two states at any given time.","Any two-level quantum system can be used for a qubit and several physical implementations have been realized including ones based on the polarization states of single photons, electron spin, nuclear spin, and the coherent state of light.","Quantum network connections provide for the communication of quantum information between remote end points. Potential uses of such connections include the networking of quantum computers, and \u201cquantum key distribution\u201d (QKD) in which a quantum channel and an authenticated (but not necessarily secret) classical channel with integrity are used to create shared, secret, random classical bits. Generally, the processes used to convey the quantum information over a quantum network connection provide degraded performance as the transmission distance increases thereby placing an upper limit between end points. Since in general it is not possible to copy a quantum state, the separation of endpoints cannot be increased by employing repeaters in the classical sense.","One way of transferring quantum information between two spaced locations uses the technique known as \u2018quantum teleportation\u2019. This makes uses of two entangled qubits, known as a Bell pair, situated at respective ones of the spaced locations; the term \u201centanglement\u201d is also used in the present specification to refer to two entangled qubits The creation of such a distributed Bell pair is generally mediated by photons sent over an optical channel (for example, an optical waveguide such as optical fibre). Although this process is distance limited, where a respective qubit from two separate Bell Pairs are co-located, it is possible to combine (or \u2018merge\u2019) the Bell pairs by a local quantum operation effected, between the co-located qubits. This process, known as \u2018entanglement swapping\u2019, results in an entanglement between the two non co-located qubits of the Bell pairs while the co-located qubits cease to be entangled, at all.","The device hosting the co-located qubits and which performs the local quantum operation to merge the Bell pairs is called a \u201cquantum repeater\u201d. The basic role of a quantum repeater is to create a respective Bell pair with each of two neighbouring spaced nodes and then to merge the Bell pairs. By chaining multiple quantum repeaters, an end-to-end entanglement can be created between end points separated by any distance thereby permitting the transfer of quantum information between arbitrarily-spaced end points.","It may be noted that while QKD does not directly require entangled states, the creation of long-distance Bell pairs through the use of quantum repeaters facilitates long-distance QKD. Furthermore, most other applications of distributed quantum computation will use distributed Bell pairs.","The present invention is concerned with the creation of entanglement between spaced qubits and with the form, management and interaction of quantum repeaters to facilitate the creation of entanglements between remote end points.","According to the present invention, there is provided a quantum repeater as set out in the accompanying claim . The quantum repeater is usable as a intermediate node in a chain of nodes, to permit an end-to-end entanglement between qubits in end nodes of the chain of nodes","Also provided is a method of creating an end-to-end entanglement between qubits in end nodes of a chain of nodes whose intermediate nodes are quantum repeaters, the method being as set out in accompanying claim .","Basic Entanglement Creation and Extension Operations","Entanglement Operation ()",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["1","2","1","1","2","4"]},"Considering  in more detail, a light field  emitted by an emitter  (snapshot (a)) is passed through the physical qubit qb (snapshot (b)) which is in a prepared non-classical state (for example: 0, +1); typically, the physical qubit implementation is as electron spin, the electron being set into a predetermined state immediately prior to passage of the light field. The light field  and qubit qb interact, with the light field  effectively \u2018capturing\u2019 the quantum state of the qubit qb. The light field  then travels down the optical fibre  (snapshots (c) and (d)) and interacts with qubit qb (snapshot (e)) before being measured at detector  (snapshot (f)); if successful, this results in the \u2018transfer\u2019 of the quantum state of qubit qb to qubit qb, entangling these qubits (in , this entanglement is represented by double-headed arrowed arc , this form of representation being used generally throughout the drawings to depict entanglements). The properties of the light field  measured by detector  enable a determination to be made as whether or not the entanglement operation was successful. The success or failure of the entanglement operation is then passed back to the qb end of the fibre  in a classical (non-quantum) message  (snapshot (g)). This message can be very simple in form (the presence or absence of a single pulse) and as used herein the term \u201cmessage\u201d is to be understood to encompass both such simple forms as well as structured messages of any degree of complexity (subject to processing time constraints); in embodiments where the message  needs to identify a particular qubit amongst several as well as the success or failure of an entanglement operation, the message may still take the form of the presence or absence of a single pulse with the timing of the latter being used to identify the qubit concerned. Where there is a need to transmit information about the success\/failure of the entanglement operation (or to identify an involved qubit) back to the qb end of the fibre , the overall elapsed time for the entanglement operation is at least the round trip propagation time along the fibre , even where the entanglement operation is successful.","An entanglement operation can be performed to entangle qubits qb and qb whether or not qb is already entangled with another qubit (in the case of qb already being entangled with another qubit qbj when an entanglement operation is performed between qb and qb, this results in the states of all three qubits qb, qb and qbj becoming entangled).","The properties of the light field  measured by detector  also enable a determination to be made, in the case of a successful entanglement operation, as to whether the entangled states of the qb and qb are correlated or anti-correlated, this generally being referred to as the \u2018parity\u2019 of the entanglement (even and odd parity respectively corresponding to correlated and anti-correlated qubit states). It is normally important to know the parity of an entanglement when subsequently using it; as a result, either parity information must be stored or steps taken to ensure that the parity always ends up the same (for example, if an odd parity is determined, the state of qb can be flipped to produce an even parity whereby the parity of the entanglement between qb and qb always ends up even).","In fact, the relative parity of two entangled, qubits is a two dimensional quantity often called the \u201cgeneralized parity\u201d and comprising both a qubit parity value and a conjugate qubit parity value. For a simple entanglement operation as depicted in , the conjugate qubit parity value information is effectively even parity and need not be measured. \u201cGeneralized parity\u201d requires two classical bits to represent it. In certain applications (such as QKD), knowledge of the conjugate qubit parity value information may not be required. Hereinafter, except where specific reference is being made to one of the components of \u201cgeneralized parity\u201d (that is, to the qubit parity value or the conjugate qubit parity value), reference to \u201cparity\u201d is to be understood to mean \u201cgeneralized parity\u201d but with the understanding that in appropriate cases, the conjugate qubit parity value information can be omitted.","As already indicated, the qubits qb and qb are typically physically implemented as electron spin. However, the practical lifetime of quantum information stored in this way is very short (of the order of 10seconds cumulative) and therefore generally, immediately following the interaction of the light field  with qb and qb, the quantum state of the qubit concerned is transferred to nuclear spin which has a much longer useful lifetime (typically of the order of a second, cumulatively). The quantum state can be later transferred back to electron spin for a subsequent light field interaction (such as to perform a merge of two entanglements, described, below).","Another practical feature worthy of note is that the physical qubits qb and qb are generally kept shuttered from light except for the passage of light field . To facilitate this at the qb end of the fibre  (and to trigger setting the qubit into a prepared state immediately prior to its interaction with light field ), the light field  can be preceded by a \u2018herald\u2019 light pulse ; this light pulse is detected at the qb end of the fibre  and used to trigger priming of the qubit qb and then its un-shuttering for interaction with the light field . Other ways of triggering these tasks are alternatively possible.","The relationship between the probability of successfully creating a Bell pair, the distance between qubits involved, and the fidelity of the created pair is complex. By way of example, for one particular implementation using a light field in the form of a laser pulse of many photons. Bell pairs are created with fidelities of 0.77 or 0.638 for 10 km and 20 km distances respectively between qubits, and the creation succeeds on thirty eight to forty percent of the attempts. The main point is that the entanglement operation depicted, in  is distance limited; for simplicity, in the following a probability of success of 0.25 is assumed at a distance of 10 km.","LLE Creation Subsystem ()","An assembly of components for carrying out an entanglement operation is herein referred to as an \u201centanglement creation subsystem\u201d and may be implemented locally within a piece of apparatus or between remotely located pieces of apparatus (generally referred to as nodes).  depicts an example of the latter case where two nodes  and  are optically coupled by an optical fibre ; optical fibres, such as the fibre , providing a node-to-node link are herein called \u201clocal link\u201d fibres. The nodes ,  of  include components for implementing respective qubits qb and qb (for ease of understanding, the same qubit designations are used in  as in ). The qubits qb and qb, together with an emitter  associated with qb, a detector  associated with qb, the local link fibre  and entanglement-operation control logic in each node (not shown), form an entanglement creation subsystem  for creating an entanglement  between qubits qb and qb. An entanglement of this sort created by a light field, passed across a local link fibre between nodes is herein called a \u201clocal link entanglement\u201d or \u201cLLE\u201d; the node-spanning entanglement creation subsystem  is correspondingly called an \u201cLLE creation subsystem\u201d.","Elongate Operation ()","An entanglement such as created by a FIG. LA entanglement operation can be \u2018extended\u2019 to create a new entanglement involving one of the originally-entangled qubits and a new qubit, the latter typically being located at a greater distance from the involved originally-entangled qubit than the other originally-entangled qubit.  illustrate two ways of extending an initial entanglement  between qubits qb and qb (referenced ) to form an entanglement between qubit qb and another qubit; both ways involve the passing of light fields through various qubits followed by measurement of the light fields but, for simplicity, the light fields themselves and the optical fibres typically used to channel them have been omitted from .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B"],"b":["2","8","1","2","1","3","10","2","2","3","3","11","2","3","8","11","1","2","3","12","2","2","2","3","2","1","3","1","3","12","1","3","1","2","3","2","1","3"]},"After the X measurement  has been made to eliminate qb from entanglement, an extended entanglement is left between qb and qb\u2014this extended, entanglement is depicted as medium thick are  in snapshot (d) of .","The parity of the extended entanglement  is a combination of the parities of the entanglements  and  and a conjugate qubit parity value determined from the X measurement (in the above example, the X measurement gives either a +1 or \u22121 result\u2014this sign is the conjugate qubit parity value). Where qubit parity value information and conjugate qubit parity value information are each represented by binary values \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 for even and odd parity respectively, the qubit parity value information and conjugate qubit parity value information of the extended, entanglement are respective XOR (Exclusive OR) combinations of the corresponding component parities.","It may be noted that a functionally equivalent result to the  elongate operation can be obtained by first entangling qb with qb by means of an entanglement operation in which the mediating light field passes first through qb, and then removing qb from entanglement by effecting an X measurement on it. In the present specification, for linguistic clarity, reference to an \u2018elongate operation\u2019 (with its integral X measurement) only encompasses the case where the initial entanglement performed as part of the elongate operation is effected by a light field first passing through a qubit of the entanglement being extended; the above described functional equivalent to the elongate operation is treated, as being separate entanglement and X measurement operations.","Where the objective is to set up an entanglement between two qubits spaced by a substantial distance, the elongate operation described above with reference to  is not that useful by itself. This is because should the component entanglement operation (see (a) of ) fail, then the pre-existing entanglement that is being extended (entanglement  in ) will be destroyed. In effect, the probability of successfully creating the extended entanglement  is the product of the success probabilities of the entanglement operations used to create entanglements  and . As already noted, the probability of a successful entanglement operation is distance related so the chances of successfully creating an entanglement over long distances using only elongate operations to successively extend an initial entanglement, are poor. The same problem exists with the described functional equivalent of the elongate operation.","Merge Operation ()","A better approach is to use the merge operation illustrated in  to knit together independently created entanglements that individually span substantial distances; this approach effectively decouples the success probabilities associated, with the individual entanglements as a failure of one attempt to create such an entanglement does not destroy the other entanglements. Of course, to be useful, the merge operation used to join the individual entanglements must itself be highly reliable and this is achieved by carrying it out over extremely short distances.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1C"],"b":["8","1","2","16","4","14","5","15","1","5","19","2","4","8","16","8","16","2","4","2","4","8","16","2","2","4","2","4","17","1","5","18","2","4","19","1","5","2","4","1","5"]},"The measurements made as part of the merge operation provide both an indication of the success or otherwise of the merge, and an indication of the \u201cgeneralized parity\u201d of the merge operation. For example, the first merge-operation process may measure a qubit parity value and the second, merge-operation process, the conjugate qubit parity value. In this case, the second process can be effected either as a single X measurement using a light field passed through both qubits qb and qb (in which case the light field has a different value to that used in the first process e.g. 0,+1 as opposed to 0,\u22121), or as individual X measurements, subsequently combined, made individually on qb, and qb, the latter approach being depicted in . The parity of the extended entanglement  will be a combination of the parities of the entanglements  and  and the parity of the merge operation. As before, where qubit parity value information and conjugate qubit parity value information are each represented by binary values \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 for even and odd parity respectively, the qubit parity value information and conjugate qubit parity value information of the extended entanglement are respective XOR (Exclusive OR) combinations of the corresponding component parities.","Information about the success or otherwise of the merge operation is passed in classical messages to the end qubit locations as otherwise these locations do not know whether the qubits qb, qb are entangled; alternatively since the failure probability of a merge operation is normally very low, success can be assumed and no success\/failure message sent\u2014in this case, it will be up to applications consuming the extended entanglement  to detect and compensate for merge failure leading to absence of entanglement. As the parity of the extended entanglement will normally need to be known to make use of the entangled qubits, parity information needed, to determine the parity of the extended entanglement  is also passed on to one or other of the end qubit locations.","It will be appreciated that the form of merge operation described above with respect to  is effectively an elongate operation carried, out over a very short distance between qb and qb to extend entanglement , together with an X measurement on qb to remove it from entanglement (qb having been removed from entanglement by the X measurement performed as part of the elongate operation). Of course, unlike the  example elongate operation where the qubit qb to which the entanglement  is being extended is not itself already entangled, the equivalent qubit qb in  is already involved in a second entanglement ; however, as already noted, an elongate operation encompasses this possibility.","As already noted, the merge operation is a local operation (between qubits qb and qb in ) that is effected over a very short distance and thus has a high probability of success. A merge operation takes of the order of 10secs.","Quantum Repeater ()","In practice, when seeking to create an extended entanglement between two qubits which are located in respective end nodes separated by a distance greater than that over which a basic entanglement operation can be employed with any reasonable probability of success, one or more intermediate nodes, called quantum repeaters, are used to merge basic entanglements that together span the distance between the end nodes. Each quantum repeater node effectively implements a merge operation on a local pair of qubits that correspond, to the qubits qb and qb of  and are involved in respective entanglements with qubits in other nodes.  depicts such a quantum repeater node  forming one node in a chain (sequential series) of nodes terminated by left and right end nodes  and  that respectively accommodate the qubits qb, qb it is desired to entangle (but which are too far apart to entangle directly using an entanglement operation). In the present example, the chain of nodes comprises three nodes with the left and right end nodes ,  also forming the left and right neighbour nodes of the quantum repeater . The quantum repeater  is connected to its left and right neighbour nodes ,  by left and right local link optical fibres L and R respectively. It is to be noted that the terms \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d as used throughout the present specification are simply to be understood as convenient labels for distinguishing opposite senses (directions along: ends of; and the like) of the chain of nodes that includes a quantum repeater.","The quantum repeater  effectively comprises left and right portions or sides (labeled \u201cL\u201d and \u201cR\u201d in ) each comprising a respective qubit qb, qb (for ease of understanding, the same qubit designation are used, in  as in ). The qubit qb of the left neighbour node  and qb of the quantum repeater node  are part of a LLE creation subsystem formed between these nodes and operative to create a left LLE  (shown as a dashed arrowed are  in ) between qb and qb. Similarly, the qubit qb of the right neighbour node  and qb of the quantum repeater node  are part of a LLE creation subsystem formed, between these nodes and operative to create a right LLE  between qb and q.","It may be noted that the direction of travel (left-to-right or right-to-left) of the light field used to set up each LLE is not critical whereby the disposition of the associated emitters and detectors can be set as desired. For example, the light fields involved in creating LLEs  and  could both be sent out from the quantum repeater  meaning that the emitters are disposed in the quantum repeater  and the detectors in the left and right neighbour nodes , . However, to facilitate chaining of quantum repeaters of the same form, it is convenient if the light fields all travel in the same direction along the chain of nodes; for example, the light fields can be arranged all to travel from left to right in which case the left side L of the quantum repeater  will include the detector for creating the left LLE  and the right side R will include the emitter for creating the right LLE . For simplicity, and unless otherwise stated, a left-to-right direction of travel of the light field between the nodes will be assumed hereinafter unless otherwise stated; the accompanying claims are not, however, to be interpreted as restricted to any particular direction of travel of the light field, or to the direction of travel being the same across different links, unless so stated or implicitly required.","In operation of the quantum repeater , after creation, in any order, of the left and right LLEs  and , a local merge operation  involving the qubits qb and qb is effected thereby to merge the left LLE  and the right LLE  and form extended entanglement  between the qubits qb and qb in the end nodes  and  respectively.","If required, information about the success or otherwise of the merge operation and about parity is passed in classical messages  from the quantum repeater  to the nodes , .","Regarding the parity information, where the parity of the local link entanglements has been standardized, (by qubit state flipping as required), only the merge parity information needs to be passed on by the quantum repeater and either node  or  can make use of this information. However, where LLE parity information has simply been stored, then the quantum repeater needs to pass on whatever parity information it possesses; for example, where the parities of the left and right LLEs ,  are respectively known by the quantum repeater  and the node , the quantum repeater  needs to pass on to node  both the parity information on LLE  and the merge parity information, typically after combining the two. Node  can now determine the parity of the extended entanglement by combining the parity information it receives from the quantum repeater  with the parity information it already knows about LLE .","From the foregoing, it can be seen that although the merge operation itself is very rapid (of the order of 10seconds), there is generally a delay corresponding to the message propagation time to the furthest one of the nodes ,  before the extended entanglement  is usefully available to these nodes.","By chaining together multiple quantum repeaters, it is possible to create an extended entanglement between any arbitrarily spaced pair of nodes.  illustrates this for a chain of N nodes comprising left and right end nodes  and  respectively, and a series of (N\u22122) quantum repeaters  (each labeled \u201cQR\u201d and diagrammatically depicted for simplicity as a rectangle with two circles that represent L and R qubits). The nodes - are interconnected into a chain by optical fibres (not shown) and are numbered from left to right\u2014the number n of each node is given beneath each node and node number \u201cj\u201d represents an arbitrary QR node  along the chain. The node number of a QR node can be used as a suffix to identify the node; thus \u201cQR\u201d is a reference to the quantum repeater node numbered j. This node representation, numbering and identification is used generally throughout the present specification.","In , three existing entanglements , , and  are shown between qubits in respective node pairings; for convenience, when referring at a high level to entanglements along a chain of nodes, a particular entanglement will herein be identified by reference to the pair of nodes holding the qubits between which the entanglement exists, this reference taking the form of a two-element node-number tuple. Thus, entanglement , which is a local link entanglement LLE between qubits in the neighbouring nodes numbered (N\u22121) and N, is identifiable by the node number tuple {(N\u22121), N}. Entanglements  and  (shown by medium thick arcs in ) are extended entanglements existing between qubits in the node pairings and {1, j} and {j,(N\u22121)} respectively, these entanglements having been created by the merging of LLEs. To create an end-to-end (abbreviated herein to \u201cE2E\u201d) entanglement between qubits in the left and right end nodes ,  (see thick arc  in ), entanglements  and  can first be merged by QRwith the resultant extended entanglement then being merged with LLE  by QR; alternatively, entanglements  and  can first be merged by QRwith the resultant extended entanglement then being merged with entanglement  by QR.","Entanglement Build Path","The \u201centanglement build path\u201d (EBP) of an entanglement is the aggregate qubit-to-qubit path taken by the mediating light field or fields used in the creation of an un-extended or extended entanglement; where there are multiple path segments (that is, the path involves more than two qubits), the light fields do not necessarily traverse their respective segments in sequence as will be apparent from a consideration of how the  E2E entanglement is built (in this example, the entanglement build path is the path from one end node to the other via the left and right side qubits of the chain of quantum repeaters).","Representation of Low Level Quantum Physical Hardware","The particular form of physical implementation of a qubit and the details of the methods of performing entanglement, elongate, and merge operations (for example, whether very weak amounts of light or laser pulses of many photons are used) are not of direct relevance to the present invention and accordingly will not be further described herein, it being understood that appropriate implementations will be known to persons skilled, in the art. Instead, the physical hardware for implementing the quantum operations (the \u201cquantum physical hardware\u201d) will be represented in terms of a basic block, herein called a \u201cQ-block\u201d, that provides for the implementation of, and interaction with, one qubit, and an associated optical fabric.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["40","42","44"]},"Q-block variety  represents the physical hardware needed to manifest a qubit and carry out the \u201cCapture\u201d interaction of  with that qubit, that is, the controlled sending of a light field through the qubit in a prepared state.

One reason not to be more specific about whether a Q-block is of a Capture or Transfer variety is that often either variety could be used, provided, that a cooperating Q-block is of the other variety (the direction of travel of light fields between them not being critical).","Regardless of variety, every Q-block will be taken to include functionality for carrying out an X measurement in response to receipt of an Xmeas signal  thereby enabling the Q-block to be used in elongate and merge operations; the X measurement result is provided in the Result signal , it being appreciated that where the Q-block has Transfer interaction functionality, the X measurement functionality will typically use the detector  associated with the Transfer interaction functionality. X measurement functionality is not, of course, needed for an entanglement operation and could therefore be omitted from Q-blocks used only for such operations.","It may be noted that where there are multiple Q-blocks in a node, the opportunity exists to share certain components between Q-blocks (for example, where there are multiple Q-blocks with Capture interaction functionality, a common light-field emitter may be used for all such Q-blocks).

The signal monitored to detect this loss of signal is typically a continuously-present carrier signal used to carry the MC channel signals but could alternatively be a dedicated integrity-monitoring signal. On detecting a fibre break, the integrity monitor unit  outputs a \u2018Path_broken\u2019 signal. This enables the left end node to be rapidly informed of a failure of the fibre used for the MC messages.","Reversing Direction of Light Fields in LLE Creation","As already indicated, the terms \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d are simply convenient labels for relative directions along the node chain. The  embodiment could equally as well been described in terms of the light fields passing from right to left in the LLE creation subsystems (in which case, for LLE creation, the L-side Q-blocks need Capture interaction functionality and the R-side Q-blocks need Transfer interaction functionality) and E2E entanglements being built from the right end node.","A more interesting case is to reverse the direction of travel of the light fields involved in LLE creation (to be right-to-left) while still building E2E entanglements from the left end node. In fact, only small changes are needed to the right and left LLE control-unit state machines L, R to accommodate this case:\n\n","With regard to parity information, the repeater measures and stores the parity of its right LLE (rather than its left LLE), and merge control unit updates the received cumulative parity information by combining it with the stored right LLE parity and the parity of the local merge operation. The result is that the cumulative parity information received by a repeater is directly the parity of the entanglement between the left end node and the repeater.","It may also be noted that a hybrid form of repeater, with two complimentary varieties, is possible in which the direction of travel of the light fields during LLE creation, is opposite for the left and right sides of the repeater. Thus, in one variety of this hybrid repeater, the light fields are generated by the left and right sides of the repeater and after passage through L and R qubits respectively, are sent out over left and right local link fibres to the left and right neighbour nodes; in the other variety of this hybrid repeater, the light fields are received by the left and right sides of the repeater over left and right local link fibres respectively from the left and right neighbour nodes, are passed through L and R qubits respectively, and are then measured. It will be appreciated that in a chain of quantum repeaters of the foregoing hybrid form, it is necessary to alternate the two varieties of repeater. It will further be appreciated that the control units , ,  can be arranged to build E2E entanglements from left to right or from right to left as desired.","Left End Node","With regard to the operation of the left end node of the chain of nodes whose intermediate nodes are constituted by \u201cExtend-from-End\u201d quantum repeaters  of the  form, this left end node  () comprises quantum physical hardware  including a R-side Capture Q block  coupled to a local link fibre  connecting to the right neighbour repeater node, and a controller  with an associated qubit timeout timer . This controller  communicates with the right neighbour node over the LLEC and MC channels; the controller is also arranged to exchange messages with a local E2E-entanglement consumer application . The operation of the left-end-node controller  can be represented by a state machine  with a state transition diagram of the form shown in , this state machine being similar to the R-LLE control-unit state machine R () but with modifications including two extra states one of which corresponds to waiting for the return of an EchoMe message, and the other of which corresponds to the R-side qubit of the left end node being successfully entangled with a L-side qubit of the right end node.","More particularly, the left-end-node state machine  has a first state  labelled \u201cPending\u201d, a second state  labelled \u201cRight Entangled\u201d, a third state  labelled \u201cE2E Entangled\u201d, and a fourth state  labelled \u201cAwait Echo\u201d.

The \u2018merge_succeeded\u2019 LR-MC message is sent even though the left end node has not carried out a merge operation because the successful creation of a right-side LLE is the left end node's equivalent of an \u201cExtend-from-End\u201d repeater merge operation in respect of extending an entanglement, anchored at the left end node, to the right neighbour node. As there is no parity information available (the left end node  does not receive any cumulative parity information, is not involved in a left LLE, and does not carry out a merge operation), the state machine  simply adds neutral parity information, that is, even parity indications, to the \u2018merge_succeeded\u2019 LR-MC message it sends out.","If right-side LLE creation is unsuccessful resulting in receipt of a LLEC \u2018failure\u2019 message, or if the useful lifetime of the R-side qubit times out resulting in receipt of a \u2018Timeout\u2019 signal, then right-side LLE creation is re-initiated (arc ).","When the left-end-node state machine  is in its \u201cRight Entangled\u201d state  following successful right-side LLE creation, one of three relevant events may occur.

Five such modifications are discussed below, it being understood that these modifications can be used alone or in combination to increase the rate of E2E entanglement creation.","1) Freeing-Up the Node Chain for Immediate Re-Use","As so far described, once an E2E entanglement has been created, the chain of nodes (left and right end nodes ,  and intermediate repeater nodes \u2014see ) cannot be re-used until the consumer applications consume the existing E2E entanglement\u2014this is because the E2E entanglement exists between the R Q-block  of the left end node  and the L Q-block  of the right end node .","To free up the R Q-block  of the left end node  and the L Q-block  of the right end node  (and thereby the node chain) without waiting upon the consumer applications, the left and right end nodes ,  can be provided with respective output buffers ,  each comprising multiple Q-blocks ,  respectively. The optical fabric and controller of each end node are set up to enable any selected one of the node's output-buffer Q-blocks ,  to be entangled with the node's R or L Q-block ,  (as the case may be) whereby to move the E2E entanglement across into the selected buffer Q-block; this operation involves substantially the same Capture and Transfer interactions as are depicted in  (but carried out over a short distance and therewith with a high probability of success). Thus, once an the E2E entanglement has been created between the R Q-block  of the left end node  and the L Q-block  of the right end node , the two ends of the entanglement are moved across into available left and right buffer Q-blocks , . The node chain is now free to create another E2E entanglement which in turn can be moved across into available left and right buffer Q-blocks ,  and so on.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0197","num":"0265"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":["186","187","146","166"]},"More particularly, in the left end node , optical merge unit  couples the buffer Q-blocks  to the R Q-Block . The buffer Q-blocks  have Capture interaction functionality and the R Q-block  now possess Transfer interaction capability in addition to the Capture interaction capability if uses to set up an LLE with its neighbour repeater node. To transfer the left end root of an E2E entanglement from the R Q-block  to a particular buffer Q-block , the qubit of latter is first entangled with the qubit of the R Q block  by an entanglement operation; this is effected by selectively energizing the emitter associated with the buffer Q-block  concerned thereby causing a light field to traverse the qubit of that Q-block before being channelled by the optical merge unit  to the R Q-block  (as generally indicated by arrow ). Thereafter, the qubit of the R Q-block  is removed from entanglement by an X measurement operation.","In the right end node , optical merge unit  couples the buffer Q-blocks  to the L Q-Block ; again, the buffer Q-blocks  have Capture interaction functionality and the L Q-block  already possess the required Transfer interaction capability. To transfer the right end roof of an E2E entanglement from the L Q-block  to a particular buffer Q-block , the qubit of the latter is first entangled with the qubit of the L Q block  by an entanglement operation; this is effected by selectively energizing the emitter associated with the buffer Q-block  concerned thereby causing a light field to traverse the qubit of that Q-block before being channelled by the optical merge unit  to the L Q-block  (as generally indicated by arrow ). Thereafter, the qubit of the L Q-block  is removed from entanglement by an X measurement operation.","It will be appreciated that different optical fabric implementations are possible; for example, to reverse the light-field direction of travel  in the right end node, an active optical switch could be used to optically couple the L Q-block  to a selected buffer Q-block  (in this case, the L Q-block  would need Capture interaction capability and the buffer Q-blocks would need Transfer interaction capability).","It will further be appreciated that associated with the operation of moving of an E2E entanglement into a buffer Q-block, will be a parity measurement. If the measured parity is even, no further action is needed as the parity of the E2E entanglement unchanged; however, if the measured parity is odd, then to keep the E2E entanglement the same, the buffer qubit concerned is flipped.","2) Parallel Operation of Node Chain Segments","By splitting the chain of nodes into multiple segments each with its own pair of left and right end nodes, creation of extended entanglements can be effected in parallel (over respective segments); these E2E segment entanglements can then be merged, to created, the final E2E entanglement.","One particular example arrangement of such segmentation is depicted in . In this case, the ultimate end nodes between which it is desired to create an E2E entanglement are left end node  and right end node . The chain of nodes (end nodes ,  and intermediate repeater nodes) is divided into a first segment  and a second segment .","The end nodes of the first segment  are the left end node  and a sub-node  of a segment-spanning node . The segment  is arranged to build an E2E segment entanglement right to left (arrow ) and, to this end, the functionality of the sub-node  corresponds to that of the previously described left end node  whereas the functionality of the left end node  corresponds to that of the previously described right end node .","The end nodes of the second segment  are right end node  and a sub-node  of the segment-spanning node . The segment  is arranged to build an E2E segment entanglement left to right (arrow ) and, to this end, the functionality of the sub-node  corresponds to that of the previously described left end node  whereas the functionality of the right end node  corresponds to that of the previously described right end node .","The segment-spanning node  is the initiator of E2E segment entanglement building over both segments  and  and, in due course, will receive an \u2018E2E succeeded\u2019 message from each of the end nodes  and  informing it of the successful creation of E2E segment entanglements. The segment-spanning node  now merges these E2E segment entanglements to generate the desired E2E entanglement between nodes  and . The segment-spanning node  thus not only possesses end node functionality but also merge functionality.","3) Enhancing LLE Creation Success Rate","As noted above, the probability of a successfully entangling two qubits coupled by a 10 km fibre is of the order of 25% which means that, for quantum repeaters of the  form spaced by distances of the order of 10 km, on average it will take four attempts at entanglement to achieve success, each attempt taking at least the light-speed round trip time between repeaters. This clearly limits the rate at which E2E entanglements can be created. Matters can be improved by increasing the probability of success of each entanglement attempt.","The simplest way of doing this is to expand each LLE creation subsystem by paralleling up the pairing of a R-side Q-block of one repeater and the L-side Q-block of the neighbour repeater so that there are multiple such pairings; at each entanglement attempt every R-side Q-block would be fired at its paired L-side Q-block.","Such an arrangement is shown in  for an LLE creation subsystem  formed between quantum repeater QR and its right neighbour repeater QR. The R-side of the quantum physical hardware of repeater QR comprises q Capture Q-blocks  with respective IDs 1 to q. Similarly, the L-side of the quantum physical hardware of repeater QR comprises q Transfer Q-blocks  with respective IDs 1 to q. Each R-side Q-block  in repeater QR is optically coupled by a respective local link optical fibre  to the corresponding L-side Q-block of repeater QR. When the R-LLE control unit of repeater QR outputs a Fire signal to its quantum physical hardware to trigger an LLE creation attempt, all q Q-blocks  are simultaneously fired and the emitted light fields pass along respective ones of the local link optical fibres  to the corresponding Q-blocks  of repeater QR. The result signals from the Q-blocks  are passed to the L-LLE control unit of repeater QR which:\n\n","The R-LLE control unit of repeater QR either itself stores the ID of the selected Q-block  or passes it to the MC unit for storage (this ID serves to identify the corresponding successful Q-block  of repeater QR). When the MC unit comes to effect a merge, it retrieves the stored Q-block ID so that it knows which R-side Q-block to use. In due course the repeater QR becomes the operative repeater and itself comes to effect a merge, it knows which L-side Q-block  to use either because its ID was previously locally stored or because the ID was included in the LR-MC \u2018merge_succeeded\u2019 message it received from repeater QR.","Of course, the arrangement shown in  is inefficient in that it uses a respective optical fibre for each pairing of R-side Q-block  and L-side Q-block . By staggering the firing of the R-side Q-blocks  of repeater QR, it is possible to multiplex the emitted light fields onto a single fibre and such an arrangement is illustrated in  for an LLE creation subsystem  formed between quantum repeater QR and its right neighbour repeater QR.","The R-side of the quantum physical hardware of repeater QR comprises q Capture Q-blocks  with respective IDs 1 to q. Similarly, the L-side of the quantum physical hardware of repeater QR comprises q Transfer Q-blocks  with respective IDs 1 to q. Each R-side Q-block  in repeater QR is optically coupled by an optical merge unit  to local link optical fibre . Fibre  feeds optical switch  of repeater QR, the outputs of the switch feeding respective ones of the L-side Q-blocks of repeater QR. When the R-LLE control unit of repeater QR outputs a Fire signal to its quantum physical hardware to trigger an LLE creation attempt, the Q-blocks  are sequentially fired and the emitted light fields pass through the merge unit  and onto the fibre ; in due course the light field arrive in sequence at the optical switch  of repeater QR and are switched to corresponding ones of the Q-blocks , Operation is then substantially as described above for the  arrangement. Each light field may be preceded by its own herald light pulse or a single herald can be provided preceding the sequence of light fields (the individual fields not having their own separate heralds in this case).","Appropriate operation of the switch to ensure that the light field associated with the QRQ-block  with ID=k is passed to the QRQ-block  with the same ID, can be achieved in a number of ways. For example, a herald pulse at the front of the sequence of light fields arriving at the switch  can be used to trigger sequential switching according to the same timing as used to sequentially fire the Q-blocks  of repeater QR. Alternatively, the switch can simply count the incoming light fields and switch according. The time interval between adjacent light fields in the sequence of light fields arriving at the switch  is advantageously kept as small as possible consistent with giving enough time for the optical switch  to change over between Q-blocks  of repeater QR.","Rather than sequentially firing the Q-blocks  of repeater QR, an equivalent result can be achieved by tiring them all together but using different lengths of fibre to connect each Q-block to the optical merge unit , thereby introducing different delays.","Because the  repeater embodiment can only handle one right LLE at a time, the arrangements of  may appear profligate in their use of Q-blocks, notwithstanding the objective of increasing the LLE creation success rate. However, with regard to the R-side Q blocks of repeater QR, it should be noted that once fired, each of these Q-blocks cannot be used again at least until the result of the entanglement it was attempting to achieve is known (at least the round trip time to repeater QR), therefore a R-side Q block cannot be rapidly re-used to try to increase LLE creation success rates. On the other hand, because the result of an attempted entanglement will be very quickly known at a L-side Q block of repeater QR, it is possible to rapidly re-use the Q-block unless and until a successful entanglement is achieved. This leads to the \u201cfiring squad\u201d arrangement depicted in  for an LLE creation subsystem  formed between quantum repeater QR and its right neighbour repeater QR.","More particularly, the R-side of the quantum physical hardware of repeater QR comprises f Q-blocks  (with respective IDs 1 to f) that have Capture interaction functionality. These Q-blocks  collectively form a \u201cfiring squad\u201d . The L-side of the quantum physical hardware of repeater QR comprises a single Q-block  with Transfer interaction functionality. The Q-blocks  of the firing squad  of repeater QR are optically coupled by an optical merge unit  to local link optical fibre  that in turn is optically coupled to the single L-side Q-block  of repeater QR. Thus, as can be seen, all the Q-blocks  of the firing squad  (herein \u201cfusilier\u201d Q-blocks) are aimed to fire at the same target Q-block .","When the R-LLE control unit of repeater QR outputs a Fire signal to its quantum physical hardware to trigger an LLE creation attempt, the fusilier Q-blocks  of the firing squad  are sequentially fired and the emitted light fields pass through the merge unit  and onto the fibre  as a light field train , It may be noted that there will be an orderly known relationship between the fusilier Q-block IDs and the order in which the light fields appear in the train. Rather than each light field being preceded by its own herald, a single herald  preferably precedes the light field train  to warn the target Q-block  of the imminent arrival of the tram  (this herald  being generated, for example, by a dedicated emitter, not shown, of the firing squad in response to the Fire signal and in advance of the firing of the fusilier Q-blocks ).","As each light field arrives in sequence at the target Q-block  of repeater QR, the shutter of the target Q-block is briefly opened to allow the light field to pass through the qubit of the target Q-block to potentially interact with the qubit, the light field thereafter being measured to determine whether an entanglement has been created. If no entanglement has been created, the qubit of target Q-block  is reset and the shutter is opened again at a timing appropriate to let through the next light field of the train . However, if an entanglement has been created by passage of a light field of train , the shutter of the target Q-block is kept shut and no more light fields from the train  are allowed to interact with the qubit of target Q-block . The measurement-result dependent control of the Q-block shutter is logically part of the L-LLE control unit associated with the L-side target Q-block  though, in practice, this control may be best performed by low-level control elements integrated with the quantum physical hardware.","It will be appreciated that the spacing of the light fields in the train  should be such as to allow sufficient time for a determination to be made as to whether or not a light field has successfully entangled the target qubit, for the target qubit to be reset, and for the Q-block shutter to be opened, before the next light field arrives.","In fact, rather than using an explicit shutter to prevent disruptive interaction with the target qubit of light fields subsequent to the one responsible for entangling the target qubit, it is possible to achieve the same effect by transferring the qubit state from electron spin to nuclear spin immediately following entanglement whereby the passage of subsequent light fields does not disturb the captured entangled state (the target qubit having been stabilized against light-field interaction). It may still be appropriate to provide a shutter to exclude extraneous light input prior to entanglement but as the qubit is not set into its prepared state until the herald is detected, such a shutter can generally be omitted.","The L-LLE control unit is also responsible for identifying which light field of the train successfully entangled the target qubit and thereby permit identification of the fusilier Q-block  (and thus the qubit) entangled with the target Q-block qubit (as already noted, there is a known relationship between the fusilier Q-block IDs and the order in which the light fields appear in the train). For example, the light fields admitted to the target Q-block may simply be counted and this number passed back to the repeater QR, in an LLEC \u2018success\u2019 message, the recipient R-LLE control unit performing any needed conversion of this number to the ID number of the successful fusilier Q-block  before storing the latter, for example in a register, for later reference (alternatively, the fusilier ID may be passed on immediately). Of course, if none of the light fields of train  is successful in creating an entanglement, an LLEC \u2018fail\u2019 message is returned.","As there is only one target Q-block , the handling of left LLE parity information is the same as previously described for the  repeater.","As with the  arrangement, rather than sequentially firing the fusilier Q-blocks  of repeater QR, an equivalent result can be achieved by firing them all together but using different lengths of fibre to connect each fusilier Q-block to the optical merge unit , thereby introducing different delays and creating the light field train .","The number of fusilier Q-blocks  in the firing squad  is preferably chosen to give a very high probability of successfully entangling target Q-block  at each firing of the firing squad, for example 99% or greater. More particularly, if the probability of successfully creating an entanglement with a single firing of a single fusilier Q-block is s, then the probability of success for a firing squad of f fusilier Q-blocks will be:\n\nFiring squad success probability=1\u2212(1\u2212)\n\nwhereby for s=0.25, 16 fusilier Q-blocks will give a 99% success rate and 32 fusilier Q-blocks a 99.99% success rate. Typically one would start with a desired probability Pof successfully entangling the target qubit with a single firing (i.e. a single light-field train) and then determine the required number f of fusilier qubits according to the inequality:\n\n\u22661\u2212(1\u2212)\n","The same formulae also apply to the arrangements of  (with f being set to the value of q in respect of those arrangements).","The time interval between adjacent light fields in the train  is advantageously kept as small as possible consistent with giving enough time for the earlier light field to be measured, the target qubit reset and its shutter opened before the later light field arrives. By way of example, the light fields are spaced by 1-10 nanoseconds.","It may be noted that when using a LLE creation subsystem that provides a high probability of success, it becomes practical to assume that every triggering of the LLE creation subsystem is successful and to simplify the overall control paradigm so that a repeater only initiates the creation of a right LLE upon becoming the operative repeater. In this case, the overall time taken to successfully create an E2E entanglement becomes substantially constant and the left end node can therefore be arranged to start the building of a new E2E entanglement after this time rather than relying on the RL-MC \u201cE2E succeeded\u201d and \u201cE2E failed\u201d messages to indicate when the building of a new E2E entanglement can be started. Since, as already noted above, detection of failed E2E entanglements can be left to the consuming applications, it now becomes possible to dispense with the RL-MC \u201cE2E succeeded\u201d and \u201cE2E failed\u201d messages entirely.","4) Free-Running LLE Creation","In the  quantum repeater, right LLE creation attempts are triggered by timeout of an existing right LLE, consumption in a merge operation of an existing right LLE, or failure of a previous right LLE attempt. This results in a period at least as long as the light-speed round trip time to the left neighbour node in which no right LLE is available.","An alternative strategy is possible that reduces this non-availability period in most cases; more particularly, right LLE creation attempts are not triggered by need but happen continually, for example with a periodicity that is a fraction of the round trip time. A currently existing right LLE is not disturbed by a new creation attempt but left available for use in a merge operation. However, whenever a successful right LLE creation attempt is reported, the new right LLE replaces the pre-existing one as the LLE waiting to be merged, the pre-existing right LLE being abandoned and the Q-blocks associated with it being freed up for re-use. The right LLE waiting to be merged will therefore always be relatively fresh and timeouts will be very unlikely. Also, if the waiting right LLE does get consumed in a merge operation, an LLE creation attempt will already be underway (unless the periodicity is less than or equal to the round trip time and the merge takes place just after a right LLE creation attempt is initiated).","Of course, reduction in the right LLE non-availability period in this way comes at a cost, this being the need for sufficient Q-blocks to support a waiting right LLE as well as one or more on-going right LLE creation attempts.","By way of example,  shows an adaptation of the  arrangement that can be used for implementing the above strategy (the same references are used in  as in  for elements which are substantially the same). More particularly, rather than the R-side Q-blocks  of repeater QRbeing fired once in quick succession in response to a Fire signal, the R-side Q-blocks  are sequentially and cyclically fired, that is, in each of an endless succession of cycles, the R-side Q-blocks  are each fired once, one after another at equal time intervals throughout the cycle\u2014however, the R-side Q-block  associated with the current waiting right entanglement is not fired (the ID number of this Q-block being stored in a register  to indicate its non-availability to participate in right LLE creation attempts). At repeater QR, the optical switch  is cyclically switched such as to pass the incoming light fields to the appropriate L Q-blocks  of repeater QR. Each successful entanglement is reported to the repeater QRin a LLEC \u2018success\u2019 message which also includes the ID of the Q-block concerned. At the repeater QRthis ID number replaces that of the previous waiting right LLE in register  to indicate the non-availability of the identified Q-block to participate in the next right LLE creation attempts, the replacement in register  of the ID associated with the previous waiting right LLE freeing up the Q-block concerned for re-use.","The repeater QRalso needs to keep track of which Q-block  is not available as a result of being used for the current waiting right LLE. By simply arranging for the cyclic firing of the Q-blocks  of repeater QRto involve doing nothing at the point when it is would otherwise be firing the Q-block associated with the current waiting right LLE so that in each cycle there is a gap in the regular firing of the Q-blocks, the optical switch  can simply cycle round in correspondence to the firing cycle of the Q-blocks  without needing to know which Q-block  is unavailable since there will be no light field presented in respect of the unavailable Q-block.","Since more than one LLE may exist at any given moment, it is necessary for parity information on multiple LLEs to be stored. One example way of doing this is to arrange for the L side of repeater QRto be able to store parity data on all possible LLEs, the repeater being in due course informed by the repeater QRin a \u2018merge_succeeded\u2019 message which LLE has been used in a merge and therefore which LLE parity data needs to be included in the cumulative parity information.","With q L Q-blocks  (and q R Q-blocks ) and a round trip time of T, the gap between successive creation attempts is on average T\/(q\u22121).","It is also possible to operate the  arrangement in the same manner, that is, rather than waiting for a need-based trigger (timeout of an existing right LLE, consumption in a merge operation of an existing right LLE, or failure of a previous right LLE attempt), the firing squad  can be fired at regular (or irregular) intervals unrelated to need.","5) Banking LLEs","Where multiple Q-blocks are provided on both sides of an LLE creation subsystem (as in the arrangements of ,  and ), the possibility arises of more than one LLE existing at the same time between the nodes concerned. In the arrangements of , and , up to q LLEs may be created at each attempt though only one is selected to endure, whereas in the  arrangement, there is a brief overlap in the existence of two LLEs before the later-created one replaces the earlier created one. Rather than abandoning excess LLEs (that is, LLEs beyond the one waiting to be merged), one, some or all of these excess LLEs can be kept in reserve (\u2018banked\u2019) in a queue and so immediately available to become the waiting LLE when the previous LLE fulfilling this role is merged or times out. This, of course, requires the relevant Q-blocks to be unavailable to participate in LLE creation which can be readily achieved, by using a \u2018non-available\u2019 ID register similar to the register  of .","The second \u201cExtend-from-End\u201d quantum repeater embodiment employs such an LLE banking arrangement and will next be described.","Second \u201cExtend-from-End\u201d Quantum Repeater Embodiment ()","The second \u201cExtend-from-End\u201d quantum repeater embodiment  is shown in , it being understood that the quantum repeater  operates in the context of being an intermediate node in a chain of nodes (such as depicted in ) between the left and right end nodes of which E2E entanglements are to be created.","The second quantum repeater embodiment  of  is similar in form and operation to the first quantum repeater embodiment  of  and the same references are used in  as in  for elements which are substantially the same. The main differences between the first and second embodiments is that in the second quantum repeater embodiment :\n\n","The details of the form of LLE creation subsystems  and  of which the L-side and R-side Q-blocks respectively form a part, and of the L-LLE and R-LLE control units \u2032 and \u2032 are described below. The merge control unit  and its associated fibre interface  of the  quantum repeater  operate substantially in the same way as the merge control unit and fibre interface of the  quantum repeater  apart from the inclusion of Q-block ID information in various messages and signals; accordingly, the description of these elements will not be repeated in respect of the  quantum repeater  (though the main differences will be described).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0241","num":"0315"},"figref":["FIG. 25","FIG. 25"],"b":["241","242","251","252","251","253","252","254","253","211","256","255","255","257","252","254","252"],"sub":["j ","(j+1) ","j ","(j+1) ","j ","(j+1) ","(j+1) "]},"The  arrangement is effectively a combination of the arrangements of  further adapted to enable the creation and \u2018banking\u2019 of multiple LLEs. Thus, as with the  arrangement, in the  arrangement the R-side Q-blocks  are continually sequentially and cyclically fired except, that is, for any R-side Q-block  associated with an existing \u2018banked\u2019 entanglement. At repeater QR, all the incoming light-fields are directed by the optical switch  to the same Q-block (as in the  arrangement) until a successful entanglement is created whereupon the optical switch is switched to pass the incoming light fields to a new, available (un-entangled), L-side Q-block . Each successful entanglement is reported to the repeater QRin a LLEC \u2018success\u2019 message which also includes the ID of the L-side Q-block  concerned. The availability status of the R-side Q-blocks  and of the L-side Q-blocks  are respectively tracked by the R-LLE control unit \u2032 and L-LLE control unit \u2032.","It may be noted, that the above-described feature of switching incoming light fields to a new, un-entangled target L-side Q-block upon an existing target Q-block becoming entangled, can also be used with the \u2018firing squad\u2019 arrangement of , that is, multiple target Q-blocks  are provided only one of which serves as the current target, this current target being changed immediately it becomes entangled. Operating in this way ensures an efficient use of the light fields fired by the firing squad .","The operation of the LLE control units \u2032 and \u2032 will next be described in terms of the interaction of their principle components rather than in terms of a controlling state machine. Considering first the R-LLE control unit \u2032, this comprises a firing control unit R, an R-side timeout monitor R, an available\/non-available status register R, an R-side Entangled queue R which is a FIFO queue, and a status control unit R that controls the status register R and the R-side entangled queue R.","The status register R maintains an entry for each R-side Q-block , these entries being indexed by Q-block ID. Each entry comprises, for the Q-block concerned, an available\/not-available bit and a qubit Capture interaction time for the last LLE-creation Capture interaction of the Q-block unless the LLE creation attempt concerned has been reported as having failed.","The firing control unit R controls the cyclic sequential firing of the R-side Q-blocks  and in doing so refers to the status register  to determine which Q-blocks  are available for firing. Whenever the firing control unit R fires a Q-block , the status control unit sets corresponding available\/not-available bit of the register R to \u2018not-available\u2019.","The LLEC \u2018success\u2019 and \u2018fail\u2019 messages received from the right-side neighbour node are passed to the status control unit .

However, if an LLEC \u2018success\u2019 message is received, the available\/not-available status-register bit of the Q-block concerned is not changed; instead, the control unit R places the ID of the R-side and L-side Q-blocks concerned in the R Entangled queue R. If this entry is now the current head entry, the control unit R sends an \u2018R entangled\u2019 signal to the merge control unit ; if the entry is not the current head entry, no such signal is sent, the entry simply being queued.","The timeout monitor R continually monitors the age of the qubit of the R-side Q-block  at the head of the queue R by comparing the qubit Capture interaction time stored for this Q-block in the status register with the current time. When the qubit times out, the control unit R is informed which thereupon deletes the head entry of the queue R and sets the corresponding available\/not-available bit of the register R to \u2018available\u2019. If there is no other entry in the queue that can be moved up to the head of the queue, the control unit R sends a \u2018R expired\u2019 signal to the merge control unit .","The status control unit R is also arranged to receive the \u2018Reset R\u2019 signals from the merge control unit . Two types of \u2018Reset R\u2019 signal are provided by the merge control unit  in this embodiment\u2014the first type, here called the \u2018Reset_All R\u2019 signal, is produced in response to the receipt of an RL-MC \u2018EchoMe\u2019 message by the merge control unit  whereas the second type, here called the \u2018Reset_Head R\u2019 signal, is produced in all other cases.

The R-side Q-blocks of the queued LLEs are unavailable for firing by the firing control unit R.","Considering now the L-LLE control unit \u2032, this comprises a target control unit L, an L-side timeout monitor L, an available\/non-available status register L, and a status control unit L that controls the status register L.","The status register L maintains an entry for each L-side Q-block , these entries being indexed by Q-block ID.

The switch setting remains unchanged unless otherwise commanded by the target control unit L.","The Results signals \u2018L entangled\u2019\/\u2018L not_entangled\u2019 from the current target Q-block  are passed to the status control unit L which send corresponding LLEC \u2018success\u2019 and \u2018fail\u2019 messages to the left neighbour node. Each of these messages includes an indication of the ID of the R-side Q-block concerned (derived, for example, from the time of arrival of the light field concerned in the current firing cycle, or by the light field's counted, position in the cycle); in addition, for \u2018success\u2019 messages, the ID of the L-side Q-block involved is also included. No other action is taken by the control unit L when receiving a \u2018L not_entangled\u2019 signal. However, when the control unit L receives an \u2018L entangled\u2019 signal, the control unit L sets the available\/not-available status-register bit of the Q-block concerned to \u2018unavailable\u2019 thereby causing the target control unit L to select a new, available, Q-block as the target; the status control unit L also enters the current time into the status-register entry as the Transfer interaction time for the Q-block just entangled and stores left LLE parity information.","The timeout monitor L continually monitors the age of the oldest \u2018non-available\u2019 Q-block in the status register L by comparing the qubit Transfer interaction time stored for this Q-block with the current time. It is noted that the way the current repeater embodiment works, only this qubit and Q-block amongst L-side ones, could be participating in a L-side entanglement that is rooted in the left end node. When the qubit times out, the control unit L is informed which sets the corresponding available\/not-available bit of the register L to \u2018available\u2019; the control unit L also sends a \u2018L expired\u2019 signal to the merge control unit .","The status control unit R is also arranged to receive the \u2018Reset L\u2019 signals from the merge control unit .

The main difference is that the LR-MC messages \u201cmerge succeeded\u201d and \u201cmerge failed\u201d both contain the ID of the L-side Q-block concerned (that is, the involved Q-block of the right neighbour node of the operative quantum repeater sending the message). In the case of a \u201cmerge failed\u201d message, this enables the merge-control unit  of the receiving quantum repeater , to identify to the L-LLE control unit \u2032 of the repeater, in an \u2018Reset This L\u2019 signal, the L-side Q-block to be reset as \u2018available\u2019. In the case of a \u201cmerge succeeded\u201d message, the included L-side Q-block ID tells the merge control unit which L-side Q-block is to be used when the repeater is ready to perform a merge\u2014the identity of the R-side Q-block to be used for the merge is retrieved when needed from the R-LLE control unit \u2032, this ID being the R-side ID contained in the head entry of the queue R.","After receiving a \u2018merge succeeded\u2019 LR-MC message, the merge control unit  will in due course attempt to effect a merge after which it will signal the LLE control units \u2032, \u2032 to reset the Q-blocks concerned (regardless of the outcome of the merge); the merge control unit  will, of course, already have the L-side ID it needs for inclusion in the \u2018Reset_This L\u2019 signal it outputs (the corresponding right-side signal \u2018Reset_Head R\u2019 does not require the ID of the R-side Q-block to be reset as this can be obtained from the head entry of the queue R). If the attempted merge was successful, the merge control unit  sends an LR-MC \u201cmerge succeeded\u201d message that not only serves to tell the left neighbour repeater that it is now the operative repeater, but also to inform it of the ID of its L-side Q-block forming the current right-hand end of the entanglement being extended from the left end node; the relevant L-side Q block ID is inserted into the LR-MC \u201cmerge succeeded\u201d by the merge control unit  after it has retrieved the ID from the head entry of the queue R. (which it does prior to sending the \u2018Reset_Head R\u2019 signal).","As regards parity information, when the MC unit  receives a \u2018merge succeeded\u2019 message it updates the cumulative parity information in the message by combining the received cumulative parity information with (i) the parity of the left LLE involved in merge to which the message relates (this information being retrieved from the status register L based on the L-side Q-block ID included in the received \u2018merge succeeded\u2019 message), and (ii) merge parity information for the merge subsequently carried out by the repeater.","It will be apparent from the foregoing that in the  quantum repeater embodiment, there is a good chance that as soon as a right LLE is used up in a merge operation or expires, there will be another right LLE immediately ready to use, this LLE having been banked in the queue R.","Banked LLEs can also be used in the process known as \u2018purification\u2019. Purification raises the fidelity of an entanglement by combining two entanglements, via local quantum operations and classical communication, into one higher-fidelity pair.","With respect to the form and operation of the end nodes of a chain of nodes with intermediate repeater nodes of the  form, persons skilled in the art will, by reference to the foregoing description of the repeater , be able to determine the adaptations needed to the left and right end nodes described above in relation to the repeater  of .","Where, as for the  embodiment, there are multiple L-side and\/or R-side Q-blocks in an LLE creation subsystem, resulting in one or both of the associated end nodes having multiple Q-blocks, then if such a multi-Q-block end node is to be provided with an output buffer into which E2E entanglements can be shifted as described above with reference to , the arrangement depicted in  can usefully be employed to avoid the use of an n\u00d7m optical switch that would otherwise be required to interface the multiple L-side\/R-side Q-blocks with the multiple Q-blocks of the output buffer.","More particularly,  depicts a left end node  having an R-side substantially as in the  LLE creation subsystem with n R-side Q-blocks  optically coupled through an optical merge unit  and local link fibre  to a chain  of repeater nodes.

A 1\u00d72 optical switch  enables the output of the optical merge unit  to be switched between the local link fibre  and a loopback fibre  that feeds an input of the optical merge unit . This arrangement permits any selectively-fired one of the R-side Q-blocks  or any selectively-fired one of the output-buffer Q-blocks  to be coupled to the intermediary Q-block . As a result, the left end of an E2E entanglement anchored in one of the R-side Q-blocks  can be shifted across to the intermediary Q-block  and from there shifted into a selected one of the output-buffer Q-blocks , both shifts being effected by an elongate operation (see ); alternatively the selected output-buffer Q-block  can first be entangled with the intermediary Q-block  and a merge operation then effected between the latter and the R-side Q-block  anchoring the E2E entanglement.","Although the end node depicted, in  is a left end node with multiple R-side Q-blocks, the same approach can be used for a right end node with multiple L-side Q-blocks.","It will be appreciated that many variants are possible to the above described embodiments of the invention.","For example, where LLE creation subsystems of the  form are employed to give a high probability of successfully creating entanglements at each firing, then it would be possible to operate the  quantum repeater on the basis that a right LLE is assumed to have been created a predetermined time after firing of the firing squad (this predetermined time being the transit time of the light train  to the target qubit plus the time length of the light train and its herald). Transition from Pending state  to Right Entangled state  in  can thus be triggered on a time basis rather than receipt of an LLEC \u201csuccess\u201d message; this leads to a local merge operation being triggered when both a token has been received from the left neighbour node making the repeater the operative repeater, and a right-side qubit is expected to have been entangled with a qubit of the right neighbour node (as opposed to the existence of this latter entanglement having been confirmed by a \u201csuccess\u201d message). In fact, for the  embodiment, this variant is largely irrelevant as it is still necessary to await information from the right neighbour node enabling identification of the fusilier qubit that has been entangled and this information itself is effectively a \u201csuccess\u201d message. However, for the modification of the  embodiment discussed above in which the direction of LLE-creation light-field travel is made right-to-left while E2E entanglements are still built from the left end node, there is only one R qubit (a target qubit) in the quantum repeater so now a merge operation can be triggered once both the repeater is the operative repeater and the light-field train from the firing squad in its right neighbour node has been fully received. Unfortunately, this generally is also of no particular advantage as knowledge of when the light-field train has been fully received will not be earlier than when the result of the LLE creation attempt would in any case be known at the repeater through measurement of the target qubit.","For various reasons it may be desirable to arrange for the merging of leftward and rightward entanglements that is effected by a quantum repeater each cycle, to be carried out through the intermediary of one or more local qubits (\u2018intermediate qubits\u2019) rather than directly by carrying out a merge operation of the form described above on the relevant repeater L-side and R-side qubits. For example, where one intermediate qubit is provided, the leftward and rightward entanglements can be separately extended to the intermediate qubit by respective elongate operations involving the entangled L-side\/R-side qubit (as appropriate) and the intermediate qubit; thereafter, the intermediate qubit is removed, from entanglement by performing an X measurement operation upon it. It will be appreciated that the details of how the local merging of a repeater's leftward, and rightward entanglements is effected is not critical to the general manner of operation of a quantum repeater operating on the \u2018Extend-from-End\u2019 basis.","With regard to the implementation of the LLE control units ,  and the merge control unit , it will be appreciated that typically the described functionality will be provided by a program controlled processor or corresponding dedicated hardware. Furthermore, the functionality of the LLE control units and the merge control unit may in practice be integrated, particularly in cases where the LLE control unit functionality is minimal. Of course, the division of control functionality is to a degree arbitrary; however, LLE control functionality merits separation into the LLE control units because in certain repeater embodiments LLE creation is free-running, that is, uncoordinated with higher level operations such as merge control. Overlying the LLE control functionality is the control functionality associated with merge control and the control of token passing\u2014this latter control functionality effectively provides fop level control of the repeater and can be considered as being provided by a top-level control arrangement (in the described embodiments this is formed by the merge control unit, though it would also be possible for the token passing control to be separated out from the merge control unit into its own distinct control unit).","Although in the foregoing description light fields have generally been described as being sent over optical fibres both between nodes and between components of the quantum physical hardware of a repeater, it will be appreciated that light fields can be sent over any suitable optical channel whether guided (as with an optical waveguide) or unguided (straight line) and whether through free space or a physical medium. Thus, for example, the optical fabric of the quantum physical hardware of a repeater may comprise silicon channels interfacing with a qubit provided by a nitrogen atom in a diamond lattice located within an optical cavity.","As already indicated, persons skilled in the art will understand how the Q-blocks can be physically implemented and relevant example implementation details can be found in the following papers, herein incorporated by reference:\n\n"],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Embodiments of the invention will now be described, byway of non-limiting example, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 7A to 7D","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIGS. 14 and 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 25","FIG. 24"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 26","FIG. 24"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
