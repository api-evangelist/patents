title: Hardening of a satellite thermal control system
abstract: A thermal control system for a space body uses an active control means to prevent laser beam radiation damage to a heat radiator. A conventional louver and louver actuator are coupled to an active overdrive actuator that closes the louver when hostile laser radiation is present. An extended bimetallic coil spring with a heater therein rotates opposite to the louver actuator in an increasing temperature environment. A cam of the overdrive actuator engages a louver arm when hostile laser radiation is present, otherwise, the louver can move freely within the cam.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.","This invention relates generally to space vehicles and, in greater particularity, relates to a device and method of protecting selected surfaces on the space vehicle from external incident radiant energy.","Many satellite components require temperature control within a narrow band to assure long life and correct operation. One temperature control method is to enclose the instrument either singly or in a group inside a chamber which is designed to have good internal thermal coupling so as to give near uniform internal temperature. One side of the chamber is a radiator: a good conductor which is thermally coupled to heat sources inside the chamber and which has a high emissivity surface facing dark space. Finally, this radiator is covered by louver blades arranged so they can be opened or closed, exposing or covering the radiator. Rectangular blades in a venetian blind like arrangement are illustrated in . A pinwheel arrangement has also been used. In either case, a bimetallic coil spring, thermally coupled to the radiator senses the temperature of the radiator, opening the louver when the radiator is warm and closing it when the radiator is cool with respect to the control range, and generally finding an intermediate position to maintain the specified temperature. This thermo-mechanical mode of operation is called the \u201cpassive mode.\u201d","More precise control of the radiator temperature is accomplished by adding an electronic device to sense the radiator temperature and to control an electric current to a heater which is bonded onto the bimetallic coil. This \u201cactive mode\u201d gives greater rotation of the louver per unit temperature change due to its amplification and accomplishes quicker, more precise temperature control; solar and earth albedo energy are prevented from entering the louver by three methods:\n\n","If hostile high energy radiation such as a laser beam is directed at the louver, it presents a dual threat:\n\n","Existing louvered radiator designs are extremely vulnerable to laser attack because of the light weight materials generally used, the sensitivity of their performance to the radiative characteristics of their surface, and in some cases, the fundamental conflict between radiative characteristics desirable for their normal function and those desirable for rejecting laser radiation.","These drawbacks have motivated the search for alternative devices which can prevent laser damage to radiators in space.","A conventional bimetallic temperature sensitive actuator controls the movement of a louver used to control heat from a radiator. If satellite components to be protected reach an excessive operating temperature, the actuator, being thermally coupled to the radiator, opens the louver thus permitting excess heat to be radiated into space. When the components cool, the actuator closes the louver to retain heat within the system.","In the case of hostile high energy radiation, (i.e. a laser beam) directed in the direction of the louver, the energy may be absorbed into the exposed surface materials heating them until they are destroyed. This heat is conducted to the actuator which opens the louver and further exposes the internal components to excess radiation which would not have been admitted if the louver remained closed.","In order to counter this destructive radiation that is incident on the louver, a combination of steps are taken. Firstly, the louver surface is coated with a protective coating to prevent the absorption of incident radiation. Secondly, a bimetalic overdrive actuator positioned opposite to the louver actuator, acting through a cam and pin assembly, drives the radiator louver in the opposite direction than that of the louver actuator. A shield attached to the overdrive actuator, normally in the open position, allows the incident radiation to heat a bimetallic coil. This coil turns counter to the radiator actuator bimetallic coil forcing the louver radiator to close.","The cam and pin arrangement allows the louver actuator to rotate without interference from the overdrive actuator unless excessive heat is received by the overdrive actuator. Thus, in the presence of excessive thermal radiation, the louver and the shield are closed.","An electronic sensor is attached to the thermal control system so that a more rapid response is produced than by just the bimetallic coils of the overdrive actuator alone.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide for a laser hardened thermal control system for a satellite or other space object;","It is another object of the present invention to provide for a protective coating to the materials used in the thermal control system;","It is another object of the present invention to provide for an overdrive actuator that closes a louvered radiator upon receiving laser radiation;","It is another object of the present invention to provide for an active overdrive actuator rather than passive.","These and many other objects and advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to one skilled in the pertinent art from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the invention and the related drawings.","Referring to , a thermal control system  is shown. Louvers  control heat flow from a radiator , shown in FIG. . Conventional louver actuators  sense the temperature of radiator  and cause louvers  to rotate to an open position to allow the flow of heat to space. Actuators  have therein bimetallic coil springs with heaters thereon so that when heated, louvers  rotate open. Overdrive actuators  upon receiving a high temperature rise indication cause louvers  to be placed in the closed position, shown in , even when louver actuators  desire to rotate open louvers . Details to be provided herein below.","Specific requirements of louvered temperature-control radiator  vary substantially from one spacecraft to another, and within any one spacecraft, depending on (a) area available; (b) internal heat loads\u2014average power, peak power, and duty cycles; (c) temperature-control-range requirements; (d) the size, location, and thermal characteristics of other parts of the spacecraft that are within the hemispheric field of view of the radiating surface; and (e) the ranges and variations of normal and abnormal directions of view of the surface normal with respect to the sun, the earth (with sunlit and dark as essential distinctions) and space. This variety tends to make it impossible to define a general set of radiator functional requirements as a baseline for laser hardening; however, the task becomes more reasonable when looked at from the viewpoint of how dominant the laser-resistance requirements are, and in recognition of the basic design choice that is always available, that of the size of radiator  that is most appropriate to meeting its functional requirements.","Although a battery radiator is used for purposes of explaining the invention, other types of radiators are functionally equivalent. In this case radiator  is a wall of a battery, not further shown.","Battery radiator  has three attributes: First, the radiator surface itself has excellent heat-sinking capabilities; it is the solid aluminim base of the battery itself. Second, to accommodate the high worst-case heat loads generated by internal dissipation in the battery, an unlouvered passive \u201cbias\u201d radiator is incorporated, in addition to the actively controlled louvered radiator. Third, the sun never directly impinges on the main radiator in normal mission attitude (a thermal fence \u2014a rudimentary sunshade\u2014is provided in order to preserve this condition for small sun angles on the \u201cwrong\u201d side of the orbit plane). The absorptivities and emissivities of the louver-blade coatings and radiator coatings have been selected to take advantage of the fact of no solar illmination; in particular, high emissivities can be chosen for the radiator surface and low emissivities for the lower blade surface without regard to the absolute solar absorptivity or the \u03b1\/\u03b5 ratio\u2014radiators in spacecraft locations that do see the sun must take \u03b1\/\u03b5 into account. The impact of relative solar orientation results in a substantial variety of surface-finish choices and combinations for louver blades and inner radiator surfaces in radiators for various functions on the spacecraft, of which the battery radiator is only one.","In spite of the range of design parameters that will consequently characterize different radiators for the infinite variety of spacecraft applications, it should be noted that the detailed requirements of battery radiator  used have not resulted in a hardening solution that is peculiar to the specific application. The same invention is applicable to louvered radiators with substantially different load-dumping, temperature, and radiant-interface requirements; the area of radiator  and the temperature set-point and gain of a control loop would be the principal design parameters that would be adjusted to adapt to differing applications.","Since Denton silver has both a low absolute emissivity and a relatively favorable \u03b1\/\u03b5 ratio for sun rejection, it can be used on both sun-exposed and sun-shaded louvers . The Z93 white paint has excellent emissivity and a very good \u03b1\/\u03b5 ratio, so it can be substituted for second-surface teflon in sun-exposed radiator applications with little or no compromise in performance.","The threat to thermal control system  is hypotheized to be a laser pulse of 100 seconds total duration, of 1 watt per square centimeter intensity at onset and at termination, of 10 watts per square centimeter intensity at peak, following a cosine-squared law for the intensity variation with time, depositing 550 joules per square centimeter total energy, and generated by a carbon dioxide laser at 10.6 centimeters wavelength.","No amelioriation has been allocated to partial shielding by other spacecraft parts or to non-normal incidence. In addition, it has been postulated for conservatism that the full threat could be (transiently) incident on the inner surfaces of louvers ; these surfaces have also been made hard against direct exposure, by coating them, also, with Denton silver. Analytic consideration has been given to the effects of changing these inner-surface finishes, for the eventuality that the assumption of direct exposure turns out to be unnecessarily pessimistic. Blackened inner surfaces, rather than Denton-silvered, would raise the maximum attained temperature of the radiator  proper somewhat, while substantially lowering that of the louver blade. Both choices lead to acceptable attained temperature limits for both components, and so a change from Denton silver would be dictated by factors that are presently not operative, such as higher threat levels, different time profiles, or weight limitations that call for consideration of blade materials lighter than Kovar.","The solution to the above problems is: (1) the use of protective coatings to exposed surfaces to prevent the absorption of the incident hostile laser energy, and (2) overdrive actuator  having a laser beam sensor .","Referring to , a Denton silver coating , is applied to the top of overdrive shield , to radiator louver , both sides preferrably, and to other exposed parts such as a louver arm .","The principal characteristics of Denton silver coating  are given in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0039"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Principal characteristics of Denton-silver coating"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["a.","Process"]},{"entry":[{},"Substrate - Mirror finish, flat or slightly"]},{"entry":[{},"curved, metal or glass (also tapes and films"]},{"entry":[{},"attached to solid substrates for coating purposes)"]},{"entry":[{},"Primer film - Approximately 500 Angstroms (\u212b)"]},{"entry":[{},"Inconel  "]},{"entry":[{},"Silver film - Approximately 100 \u212b, purity 99.8%"]},{"entry":[{},"Protective interface film - Approximately 1300 \u212b"]},{"entry":[{},"reagent grade AlO"]},{"entry":[{},"Protective surface film - Approximately 1300 \u212b"]},{"entry":[{},"reagent grade SiO"]},{"entry":["b.","Finished Coating"]},{"entry":[{},"Reflectance - More than 98% at any wavelength"]},{"entry":[{},"from 0.5 to 50 micrometers"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"In particular, suitable substrate materials may be aluminum, nickel, stainless steel, glass or tape.

Additional louvers  are possible depending on heat transfer requirements. As shown, louver actuators  and overdrive actuators  are at opposite ends of louvers . Although this placement is preferred because of present devices, the placement at one end of these actuators  and  is also possible and the principles of this invention are still applicable even though the mechanical design would be complicated to a greater degree.","In order to describe the operation of this invention a partial cross section, , is taken through the longitudinal axis along lines II-II of FIG. .","In , convention louver actuator  having a bimetallic coil spring therein with attached heater, not shown, is connected to louver  by an arm . The heater in actuator  receives driving current in response to a temperature radiator sensor . The current is controlled by means of a circuit shown in  where temperature sensor  sends data to a temperature control device  that in turn sends current to a heater  such that a higher temperature causes actuator  to open louver  to allow heat radiation.","Louver  is further connected to a pin arm  that rotates in overdrive actuator . The opening of louver  allows heat to flow from radiator  through an aperature . Pin arm  turns on an axle  which is mounted in a cam  of overdrive actuator A. A bearing  allows for minimum friction between axle  and cam . Cam  is mounted in a drive support  with a bearing . Attached to cam  is a drive shaft . Drive shaft  is mounted to a center support  with a bearing  and to a end support  with a bearing . Further attached to cam  is overdrive shield . On the other end of shaft , a shield support  is mounted to both shaft  and shield . A counter balance  minimizes the amount of torque needed to move shield  and louver .","A bimetallic overdrive assembly , only one shown in detail, is mounted to support  and shaft . The purpose of an extended bimetallic coil spring  is to expose as much as possible of coil  to incoming laser radiation beam  so that the heating provided causes spring  to counter rotate to the bimetallic coil spring mounted in louver actuator . If so required, additional bimetallic coils  can be mounted to shaft  to provide the necessary torque and heating surface to close louver  to laser radiation .","In addition to or in the alternative, a heater , shown in outline on spring , can heat bimetallic coil spring  to provide the necessary torque in a much quicker manner. This is preferable since a quicker closing of louver  can be obtained without possible damage to radiator . The presence of laser radiation  is detected by a sensor  which sends data to a temperature control . The circuit provided would be similar to that shown in FIG. . Sensor  is shown as being flat but a more omni-directional sensor  will be used to detect laser radiaton  at different angles.","To better understand the interaction between cam  and a pin  of pin-arm  a cross section along lines III A-III A is shown in FIG. A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3C","FIG. 3C","FIG. 3B"],"b":["24","86","40","58","24","88","76","84","28","12","58","84"]},"In normal operation pin  can move through a 90\u00b0 angle. Upon the receipt of laser radiation , bimetallic overdrive assembly  causes cam  to move in a counter-clock wise direction. If sufficient energy is received, pin  is engaged and turned to the position shown in  where both shield  and louver  are in the closed position. Referring to , cam  has a counter balance  mounted opposite shield . Shield  is mounted to an arm  that has therein a pin engagement slot . As shown in , when cam  is in the fully open position, pin  can rotate through a full 90 degree angle without contacting slot . In the fully closed position, , slot  forces pin  into a vertical position thus closing louver .","In the following analysis, heater  is not considered attached to bimetallic coil spring . This is named the \u201cpassive mode\u201d and provides a minimum response to the intended threat assumed by the present invention.","The following nomenclature is used throughout the analysis presented:\n\n","For each of the bimetallic springs which drive louver  as well as shield , the following relationship exists between the spring angular position and temperature change, i.e.\n\n\u03b8=\u03b8+\u03b1\u2003\u2003(1) \n","When overdrive spring  is coupled (i.e. contacted) with the louver spring, not shown, a constraining force will be developed and Equation (1) is no longer valid. A general coupling equation is derived which will relate the angular position of louver  and shield  for arbitrary initial angular position and for any temperature changes for louver  and for shield .","Assume that at certain temperature changes, \u0394Tand \u0394T, louver  and shield  are coupled as shown in FIG. C. Louver  rotates through an angle \u03b8and shield  rotates an angle \u03b8and their final positions are designated as \u03b8and \u03b8, respectively.

For the configuration shown on , all bimetallic springs are identical, so that \u03b1=\u03b1=\u03b1, and k=2k=2k. For this case Equation 8 can be reduced to: \n\n","Since in Equation 5 we define the coupling load as P = X\/Y, the temperature rise required for coupling to start can be found by setting P=0 or X=0.","Thus, Equation 6 becomes: \n\n","Now substituting Equation 9 and Equation 10 into Equation 12 gives:\n\n(T)\u03b1+()\u03b1+\u03b8+\u03b80 \u2003\u2003(13)\n","For the special case of T=T=T, the above equation leads to: \n\n","The temperature rise required to close louver  can be determined by setting \u03b8=0 in Equation 8, or \n\n","Another special case of interest is when only one of the overdrive springs  is heated.
