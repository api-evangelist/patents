The disclosure of the prior application is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","1. Field of Invention","This invention relates to systems and methods for reducing process direction registration errors of a printhead using a linear array sensor.","2. Description of Related Art","Fast printing with a direct marking engine requires the use of multiple printheads. For example, four aligned printheads may be used in a printer to write to a drum rotating underneath them. Each printhead has six degrees of positional freedom, three translational and three rotational. The printheads need be precisely aligned so that there is a smooth transition from one printhead to the other in the printed image.","In order to achieve a high resolution, it may also be necessary for the drum of the printer to make multiple passes while the printheads are translated after each rotation along the axis of the drum. In this case, the transition of the printhead needs to be precise, to achieve equal spacing between the centers of the printed lines during the passes.","When a printer uses a plurality of printheads to write to a drum rotating underneath them, print defects can occur at the boundary between two printheads, if the two printheads are not precisely aligned. These print defects include roll and y-axis stitch.","In particular, roll can occur as a rotation of a printhead about an axis normal to the drum. Roll causes a skew of the image produced by the printhead relative to the print medium, such as paper. If an image was printed entirely with a single printhead, small amounts of roll would not be perceivable. However, if an image was printed with at least two printheads, the roll of one of the printheads will cause a translation of the printed image in the process direction at the interface between the two printheads. Such a translation causes an objectionable streak.","Y-axis stitch may be defined as a translation of one printhead compared to another printhead in a direction parallel to the rotation of the drum. Y-axis stitch shifts the image from one printhead with respect to the other printhead in the process direction. Such a y-axis stitch causes a noticeable streak at the interface between the two printheads.","When a printhead uses multiple passes to produce high resolution images, another print defect, the y-axis interlace, may occur. The y-axis interlace may be defined as a timing error between multiple passes of the printhead. In particular, if the pass-to-pass timings do not align, a single-pixel wide line written in the cross process direction will appear jagged, although the intent was to make it straight. The pass-to-pass errors can also introduce high frequency banding in a halftone image.","Various exemplary embodiments according to the present invention provide systems and methods for reducing process direction registration errors using test patterns. In various exemplary embodiments, a method for detecting process direction registration errors comprises obtaining a first dash minimum response curve, the first dash minimum response curve outlining a first plurality of minimal responses sensed from a first plurality of dashes in a test pattern, the dashes in the test pattern including being spaced substantially equally in a cross process direction, each dash extending substantially the same length in a process direction, the process direction perpendicular to the cross process direction, at least one dash having a position shift in the process direction from a neighboring dash; obtaining a second dash minimum response curve, the second dash minimum response curve outlining a second plurality of minimal responses sensed from a second plurality of dashes in the test pattern; and determining a difference in phase and\/or frequency between the first and second sinusoidal curves.","This and other features and advantages of this invention are described in, or apparent from, the following detailed description of various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["1000","1000","10","10","20","10","22"]},"As shown in , each dashed line  includes a plurality of dashes  running in the process direction . The dashes  of a dashed line  are substantially equally spaced or separated from each other in the process direction .","As shown in , a dash  in a dashed line  is shifted for a certain number of pixels  in the process direction  relative to a dash  of a neighboring dashed line . For example, as shown in , dash A is ahead of dash B in the process direction . The shift may be any number of pixels. For example, as shown in , dash A is one pixel ahead in the process direction  than dash B.","As shown in , the test pattern  periodically repeats the configuration of a plurality of dashed lines  in the cross process direction . For example, as shown in , dashed line groups  and  have similar configuration. In particular, dashes C and D are located at substantially the same process direction location. Dashes E and F are also located at substantially the same process direction location.","In various exemplary embodiments, the dashes  are spaced far enough apart in the cross process direction  (x-axis direction) so that they can be distinguished by a full width array sensor. The dashes  are long enough in the process direction  (y-axis direction) so that end effects do not affect the shape of the dashes  as detected by the sensor.","Each dashed line  includes periodical occurrences of dashes  and gaps . A gap  is the separation between two dashes  in the process direction . In various exemplary embodiments, the dash\/gap (or on\/off) period is designed for adequate raster optical scanner misalignment detection, as discussed in greater detail below. In the exemplary test pattern shown in , the length of the dashes is 4 pixels, and the gap between two dash lines is 4 pixels.","As shown in , a cross section  running across the test pattern  in the cross process direction  goes through the dashed lines . The cross section  may intersect a dashed line  within a gap  between the dashes  of the dashed line . The cross section  may also intersect a dashed line  within a dash  of the dashed line . In addition, the cross section  may intersect a dashed line  at a tip or end of a dash of the dashed line . As will be discussed in greater detail below, a sensor response profile along the cross section  will have a maximal, minimal or intermediate value at a particular x-axis position depending on whether the cross section  intersects a dashed line  located at the particular x-axis position within a gap between the dashes, within a dash, or at a dash tip of the dashed line.","In various exemplary embodiments, the test pattern shown in  is produced by a printhead, with each dashed line produced by a corresponding nozzle of the printhead. In various other exemplary embodiments, the dashed lines are produced by nozzles of different printheads. In various other exemplary embodiments, the dashed lines represent an expected test pattern from precisely aligned printhead or printheads.","In various exemplary embodiments, the test pattern  shown in  is used to detect roll. In various other exemplary embodiments, the test pattern  shown in  is used to detect y-axis stitch.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":"1010"},"The test pattern  in  is similar to that shown in , except that the test pattern  in  includes dashed lines  produced by different passes  of a printhead. In particular, as shown in , the dashed lines  produced by pass  and the dashed lines  produced by pass  are each substantially identical to the dashed lines  in . However, the dashed lines  from pass  and pass  are combined in the test pattern  in , such that dash pairs  are formed. The dashes  in a dash pair  of a pair of dashed lines  are located in a same position in the process direction  without a shift. The dash pair  in a pair of dashed lines  shifts in the process direction  relative to a dash pair  of a neighboring pair of dashed lines . The shift may be any number of pixels . In the exemplary embodiment shown in , the shift is one pixel .","In various exemplary embodiments, the test pattern  of  includes dashed lines  from two passes . In various other exemplary embodiments, the test pattern (not shown) includes dashed lines from more than two passes.","In various exemplary embodiments, a linear array sensor is used to detect process direction registration errors. In various exemplary embodiments, an inline linear array sensor is used. The linear array sensor detects the ink on the drum to enable the potential to measure printhead roll. In various exemplary embodiments, the full width array sensor is a contact image sensor with a row elements running completely across the process direction, an illumination source, and a set of graded index cylindrical lenses that focuses the drum image onto the sensors. In various other exemplary embodiments, the full width array sensor is linear array remote from the drum with an illumination source and reduction optics that focus the full width of the drum row onto the linear array sensor.","In various exemplary embodiments, a common integration time technique is used for gathering full width array sensor data. In such exemplary embodiments, the sensor responses are clocked out individually so that the reflectance of a set of points parallel to the axis of the rotation of the drum are read.","In various other exemplary embodiments, a sequential integration time technique is used for gathering full width array sensor data. In such exemplary embodiments, each sensor is clocked out in sequence, so the drum rotates some distance between the first read and the last read. This may have the effect of reading along a line rotated at some angle with respect to the cross process direction. With knowledge of the read time, the test pattern and the analysis thereof may be used for subsequent adjustment.","The presence of dashes changes sensor response. In particular, the presence of ink on the drum can either decrease or increase the response of sensors, depending on the relative colors of the ink and the drum and the texture of the ink and the drum. For the ease of discussion, it is assumed that the presence of ink decreases sensor response. However, it should be appreciated that the discussion below also applies when the presence of ink increases sensor response.","In various exemplary embodiments, as will be described in greater detail below in connection with , a sensor response profile is obtained from a cross section along the cross process direction of a test pattern. As discussed above, the strength of the response at a particular cross process direction location in the response profile depends on whether the cross section intersects with a dashed line at the particular cross process direction location, and if the cross section intersects with a dashed line, whether the cross section intersects the dashed line between the dashes, within a dash, or at a dash tip of the dashed line. In particular, the strength or magnitude of the response in the response profile will reach a maximum at the particular cross process direction location if the cross section does not intersect a dashed line at the cross process direction location, because there is no dash to decrease the sensor response. Similarly, if the cross section intersects with a dashed line at the particular cross process direction location, but the cross section intersects with the dashed line between the dashes of the dashed line, the strength of the response at the cross process direction will still be close to the maximum response strength because there is no dash at the intersection to decrease the sensor response. However, if the cross section intersects the dashed line within a dash of the dashed line, the response strength will be a minimal, because the presence of the dash decreases the sensor response. When the cross section intersects the dashed line at a dash tip, the presence of the dash within the cross section is not complete. The decrease in sensor response will be reduced. Accordingly, the strength of the response will be at an intermediate magnitude between the maximum and the minimum.","In particular, as shown in , a cross section  is used to indicate where a sensor detects dashes. In various exemplary embodiments, a cross section of sensor response is used to detect errors in a printed image. The cross section of the sensor response is a collection of profiles through the dashes in the test pattern. A profile includes sensor response along the cross process direction at a particular process direction location. In various exemplary embodiments, the cross section is a collection of profiles through all the dashes in a test pattern. In various other exemplary embodiments, the cross section is a collection of profiles through the dashes near the interface between two printheads.","In a response profile of a cross section of sensor response, sensor response varies along the cross process direction. As discussed above and shown in , a sensor response profile along the cross section  will have a maximal, minimal or intermediate value at a particular x-axis position depending on whether the cross section  intersects a dashed line  located at the particular x-axis position within a gap between the dashes, within a dash, or at a dash tip of the dashed line. In particular, sensor response highs, or maxima, occur at locations corresponding to positions where dashes do not exist, such as the gaps between dashes. For example, as shown in , at the x-axis position where the dashed line containing dash A is located, the sensor response on the cross section  will be relatively high because the cross section  intersects this dashed line at a gap between the dashes of this dashed line. There is no dash at the intersection to decrease the sensor response, and the sensor response will be a high or maximum.","On the other hand, at the x-axis position where the dashed line containing dash G is located, the sensor response on the cross section  will be relatively low because the cross section  intersects this dashed line within a dash of this dashed line. The dash at the intersection decreases the sensor response, and the sensor response will be a low or minimum.","Furthermore, at the x-axis position where the dashed line containing dash B or E is located, the sensor response on the cross section  will be between the high and low values discussed above, because the cross section  intersects this dashed line at a dash tip.","The positions of the lows (minima) are used to obtain the locations of the corresponding dashes. In various exemplary embodiments, the positions of the lows (minima) are also used to obtain information of the nozzles which produced the dashes.","In various exemplary embodiments, the centers of the dashes may be determined based on the cross section of sensor response, using the minima in the response profile. The determination may be achieved by any existing or later developed techniques. In various exemplary embodiments, the center of a dash line is determined based on an interpretation of the response data near the dash line, a mid-point of the line edges of a detected dash line, a non-linear least squares fit, or a multi-dimension vector under Radar theory.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["54","55","52","55"]},"The spikes  are located on the x-axis corresponding to the locations of the dashed lines  in . Each spike  indicates a reduction of response strength due to the presence of a respective dashed line that decreases the sensor response. Each spike has a spike tip  that identifies how low the sensor response has been reduced to.","As discussed above, the presence of a dashed line in the cross section decreases the sensor response differently, depending on whether the cross section intersects with the dashed line between dashes, within a dash, or at a dash tip of the dashed line. Such a variation in sensor response reduction is reflected in . As shown in , the longest spikes , indicating maximal sensor response reduction and minimal sensor response, appear at x-axis locations corresponding to the dashed lines with which the cross section intersects within dashes. The locations with gaps  between spikes , indicating minimal sensor response reduction and conformity to the constant response magnitude, appear at x-axis locations corresponding to dashed lines with which the cross section intersects within the gaps between dashes. The other, shorter spikes with intermediate length, indicating intermediate sensor response reduction and representing intermediate sensor response magnitude, appear at x-axis locations corresponding to dashed lines with which the cross section intersects at dash tips.","As shown in , the response profile periodically repeats the characteristics of a group of spikes. For example, the profile portion  is similar to the profile portion . This corresponds to the periodical configuration of dashed line groups  and , as shown in .","In various exemplary embodiments, registration errors are detected by first converting the sensor profile to a dash minimum response profile. The dash minimum response profile is a table of the sensor response at the minimum of each spike. The length of the sensor profile is equal to the number of sensor elements in the linear array. The length of the dash minimum response profile is equal to the number of nozzles writing the dashes in the test pattern.","Alternative metrics other than the sensor response at the minimum of each spike can be used to create the dash minimum response profile. One choice is the interpolated minimum of the spike, where the response of the linear array is interpolated between the sensors at each spike minimum. Another choice is the interpolated width of each spike taken at some point between the minimum response and the response of the substrate. Another choice is the integrated area under the spike.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["62","60","16","18","1000"]},"For a particular point on the dash minimum response curve  in , such as point P, the location on the x-axis corresponds to the x-axis location of a respective dashed line  in . The phase of this point corresponds to the metric characterizing the respective spike  in , which indicates the amount of sensor response reduction caused by the respective dashed line  in . For example, point Q corresponds to the tip of a longest spike  in . Point R corresponds to the tip of the shortest spike  in .","In various exemplary embodiments, the frequency of the dash minimum response curve is used to detect roll. Roll is a rotation of the printhead about an axis normal to the drum. When the printhead has roll, the y-axis position of the nozzles of the printhead is a function of the x-axis position. Thus, for example, a one pixel offset (or shift) between dashes of adjacent dashed lines produced by adjacent nozzles will be different than one pixel. This difference will cause a change in the frequency of the dash minimum response profile produced from the response profile sensed from the dashed lines.","In various exemplary embodiments, each dashed line  in  is assigned a dashed line index based on the x-axis position of the dashed line. Accordingly, the x-axis in  may be replaced by dashed line indices, and the dash minimum response profile  in  may be expressed as a function of dashed line indices, as shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["70","72"]},"In various exemplary embodiments, the first sinusoidal curve is obtained from an aligned printhead, a simulated test pattern, or mathematical calculations.","As shown in , the first dash minimum response profile  has a longer wavelength, or lower frequency, than the second dash minimum response profile . The frequency difference between the first and second sinusoidal curves is proportional to the magnitude of the roll.","In various exemplary embodiments, the frequency change is determined using standard fast Fourier transform. When the changes are less than the frequency resolution of standard fast Fourier transform, various digital signal processing techniques are used to measure such small changes in frequency. In various exemplary embodiments, the small changes in frequency are determined using Chirp Z-Transform.","In various exemplary embodiments, the changes in frequency are determined by comparing the frequency of the second sinusoidal curve with an expected frequency. In such exemplary embodiments, the first sinusoidal curve need not be produced.","In various exemplary embodiments, the first and second sinusoidal curves in  represent dash minimum response profiles from two printheads. In such exemplary embodiments, the difference between the frequencies of the two sinusoidal curves indicates that one printhead has roll relative to the other printhead.","In various exemplary embodiments, the phase of the dash minimum response profile in  is used to detect y-axis stitch. Y-axis stitch shifts the image produced by one printhead with respect to the image produced by another printhead in the process direction. Because of the image shift between two printheads, a change occurs in the phase of the dash minimum response profile of the cross section between the two printheads, as shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["80","82","80","82","86","80","82","86","80","82","80","82"]},"The phase of the dash minimum response profile may be determined using a digital signal process technique. The difference in the phases of two curves may be used to determine y-axis offset between two printheads. In various exemplary embodiments, the relative y-axis offset between two printheads is determined by:\n\n\u0394=()\u03c6\/(2\u03c0),\n\nwhere n+nis the repeat of the test pattern in pixels, s is the spacing between pixels, and \u03c6 is the phase difference. In various exemplary embodiments, s=42.3 \u03bcm for 600 spi printing.\n","In various exemplary embodiments, there is a dynamic range requirement for the detection of process direction stitch. The distance between the top of one dash to the top of the next dash in the process direction must be greater than the range in process direction stitch that is necessary to detect. A change in process direction stitch greater than the distance between dashes in the process direction is equivalent to a change in phase greater than 2\u03c0 between the dash minimum response profiles from each printhead. A phase shift outside the range between \u2212\u03c0 and \u03c0 cannot be distinguished than a phase in between the range \u2212\u03c0 and \u03c0. If the required dynamic range is known, then the dash length can be chosen so the process direction stitch can be measured across the full dynamic range.","In various exemplary embodiments, the phase of the dash minimum response profile of  is used to detect y-axis interlace between two passes of a single printhead.  illustrates a first sinusoidal curve  (the black curve) and a second sinusoidal curve  (the gray curve) with a phase difference . The first dash minimum response profile  is determined from finding the metric associated with the spikes of the sensor response arising only from the dashes printed during the first pass. The second dash minimum response profile  is determined from a finding the metric associated with the spikes of the sensor response arising only from dashes printed during the second pass.","In , the dash minimum response profiles  and  are plotted against the nozzle index. In various exemplary embodiments, the nozzle index is a sequential identification numbering of the nozzles that produce the dashed line printed during the pass plotted. In various other exemplary embodiments, the dash minimum response curves are plotted against the x-axis location of the dashed line produced in the first pass, the dashed line produced in the second pass or a combination of the x-axis positions of the dashed line produced during the first pass and the dashed line produced during the second pass.","When there is no y-axis interlace, and the dash minimum response is plotted against the nozzle index, the two dash minimum response profiles in  should overlap. However, when there is a y-axis interlace, there is a difference between the phases of the two dash minimum response profiles  and . Accordingly, the two sinusoidal curves  and  do not overlap. In various exemplary embodiments, the difference between the phases of the two sinusoidal curves  and  is used to determine y-axis interlace.","The description above in connection with  uses only two passes. It should be appreciated that the description is not limited to two passes. Instead, the description can be generalized to any number of passes.","In various other exemplary embodiments, the y-axis interlace is determined by producing dashed lines during the first pass using only a subset (for example, the left hand side half) of the nozzles of the printheads, and producing dashed lines during the second pass using another subset (for example, the right hand side half) of the nozzles of the printhead. In such exemplary embodiments, sinusoidal curves will be produced that are similar to the sinusoidal curves  and  in , except that first curve  on the left hand side is produced during the first pass, and the second curve  on the right hand side is produced during the second pass. Accordingly, the phase shift or phase change between the first and second curves  and  indicates y-axis interlace.","The detected roll, y-axis stitch and y-axis interlace may be used for correction and adjustment. In various exemplary embodiments, these registration errors are measured at manufacturing during the alignment of the printheads. In various other exemplary embodiments, these registration errors are measured dynamically during printer operation. The measurements and adjustments may be repeated during the life of the printer. The adjustment may be made manually or automatically. In various exemplary embodiments, the adjustment is made automatically by mechanically adjusting the position of a printhead. In various other exemplary embodiments, the adjustment is made by adjusting the jet firing time to compensate for registration errors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["100","110","120","130","135"]},"In step S, minima first and second metric is determined from the first and second dash minimum response profile.
