Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to methods and apparatus for displaying information graphically.","B. Description of the Related Art","A problem today for many practitioners, particularly in the science disciplines, is the scarcity of available time to review the large volumes of information that are being collected. For example, modern methods in the life and chemical sciences are producing data at an unprecedented pace. This data may include not only text information, but also DNA sequences, protein sequences, numerical data (e.g., from gene chip assays), and categoric data.","Given this flood of diverse information, effective and timely use of the results is no longer possible using traditional approaches, such as lists, tables, or even simple graphs. Furthermore, it is clear that more valuable hypotheses can be derived by simultaneous consideration of multiple types of experimental data (e.g., protein sequence in addition to gene expression data), a process that is currently problematic with large amounts of data.","Others have developed graphical depictions of multivariate data. See e.g., Nielson G M, Hagen H, M\u00fcller H, eds., (1997) , IEEE Computer Society, Los Alamitos; Becker R A, Cleveland W S (1987) , Technometrics 29:127\u2013142; Cleveland W S (1993) , Hobart Press, Summit, N J; Bertin J (1983) , University of Wisconsin Press, London; Cleveland W S (1993) Visualizing Data, Hobart Press, Summit, N J. Although these efforts may provide a graphical description of data, they do not provide an integrated, interactive, and intuitive approach that allows a user to explore information to discover knowledge.","There exists, therefore, a need for methods and apparatus that address the shortcomings of these graphical interfaces.","Methods and apparatus consistent with the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, use interactive surface maps to display disparate types of information graphically. These methods and apparatus provide a graphical depiction of records and their attributes in a manner that is easy for the human mind to assimilate, highlights the most informative features of the data, and enables unexpected relationships to be found.","Consistent with the invention, a method of interactively displaying records and their associated attributes involves defining a set of graphic images, wherein each graphic image represents a range of values. The method generates a surface map, with records arranged along a first dimension and graphic images (representing attributes associated with the records) arranged along a second dimension. Upon receiving input from a user selecting a record on the surface map, an index is analyzed to determine if the record is shown in another view. If the record is shown in another view, the visual representation of the record in the other view is altered.","Consistent with the invention, a computer-readable medium includes instructions for controlling a computer system to perform a method for interactively displaying records and their associated attributes. The method involves selecting a set of records and their associated attributes, wherein the associated attributes are any combination of numeric, categoric, sequence, and text information. The method converts the attributes into numeric values, and defines a set of graphic images, wherein each graphic image represents a range of numeric values. The method generates a surface map with the set of records arranged along a first dimension and graphic images (representing attributes associated with the records) arranged along a second dimension.","Reference will now be made in detail to an embodiment of the present invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers may be used throughout the drawings and the following description to refer to the same or like parts.","A. Overview","Methods and apparatus consistent with the invention provide tools that allow a user to display information interactively so that the user can explore the information to discover knowledge. One such tool displays a set of records and their associated attributes in the form of a detailed, resizeable, scrollable two-dimensional surface map. As used herein, the term \u201crecord\u201d (or \u201cobject\u201d) generally refers to an individual element of a data set. The characteristics associated with records are generally referred to herein as attributes.","The tool also generates reduced-size two- and three-dimensional surface maps that provide an overview of the information displayed in the detailed surface map. Each of these maps are linked to other views, such that a record selected in one map is highlighted in the other views, and vice versa.","B. Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","180","170","170","100"]},"Computer  comprises several components that are all interconnected via a system bus . Bus  can be, for example, a bi-directional system bus that connects the components of computer , and contains thirty-two address lines for addressing a memory  and a thirty-two bit data bus for transferring data among the components. Alternatively, multiplex data\/address lines can be used instead of separate data and address lines. Computer  communicates with other users' computers on network  via a network interface , examples of which include Ethernet or dial-up telephone connections.","Computer  contains a processor  connected to a memory . Processor  can be a microprocessor manufactured by Motorola, such as the 680X0 processor, a processor manufactured by Intel, such as the 80X86 or Pentium processors, or a SPARC\u2122 microprocessor from Sun Microsystems, Inc. However, any other suitable microprocessor or micro-, mini-, or mainframe computer, can be used. Memory  can include a RAM, a ROM, a video memory, or mass storage. The mass storage can include both fixed and removable media (e.g., magnetic, optical, or magnetic optical storage systems or other available mass storage technology). Memory  can include a program, an application programming interface (API), and a virtual machine (VM) that contains instructions for handling constraints, consistent with the invention.","A user typically provides information to computer  via a keyboard  and a pointing device , although other input devices can be used. In return, information is conveyed to the user via display screen .","C. Architectural Operation","Before information may be displayed interactively so that a user can explore and discover knowledge, it must be processed into a condition suitable for display. Although this processing is described in detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/410,367, entitled \u201cDATA PROCESSING, ANALYSIS, AND VISUALIZATION SYSTEM FOR USE WITH DISPARATE DATA TYPES,\u201d it may be described briefly as follows. First, the information represented by the records (including text, numeric, categoric, and sequence\/string data) is received in electronic form. Second, the records are analyzed to produce high-dimensional vectors, which are indexed. Third, the high-dimensional vectors are grouped in space to identify relationships. Fourth, the high-dimensional vectors are converted to a two dimensional representation for viewing purposes, generally referred to herein as \u201cprojection.\u201d Fifth, the projections may be viewed in different formats according to user-selected options. Each view is linked to an index (or indices), such that a user selection in one view propagates to other views.","One basic visual tool consistent with the invention for viewing information is a \u201cgalaxy view,\u201d an example of which is shown in . The galaxy view is a two-dimensional scatter graph in which records are organized and depicted in groups (or \u201cclusters\u201d) based on relationships between one record and another. In addition to this galaxy view tool, the invention provides numerous interactive visual tools that allow a user to explore and discover knowledge.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["305","310","315"]},"Next, a two-dimensional surface map is generated to visually depict the records and their associated attributes (step ). illustrates one implementation of a resizeable, scrollable surface map  (the portion of bounded by \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d) that is arranged as an array, with records forming the rows and attributes forming the columns. Each row within , a set of which are shown as , depicts information associated with a record. Within each row, a series of gray-scale rectangular blocks are used to depict the value of each attribute associated with that record, as shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"i":["b ","a","b"],"b":["405","410","450","450"]},"The ordering of records within map  may be defined by the user; or it may be achieved by using algorithms, such as statistical correlation. Similarly, the ordering of the attributes associated with each record may be defined by the user or by an algorithm. Furthermore, relationships between records may be depicted within map  in numerous ways. For example, graphical bands (e.g., the two bands shown as ), may be used to represent related groups of records. Alternatively, conventional dendograms may be used to show relationships between records.","In one implementation, the ordering of records is performed by grouping the records into clusters that have centroids. These clusters are then ordered based on a correlation algorithm applied to the centroids. Finally, within each cluster, the records are ordered by sorting based on the mean distance between each record and the centroids neighboring that record's centroid\u2014the goal being to place each record closest to the neighboring centroid to which it is the most similar. For the terminal clusters, where there is only a single neighboring centroid, the records are sorted by mean distance from the single centroid neighbor. This approach minimizes distances between like records, provides a smooth blending from one record to the next, and allows the user to see structure in the data that would otherwise be difficult to find.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 4","i":"a ","b":["440","440","405","440","445","440","405"]},"In addition to map  shown in , a three-dimensional surface map  may be used, as shown in . In the implementation shown, records are arranged in rows from the bottom-left to the upper-left; attributes are arranged as columns of gray-scale rectangular blocks from the bottom-left to the bottom-right; and values corresponding to each particular attribute for each particular record are represented both by the shade of gray and the height of each rectangular block. Map  may contain either the records shown in  or all records being evaluated, and may be rotated in any of the three dimensions and\/or zoomed to view the information contained therein.","In addition to viewing the information in graphical form, the user can interact with the surface maps. Systems consistent with the invention are capable of receiving input from a user selecting a portion of the surface map (step ). This may be achieved, for example, by using a device to point to a portion of map  or by clicking a pointing device on a portion of map . In response to this user input, the information associated with the identified portion can be displayed in text format. For example, the record being pointed to in is identified as \u201c1377T\u201d, as shown by . Similarly, the attribute being pointed to in is identified as \u201cMETA\u201d, as shown by . The value of the attribute being pointed to in is identified as \u201c0.0\u201d, as shown by .","Furthermore, any selections made by the user on a surface map are propagated to other views. For example, in response to receiving input from a user selecting a record in surface map , an index is analyzed to determine if the record is shown in another view (step ). This index is described more fully above in U.S. patent application Ser. No, 09\/410.367, entitled \u201cDATA PROCESSING, ANALYSIS, AND VISUALIZATION SYSTEM FOR USE WITH DISPARATE DATA TYPES.\u201d If the record is shown in another display (step ), the visual representation of that record in the other view is altered (step ).  is a diagram showing both map  and a galaxy view of records . If a record is selected on map , the record is highlighted In galaxy view , and vice versa. Similarly, selecting a group of records on map  (as shown by ) causes the corresponding group of records to be highlighted in galaxy view  (as shown by ), and vice versa.","D. CONCLUSION","As described in detail above, methods and apparatus consistent with the invention provide tools that allow a user to display information interactively so that the user can explore the information to discover knowledge. The foregoing description of an implementation of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. Modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practicing the invention.","For example, although the foregoing description focuses on data types such as text, numeric, categoric, and sequence, those skilled in the art will recognize that other data types may be used consistent with the invention. Furthermore, the foregoing description is based on a client-server architecture, but those skilled in the art will recognize that a peer-to-peer architecture may be used consistent with the invention. Moreover, although the described implementation includes software, the invention may be implemented as a combination of hardware and software or in hardware alone. Additionally, although aspects of the present invention are described as being stored in memory, one skilled in the art will appreciate that these aspects can also be stored on other types of computer-readable media, such as secondary storage devices, like hard disks, floppy disks, or CD-ROM; a carrier wave from the Internet; or other forms of RAM or ROM. The scope of the invention is therefore defined by the claims and their equivalents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in, and constitute a part of, this specification illustrate an embodiment of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the advantages and principles of the invention.
