{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 11\/986,562 filed Nov. 21, 2007, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/860,293 filed Nov. 21, 2006, U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/879,835 filed Jan. 11, 2007, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/901,623 filed Feb. 13, 2007, which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.","The invention relates generally to systems and methods for providing public and non-public notice through nontraditional means. More specifically, this invention relates to systems and methods for providing legal and other public notice using the Internet.","As most lawyers and people know, the law requires notice before certain types of legal actions can proceed. The most ready example of the need for public notice, of course, would be notice by publication in serving a lawsuit where the defendant cannot be found for personal service of the summons. Currently, notice by publication is accomplished by publication in a newspaper. Given the well publicized disintegration of the paper newspaper industry currently taking place (which is in turn due partly to the fact that only 19% of persons under the age of 35 still read a newspaper at least once per week), this form of notice no longer serves the public policy behind the enabling statutes (i.e., the widest possible dissemination of the notice to the public). Thus, this traditional means of public notice no longer serves its legal function. Additionally, the costs incurred in the use of traditional methods can be much greater than those associated with on-line notice postings. Further, the security and archival options of traditional notice methods are limited. Traditional methods of providing notice also suffer from limited coverage due to the fact that notice is constrained to the available newspaper circulation area. Finally, traditional methods of notice are constrained by delivery schedules and cycles of newspaper vendors and delivery personnel along with the hours of operation of many courthouses.","Using the Internet to provide notice services overcomes only some of the shortcomings of traditional print publication. Currently, the only forms of Internet-based public notice that exist are what can be termed \u201crepublication\u201d notices. For example, newspapers often publish an online version of their printed notices on a website. Other organizations have attempted to provide limited, secondary publication public notice services via the Internet, but have failed to create a centralized forum for all state-encompassed jurisdictions and\/or a forum of original publication for public notice within a jurisdiction that is both government sanctioned (or sanctioned by some other useful body) and quality controlled, or not, as the jurisdiction and case might require.","As such, a need exists for a cost-effective, quality-controlled forum for providing centralized, original-jurisdiction legal and other public notice within a legal jurisdiction.","The invention substantially meets the aforementioned needs of the industry by providing a unique way of achieving legal and other notice which is first and foremost consolidated, and also more thorough, wide-reaching, and inexpensive than that which could be achieved via notice by publication at the courthouse or in a newspaper, and thereby creates a certainty of increasing the dissemination of the notice to the intended party or parties. Further, various embodiments of the invention overcome the limitations presented above by allowing economical public notice across all jurisdictions, at all times.","One embodiment of the present invention is a system for posting a public notice on the Internet. The system may include a notice database server, notice application server and an interactive voice response server. The servers may be configured to operate on a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). In various embodiments, additional servers may be utilized in load-balancing or cluster configurations in order to handle increased load and to maintain system performance as the number of users increase. In this way, system users may access the system utilizing network-capable devices or via voice-enabled devices.","In various embodiments, the notice database server stores data and information regarding public notices in various jurisdictions including federal, state and county. The notice application server supports a notice website that provides notice-related services such as posting, searching, monitoring, and others. Further, the notice application server may serve custom Uniform Resource Locators (URL) for specific jurisdictions in order to merge with existing web offerings of that jurisdiction. Further the custom URLs may provide an initial level of filtering for notices and services offered.","Another embodiment of the present invention is a method of posting a public notice on a government-sanctioned website. Steps include accessing a court's case database, locating a court filing that requires public notice in the database, transferring the information required for public notice to an offsite server, and making the public notice available to users of the Internet. Another method for obtaining the necessary court filing information to post to the government-sanctioned website is to utilize a notice application\/web server to directly connect to a court's case database and query notice information in order to dynamically generate near real-time updates to the notice pages provided by the notice website and display updated notice-related information.","Another embodiment of the present invention is a method of searching for notice information utilizing the notice website. Steps include choosing key search terms, searching the notice website for notices using key terms, providing search results relevant to the users notice query. Searching the notice website may include searching the notice archives for notices that have elapsed. Further, in certain embodiments the end-user performing the search may be notified later as additional notices are added to the notice database.","In other embodiments, the notice application server and notice database are able to store and provide notice relating to additional businesses that frequently utilize notice mechanisms. In this way, the notice application\/web server may provide key business information such as the address and current registered agent of a selected company.","The above summary of the various embodiments of the invention is not intended to describe each illustrated embodiment or every implementation of the invention.","While the invention is amenable to various modifications and alternative forms, specifics thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the intention is not to limit the invention to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.","Referring to , one embodiment of a system for posting a public notice on the Internet is presented The system  may include the Internet , a notice server , a administrative computer , a administrative server , and client computers  and .","The Internet  is utilized to provide interconnectivity between the notice server , administrative computer  and client computers  and .

Further, the end-user may be able to enter in billing information which will enable to the Internet notice posting system  to produce invoices for notice services performed.","The user interface  may allow an end user to create a notice. In various embodiments the end user creates a notice by traversing several user interface screens that allow the end user to enter in specific information including state selection , county selection , notice type selection , other notice data entry  and validation . The information may be entered utilizing various form fields and dropdowns present on the user interface. Further, the user interface may provide different form fields to the end-user based on the state selection , county selection  and notice type selection . In the case of legal notice, the Internet posting service  user interface  will provide the form fields statutorily defined for that type of notice in that jurisdiction. The user interface  may then allow the end user to submit the notice to the Internet notice posting system's  notice application server  for processing by the PVS and NVS. Upon successful processing by the PVS and NVS the user interface may signal the end-user that the notice was successfully submitted. In other embodiments, the submission process will not perform the PVS before moving to the NVS.","The PVS, according to various embodiments validates information submitted to the Internet notice posting system . The PVS may be run on the notice application server  and may be coded in a variety of programming languages including Java, C#, C++, C, php, .NET and others. The PVS is able to take information submitted via the Internet notice posting system  user interface  or the IVR and validate it to ensure the completeness and correctness of information. In various embodiments, the PVS will compare information submitted through the user interface  to a validation scheme stored in the notice database  for the user selected jurisdiction. For example, an end user may select North Carolina, Guilford County and Notice of Foreclosure as the notice type via the user interface . The PVS will take this information and compare it to a set of fields in the notice database . For instance, the PVS will compare North Carolina with a list of all states. If the notice database  does not contain the information and the comparison fails the PVS validation will fail. Additional information relating to the Notice of Foreclosure, as used in our example, such as original deed of trust information, sale location, sale time, sale date, property information, deposit requirements and sale trustee information may be validated by the PVS by first parsing the data into component parts and then evaluating them individually. In various embodiments, parsing is provided by a slot grammar parser and the resulting component parts are validated against a list of acceptable terms for that data field stored in the notice database . Each part may be evaluated individually as well as in relation to the entire field entry against a database of acceptable terms and grammatical rules. In addition, each evaluation may further be given a validity score ranging from 1 to 100. In this situation, should the average score of each evaluation exceed a tolerance, the field will pass evaluation, otherwise the validation will fail. For example, utilizing the North Carolina, Guilford County and Notice of Foreclosure selections, values submitted in the sale time field may be validated as a correct date. Thus, a sale time of \u201c10:00 a.m\u201d may be parsed and validated as having acceptable values in that field with a score for \u201c10:00\u201d of 97 and a score for \u201ca.m\u201d of 93. While a sale time of \u201cquail roost road\u201d would be parsed and then flagged by the PVS as invalid with \u201cquail\u201d having a score of 30, \u201croost\u201d having a score of 25 and \u201croad\u201d having a score of 12 for that field where the tolerance is set at 75.","In addition to the comparison of data types, the PVS may utilize information from various external databases and external applications for validation. For example, the PVS may connect to an external web service provided by the US Postal Office to analyze and verify that the property information submitted by the end user is a valid address. Thus, the PVS may query the US Postal Office web service for \u201c1122 Quail Roost Drive, Greensboro, N.C., 27410\u201d for indication that this is a valid address. Similarly the PVS may utilize web services to the Register of Deeds and other databases to validate submitted information. For instance, the PVS may query the Register of Deeds database to determine whether the information submitted relating to the original deed of trust is correct based on the submitted address. In another embodiment, the PVS will contact the clerk of courts database through a web service or a persistent connection and validate values of each field against the Clerk of Courts system. The PVS may, in other embodiments, utilize local copies of record databases for validation.","The PVS may, in various embodiments, adjust its ranking system over time. In these embodiments, every comparison of data and score ranking is logged for further evaluation when the information fails to meet the determined threshold. Thus, if the PVS flags a piece of data as invalid and upon later review it is found to be valid, the acceptable terms and grammar rules will be updated to reflect the validity. In this way, the PVS dynamically adapts to rule and vocabulary changes over time, thus maintaining a high degree of accuracy in validation.","The NFS, according to various embodiments, formats information submitted to the Internet notice posting system  into a valid format for providing notice. The NFS may be run on the notice application server  and may be coded in a variety of programming languages including Java, C#, C++, C, php, .NET and others. The NFS is able to take information validated by the PVS and populate it into the corresponding notice template. In various embodiments the notice templates are created utilizing HTML and CSS. The Internet notice posting system  and user interface  may then present the completed notice including end-user submitted data to the end-user for validation. Upon end-user validation, the NFS will transform the populated notice template into a non-editable format. The formats available include a PDF, or image such as TIFF. Conversion to PDF may be completed utilizing conversion programs such as Apache XML Graphics, html2 ps, dompdf, html-to-pdf or the like. Conversion into various image formats may be performed by utilizers such as Imagemagick\u00ae, GD2, HTML snapshot or others. Then the NFS will apply a cryptographic algorithm such as SHA or MD5 to the converted PDF or image file and store the resulting file in the notice database . The converted template may also be stored in the database for retrieval by users of the Internet notice posting system . In this way, the NFS provides the ability to verify the validity of a converted notice by reapplying the cryptographic algorithm and validating the result against the corresponding file stored in the notice database . If the two files are not the same, then the converted notice has been modified. These validation procedures may be performed later by end-users who view the notice or by and automated process that periodically verifies the validity of the converted notices stored in the notice database .","Now referring to  posting a notice to the Internet notice posting system  utilizing the Internet user interface according to one embodiment is presented. In this embodiment an end-user will utilize their Internet browser to connect to the Internet notice posting system's website . The end-user may utilize web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera or Apple Safari.

The end user then will enter in the additional information required by the selected notice in the selected jurisdiction on the Internet notice posting system website . Once the end-user has completed the data entry, they will submit the data  and the information is passed to the PVS . The PVS  then attempts to validate the information  utilizing the machines, systems, and methods presented above. If the PVS  determines that the information is invalid it will log the error and return to the Internet notice posting system website  and allow the end-user to reenter the information. If the PVS  determines that the information is valid, it will submit the information  to the NFS . The NFS  will format the notice and produce a converted notice file and cryptographic file which will then be stored in the notice database .","Now referring to  posting a notice to the Internet notice posting system  utilizing the IVR according to one embodiment is presented. In this embodiment, a voice user  will utilize their voice device to connect to the Internet notice posting system's IVR system . The voice user  may utilize a landline telephone, a cellphone, IP-voice service or other voice device. The voice user  will then select the jurisdiction  and type of notice that they would like to submit and enter in the additional information  required by the selected notice in the selected jurisdiction into the IVR . As mentioned earlier, this information may be submitted via voice recognition or keypad recognition in the IVR . At any time during the data entry, the voice user  may obtain support  from a customer service representative . The customer service representative may be requested for support, or may be initialized by the IVR, PVS or NFS. Once the voice user  has completed data entry the IVR  will forward the data to the PVS  for validation . The PVS  will attempt to validate the information  utilizing machines, systems, and methods presented above. If the PVS  determines that the information is invalid it will log the error and contact a customer service representative  who will assist the voice user  in data entry. If the PVS  determines that the information is valid, it will submit the information  to the NFS . The NFS  will format the notice and produce a converted notice file and cryptographic file which will then be stored  in the notice database . The customer service representative  may, in some cases, format the notice with information provided by the voice user  and store it directly in the notice database .","Now referring to , posting a notice to the Internet notice posting system  utilizing the Internet notice posting system AOC connection, according to one embodiment is presented. In this embodiment, a court clerk or other state employee utilizing an AOC client computer  will enter in case data  into the court's enterprise server  and case database system .

The NFS  may then extract notice data  from the case database system  based on the flags. In various embodiments, the NFS  may include a notice data extraction system that extracts the notice information from the case database system  utilizing an AOC connection. In other embodiments the notice data extraction system may be a process running within the Internet notice posting service  that periodically establishes a connection to the case database system  to look for data flagged for extraction by the case database system  or AOC client computer . In still other embodiments the notice data extraction system may be an application installed on the case database system  or AOC client computer  to extract data selected for notice generation while it is being entered or after a completed case database system  transaction. Thus, various embodiments, the extracted data is utilized by the NFS . The NFS  will format the notice and produce a converted notice file and cryptographic file which will then be stored  in the notice database .","Now referring to , a notice creation process, according to an embodiment, is presented. The process described in  may be utilized in various data entry endpoints including the Internet user interface and IVS systems presented above. The notice creation process begins with an end-user selecting a state of jurisdiction . The Internet notice posting system  will query the notice database  for a list of counties based on the selected state . The end-user will then select the county of interest from the list . The Internet notice posting system  will then query the notice database  for a list of notices available for the user-selected county .
