{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/259,720, filed Jan. 4, 2001.","This invention was made with government support under NIH Grant Nos. GM19335 and AI34342. As such, the United States government has certain rights in this invention.","Human cyclic ADP-ribose synthetase (CD38) is an ectoenzyme, expressed on the surface of \u03b2 cells, that makes cyclic-adenosine-diphosphate-ribose (cADPR) and ADP-ribose from nicotinamide-diphosphate-ribose (oxidized form) (NAD). Nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide (NGD) is also cyclized by CD38 to form cGDPR, and hydrolyzed to form GDPR. Human CD38 (1\u20132, 33) and adenosine-diphosphate (ADP) ribosyl-cyclase (3\u20134, 34\u201335) share 68% homology in primary sequence (36); both synthesize cADPR from NAD (15, 37). The compound cADPR is formed by intramolecular ADP-ribosylation at the N1 position of the adenine ring (5), and is a potent agent for calcium-ion (Ca) release from intracellular Ca stores (1, 7, 38\u201344).","An increasing volume of evidence indicates that CD38 and ADP ribosyl-cyclase regulate important physiological processes in invertebrates (1, 38\u201344), plants (8), and mammals (1, 2, 6, 9\u201310, 45) via the synthesis of cADPR. In mammals, CD38 and cADPR have been implicated in the regulation of cellular processes, including insulin release (9), lymphocyte activation (2, 10), bone homeostasis (45), and synaptic plasticity (6). Additionally, the presence of CD38 has been linked to cytokine-induced differentiation (1), cell adhesion (1), and signal transduction (37). The wide distribution of CD38 in the brain, white blood cells, pancreas, and other tissues, suggests that this enzyme may have a general signaling role via cADPR production in vivo.","cADPR has been implicated in the release of Ca from inside cells (1, 7, 38\u201344). Mobilization of internal calcium is an important signaling mechanism in cells, and may be implicated in numerous pathologies. Diseases and conditions associated with the transmembrane flux of Ca ions into cells, particularly vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiac muscle cells, and cells of the nervous system, may include angina (e.g., angina pectoris, chronic stable angina, and vasospastic angina), arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), and multiple sclerosis (MS).","Small-molecule, mechanism-based inhibitors of specific signaling pathways are desirable for therapeutic use. Unlike most conventional drugs, which temporarily inhibit the target enzyme, many mechanism-based inhibitors permanently disable the target enzyme. Small molecules that inhibit CD38 would be expected to decrease levels of cADPR, resulting in a modification in intracellular levels of Ca. In particular, inhibition of cADPR-stimulated Ca release would be expected to have significant effects on calcium-mediated signaling pathways in many cells and tissues, thereby providing a useful treatment option for pathologies in which Ca regulation is implicated. However, prior to the present invention, there were no known effective, small-molecule, mechanism-based inhibitors of CD38 having the potential for regulation of cADPR levels.","The present invention is based upon the design and synthesis of a novel class of small-molecule, mechanism-based inhibitors of human CD38 that accomplish mechanism-based trapping at the enzyme's catalytic site. These inhibitors and their analogues provide new tools for investigating biological pathways in which CD38 and related enzymes are involved, and offer new therapeutic options for treating diseases and conditions associated with CD38, related enzymes, and cADPR. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide pharmaceuticals that are effective inhibitors of ADP-ribosyl cyclases, transferases, and hydrolases.","It is also an object of the present invention to provide compounds having the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0009"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"20.66mm","wi":"26.42mm","file":"US07056894-20060606-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"It is a further object of the present invention to provide pharmaceutical compositions containing the above compounds, methods of using the above compounds as pharmaceuticals, and processes for preparing the above compounds.","Additionally, it is an object of the present invention to provide methods for inhibiting an ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, or ADP-ribosyl hydrolase enzyme, by contacting the enzyme with one of the above compounds in an amount effective to inhibit the enzyme.","Finally, it is an object of the present invention to provide methods for treating a disease or condition associated with an ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, or ADP-ribosyl hydrolase enzyme in a subject in need of treatment thereof, by administering to the subject one of the above compounds in an amount effective to treat the disease or condition.","Additional objects of the present invention will be apparent in view of the description which follows.","In one aspect, the present invention provides inhibitor compounds having the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0024"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"23.11mm","wi":"56.73mm","file":"US07056894-20060606-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Preferably, A is an N-linked aryl or heterocyclic group, an O-linked aryl or heterocyclic group having the formula \u2014O\u2014Y, or an S-linked aryl or heterocyclic group having the formula \u2014O\u2014Y; both B and C are hydrogen, or either B or C is a halogen, amino, or thiol group and the other of B or C is hydrogen; and D is a primary alcohol or hydrogen.

Additionally, the enzyme may be incubated with a radioactive inhibitor, and radiochemical measurements of reaction rates may be taken, as described below. Slow-onset inhibitor binding may be determined using methods such as those described (32).","Molecules of the novel class of mechanism-based inhibitors disclosed herein accomplish mechanism-based trapping at the catalytic site of their target enzymes. The inhibitor is designed to react rapidly to form a covalent intermediate that cannot cyclize and that is stable to hydrolysis, thereby trapping the enzyme in a catalytically-inactive form. For example, the novel inhibitor \u03b2--1\u2032-nicotinamide-2\u2032-deoxyribofuranoside acts as a reversible competitive inhibitor (K=1.0 \u03bcM) of CD38, and is followed by slow-onset inactivation of the enzyme. Inactivated enzyme is covalently modified by the deoxyribofuranoside. Active CD38 is slowly regenerated by hydrolysis in the absence of added substrates, and is rapidly regenerated in the presence of excess nicotinamide. These properties of inhibitor action give rise to an effective inhibition constant of 2.9 nM. This novel class of mechanism based inhibitors has potential for the regulation of cyclic ADP-ribose levels through CD38, and provides new tools for investigating the various pathways in which ADP-ribosyl transferases, cyclases, and hydrolases have been implicated.","The biological availability of a compound of formula (I) can be enhanced by conversion into a pro-drug form. Such a pro-drug can have improved lipophilicity relative to the compound of formula (I), and this can result in enhanced membrane permeability. One particularly useful form of pro-drug is an ester derivative. Its utility relies upon the action of one or more of the ubiquitous intracellular lipases to catalyse the hydrolysis of ester groups, to release the compound of formula (I) at or near its site of action. In one form of pro-drug, one or more hydroxy groups in a compound of formula (I) can be O-acylated, to make an acylate derivative.","Pro-drug forms of a 5-phosphate ester derivative of compounds of formula (I) can also be made. These may be particularly useful, since the anionic nature of the 5-phosphate may limit its ability to cross cellular membranes. Conveniently, such a 5-phosphate derivative can be converted to an uncharged bis(acyloxymethyl) ester derivative. The utility of such a pro-drug relies upon the action of one or more of the ubiquitous intracellular lipases to catalyse the hydrolysis of ester groups, releasing a molecule of formaldehyde and the compound of formula (I) at or near its site of action. Specific examples of the utility of, and general methods for making, such acyloxymethyl ester pro-drug forms of phosphorylated carbohydrate derivatives have been described (28\u201331).","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for inhibiting an ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, or ADP-ribosyl hydrolase enzyme. As used herein, \u201cADP-ribosyl transferase\u201d refers to those enzymes which catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose (adenosine 5\u2033-diphospho-5\u2032-\u03b1--ribose) from NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) to acceptor groups that are chemically reactive as nucleophiles, as well as enzymes that share catalytic site homology with such enzymes. The acceptor groups include the nucleophilic groups of proteins, nucleic acids, sugars, and lipids. Biologically reactive nucleophiles also include other metabolites containing carboxyl groups, amino groups, guanidinium groups, thiol groups, and nitrogens of aromatic or aliphatic compounds, as well as other groups chemically recognized as having nucleophilic character. The ADP-ribosyl transferase family of enzymes produces ADP-ribosylated proteins, ADP-ribosylated nucleic acids, ADP-ribosylated sugars, sugar polymers in homo- or hetero-polymeric forms, glycoproteins, ADP-ribosylated lipids, and ADP-ribosylated compounds of cellular metabolism. Compounds of cellular metabolism include carboxylic acids, sugars, amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, nucleosides, vitamins, and intermediates in the biochemical pathways that synthesize these compounds of cellular metabolism.","As used herein, \u201cADP-ribosyl cyclase\u201d includes those enzymes that catalyze the conversion of NAD to ADP-ribose (adenosine 5\u2033-diphospho-5\u2032-\u03b1--ribose), in which reaction a chemical bond between carbon 1\u2032 of the \u03b1--ribose group of NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is transferred to any nucleophilic acceptor group within the same ADP-ribose molecule, thereby forming a cyclic ring system not existing in the parent molecule of NAD. Also included are enzymes that share catalytic site homology with such ADP-ribosyl cyclase enzymes. Nucleophilic acceptor groups include nitrogen and oxygen groups of the parent NAD molecule (e.g., the structure of cyclic-ADP-ribose, in which the carbon 1\u2032 of the \u03b1--ribose group of NAD is cyclized to nitrogen 1\u2032 of the adenine ring to form a new cyclic ring).","Additionally, as used herein, \u201cADP-ribosyl hydrolase\u201d refers to those enzymes that catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose (adenosine 5\u2033-diphospho-5\u2032-\u03b1--ribose) from NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) in the formation of ADP-ribose or cyclic-ADP-ribose. \u201cADP-ribosyl hydrolase\u201d, as used herein, also includes enzymes that catalyze the removal of ADP-ribose, in a hydrolytic reaction, from the ADP-ribosylated groups that are chemically reactive as nucleophiles, defined above. Also included are enzymes that share catalytic site homology with such ADP-ribosyl hydrolase enzymes. ADP-ribosylated groups that are chemically reactive as nucleophiles include the groups of ADP-ribosylated-proteins, ADP-ribosylated-nucleic acids, ADP-ribosylated-sugars, and ADP-ribosylated-lipids from the covalent ADP-ribose. Biologically reactive groups removed from ADP-ribose by hydrolysis may also include biological metabolites containing ADP-ribosylated-carboxyl groups, ADP-ribosylated-amino groups, ADP-ribosylated-guanidinium groups, ADP-ribosylated-thiol groups, ADP-ribosylated-nitrogens of aromatic or aliphatic compounds, and other ADP-ribosylated groups chemically recognized as having nucleophilic character. This family of hydrolases regenerates proteins from ADP-ribosylated proteins, nucleic acids from ADP-ribosylated nucleic acids, sugars from ADP-ribosylated sugars, sugar polymers in homo- or hetero-polymeric forms from their ADP-ribosylated states, and glycoproteins from ADP-ribosylated glycoproteins, lipids from ADP-ribosylated lipids, and removes ADP-ribose from ADP-ribosylated compounds of cellular metabolism. Compounds of cellular metabolism include carboxylic acids, sugars, amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, nucleosides, vitamins, and intermediates in the biochemical pathways that synthesize these biological metabolites.","Examples of ADP-ribosyl transferases, cyclases, and hydrolases include, without limitation, ADP-ribosyl transferases involved in the regulation of gene expression (e.g., SIR family enzymes and their homologues), human CD38, the human ADP-ribosyl cyclase, invertebrate and plant ADP-ribosyl cyclases (e.g., ADP ribosyl-cyclase), and human bone stromal cell antigen (humBST1).

Inhibitor compounds contemplated for the inhibition of ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, or ADP-ribosyl hydrolase enzymes may form a combination of enzyme and inhibitor, thereby generating complexes that reduce the catalytic function of the enzyme.","The inhibitor compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, may be contacted with the enzyme either in vivo or in vitro, using techniques well known to one of skill in the art. Where contacting is effected in vitro, the inhibitor compound may be used as tools for investigating the pathways in which ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, or ADP-ribosyl hydrolase enzymes are involved. Where contacting is effected in vivo, the inhibitor compound may be used to treat a disease or condition in which it is desirable to decrease the activity of an ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, or ADP-ribosyl hydrolase enzyme.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides a method for treating a disease or condition that is directly or indirectly associated with an ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, or ADP-ribosyl hydrolase enzyme in a subject in need of treatment thereof. The method of the present invention comprises administering to the subject any one of the inhibitor compounds of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, in an amount effective to treat the disease or condition.

The ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, or ADP-ribosyl hydrolase enzyme may include any of those described above (e.g., ADP-ribosyl transferases involved in the regulation of gene expression (e.g., SIR family enzymes and their homologues), human CD38, the human ADP-ribosyl cyclase, invertebrate and plant ADP-ribosyl cyclases (e.g., ADP ribosyl-cyclase), and human bone stromal cell antigen (humBST1)). In one embodiment of the present invention, the enzyme is CD38.","As used herein, \u201cdisease\u201d refers to any deviation from, or interruption of, the normal structure or function of any part, organ, or system (or combination thereof) of the body that presents an abnormal or pathologic body state. As further used herein, \u201ccondition\u201d refers to any state of physical or mental abnormality. Furthermore, as used herein, \u201ca disease or condition associated with an ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, or ADP-ribosyl hydrolase enzyme\u201d includes a disease or condition wherein an ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, or ADP-ribosyl hydrolase enzyme contributes to (either directly or indirectly), or is responsible for, the pathophysiology of the disease or condition, or in which it is desirable to decrease the activity of an ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, or ADP-ribosyl hydrolase enzyme, or in which it is desirable to regulate the level of cADPR.","Inhibition of cADPR-stimulated calcium release is expected to have significant effects on calcium-mediated signaling pathways in many cells and tissues. Accordingly, in the method of the present invention, the disease or condition associated with an ADP-ribosyl transferase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, or ADP-ribosyl hydrolase enzyme may include any disease or condition associated with a defect or deficiency in the transmembrane flux of calcium (Ca) ions into or out of cells, particularly vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiac muscle cells, and cells of the nervous system. Examples of such diseases may include, without limitation, angina (e.g., angina pectoris, chronic stable angina, and vasospastic angina), arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), acute transverse myelitis, acute viral encephalitis, adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), adrenomyeloneuropathy, AIDS-vacuolar myelopathy, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), HTLV-associated myelopathy, Leber's hereditary optic atrophy, multiple sclerosis (MS), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, and tropical spastic paraparesis.","In mammals, CD38 and cADPR have been implicated in the regulation of cellular processes, including insulin release (9), lymphocyte activation (2, 10), bone homeostasis (45), and synaptic plasticity (6).

Nevertheless, requisite amounts can be readily determined by the skilled artisan.","It is within the confines of the present invention that the inhibitor compounds disclosed herein may be administered to a subject who is already receiving an inhibitor of the ryanodine receptor or an antagonist that binds the ryanodine receptor. The inhibitor compounds of the present invention, when contacted with the ADP-ribosyl transferase, cyclase, and hydrolase enzymes described herein, result in a decrease in cADPR concentration. It is expected that this decrease would prevent cADPR from competing against antagonists or inhibitors binding at the same site on the ryanodine receptors.","In accordance with the method of the present invention, the inhibitor compound may be administered to a human or animal subject by known procedures, including, without limitation, oral administration, parenteral administration (e.g., epifascial, intracapsular, intracutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intraorbital, intraperitoneal, intraspinal, intrasternal, intravascular, intravenous, parenchymatous, or subcutaneous administration), transdermal administration, and administration by osmotic pump. Preferably, the inhibitor compound of the present invention is administered orally.","For oral administration, the inhibitor compound may be formulated in solid or liquid preparations, e.g., capsules, tablets, powders, granules, dispersions, solutions, and suspensions. Such preparations are well known in the art as are other oral dosage forms not listed here. In a preferred embodiment, the inhibitor compounds of the invention are tableted with conventional tablet bases, such as lactose, sucrose, mannitol, and corn starch, together with a binder, a disintegration agent, and a lubricant. These exipients are well known in the art. The formulation may be presented with binders, such as crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, acacia, corn starch, or gelatins.

Such a formulation may be prepared by dissolving a solid active ingredient in water containing physiologically-compatible substances, such as sodium chloride, glycine, and the like, and having a buffered pH compatible with physiological conditions, so as to produce an aqueous solution, then rendering said solution sterile. The formulations may be presented in unit or multi-dose containers, such as sealed ampules or vials. The formulation may be delivered by any mode of injection, including, without limitation, epifascial, intracapsular, intracutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intraorbital, intraperitoneal, intraspinal, intrasternal, intravascular, intravenous, parenchymatous, or subcutaneous.","For transdermal administration, the inhibitor compound may be combined with skin penetration enhancers, such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, isopropanol, ethanol, oleic acid, N-methylpyrrolidone, and the like, which increase the permeability of the skin to the inhibitor compound, and permit the inhibitor compound to penetrate through the skin and into the bloodstream. The inhibitor compound\/enhancer composition also may be further combined with a polymeric substance, such as ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, ethylene\/vinylacetate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and the like, to provide the composition in gel form, which may be dissolved in solvent, such as methylene chloride, evaporated to the desired viscosity, and then applied to backing material to provide a patch. The inhibitor compound may be administered transdermally, at or near the site on the subject where the disease or condition is localized. Alternatively, the inhibitor compound may be administered transdermally at a site other than the affected area, in order to achieve systemic administration.","The inhibitor compound of the present invention also may be released or delivered from an osmotic mini-pump or other time-release device. The release rate from an elementary osmotic mini-pump may be modulated with a microporous, fast-response gel disposed in the release orifice. An osmotic mini-pump would be useful for controlling release, or targeting delivery, of the inhibitor compound.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition, comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of an inhibitor compound of the first aspect of the invention. The inhibitor compound may be chosen from any of those described above.

Introduction","Human CD38 (1, 2) and related ADP-ribosyl-cyclases (3, 4) are attractive targets for inhibitor design based upon their ability to synthesize cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) from NAD (5). The compound cADPR is formed by the intramolecular transfer of ADP-ribose of NAD to N1 of adenine, with retention of the \u03b2-stereochemistry (Scheme 1). The cADPR product binds ryanodine receptors that control Ca release (1, 7\u201310); therefore, it is a putative second messenger for Ca release inside cells. The mechanism of cADPR formation, which is catalyzed by ADP-ribosyl cyclases, occurs through decomposition of the NAD C1\u2032-N1 bond, resulting in the formation of an ADP-ribosyl electrophile that has been demonstrated to be a covalent intermediate at the active site of the enzyme (11\u201315). Relying upon this mechanistic description of the enzyme function, the inventors have designed, synthesized, and evaluated a new class of mechanism-based inhibitors for the ADP-ribosyl cyclases. These novel compounds function via a combination of binding and mechanism-based covalent inactivation of the ADP-ribosyl cyclase enzymes. The parent structure, nicotinamide deoxyriboside, is a potent inhibitor of CD38\u2014the human ADP-ribosyl cyclase. The chemical synthesis of 2\u2032-deoxy-\u03b2--ribofuranosides of nicotinamide, and several analogues, is described herein, as is their inhibitory properties in respect of CD38 catalytic function.","2.

To a second flask was added 5 mg of nicotinamide (0.041 mmol), 86 mg of AgSbF(0.25 mmol), and 5 ml of acetonitrile.

The rate constant k() was determined as reported (19).","3. Results and Discussion","The reaction mechanism of CD38, and, presumably, the mechanisms of related ADP-cyclase enzymes, involve the formation of a covalent intermediate along the catalytic reaction coordinate (12). Numerous glycotransferases form covalent intermediates during the catalytic cycle. These enzymes have been inhibited by compounds that feature a 2\u2032-fluorine substitution for the 2\u2032-hydroxyl (2\u2032-OH) group (20\u201323). This strategy has also proved successful for inhibition of CD38 (12, 24, 25). The proposed mechanism of action for these inhibitor compounds is the formation of a reaction intermediate that is resistant to normal hydrolytic breakdown. The intermediate is probably resistant to nucleophilic displacement on the enzyme because of the inductive effect of the fluorine atom (12, 20\u201323).","The proposed mechanism is supported by increased stability of fluorinated sugars, as compared with their non-fluorinated ribosyl substrates, in acid-catalyzed hydrolysis reactions (26). Nevertheless, the rates for decomposition of fluoro-substituted covalent intermediates are lower than would be predicted from their relative stabilities, as compared with those of normal substrates, based on rate comparisons for these same reactants in solution hydrolysis reactions (26). This comparison suggests that substrate reactivity on the enzyme is uniquely accelerated by the presence of the 2\u2032-OH group in the molecule. One physical explanation for this effect suggests that the 2\u2032-OH plays an integral role in the mediation of proton transfer to the carboxylate nucleophile identified as the intermediate's point of attachment to the enzyme (12). This protonation could assist carboxylate departure at the transition state, and lower transition state energy.","The inventors tested their hypothesis by synthesizing nicotinamide 2\u2032-deoxyribosides (\u03b2NdR). These derivatives are intrinsically more reactive in solution hydrolysis reactions than are their ribose cousins. Chemical instability toward hydrolysis implies that the derivatives should react at least as fast as substrate, if chemical stability dominates at the enzyme-catalyzed transition state, but should be effective inhibitors of CD38, if the removal of a 2\u2032-OH group disrupts an essential proton transfer from the 2\u2032-hydroxyl moiety.","Synthesis of \u03b2NdR and derivatives is unprecedented from available literature. The inventors' synthetic investigations eventually led to the development of a versatile silver coupling methodology which allowed direct access to either \u03b1 or \u03b2 nucleosides in high yield (18). This method provided good yields to permit the synthesis of a variety of pyridyl-substituted deoxy derivatives. The general synthetic routes are shown in  and .","A. Inhibition of CD38 by \u03b2NdR","Treatment of CD38 with \u03b2-1\u2032-nicotinamide-2\u2032-deoxyribose (\u03b2NdR) confirmed that the compound rapidly inhibits the enzymatic activity of CD38. Assay of enzymatic activity 10 min after treatment of the enzyme (500 nM) with excess inhibitor (10 \u03bcM) showed residual enzymatic activity to be less than 5% of the control. The inactivation rate of CD38 at an inhibitor concentration of 2 \u03bcM showed that inactivation follows a pseudo-first-order rate process (), with a bimolecular rate constant (k) of 1100 Msecat 25\u00b0 C. This rate constant was confirmed by the use of radiolabeled inhibitor, [2\u2032-H]\u03b2NdR. The binding of this inhibitor to CD38 was determined by scintillation counting after rapid gel filtration was used to separate free inhibitor from its protein complex. This method allowed measurement of kby an exponential fit of accumulated cpm bound versus time (). The value for kdetermined by this method was 1540 Msec.","B. Kinetic Constants for CD38 Inhibition by \u03b2NdR","The mechanism of inhibition of \u03b2NdR was suspected to be covalent inactivation of CD38, based upon the proposition that CD38 forms a covalent intermediate in the reaction with the substrate NAD () (12). The kinetic features of this inhibition are similar to those for slow-binding inhibitors, where the initial binding of inhibitor is characterized by a Kvalue and a subsequent chemical conversion process governed by a rate constant (k) analogous to the slow-binding step (19). This mechanism of inhibition was tested by treatment of CD38 with different concentrations of inhibitor in the presence of 50 Kof substrate to establish values for Kand k. In the presence of 100 \u03bcM NGD, reaction mixtures containing 0 to 50 \u03bcM \u03b2NdR were initiated by addition of enzyme (). The initial slopes in  were used to determine a Kvalue of 1 \u03bcM\u2014the inherent binding affinity of the enzyme for \u03b2NdR. The rate curves in  are consistent with competitive inhibition during initial rate measurements, but show increasing inhibition over time. This second phase, showing increased inhibition, reflects conversion of the initial bound inhibitor to a more stable form, proposed to be the chemical reaction of the inhibitor to form an enzyme covalent complex. The fits of these curves determine a rate constant for chemical reaction: a kof 0.0126 sand a t for inactivation of 55 sec ().","C. Reversibility of \u03b2NdR Inhibition","Recovery of CD38 catalytic activity after inhibition by \u03b2NdR was measured by adding inactivated CD38 to solutions of NGD, and monitoring absorbance change at 295 nm for periods of 3\u20134 h. The recovery process was slow: full catalytic activity was not restored over this time period. However, the measured rate constant for recovery could be measured by regressive fit of the data to the activity recovery equation, A(t)=vt+(b\u2212v)(1\u2212exp(\u2212kt))\/k+A, where kis the observed rate constant, b is the initial rate, v is the final rate, and Ais the initial absorbance. These data produced a kvalue of 5\u00d710sec, to give a t for recovery of 38 h. The proposed mechanism of recovery operates through the hydrolytic path ().","D. Product-Assisted Rescue of Inactivated CD38","Chemical inactivation of CD38 by \u03b2NdR can be rapidly reversed by exposure of the inhibited enzyme to millimolar concentrations of nicotinamide. Inhibited enzyme that was treated with 20 mM nicotinamide for 5 min, then diluted into NGD and assayed, exhibited complete recovery of catalytic activity, as compared with a control. The mechanism of recovery is shown in . A nicotinamide base-exchange reaction is catalyzed by CD38, with its normal substrates, in the presence of millimolar concentrations of base. Thus, covalent inactivation can be reversed by nicotinamide reaction with the covalent complex, through the normal exchange pathway. This result is diagnostic for a covalent intermediate, as is the mechanism of inhibition of CD38 by \u03b2NdR.","E. Inhibition Efficiency for \u03b2NdR","Kinetic parameters for \u03b2NdR inhibition, inactivation, and recovery provide a complete rate profile for the inhibition-recovery process (Table 2). The values of k, K, k, and kcan be used to assess the value of K, as defined by either Kk\/k=Kor k\/k=K. Table 2 shows that Kvalues agree reasonably well, regardless of approach taken. The value derived from the former method of calculating Kis 0.4 nM, whereas the Kvalues calculated by the latter method are 3.2 and 5.0 nM.

Mechanistic Interpretation","Evaluation of the inhibitor at substrate concentrations that approximate 50\u00d7Kshows that the inhibitor is efficiently recognized by CD38 with a Kvalue of 1.0 \u03bcM (, inset). This Kvalue is surprising, given that the Kvalue for the NGD substrate is 2 \u03bcM. The subsequent onset of more potent inhibition over time is consistent with the subsequent chemical inactivation of the enzyme (). The covalent nature of this second phase of inhibition (analogous to slow-binding) is demonstrated through the ability to rescue CD38 from inhibition by adding millimolar concentrations of nicotinamide (). The covalent inactivation process is governed by an intrinsic rate constant, k=0.0126 sec().","In the absence of nicotinamide, the inhibition of CD38 by \u03b2NdR is limited by a slow recovery of enzymatic activity that is governed by the rate constant for hydrolysis, k=5\u00d710sec(). This number can be compared directly with the kfor NMN hydrolysis, since hydrolysis of the covalent intermediate was measured to be 512 secat 37\u00b0 C. (11). The rate of CD38-deoxyribose hydrolysis is 10that of CD38 ribose 5-phosphate, implicating the 2\u2032-OH as a proton transfer agent. Substrates for the first step of the reaction, which lack the hydroxyl (OH) group, generate relatively stable intermediates; thus, they provide potent inhibition of the CD38 enzyme. The presence of an electronegative atom is neither necessary nor essential to the development of effective inhibitors for CD38. The synthesis of a new generation of mechanism-based inhibitors for ADP-ribosyl transferases is possible, based on the above-described mechanism of catalysis.","G. Inhibition of CD38 by 1\u2032-pyridyl-deoxy-ribose and 5\u2032-phospho-1\u2032-pyridyl-deoxyribose","The ability of CD38 to tolerate changes in the NAD structure, specifically at the site of the nicotinamide ring, has been previously investigated (27). This work showed that there is a strong correlation between log kand the pKvalue of the corresponding pyridyl leaving group, with a heightened \u201cabove-the-line\u201d value of log kfor nicotinamide, reflecting optimization of the enzyme for the natural substrate. The design of inhibitors, then, should be flexible, based upon these observations. Synthesis of pyridyl deoxyribose derivatives was accomplished to prove that inhibition of CD38 can be achieved by changing the leaving-group structure.","Incubation of CD38 with 50 \u03bcM to 50 mM concentrations of pyridyl-deoxyribose in the presence of 5 \u03bcM (3 K) NGD gave a Kvalue for CD38 inhibition by pyridyl-deoxyribose of 11 mM. The low affinity of this structure versus that of the nicotinamide derivative (1 \u03bcM) no doubt reflects the loss of hydrogen bonding as a consequence of the omission of the amide group as a pyridine-ring substituent. Onset of covalent inactivation is also very much slower than the \u03b2NdR rate of onset. At saturating concentrations (25 mM) in the absence of NGD, \u03b2-pyridyl-deoxyribose covalently inactivated CD38 at a rate of 1.7\u00d710s, equivalent to the value of k. Achievement of only 60\u201380% inhibition was obtained due to long onset times and inhibitor decomposition. However, the extent of inhibition was confirmed by gel-filtration using radiolabeled [2\u2032-3H]\u03b2-pyridyl-deoxyribose, where the extent of inhibition determined by activity assay correlated to the quantity of radiolabeled enzyme eluting from the column (see Experimental Details). The calculated value for K(kK\/k)=323 \u03bcM, which was 10times larger than the value of Kfor \u03b2NdR (2 nM). The considerably greater inhibition value reflects lowered binding affinity and the lower rate of chemical inactivation. The diminished value of kversus that for \u03b2NdR (1.7\u00d710sversus 1.3\u00d710s) almost completely reflects the predicted loss of rate based upon the pKdifferences of the leaving groups: (pK\u2212pK=1.5 versus log k\/log k=1.86).","Similar studies were performed for the inhibition of CD38 by the 5\u2032-phospho-1\u2032-pyridyl-deoxyribose derivative. The determined value for K>200 \u03bcM reflects a relatively weak intrinsic binding affinity of the structure for the enzyme. This valuation underscores the significance to binding affinity of the amide structure of the pyridyl ring of nicotinamide, which cannot be overcome by addition of the 5\u2032phosphoryl moiety. This fact is indicated by a comparison to the Kvalue for \u03b2NdR (1 \u03bcM). Extended incubations of CD38 with 200 \u03bcM 5\u2032-phospho-1\u2032-pyridyl-deoxyribose inhibited the enzyme. Plots of activity versus time determined a minimum value for kof 2.2\u00d710s. Use of [2\u2032-H]5\u2032-phospho-1\u2032-pyridyl-deoxy-ribose as inhibitor confirmed covalent attachment of the sugar moiety to the enzyme by the gel-filtration approach (see Experimental Details).","4. Conclusion","Mechanism-based inhibitors are specific and efficient when they undergo rapid conversion to an enzymatic covalent intermediate that is slow in achieving subsequent steps. An understanding of this strategy has led to the development of novel inhibitors of CD38. Enzymes that share catalytic site homology with CD38, such as human bone stromal cell antigen (humBST1), are also expected to be targets for these agents. The use of 1-substituted-2-deoxyribose is a new development that is based on the detailed mechanism of CD38 and related enzymes. The deoxy analogues support a mechanism in which removal of the 2\u2032-OH moiety leads to potent inhibition, without a requirement for an electronegative atom at the 2\u2032-position. Hurdles toward the synthesis of these molecules have been overcome by the development of a new and flexible synthetic methodology. Efficient synthesis of various pyridyl-substituted nucleosides in high yield and high stereoselectivity is now possible. The enzymes that can be inhibited by deoxy pyridyl compounds are CD38, the human ADP-ribosyl cyclase, invertebrate and plant ADP-ribosyl cyclases, and possibly several other ADP-ribosyl transferases involved in the regulation of gene expression (e.g., SIR family enzymes and their homologues).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.
