Both web clients and web widgets allow Internet\/Intranet users to communicate with mobile users using phone calls, advanced voice services, messaging, data exchange, etc.","Preferably, the present invention includes a number of key features and functionality, including:\n\n","These and other aspects of the present invention are described in more detail below.","1.3. Wireless Communications Network Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0112"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100"]},"Within the network , an RTX , also known as a Dispatch Gateway (DG), communicates with a MSC (Mobile Switching Center)  and PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network)  using SS7-ISUP\/WIN\/CAMEL (Signaling System 7-Integrated Services Digital Network User Part\/Wireless Intelligent Network\/Customized Applications for Mobile Enhanced Logic) messages at a signaling plane . A bearer path  implements a TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) interface carrying PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) or TFO (Tandem Free Operation) voice frames. Support for TFO in this path  is negotiated between a BSC (Base Station Controller)  and the RTX  for each originating and terminating leg of a call. The use of TFO ensures high voice quality (as voice vocoder conversion is avoided) between mobile-to-mobile calls.","When a subscriber originates a call, the MSC  routes the call to the RTX . The MSC  also requests the BSC  via  to establish a radio traffic path  with a mobile station (MS)  (also known as a handset, mobile unit, mobile phone, or cellular phone) via the BTS (Base Transceiver Station)  (as it does for a normal cellular call). At this time, the BSC  tries to negotiate TFO (if it is supported) on a TDM link with the far end (in this case, the RTX ).","At the same time (after the MSC  terminates the call request to the RTX ), the RTX  identifies the terminating group users and their numbers, which may comprise an MS-ISDN (Mobile Station-Integrated Services Digital Network) number, an IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) number, or an MDN (Mobile Directory Number).","The RTX  sends an ISUP call origination request for each terminating handset . It may send requests directly to the MSC , PSTN  or IP network  via a PDSN (Public Data Switched Network) , Router , and\/or Internet\/Intranet , depending on the routing table configuration for terminating numbers. Once the bearer path  is established, the RTX  begins a negotiation with the far end (in this case, the terminating BSC ) for each terminating leg to a handset .","Once bearer paths  are established for originating and terminating legs for a call, the RTX  switches (or duplicates) voice or data from the originating handset  to all terminating handsets .","The RTX  may also use an IP network  or the Internet\/Intranet . The IP network  or the Internet\/Intranet  can be used in a toll bypass mode where two RTXs  can exchange voice traffic bypassing the PSTN . However, each RTX  is responsible for terminating traffic to its closest MSC . In this case, the IP network  or the Internet\/Intranet  is used as a backbone transport of voice traffic between two RTXs .","The IP network  or the Internet\/Intranet  can also be used for a registration and presence application. Since the MSC  will not direct a registration request from a handset  to the RTX  (because it would require changes in the MSC ), the latter does not have any information of the registered handset . To circumvent this issue, a registration and presence application runs over an IP stack in the handset . After the handset  registers for a data interface (i.e., obtaining an IP address) with the PDSN  (or Serving GSM Service Nodes (SGSN)  in the case of GSM networks and Gateway GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) Support Node (GGSN)  in the case of GSM phones for transmitting IP packets), the registration and presence application in the handset  registers with the RTX  using its IP address. The RTX  also uses this IP interface to update the presence information to a handset .","An alternative embodiment may use the SMS (Short Message Service) transport to carry presence messages over a data channel. The RTX  interacts with the handset  using predefined presence application related messages that are transported as SMS messages. The same messages can be transported via the PDSN  interface, if users have data service.","During roaming, a Home Location Register (HLR)  and Visitor Location Register (VLR)  can be accessed via the MSC  and a MAP (Mobile Application Part) link . The HLR  and VLR  are used to track the handsets  within home or foreign networks, while the RTX  is used to track the presence of members of a group within the home or foreign networks and updates the handsets  for those members with the network availability of other members of the group.","A Short Message Service Center (SMSC)  is accessible via the IP network  (or other element) for the storage of text messages (SMS messages). When an SMS message is sent to a handset , the message is first stored in the SMSC  until the recipient handset  is available (e.g., a store-and-forward option).","1.4. Real Time Exchange",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0124"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"102"},"The architecture includes a Call Processing system , Presence Server , Real-Time Event Processing system , one or more Media Managers , and an SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) Transport , as well as modules for various SS7 protocols, such as MTP-1 (Message Transfer Part Level 1) , MTP-2 (Message Transfer Part Level 2) , MTP-3 (Message Transfer Part Level 3) , ISUP (Integrated Services Digital Network User Part) , SCCP (Signaling Connection Control Part) , and TCAP (Transactions Capabilities Application Part)  protocols.","The Call Processing system , Presence Server , Media Managers , SMPP Transport , and other modules communicate across an IP network . The Real-Time Event Processing system  communicates directly with the Call Processing system , Presence Server , and the modules for various SS7 protocols. The modules for various SS7 protocols communicate with other entities via a SS7 Signaling Link . The SMPP Transport  communicates with a SMSC (Short Message Service Center) gateway using the SMPP protocol . The Media Managers  communicate among themselves using the H.110 protocol  (or some other protocol, such TCP\/IP).","The originating handset  signals the RTX  via the wireless network , e.g., by transmitting one or more configured DTMF (Dual Tone Multi Frequency) digits to the RTX . The Media Manager systems  receive the DTMF digits and pass the DTMF digits to the Call Processing system . The Call Processing (CP) system  determines whether the originating handset  has subscribed to the AVS, AGS or AGC service before originating the call. Upon confirmation, the Call Processing system  initiates a new call. The Call Processing system  interacts with the Presence Server  and Real-Time Event Processing system  to cause the wireless network  to perform call setup with the terminating handsets  for the call, and thereafter to manage the call.","During the call, the Call Processing system  interacts with the Media Manager systems  to maintain the H.110 channels  and assign any additional H.110 channels  required for the call, which may span across multiple Media Manager systems . During the call, the Media Manager systems  of the RTX  are used to mix audio streams between the originating handset  and the terminating handset , and then deliver these mixed audio streams to the originating handset  and the terminating handset . The H.110 channels  are used for passing mixed and unmixed audio streams voice between the Media Manager systems  as required.","In addition, the RTX  may include an MMS Relay , Notification Server , Registrar\/SIP Proxy , Media Proxy , Media Converter , Content Server , Web Server  and Location Server . The operation of these various components are described in more detail below, as well as in the co-pending and commonly-assigned patent applications cross-referenced above and incorporated by reference herein.","1.5. Handset Components",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0106","num":"0131"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["120","120"]},"Preferably, the software architecture used in the handset  provides an application programming interface (API) that supports the logic and data required within the handset  for providing cellular service, including the functions necessary for the making a call generally, and for providing the AVS, AGS or AGC services specifically.","The high-level functional components of the handset  include an encoder\/decoder , processing logic  and user interface . A client application  is provided on a subscriber identity module (SIM)  that supports AVS, AGS or AGC functionality for the handset . In addition, the SIM  stores a database , which includes an address book, contacts and\/or group information.","At power-on, the handset  loads the client application  necessary to support the AVS, AGC or AGC services. This functionality provided includes the \u201clook and feel\u201d of the menu displays on the handset , as well as user interaction with the menu displays.","During operation, the encoder\/decoder  decodes and encodes messages, and populates specific data structures in the handset . The encoder\/decoder  checks the validity of the incoming messages by verifying mandatory parameters for each of the incoming messages. A message will not be processed further if the encoder\/decoder  fails to decode the message.","The processing logic  handles normal calls, as well as all the AVS, AGS or AGC related functionalities. The processing logic  implementation is device-specific and vendor-specific, and it interacts with the other components, including the encoder\/decoder , user interface , client application  and database .","The processing logic  provides an auto-answer mechanism for calls. Specifically, when a call is received, the processing logic  automatically answers the call. The processing logic  makes use of call notification for incoming call detection and, based on various parameters received within the call notification, determines whether the call is a normal call or an AVS, AGS or AGC call. The processing logic  performs the necessary processing based on this determination.","In addition, the processing logic  provides SMS destination control based on the type of subscriber. At the time of subscriber data provisioning, if it is determined that the handset  will use AVS, AGS or AGC based logic, then appropriate logic is invoked in the RTX  to send presence messages over SMS to the handset . Similarly, the handset  is configured at the time of provisioning to receive\/accept such SMS and respond to the RTX  appropriately.","Finally, the processing logic  also enables subscribers to track the presence of contacts and members of a group on their handset , and provides a mechanism and API to carry-out contacts and group management operations on the handset , such as add member, delete member, etc.","Since most of the presence information is stored in the database , the database  is tightly integrated with the processing logic . The database  stores groups, contacts, presence and availability related information. The database  information essentially contains group and member information along with presence information associated with each group and member. Apart from group and member information, the database  also stores subscriber information, such as privileges, presence information, etc. The other components of the handset  may interact with the database  to retrieve\/update the group, members and presence information for various operations. The database  also has pointers to the native address book on the handset , to provide seamless \u201calias\u201d naming for contacts used with normal calls, as well as AVS, AGS or AGC services.","The user interface  provides a mechanism for the user to view and manage groups, group members, contacts, presence and availability. The user interface  also makes it possible to invoke the AVS, AGS or AGC services from the group\/contact list screens, as described in more detail below.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, the functionality of the converged mobile-Web communications solution includes the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0143"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Contacts","Back-up of contacts online."]},{"entry":[{},"Never have to worry about losing contacts if handset is "]},{"entry":[{},"lost."]},{"entry":[{},"No need to transfer contacts from one handset to "]},{"entry":[{},"another."]},{"entry":["Text ","Type from the convenience of a handset, web browser, "]},{"entry":["Messaging","web client, web widgets, etc., and send a single message "]},{"entry":[{},"to a group all at once."]},{"entry":[{},"Messages are all threaded."]},{"entry":["Voice","Add a personal touch to a message using voice."]},{"entry":["Messaging","Send it to recipients' handsets, IM accounts, and\/or e-"]},{"entry":[{},"mail addresses as an attachment."]},{"entry":["Multimedia ","Easily attach multimedia content to a message."]},{"entry":["File","Send it to any mobile subscribers with or without a "]},{"entry":["Attachments","computer."]},{"entry":["Group Voice","Flexibility of making an easy group voice call from a "]},{"entry":["Calls","computer (with a microphone)."]},{"entry":[{},"No need to pay expensive international voice call rates "]},{"entry":[{},"while traveling overseas."]},{"entry":["Message ","No more worry about having to delete old messages on "]},{"entry":["Retrieval","the handset."]},{"entry":[{},"All text and voice messages are saved online and can be"]},{"entry":[{},"archived\/searched."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The components that work together to provide the functionality of the converged mobile-Web communications solution according to one embodiment of the present invention are described in more detail in the following sections.","2.1.

The RTX  interfaces to at least one MSC  in the network  to provide the AVS, AGS or AGC services therein, without requiring any changes to the MSC  or other equipment of the network  to provide the AVS, AGS or AGC services. Both the RTX  and the handsets  that use the AVS, AGS or AGC services communicate with each other using the call setup and in-band signaling within the network , such that at least one MSC  routes an originating leg of the AVS, AGS or AGC services from an originating handset  to the RTX , the RTX  exchange initiates one or more terminating legs of the AVS, AGS or AGC services to one or more terminating handsets  through at least one MSC , and the RTX  switches the voice frames for the AVS, AGS or AGC services for the handsets  across the bearer paths and through at least one MSC  in the network .","In one embodiment, the RTX  also interfaces to one or more Intranet or Internet networks, such as  or , for exchanging data between at least one of the handsets  and at least one user on the Intranet or Internet network  or , in order to provide the AVS, AGS or AGC services (and other services) to the user on the Intranet or Internet network  or .

The other components of the network  together comprise the means, that interface to the network  and the network  or , for providing a converged mobile-Web communications solution to both the handsets  and the Web Client  or Web Widget , wherein the converged mobile-Web communications solution comprises one or more of the following services:\n\n","2.2. Web Client and Web Widgets","A Web Client  may execute within a browser, for example, as a plug-in downloaded from a Web site, or may comprise standalone programs, while a Web Widget  may comprise a program or plug-in that is embedded in a Web page.","The Web Client  preferably contains two components:\n\n","Alternatively, Web Widgets  may be used to perform the same functions as the Web Client . A Web Widget  is an applet (program) that can be installed within any Web page and then executed by a Web browser when the Web page is accessed. Web Widgets  may be implemented using DHTML, JavaScript, Adobe Flash, or other programming languages.","2.3. Packet Data Gateway","The Packet Data Gateway (PDG)  is a network  component, wherein the Web Client \/Web Widgets  establishes a secure IPSec tunnel with the PDG . All SIP communication from the Web Client \/Web Widgets , and optionally the HTTP traffic, will be routed through the secure IPSec tunnel with the PDG , to the Web Server  and the Registrar\/SIP Proxy .","2.4. Registrar\/SIP Proxy and Media Proxy","All call related features on Web Client \/Web Widget  use the SIP protocol for session establishment and call control. The Registrar\/SIP Proxy , also known generically as an Access Gateway (AGW), acts as a gateway and routes calls between the Web Client \/Web Widget  and the RTX . It also acts as a SIP Registrar  that not only authenticates the subscribers before providing access to the RTX , but also stores the location and routing information needed for terminating incoming calls on the Web Client \/Web Widget .","The Registrar\/SIP Proxy  controls the path for all SIP signaling between the Web Client \/Web Widget  and the RTX . The main function of the Registrar\/SIP Proxy  is to authenticate SIP messages. The SIP authentication is performed using the session ID established at the Web Server  by the Web Client \/Web Widget . The Registrar\/SIP Proxy  also acts as a SIP registrar. The Registrar\/SIP Proxy  preferably comprises a set of redundant proxy servers\/registrars.","A Web Client \/Web Widget  receives a SIP configuration from the Web Server . This configuration contains details of the Registrar\/SIP Proxy  to be contacted.","Associated with the Registrar\/SIP Proxy  is a Media Proxy . Similar to the way the Registrar\/SIP Proxy  acts as a gateway for call signaling, the Media Proxy  function acts as a gateway for media packets sent between the Web Client \/Web Widget  on one side and a Content Server  in the RTX  on the other side.","2.5. Web Server","The Web Server  presents the user interface pages to the Web Client \/Web Widget . It also provides the user with a SIP plug-in for installation. The Web Server  interfaces with the Content Server  to provide views of the user's address book and message inbox. However, the Web Server  does not store any user data permanently. All user data served by the Web Server  is obtained from the Content Server .","The Web Server  is also responsible for authenticating the user with the network. After it establishes an HTTP session with the Web Client \/Web Widget , the Web Server  shares the session ID with the Registrar\/SIP Proxy  for authenticating SIP requests.","Multiple Web Servers  may be deployed to support high availability and redundancy.","A Web Server  may also be deployed in the public internet by the carrier (i.e., the Web Server  does not communication with the Web Client \/Web Widget  through the Registrar\/SIP Proxy ). This Web Server  will also serve the SIP plug-in and user interface pages to the Web Client \/Web Widget .","2.6. Presence Server","The Presence Server  handles SIP subscriptions and publications from the Web Client \/Web Widget . The main function of the Presence Server  is to off-load presence related messaging and dialog maintenance overheads from the RTX . The RTX  maintains the presence state of the user. The Presence Server  creates presence documents using the information stored on the RTX . The Presence Server  also updates the presence state on the RTX  when it receives presence publications from the Web Client \/Web Widget .","2.7. Location Server","The Location Server  stores information about a user's home RTX , Presence Server , and Content Server . The Location Server  is also used to store the session details for Web Clients \/Web Widgets . The Registrar\/SIP Proxy  uses this information to authenticate SIP messages using the session ID. The session ID is created by the Web Server  and is only read by the Registrar\/SIP Proxy . The Registrar\/SIP Proxy  cannot extend the life of the session ID directly. The SIP plug-in in the Web Client \/Web Widgets  will trigger \u201ckeep-alive\u201d HTTP requests when calls are in progress to prevent HTTP session timeout. The session ID will be removed from the Location Server  by the Web Server  in case of a session timeout.","2.8. RTX","The RTX  has a SIP adaptor that is capable of receiving and originating SIP calls to the Web Client \/Web Widget . The SIP adaptor is integrated with the Call Processing  component, which can handle calls with simultaneous SIP and SS7 legs. The SIP adaptor is also capable of injecting SMS signals into the RTX , which is used for features such as Voice SMS (VSMS) deposit.","2.9. SyncML Server","The SyncML (Synchronization Markup Language) Server  handles SyncML connections from the handset  to synchronize the address book and other data between the handset  and the Content Server .","2.10. Content Server","The Content Server  archives all messages belonging to a user. It also holds a view of the user's address book and the messages stored on the handset . The Content Server  may be a distributed data store. It will interface with the SyncML Server  to maintain synchronization with the data from the handset .","The RTX  copies all AGC communication sent to users with their Content Server . The Web Server  will fetch data to be displayed by the Web Client \/Web Widget  from the Content Server .","2.11. Notification Server","The Notification Server  allows other web services and network components to send notifications to the Web Client \/Web Widget  whenever data changes on the Content Server . The Web Client \/Web Widget  will then pull the data from the Content Server  through the Web Server  using other web services.","2.12. MMS Relay","The MMS Relay  provides access to the operator's MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) by acting as a gateway between the different types of clients (Handset , Web Client , Web Widget ) and the MMSC (Multimedia Messaging Service Center).","2.13. Media Converter","The Media Converter  provides a media library and multimedia messaging features, and is used for storing the media files. These media files can be any number of different formats, such as JPG, PNG, GIF, etc., for pictures; MP3, WAV, AMR, etc. for audio; and MPG, AVI, 3PG, etc., for video. Since not all formats are supported by all the mobile handsets , and also for enabling streaming of audio and video files to the Web Client \/Web Widget , the media files may need to be converted into formats different from the original format of the uploaded files. The Media Converter  provides this function within the network.","The Web Client \/Web Widget  expects the following configuration from the Web Server  after authentication:","1. Access numbers for the various services.","2. DTMF patterns for call transfer.","3. Configured numbers for call transfer (mobile and landline numbers).","4. Registrar\/SIP Proxy  details.","The following sections describe the following message flows:","1. Web Server  registration and SIP registration.","2.

The Web Server  verifies the received authentication credentials and, if successful, stores the session id and the time stamp for the session id in a subscriber information table in the Location Server .","6. The Web Server  then checks for the Registrar\/SIP Proxy  information for the user on the Location Server . If Registrar\/SIP Proxy  information is not available, then the Web Server  selects an Registrar\/SIP Proxy  to communicate with the Web Client  and stores the information in the Location Server .","7. The Web Server  creates and sends a customized web page for that user. As part of the response, the Web Client  also receives other configuration information such as the identity of the Registrar\/SIP Proxy , access numbers for various features, etc.","8. The Web Client  initiates SIP registration.","9. The Registrar\/SIP Proxy  challenges the Web Client  for authentication.","10.

For VSMS, only the notifications are downloaded; the audio data is downloaded and played when the user opens the message to listen to the message.","2. The Web Server  retrieves the requested data from the Content Server  and includes them in the message body of an HTTP 200 Ok response.","3. User A adds a contact on the handset . The handset  sends a SyncML request to the SyncML Server  with the added data.","4. The SyncML Server  interacts with the Content Server  to retrieve and add the new data, and then stores the modified data back into the Content Server .","5. The SyncML Server  sends the modified data back to the handset  in the response message.","6. The Content Server  detects the change in user A's data and triggers the Presence Server  to send a SIP NOTIFY message to the Web Client .","7. The Presence Server  sends a SIP NOTIFY message to the Web Client  through A's Registrar\/SIP Proxy . The SIP NOTIFY is sent within the SUBSCRIBE dialog created earlier by the Web Client  for presence and data change.","8. The Web Client  receives the SIP NOTIFY request and sends back a SIP 200 Ok response to the Presence Server  through the Registrar\/SIP Proxy .","9. The Web Client  then sends a HTTP request to the Web Server  to retrieve the changed data.","10. The Web Server  retrieves the changed data from the Content Server  and returns them in the HTTP 200 Ok response.","11. User A deletes a notification message from the Web Client . This notification happens to be marked as visible on the handset . The Web Client  creates and sends a HTTP request to the Web Server  to delete the notification.","12. The Web Server  accesses the Content Server  and marks the notification message for deletion. It then sends a HTTP 200 Ok response to the Web Client  to indicate successful deletion of the notification message.","13. The Content Server  detects the data marked for deletion, initiated by the Web Client . It checks whether the data to be deleted is marked as visible on the handset .","14. Since the data is marked as visible on the handset , the Content Server  triggers the SyncML Server  to update the handset .","15. The SyncML Server  sends a SyncML request to the handset  to update its data, specifying the deleted notification.","16. The handset  updates its data and sends a SyncML response back to the SyncML Server  to indicate successful completion of the request.","The foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description.
