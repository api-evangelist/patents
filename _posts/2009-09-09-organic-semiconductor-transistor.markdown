Therefore, the organic semiconductor layer is formed in a so-called wet process by using a solution in which the compound represented by Formula (I) is dissolved in the organic solvent. In the thus-prepared organic semiconductor layer, owing to the excellent solubility of the compound represented by Formula (I) in the organic solvent, failures such as cracks, crazes, or chips in film formation may be suppressed.

In addition to that, in the organic semiconductor layer that includes the compound represented by Formula (I) and is formed in a wet process, failures such as cracks, crazes, or chips are suppressed in the process of forming the layer, thereby suppressing defects or unevenness in electrical properties in the face of the layer.
