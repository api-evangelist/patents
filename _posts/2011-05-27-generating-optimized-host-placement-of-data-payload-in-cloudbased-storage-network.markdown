title: Generating optimized host placement of data payload in cloud-based storage network
abstract: Embodiments relate to systems and methods for generating optimized host placement of data payload in a cloud-based storage network. In aspects, a user can maintain a user premise network including servers, clients, local area networks, data stores, and/or other network assets. An administrator or other user of the premise network may wish to extract data from the premise network and transfer that data payload to a set of host storage clouds to leverage cost, redundancy, consolidation, or other cloud advantages. The placement tool can evaluate potential target cloud-based data stores based on various or multiple parameters for the hosting features offered by different cloud providers. The tool can generate a determination of the target host or hosts which can provide the best-matched or optimized data hosting facilities or services for the user's data payload in the cloud. The selected target(s) can be based on cost, capacity, security, compatibility, or other parameters or specifications, which can be user-specified or user-weighted.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates generally to systems and methods for generating an optimized host placement of a data payload in a cloud-based storage network, and more particularly, to platforms and techniques for assembling a data payload extracted from an on-premise network or other source in a data distribution service connected to a set of host storage clouds via high-bandwidth connections, and generate or identify one or more target clouds in that set representing the optimized or best-available hosting resource for that data payload based on a user's specified data hosting parameters.","The advent of cloud-based computing architectures has opened new possibilities for the rapid and scalable deployment of virtual Web stores, media outlets, social networking sites, and many other on-line sites or services. In general, a cloud-based architecture deploys a set of hosted resources such as processors, operating systems, software and other components that can be combined together to form virtual machines. A user or customer can request the instantiation of a virtual machine or set of machines from those resources from a central server or cloud management system to perform intended tasks, services, or applications. For example, a user may wish to set up and instantiate a virtual server from the cloud to create a storefront to market products or services on a temporary basis, for instance, to sell tickets to or merchandise for an upcoming sports or musical performance. The user can subscribe to the set of resources needed to build and run the set of instantiated virtual machines on a comparatively short-term basis, such as hours or days, for their intended application.","Typically, when a user utilizes a cloud, the user must track the software applications executed in the cloud and\/or processes instantiated in the cloud. For example, the user must track the cloud processes to ensure that the correct cloud processes have been instantiated, that the cloud processes are functioning properly and\/or efficiently, that the cloud is providing sufficient resources to the cloud processes, and so forth. Due in part to the user's requirements and overall usage of the cloud, the user may have many applications and\/or processes instantiated in a cloud at any given instant, and the user's deployment of virtual machines, software, and other resources can change dynamically over time. In cases, the user may also utilize multiple independent clouds to support the user's cloud deployment. That user may further instantiate and use multiple applications or other software or services inside or across multiple of those cloud boundaries, and those resources may be used or consumed by multiple or differing end-user groups in those different cloud networks.","In terms of data deployment and migration to the cloud, in cases, an administrator or other user may wish to consider transporting a set of data from a premise-based network into cloud-hosted storage, for instance to leverage the cost, consolidation, management tools, and\/or other features or advantages of the cloud. In an unmodified or unaided cloud storage platform, relatively large-scale storage resources may be available for users wishing to upload their data assets into the cloud, but without any special or enhanced set of connections into the host storage clouds. In the case of relatively large-scale premise data stores, such as those maintained, merely for instance, by hospitals, government agencies, financial institutions, or other entities, the amount of data that needs to be transported may be in the range of terabytes, petabytes, or more. In the case of those comparatively large-scale data installations, an attempt to migrate the data over public Internet connections, such as packet-switched TCP\/IP (transfer control protocol\/Internet protocol) or FTP (file transfer protocol) connections, the delivery of the data payload could require days or weeks of time. For many organizations, that type of transfer delay may be impractical or impossible. In addition, the relatively narrow-bandwidth connections available over the public Internet may not be secure, and for sensitive data or applications, the use of such connections may also not be a valid or practical option. Narrow-bandwidth connections into a host storage cloud may also not allow for data management services such as error correction, in-flight encryption, or other security or management options.","Moreover, in some cloud-based storage networks, after completion of the transport and mounting of the data payload of interest to an intermediate distribution service, there may be multiple potential target hosts to which the data payload may be moved and hosted. In aspects, without any additional decision logic or hosting or management tools, the user could be forced to manually review all available target storage clouds, and manually inspect or consider those potential hosting sites to determine which cloud or clouds may meet their criteria of interest, and ultimately select a cloud or clouds they wish to host their data payload.","It may be desirable to provide systems and methods for generating an optimized host placement of a data payload in a cloud-based storage network, in which the interrogation, matching, rating and selection of one or more host storage clouds can be conducted on an automatic or optimized basis, in which all available cloud storage options can be discovered and evaluated against a users set of selected storage criteria or parameters using placement tools and logic, to select or identify an optimized or best-available set of host storage clouds in which to place the users desired data payload.","Embodiments described herein can be implemented in or supported by a cloud network architecture. As used herein, a \u201ccloud\u201d can comprise a collection of hardware, software, services, and\/or resources that can be invoked to instantiate a virtual machine, process, or other resource for a limited or defined duration. As shown for example in , the collection of resources supporting a cloud  can at a hardware level comprise a set of resource servers  configured to deliver computing components needed to instantiate a virtual machine, process, service, or other resource. For example, one group of resource servers in set of resource servers  can host and serve an operating system, and\/or components, utilities, or interfaces related to that operating system, to deliver to a virtual target, and instantiate that machine with an image of that operating system. Another group of servers in set of resource servers  can accept requests to host computing cycles or processor time, memory allocations, communications ports or links, and\/or other resources to supply a defined level of processing power or throughput for a virtual machine. A further group of resource servers in set of resource servers  can host and serve applications or other software to load on an instantiation of a virtual machine, such as an email client, a browser application, a messaging application, or other applications, software, or services. Other types of resource servers can be used to support one or more clouds .","In embodiments, the entire set of resource servers  and\/or other hardware or software resources used to support one or more clouds , along with the set of instantiated virtual machines, can be managed by a cloud management system . The cloud management system  can comprise a dedicated or centralized server and\/or other software, hardware, services, and network tools that communicate via network , such as the Internet or other public or private network, with all servers in set of resource servers  to manage the cloud  and its operation. To instantiate a new or updated set of virtual machines, a user can transmit an instantiation request to the cloud management system  for the particular type of virtual machine they wish to invoke for their intended application. A user can for instance make a request to instantiate a set of virtual machines configured for email, messaging or other applications from the cloud . The virtual machines can be instantiated as virtual client machines, virtual appliance machines consisting of special-purpose or dedicated-task machines as understood in the art, and\/or as other virtual machines or entities. The request to invoke and instantiate the desired complement of virtual machines can be received and processed by the cloud management system , which identifies the type of virtual machine, process, or other resource being requested in that platform's associated cloud. The cloud management system  can then identify the collection of hardware, software, service, and\/or other resources necessary to instantiate that complement of virtual machines or other resources. In embodiments, the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources can, for example, and as noted, comprise virtual transaction servers used to support Web storefronts, Web pages, and\/or other transaction sites.","In embodiments, the user's instantiation request can specify a variety of parameters defining the operation of the set of virtual machines to be invoked. The instantiation request, for example, can specify a defined period of time for which the instantiated collection of machines, services, or processes is needed. The period of time can be, for example, an hour, a day, a month, or other interval of time. In embodiments, the user's instantiation request can specify the instantiation of a set of virtual machines or processes on a task basis, rather than for a predetermined amount or interval of time. For instance, a user could request a set of virtual provisioning servers and other resources until a target software update is completed on a population of corporate or other machines. The user's instantiation request can in further regards specify other parameters that define the configuration and operation of the set of virtual machines or other instantiated resources. For example, the request can specify a specific minimum or maximum amount of processing power or input\/output (I\/O) throughput that the user wishes to be available to each instance of the virtual machine or other resource. In embodiments, the requesting user can for instance specify a service level agreement (SLA) acceptable for their desired set of applications or services. Other parameters and settings can be used to instantiate and operate a set of virtual machines, software, and other resources in the host clouds. One skilled in the art will realize that the user's request can likewise include combinations of the foregoing exemplary parameters, and others. It may be noted that \u201cuser\u201d herein can include a network-level user or subscriber to cloud-based networks, such as a corporation, government entity, educational institution, and\/or other entity, including individual users and groups of users.","When the request to instantiate a set of virtual machines or other resources has been received and the necessary resources to build those machines or resources have been identified, the cloud management system  can communicate with one or more set of resource servers  to locate resources to supply the required components. Generally, the cloud management system  can select servers from the diverse set of resource servers  to assemble the various components needed to build the requested set of virtual machines, services, or other resources. It may be noted that in some embodiments, permanent storage, such as optical storage or hard disk arrays, may or may not be included or located within the set of resource servers  available to the cloud management system , since the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources may be intended to operate on a purely transient or temporary basis. In embodiments, other hardware, software or other resources not strictly located or hosted in one or more clouds  can be accessed and leveraged as needed. For example, other software or services that are provided outside of one or more clouds  acting as hosts, and are instead hosted by third parties outside the boundaries of those clouds, can be invoked by in-cloud virtual machines or users. For further example, other non-cloud hardware and\/or storage services can be utilized as an extension to the one or more clouds  acting as hosts or native clouds, for instance, on an on-demand, subscribed, or event-triggered basis.","With the resource requirements identified for building a network of virtual machines, the cloud management system  can extract and build the set of virtual machines or other resources on a dynamic, on-demand basis. For example, one set of resource servers  may respond to an instantiation request for a given quantity of processor cycles with an offer to deliver that computational power immediately and guaranteed for the next hour or day. A further set of resource servers  can offer to immediately supply communication bandwidth, for example on a guaranteed minimum or best-efforts basis, for instance over a defined window of time. In other embodiments, the set of virtual machines or other resources can be built on a batch basis, or at a particular future time. For example, a set of resource servers  may respond to a request for instantiation of virtual machines at a programmed time with an offer to deliver the specified quantity of processor cycles within a specific amount of time, such as the next 12 hours. Other timing and resource configurations are possible.","After interrogating and receiving resource commitments from the set of resource servers , the cloud management system  can select a group of servers in the set of resource servers  that match or best match the instantiation request for each component needed to build the user's requested virtual machine, service, or other resource. The cloud management system  for the one or more clouds  acting as the destination for the virtual machines can then coordinate the integration of the identified group of servers from the set of resource servers , to build and launch the requested set of virtual machines or other resources. The cloud management system  can track the identified group of servers selected from the set of resource servers , or other distributed resources that are dynamically or temporarily combined, to produce and manage the requested virtual machine population, services, or other cloud-based resources.","In embodiments, the cloud management system  can generate a resource aggregation table or other record that identifies the various selected sets of resource servers in set of resource servers  that will be used to supply the components of the set of instantiated virtual machines, services, or processes. The selected sets of resource servers can be identified by unique identifiers such as, for instance, Internet protocol (IP) addresses or other addresses. In aspects, different sets of servers in set of resource servers  can be selected to deliver different resources to different users and\/or for different applications. The cloud management system  can register the finalized group of servers in the set resource servers  contributing to or otherwise supporting the set of instantiated machines, services, or processes.","The cloud management system  can then set up and launch the initiation process to instantiate the virtual machines, processes, services, and\/or other resources to be hosted and delivered from the one or more clouds . The cloud management system  can for instance transmit an instantiation command or instruction to the registered group of servers in the set of resource servers . The cloud management system  can receive a confirmation message back from each registered server in set of resource servers  indicating a status or state regarding the provisioning of their respective resources. Various registered resource servers may confirm, for example, the availability of a dedicated amount of processor cycles, amounts of electronic memory, communications bandwidth, services, and\/or applications or other software prepared to be served and delivered.","As shown for example in , after coordination of the sources and configuration of resources including the hardware layer, selected software, and\/or other resources, the cloud management system  can then instantiate a set of virtual machines , and\/or other appliances, services, processes, and\/or entities, based on the resources supplied by servers within set of resource servers  registered to support the one or more clouds  in a multiple-cloud network . According to aspects, cloud management system  can access or interact with a virtualization module, platform, or service to instantiate and operate set of virtual machines , such as the kernel-based virtualization manager (KVM\u2122) available from Red Hat, Inc. of Raleigh, N.C., or others. In embodiments, the cloud management system  can instantiate a given number, for example, 10, 500, 1000, 20,000, or other numbers or instances of virtual machines to populate one or more clouds  and be made available to users of that cloud or clouds. In aspects, users may access the one or more clouds  via the Internet, or other public or private networks. Each virtual machine can be assigned an instantiated machine ID that can be stored in the resource aggregation table, or other record or image of the instantiated virtual machine population. Additionally, the cloud management system  can store data related to the duration of the existence or operation of each operating virtual machine, as well as the collection of resources utilized by the overall set of instantiated virtual machines .","In embodiments, the cloud management system  can further store, track and manage each user's identity and associated set of rights or entitlements to software, hardware, and other resources. Each user that operates a virtual machine or service in the set of virtual machines in the cloud can have specific rights and resources assigned and made available to them, with associated access rights and security provisions. The cloud management system  can track and configure specific actions that each user can perform, such as the ability to provision a set of virtual machines with software applications or other resources, configure a set of virtual machines to desired specifications, submit jobs to the set of virtual machines or other host, manage other users of the set of instantiated virtual machines  or other resources, and\/or other privileges, entitlements, or actions. The cloud management system  associated with the virtual machine(s) of each user can further generate records of the usage of instantiated virtual machines to permit tracking, billing, and auditing of the resources and services consumed by the user or set of users. In aspects of the present teachings, the tracking of usage activity for one or more user (including network level user and\/or end-user) can be abstracted from any one cloud to which that user is registered, and made available from an external or independent usage tracking service capable of tracking software and other usage across an arbitrary collection of clouds, as described herein. In embodiments, the cloud management system  of an associated cloud can for example meter the usage and\/or duration of the set of instantiated virtual machines , to generate subscription and\/or billing records for a user that has launched those machines. In aspects, tracking records can in addition or instead be generated by an internal service operating within a given cloud. Other subscription, billing, entitlement and\/or value arrangements are possible.","The cloud management system  can configure each virtual machine in set of instantiated virtual machines  to be made available to users via one or more networks , such as the Internet or other public or private networks. Those users can for instance access set of instantiated virtual machines via a browser interface, via an application server such as a Java\u2122 server, via an application programming interface (API), and\/or other interface or mechanism. Each instantiated virtual machine in set of instantiated virtual machines  can likewise communicate with its associated cloud management system  and the registered servers in set of resource servers  via a standard Web application programming interface (API), or via other calls, protocols, and\/or interfaces. The set of instantiated virtual machines  can likewise communicate with each other, as well as other sites, servers, locations, and resources available via the Internet or other public or private networks, whether within a given cloud in one or more clouds , or between those or other clouds.","It may be noted that while a browser interface or other front-end can be used to view and operate the set of instantiated virtual machines  from a client or terminal, the processing, memory, communications, storage, and other hardware as well as software resources required to be combined to build the virtual machines or other resources are all hosted remotely in the one or more clouds . In embodiments, the set of virtual machines  or other services, machines, or resources may not depend in any degree on or require the user's own on-premise hardware or other resources. In embodiments, a user can therefore request and instantiate a set of virtual machines or other resources on a purely off-premise basis, for instance to build and launch a virtual storefront, messaging site, and\/or any other application. Likewise, one or more clouds  can also be formed in whole or part from resources hosted or maintained by the users of those clouds, themselves.","Because the cloud management system  in one regard specifies, builds, operates and manages the set of instantiated virtual machines  on a logical or virtual level, the user can request and receive different sets of virtual machines and other resources on a real-time or near real-time basis, without a need to specify, install, or configure any particular hardware. The user's set of instantiated virtual machines , processes, services, and\/or other resources can in one regard therefore be scaled up or down immediately or virtually immediately on an on-demand basis, if desired. In embodiments, the set of resource servers  that are accessed by the cloud management system  to support the set of instantiated virtual machines  or processes can change or be substituted, over time. The type and operating characteristics of the set of instantiated virtual machines  can nevertheless remain constant or virtually constant, since instances are assembled from a collection of abstracted resources that can be selected and maintained from diverse sources based on uniform specifications. Conversely, the users of the set of instantiated virtual machines  can also change or update the resource or operational specifications of those machines at any time. The cloud management system  and\/or other logic can then adapt the allocated resources for that population of virtual machines or other entities, on a dynamic basis.","In terms of network management of the set of instantiate virtual machines  that have been successfully configured and instantiated, the one or more cloud management systems  associated with those machines can perform various network management tasks including security, maintenance, and metering for billing or subscription purposes. The cloud management system  of one or more clouds  can, for example, install, initiate, suspend, or terminate instances of applications or appliances on individual machines. The cloud management system  can similarly monitor one or more operating virtual machines to detect any virus or other rogue process on individual machines, and for instance terminate an application identified as infected, or a virtual machine detected to have entered a fault state. The cloud management system  can likewise manage the set of instantiated virtual machines  or other resources on a network-wide or other collective basis, for instance, to push the delivery a software upgrade to all active virtual machines or subsets of machines. Other network management processes can be carried out by cloud management system  and\/or other associated logic.","In embodiments, more than one set of virtual machines can be instantiated in a given cloud at the same time, at overlapping times, and\/or at successive times or intervals. The cloud management system  can, in such implementations, build, launch and manage multiple sets of virtual machines as part of the set of instantiated virtual machines  based on the same or different underlying set of resource servers , with populations of different virtual machines such as may be requested by the same or different users. The cloud management system  can institute and enforce security protocols in one or more clouds  hosting one or more sets of virtual machines. Each of the individual sets or subsets of virtual machines in the set of instantiated virtual machines  can be hosted in a respective partition or sub-cloud of the resources of the main cloud . The cloud management system  of one or more clouds  can for example deploy services specific to isolated or defined sub-clouds, or isolate individual workloads\/processes within the cloud to a specific sub-cloud or other sub-domain or partition of the one or more clouds  acting as host. The subdivision of one or more clouds  into distinct transient sub-clouds, sub-components, or other subsets which have assured security and isolation features can assist in establishing a multiple user or multi-tenant cloud arrangement. In a multiple-user scenario, each of the multiple users can use the cloud platform as a common utility while retaining the assurance that their information is secure from other users of the same one or more clouds . In further embodiments, sub-clouds can nevertheless be configured to share resources, if desired.","In embodiments, and as also shown in , the set of instantiated virtual machines  generated in a first cloud in one or more clouds  can also interact with a set of instantiated virtual machines, services, and\/or processes generated in a second, third or further cloud in one or more clouds , comprising a multiple-cloud network . The cloud management system  of a first cloud of one or more clouds  can interface with the cloud management system  of a second, third, or further cloud of one or more clouds  to coordinate those domains and operate the clouds and\/or virtual machines, services, and\/or processes on a combined basis. The cloud management system  of a given cloud on one or more clouds  can in aspects track and manage individual virtual machines or other resources instantiated in that cloud, as well as the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources in other clouds.","In the foregoing and other embodiments, the user making an instantiation request or otherwise accessing or utilizing the cloud network can be a person, customer, subscriber, administrator, corporation, organization, government, and\/or other entity. In embodiments, the user can be or include another virtual machine, application, service and\/or process. In further embodiments, multiple users or entities can share the use of a set of virtual machines or other resources.","In aspects, the cloud management system  and\/or other logic or service that manages, configures, and tracks cloud activity can be configured to interact with other sites, platforms, engines, servers, and\/or associated services that are configured to organize and manage the transport and delivery of existing data stores from on-premise databases or other sources, and stage that data to data storage resources at, near, co-hosted, or otherwise in geographic proximity to a set of host storage clouds in which that data payload will be placed and stored. In aspects, the cloud distribution data service (which may be referred to as \u201cCDD\u201d, \u201cCDD service,\u201d \u201cdata delivery service,\u201d or other references herein) can be located at the network edge to either or both of the premise data sources, and\/or the set of host storage clouds. In aspects, this staging or staggering of potentially large-scale or very large-scale data stores can permit the connection between the data source(s), intermediate or staged data stores, and\/or the host cloud data stores using dedicated and\/or high-bandwidth lines, channels, or connections to permit the efficient and timely porting of that data to a host storage cloud or clouds of the user's choice. In aspects, the data payload or portions thereof can be located, extracted and transmitted as an image or copy of the subject data, with the original cloud-hosted being preserved in the set of host storage clouds. In aspects, the data payload and\/or portions thereof can be located, extracted, and transmitted without leaving the original data stored in the set of host storage clouds, such as by deleting that data upon reading-out, or using other techniques.","In those regards,  illustrates a network implementation in which, in various cases, an administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user of a premise network  may wish to consider identifying, collecting, and migrating or transporting their databases, data files, and\/or other data assets to a set of host storage clouds . In aspects and merely illustratively, the premise network  can contain or include on-premise, bare-metal, and\/or other virtual or physical assets including a set of premise servers , a set of premise clients , one or more local area networks (LANs)  such as an Ethernet\u2122 or Wifi\u2122 network, a virtual private network (VPN), and\/or other networks or connection topologies. The premise network  can include or interface to one or more networks , such as the public Internet and\/or other public or private networks.","The premise network  can likewise include a set of premise data stores , such as one or more databases, data stores, servers, redundant arrays of inexpensive disks (RAID) installations, optical or solid-state storage or devices, and\/or other data storage repositories, resources, or assets. In aspects, the set of premise data stores  can store different types of data, including, for example, technical, medical, financial, scientific, and\/or other data. The data hosted or stored in the set of premise data stores  can comprise significantly or substantially large-scale data, for example data or files comprising terabytes or other amounts of data. For instance, the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user of a corporation, hospital, educational institution, government body, and\/or other entity may collect and maintain a set of data in a set of premise data stores  such as local databases, data centers, database files and\/or engines, repositories, and\/or other data assets, services, and\/or other storage sites of resources. In cases, the set of premise data stores  can host and store a significant or substantial amount of data, such as terabytes, petabytes, exabytes, yottabytes, and\/or other amounts of data. In aspects, the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user responsible for hosting and\/or maintaining that data in the set of premise data stores  may, for various reasons, wish to migrate some or all of that constituent data to one or more local cloud data stores  in the set of host storage clouds , such as to leverage cost, maintenance, capacity, security, and\/or other advantages or factors available in the set of host storage clouds .","In aspects, it can be the case that if the owner, administrator, and\/or other user of the user premise network  attempted to transport a significant amount of the data stored in the set of premise data stores  via one or more networks  such as the Internet in an unmanaged fashion, the comparatively low bandwidth or lack of reliability in the packet-switched public Internet could render the data transfer difficult, impractical, unfeasible, or impossible due to the limitations of those types of channels or connections. The upload of terabytes or other amounts of data over public Internet or similar connections could require days of time or more, and data integrity or reliability issues could also affect the effectiveness of data migration attempted in that manner.","According to aspects, systems and methods for generating optimized host placement of data payload in a cloud-based storage network according to the present teachings can be deployed to assist in reducing, avoiding, or eliminating those and other types of performance degradations and other factors having a potential impact on the transport of data from on-premise and\/or other sources to the set of host storage clouds  and\/or other cloud-based storage assets, services, or resources. In implementations of the present teachings, a data distribution service  can accordingly be established or deployed as an independent service or access point, available publicly or privately to potential subscribers to the set of host storage clouds , to condition, prepare, receive, and stage incoming data payloads or data sets for delivery to an eventual cloud storage host, using enhanced, dedicated, and\/or otherwise managed connections to reduce data transport time, to improve transfer reliability and\/or security, and\/or to provide other factors or benefits. In aspects, the data distribution service  can establish or maintain physical points of presence (PoPs) and\/or other connections to one or more networks , such as the Internet and\/or other public or private networks, through which users or potential users can connect to the data distribution service  and its associated resources, logic, and services. According to aspects, the data distribution service  can host or execute a staging engine  that can contain software application, operating system, and\/or other logic or resources to manage the transport and delivery of a data payload  from the set of premise data stores  and\/or other sources to a set of host storage clouds . In aspects, the data distribution service  can be configured to communicate directly or indirectly with the cloud management system  of each of the set of host storage clouds , for instance via the Internet and\/or other public or private networks or connections. In aspects, the data distribution service  can also maintain a set of staged data stores , such as databases, data stores, servers, and\/or other data assets or resources with which to store and stage the data payload  for migration into one or more local cloud data stores  hosted in the set of host storage clouds . In aspects, each cloud in the set of host storage clouds  can host one or multiple local cloud data stores .","According to implementations of the present teachings in certain regards, the data distribution service  can operate to manage, organize, and\/or enhance or optimize the transfer of the data payload  from the set of premise data stores  and\/or other sources by staggering, staging, pre-staging, conditioning, and\/or otherwise manipulating and administering the transfer of the data payload  to the set of staged data stores  via sets of selectable and\/or configurable channels or connections. In aspects, those channels or connections can be or include a set of dedicated staging connections  that connect the user premise network  to the data distribution service  and the set of staged data stores . In aspects, the set of dedicated staging connections  can be or include any one or more of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks or connections, wide area networks (WANs) or connections, metropolitan area networks (MANs) or connections, fiber optical connections such as synchronous optical networking (SONET) or synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) connections, wireless connections, cable or wireline connections, virtual private networks (VPNs) or connections, and\/or other channels or connections. In aspects, the connections in the set of dedicated staging connections  can be or include channels or connections can having a relatively high-capacity bandwidth or service level, such as for instance tens of megabytes per second, hundreds of megabytes per second, gigabytes per second, tens of gigabytes per second, hundreds of gigabytes per second, terabytes per second, and\/or other data transfer rates or bandwidth ratings or capacities. In aspects, any one or more of the connections or channels in the set of dedicated staging connections  can comprise connections which are leased by a user on a temporary, demand-triggered, long-term, and\/or other basis. And one or more of the connections or channels in the set of dedicated staging connections  can be or include permanent or dedicated channels, line, and\/or connections, dynamically routed or configured channels or connections, and\/or other channels or connections.","In aspects, the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user of the user premise network  can specify a set of conditions, criteria, and\/or other parameters to govern the transport of the data payload  during delivery to the data distribution service  and\/or to the eventual set of host storage clouds , which information can be stored or encoded in a set of transport parameters , which can be stored in the staging engine  and\/or other locations or stores. The set of transport parameters  can, for instance, specify a total amount of data to be include in the data payload  for delivery to the data distribution service , as well as a schedule over which or time by which the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user wishes to conduct and complete the migration of the data payload  to the data distribution service . The set of transport parameters  can likewise include cost specifications, for instance, in cases where the cost of leasing or using any of the set of dedicated staging connections  is selectable or variable. The set of transport parameters  can also include further configuration parameters, such as any security or redundancy protocols or standards that the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user wishes to apply to the transport of the data payload to the data distribution service , user access controls to the data payload  before or after transport has been initiated or completed. Other parameters, configuration settings, commands, scripts, and\/or other criteria, variables, or conditions can be specified or indicated in the set of transport parameters .","As a merely illustrative example, the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user can enter or encode the set of transport parameters  to indicate that a data transport event is desired to migrate the data payload  from the user premise network  under criteria that 1,000 terabytes of data is to be transported by an ending time of 12:00 midnight on a specified data, at an average cost of not more than $0.25 per megabyte and with the data payload  encrypted using the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and\/or other encryption or security protocol, and with the data payload  to be stored in the set of staged data stores  of the data distribution service  in XML (extensible markup language) or other format. The set of transport parameters  can be selected, entered, and\/or otherwise transmitted from the user premise network  or other site to the data distribution service , for instance via a selector tool, Web browser, and\/or other application or interface. The set of transport parameters  can, in aspects, in whole or part specify the set of dedicated staging connections  to be used for delivery of the data payload  and\/or associated information to the data distribution service , for instance via manual selection or input received from the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user.","In aspects, the data payload  and\/or associated information can be migrated or transported partly or entirely via the set of dedicated staging connections . For instance, in cases, the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user may transmit some of the data payload  and\/or associated information via the one or more networks, in addition to the set of dedicated staging connections . For example, configuration commands, the set of transport parameters  or portions of or updates to the set of transport parameters , can be transmitted via the one or more networks , for instance via the public Internet, since in aspects comparatively higher-bandwidth connections may not be necessary to transmit relatively small amounts of commands and\/or data or elements of the data. In cases, the one or more networks  can in addition or instead transport at least a portion of the data payload , for instance, to transmit supplemental data or attributes whose delivery target time is not immediate or a high priority. Other combinations of the one or more networks , the set of dedicated staging connections , other networks or connections, and\/or combinations thereof can be used.","In aspects, after transport of the data payload  to the set of staged data stores  of the data distribution service  has been completed, the data distribution service  can finalize the installation, storage, and\/or hosting of the data payload  and\/or associated information in the one or more local cloud data stores  before initiating activities related to further transport of the data payload  to the one or more local cloud data stores  of one or more of the set of local host storage clouds . The data distribution service  can store, host, and maintain the data payload  in the set of staged data stores  for temporary, short-term, and\/or longer or other periods, depending on the set of transfer parameters  and\/or other factors. For instance, the staging engine  of the data distribution service  can determine that the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user has specified or requested that the transfer of the data payload  into the one or more local cloud data stores  of one or more of the set of local host storage clouds  be initiated by 9:00 p.m. on a certain date. To satisfy that scheduling criterion, the staging engine  can identify the size and\/or type of data in the data payload , analyze or estimate the bandwidth available in the set of dedicated staging connections , and set a target delivery completion time of 11:00 p.m. on the specified delivery date, taking into account the interval of time that will be necessary to transport the data payload  over the available bandwidth of the selected channels in the set of dedicated staging connections  to complete transfer of the data payload  by 11:00 p.m. on that scheduled date. If the transport process proceeds to complete by the calculated completion time of 11:00 p.m. on that date, the data of the data payload  and\/or any associated information can accordingly reside in the set of staged data stores  of the data distribution service  for one hour before the staging engine  initiates the further or next-stage migration or transport of the data payload  to the one or more local cloud data stores  of one or more of the set of local host storage clouds . The set of staged data stores  of the data distribution service  can host the data payload  and\/or associated information for lesser or greater amounts of times, for instance, for periods of minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and\/or other periods or intervals, depending on the set of transfer parameters  and\/or other factors. For instance, in an illustrative implementation involving payload data  including enterprise resource planning (ERP) data related to a chemical or automotive factory, the manufacturing data, materials deliveries and costs, factory repair or maintenance events or schedules, and\/or other data may be tracked, stored, and updated on a monthly cycle. In those or other implementations, the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user may specify that the data payload  encapsulating that ERP and\/or other data can or should be migrated over a period of 30 days and\/or before the next regular update cycle, in which case the data distribution service  may determine that the data payload  can be extracted to the data distribution service  over a period of 30 days, for instance so as to use a comparatively lower amount of bandwidth in the set of dedicated staging connections  and thereby incur less connection leasing costs. In cases where the set of staged data stores  of the data distribution service  stores, hosts, and\/or maintains the data payload  over significant intervals of time, such as days or weeks of time, and\/or other intervals or periods, the data distribution service  can also apply or enforce data conditioning or maintenance standards or procedures on the data payload  or other information. For example, in cases where the data payload  includes medical information, the data distribution service  can apply user access controls such as username\/password authentication and\/or data encryption, for instance to satisfy the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA), the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), or other regulatory or compliance stipulations or requirements. Other compliance, management, and\/or security protocols can be applied to the data payload  and\/or other information stored in the set of staged data stores  of the data distribution service , regardless of the duration of time that information is staged in the data distribution service . For instance, during the period that the data payload  resides or is hosted in the data distribution service , the data distribution service  can also communicate with the user premise network  to interrogate that source network for any incremental or other updates to the data payload , and incorporate those updates into the data payload  stored in the set of staged data stores  of the data distribution service . Other data conditioning or processing can be performed on the data payload  while hosted or stored in the set of staged data stores  of the data distribution service .","In aspects, the data distribution service  can be installed, configured, and\/or located in geographic proximity to the set of host storage clouds , the one or more local cloud data stores , and\/or other network elements or sites. As used or described in this application, in aspects, locations within geographic proximity to each other can be or include locations or sites located within the same city or metropolitan area, and\/or within the same general region, such as within a state in the U.S. and\/or a multi-state region generally recognized as constituting a cohesive geographic region, such as, merely for example, the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut tri-state area, and\/or others. In aspects, locations within geographic proximity to each other can also or instead be or include areas or regions within which direct, continuous, connectable, configurable, leasable, primary, and\/or otherwise uninterrupted or unmediated physical or wireless connections are available to establish communications links between two or more network points, sites, and\/or entities within a geographic region, section, and\/or area. In aspects, network sites, points including physical points of presence (PoPs), and\/or other elements can be considered to be within geographic proximity to each other is those sites or points can be connected directly or essentially directly via comparatively high-bandwidth channels or connections, and\/or without resorting to connections via the public Internet. For example, network sites, points including physical points of presence (PoPs), and\/or other elements can be considered to be within geographic proximity to each other if those sites, points, and\/or other elements can be connected directly or essentially directly via one or more wide area networks (WANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs), optical connections such as synchronous optical network (SONET) connections, and\/or other comparatively high-bandwidth channels or connections, as will be understood by persons skilled in the art. While in aspects network sites, points including physical points of presence (PoPs), and\/or other elements can be considered as being within geographic proximity based on various physical, functional, and\/or logical factors, in aspects, and purely illustratively, network sites, points including physical points of presence (PoPs), and\/or other elements that can be classified or considered as being within geographic proximity can be located within distances of miles, tens of miles, hundreds of miles, and\/or lesser or greater distances of each other. Other factors, parameters, criteria, and\/or considerations can be used to determine geographic proximity between network sites, points including physical points of presence (PoPs), and\/or other elements as described herein.","Upon meeting, reaching, and\/or otherwise satisfying the scheduled time, criteria, and\/or conditions to initiate the further transfer of the data payload  and\/or associated information to the set of host storage clouds , the data distribution service  and\/or other logic or service can begin the processing to migrate that data or information to the one or more local cloud data stores  of one or more clouds in the set of host storage clouds . In aspects, the delivery of the data payload  and\/or associated information to the set of host storage clouds  can be initiated at a scheduled time, such as a time specified in the set of transport parameters  and\/or other commands or configuration data. In aspects, the delivery of the data payload  and\/or associated information to the set of host storage clouds  can be initiated on an event-triggered basis, such as one hour or one day after completion of the transport of the data payload  to the data distribution service . In aspects, the delivery of the data payload  and\/or associated information to the set of host storage clouds  can also or instead be initiated by manual selection or command, for instance, by a selection or command inputted by the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user.

In aspects, the staging engine  and\/or other logic or service can initiate and manage the transfer of the data payload  and\/or image thereof stored or hosted in the set of staged data stores  to the one or more local cloud data stores  via the set of dedicated transport connections  on a scheduled, event-triggered, manually-specified, and\/or other basis. The migration or transport of the data payload  and\/or associated data can for instance be programmed to begin at a specified time on a specified date, and\/or to begin upon the detection of specified events, such as validation of the data payload  and\/or associated data using error correction, decryption, and\/or other processing or protocols. In aspects, the migration or transport of the data payload  and\/or associated data can be initiated by receipt of a command, input, and\/or other signal from the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user, for instance, received via a tool, interface, or browser operated by the admin in the user premise network  and\/or other location or site.","After the transfer of the data payload  and\/or other associated data has been initiated, the staging engine  and\/or other logic or service can monitor the transport of that data while in-flight, for instance, to perform data validation of migrated data using for instance check-sum or other processing, encryption\/decryption of the data while traversing the set of dedicated transport connections , and\/or to perform other supervisory or monitoring tasks to ensure the integrity of the data being moved and the migration process. After the successful completion of all data transport, validation, security, and\/or other processing required for migration of the data payload  and\/or related information, the staging engine  can detect, confirm, and\/or declare the completion of the transfer of the data payload  and\/or associated information to the set of host storage clouds .

In aspects, the staging engine  can also perform any post-transfer activities that may be selected or required to complete the installation and storage of the data payload  and\/or related information in the set of host storage clouds . In aspects, for instance, the staging engine  and\/or other logic or service can communicate with the user premise network  to indicate that the data payload  and\/or associated information has been safely and\/or completely migrated to the data distribution service , upon which notification the user premise network  can perform other actions, such as to delete and\/or archive the data of the data payload  from the set of premise data stores .

The host placement engine  and\/or other logic, application, site, and\/or service can for instance search for those host clouds and\/or cloud providers whose reported set of operational parameters  include a data uptime or availability rating of, merely for instance, 99.99% at all hosted times, in cases where the user's set of data hosting parameters  require a minimum of 99.99% availability for all hosted or subscription periods. Other parameters or specifications can be used to reflect, encode, or represent one or more minimum or baseline requirements encapsulated in the set of data hosting parameters .","In , host placement engine  and\/or other logic, application, site, and\/or service can eliminate, discard, and\/or discount those clouds and\/or cloud providers whose set of operational parameters  do not meet one or more required resource or operational threshold or thresholds, including for instance minimum storage capacity, as appropriate. Thus for instance, the host placement engine  and\/or other logic, application, site, and\/or service can eliminate those clouds and\/or cloud providers whose set of operational parameters  do not include or do not permit them to offer or provide the aforementioned  terabytes of data storage for the first 30 days of the hosted storage. Other parameters or specifications, singly or together, can be examined to determine or identify those clouds or cloud providers whose resources or capacities do not meet one or more requirements or aspects of the user's set of data hosting parameters , as appropriate.","In , the host placement engine  and\/or other logic, application, site, and\/or service can generate, evaluate, calculate, discover, and\/or identify the set of potential host clouds in the host storage clouds  which provide or produce an optimized or best-available match or satisfaction of the set of data hosting parameters , after the baseline or preliminary qualification of those clouds or providers remaining after 714, as appropriate. In cases where the user has specified one variable or parameter as the key, overriding, or predominant desired feature or specification, the host cloud, clouds, and\/or providers whose set of operational parameters  provide the highest rated value for that variable can be identified as the optimized or best-available cloud or provider to host the data payload . For instance, for a user whose data hosting needs involve critical or sensitive data, data availability ratings may represent the single most important factor in selected a host storage cloud, and so the cloud or provider offering the highest-rated data availability specification, such as for example, 99.9999% amongst the set of host storage clouds  where no other cloud or provider can offer more than 99.9980%, may be identified or selected based on that critical or key factor. In other cases, the user may specify in their set of data hosting parameters  or otherwise that subscription, hosting, and\/or related costs may represent the most important or determinative variable for that users data hosting needs, and so the cloud and\/or provider offering the lowest cost hosting package may be selected based on that factor, assuming all other minimum requirements are met. Other factors, parameters, settings, and\/or configuration values can be used to selected an optimized or best-available cloud, clouds, and\/or cloud providers to host the data payload  and\/or other data.","In aspects, the user may specify that host storage targets may be identified or selected based on more than one variable, parameter, or factor, and\/or may indicate or supply a weight, ranking, or rating to be applied to different ones of those variables, and\/or combinations thereof. Thus for instance, a user may specify that they require a minimum of 300 terabytes storage capacity a month, for which they are willing to pay a subscription cost of 15 cents per megabyte per month. The same user may also specify, however, that they would prefer an option of a continuously available or hot backup of the 300 terabytes of data, for which option they would be willing to pay a subscription cost of 18 cents per megabyte per month, and would likewise prefer an option of a selected or preferred piece of database middleware to be made available to network users, at a cost of 10 cents per instance if available. That user may assign a weight, ranking, or value of 1.0 to the 300 terabyte storage capacity, a weight of 0.9 for continuous backup capability, a weight of 0.6 for the preferred database middleware. In such cases, different clouds or cloud providers in the set of host storage clouds  may be able to provide or partially provide different combinations of the user's set of data hosting parameters , in which case, the host placement engine  and\/or other logic, application, site, and\/or service can compute a total weighted value of each cloud or provider's offering based on a weighted sum of the various factors or parameters. In such cases, the cloud or provider offering the combination of resources or parameters having the highest total of the weighted sum can be selected or identified as the optimized or best-available host storage cloud or provider. In further cases, no one cloud or cloud provider may be able to provider all desired resources or service levels, in which as the host placement engine  and\/or other logic, application, site, and\/or service can, for example, provider the user with a list of clouds or providers which can provide a set of operational parameters  partially satisfying the user's storage requirements, and for example permit the user to selected among the available cloud or provider options. Other reports, results, recommendations, and\/or selections can be made, and can, for instance, be delivered or presented to the user via a graphical dialog, such as via a browser or other interface.","In , the host placement engine  and\/or other logic, application, site, and\/or service can generate a recommendation and\/or a set of potential selections and present the identified or alternative cloud or clouds, and\/or cloud providers, to present to the user via the host placement engine  and\/or other service or interface. In embodiments, the host placement engine  can also or instead be configured to automatically select the target cloud in the set of host storage clouds  to host the data payload  and\/or other data based on the set of data hosting parameters  and\/or other criteria. In , the host placement engine  and\/or other logic, application, site, or service can initiate the transport of the data payload  to the identified and\/or selected host storage cloud or clouds in the set of host storage clouds , for instance by invoking transport services of the data distribution service . In , processing can repeat, return to a prior processing point, jump to a further processing point, or end.","The foregoing description is illustrative, and variations in configuration and implementation may occur to persons skilled in the art. For example, while embodiments have been described in which the cloud management system  for a particular cloud resides in a single server or platform, in embodiments the cloud management system  and associated logic can be distributed among multiple servers, services, or systems. Similarly, while embodiments have been described in which one group of servers within a set of resource servers  can provide one component to build a requested set of virtual machines, in embodiments, one group of resource servers can deliver multiple components to populate the requested set of instantiated virtual machines , and\/or other machines, entities, services, or resources. Other resources described as singular or integrated can in embodiments be plural or distributed, and resources described as multiple or distributed can in embodiments be combined.
