{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The Web can be a dangerous place. Attackers come at your sites constantly from all sides, wielding powerful weapons in attempts to degrade, defile, compromise, shut down, or simply take advantage of your Web presence. A user may fight back with security patches, input validation checks, encryption, running with least privilege, reducing possible attack surface, and a myriad of other secure coding techniques. But new attacks and new angles continue to proliferate, so the defenses evolve as well.","One of the greatest tools in an attacker's arsenal is computing power. The speed at which a computer can send hundreds and thousands of requests to hundreds and thousands of sites is staggering. Often, this is used for attacks that in moderation might not be considered an attack at all. For example, Hotmail\u00ae provides free e-mail accounts to the general public. However, Hotmail\u00ae is not happy to provide thousands of accounts to an attacker looking to use the accounts to send boatloads of spam to unsuspecting users. The problem for Hotmail\u00ae and other sites in the same predicament is that it can be very hard to differentiate a browser controlled by a grandmother looking to open an account to correspond with her grandson, from an attacker with a custom application looking to automatically open multiple accounts to send that grandson e-mail of a different sort. A famous problem known as the Turing Test led to one solution.","In 1950, Alan Turing fundamentally changed the world of artificial intelligence by proposing what is now known as the Turing Test. Turing believed that manmade computers would one day have abilities and intelligence rivaling that of humans. After all, the human brain is a form of a computer, albeit one based in biology rather than in silicon. Turing believed that asking whether computers can think is meaningless, that the true test of intelligence is whether a human could differentiate an artificial intelligence developed by human from an actual human.","To further his argument, Turing proposed the Turing Test. The Turing Test involves a scenario where a computer is placed in one room and a human contestant in another, both of which are separated from a third party. The third party is a human interrogator, who does not know which room contains the computer. This interrogator poses questions to both rooms through a text-based interface and receives answers from both the computer and the human contestant. When satisfied, the interrogator guesses which room contains the computer and which room contains the human contestant. If the interrogator is unable to come to the correct answer more than half the time, the computer passes the test and is considered as intelligent as the human contestant.","The Turing Test is based on the problem of a human differentiating between a computer and a human. In a sense, the Turing Test addresses the reverse of the problem described above: differentiating human-initiated requests from requests scripted by a program. This scenario has formally been named the Reverse Turing Test (RTT), although the term has also been used in some circumstances to describe a similar scenario but where both contestants attempt to be recognized as a computer.","One solution to the Reverse Turing Test is the CAPTCHA. CAPTCHAs, or more specifically \u201cCompletely Automated Public Turing Tests to Tell Computers and Humans Apart,\u201d also known as Human Interactive Proofs (HIPs). A HIP is a puzzle that is easily solvable by a human but difficult for a computer. In essence, HIPs take advantage of the intelligence gap that exists between humans and computers. HIPs differ from the standard Turing Test in that they are \u201ccompletely automated,\u201d meaning that the questions or puzzles posed to the user come from a computer, and are generated automatically. CAPTCHA-based systems are now in use all over the Web, from large Internet portals to smaller, individually run personal sites.","There are various types of HIP puzzles, typically presented to users as images. One popular type of HIP renders words in a distorted form, asking the user to enter the presented word. Another type of HIP displays one or more pictures of a familiar entity (such as a monkey), also distorted, asking the user to name the contents of the pictures.","When implemented properly, a HIP puzzle can prevent an automated script or a hacker from accessing services and resources that are meant for only humans to use, such as web site account registration, e-mail, and chat rooms. However, as these resources become more valuable, the ability to solve HIPs has become more valuable.","A HIP that displays distorted characters, can typically be solved via a two step process by computers. In the first step, the HIP image is segmented into its component characters. In the second step, the segmented characters may be analyzed using an optical character recognition (OCR) program to recognize the characters. The challenge for spammers is to collect a significant number of HIP samples and have the samples labeled by humans. Once the labeling is complete, it is possible for a software engineer to write a program that can learn how to segment the HIPs by using the labeled set as a training set.","Described herein are implementations of various technologies for generating human interactive proofs (HIPs). A resource provider, such as a web email account provider, may implement HIP technology to protect email account resources. More specifically, the resource provider may impede automated registration of large numbers of accounts that is typically performed by spammers using software tools. While the spammer may use HIP-solving technology to obtain access to the resources, the resource provider may use a HIP framework that impedes the successfulness of HIP-solving technology. With the HIP framework, HIPs may be generated dynamically, making it more difficult for HIP-solving technology to predict what the HIP to be solved may look like. By complicating the ability of HIP-solving technology to predict HIPs generated by the framework, the ability of the HIP-solving technology to solve HIPs may be reduced.","The claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all of the noted disadvantages. Further, the summary section is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description section. The summary section is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","In general, one or more implementations of various technologies described herein are directed performing symbolic computations on a mathematical equation. The various implementations will be described in more detail in the paragraphs below with reference to .","Implementations of various technologies described herein may be operational with numerous general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations. Examples of well known computing systems, environments, and\/or configurations that may be suitable for use with the various technologies described herein include, but are not limited to, personal computers, server computers, hand-held or laptop devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based systems, set top boxes, programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, distributed computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.","The various technologies described herein may be implemented in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The various technologies described herein may also be implemented in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network, e.g., by hardwired links, wireless links, or combinations thereof. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","120","110","130","140","140"]},"The resource server  may be a computing device that is used to provide a service to human users. Examples of such services include email, Internet chat rooms, Web site account registrations, and the like.","The spammer server  may be used by a spammer to obtain resources from the resource server . In one implementation, the spammer server  may include spammer software  that obtains resources automatically. By obtaining the resources automatically, the spammer may collect great multitudes of resources from the resource server .","For example, the spammer software  may collect a multitude of email addresses from the resource server . The spammer may then use the multitude of email addresses to send spam emails across the Internet.","The resource server  may be in communication with the HIP server . The HIP server  may be configured to impede the automated collection of the resources.","For example, in response to a request for resources from the spammer server , the resource server  may request a HIP from the HIP server . As stated previously, HIPs may be puzzles that are easily solved by humans, but not easily solved by computers. By sending the HIP to the spammer server , the HIP server  may impede the ability of the spammer to obtain resources from the resource server .","However, the spammer software  may be further configured to solve the HIPs. As stated previously, the spammer may collect a representative sample of HIPs from the HIP server . A human being may then label the samples, and have a software engineer modify the spammer software  such that it may solve the HIPs.","Accordingly, the HIP server  may include a HIP framework . The HIP framework  may be configured to generate HIPs dynamically to impede the ability of the spammer software  to solve the HIPs.","For example, HIPs may be generated using any one of numerous algorithms, also referred to herein as HIP engines. Each HIP engine may generate HIPs with different types of challenges for the spammer software  to solve. The different types of challenges may include character-based HIPs, picture-based HIPs, HIPs as games, audio HIPs, and the like.","The HIP framework  may be configured to generate HIPs from randomly selected HIP engines. In such a case, the spammer software  may not be able to predict the algorithm that is used to generate a particular HIP. As such, the spammer software's attempts to solve the HIPs may fail. The HIP framework  is described in greater detail with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","135","200","200"]},"At step , the HIP framework  may receive a HIP request. As stated previously, the resource server  may send the HIP request to the HIP framework  in response to a request for resources from the spammer software . In one implementation, the HIP request may be received through an interface such as, SOAP, HTTP_GET, redirect, and the like. In another implementation, the HIP framework  may receive the HIP request from the spammer software .","At step , the current configuration may be determined. The current configuration may specify parameters for dynamically generating the HIPs. For example, the current configuration may specify two or more HIP engines to be randomly selected for generating the HIP.","In one implementation, the HIP framework  may be configured to periodically rotate different configurations of HIP generation. More specifically, the current configuration could change over specified periods. The specified periods could range from periods of minutes to periods of months.","For example, the configuration in one period may specify two HIP engines to be used, while the configuration for a subsequent period may specify two completely different HIP engines.","In another implementation, the current configuration may specify a traffic routing percentage for each of the HIP engines. The traffic routing percentage may specify that a particular HIP engine be used a specified percentage of the time. For example, the current configuration may specify a HIP engine A, and a HIP engine B. Additionally, the current configuration may specify that HIP engine A be selected 30% of the time, while HIP engine B is selected 70% of the time.","In yet another implementation, the current configuration may specify parameters for each of the HIP engines. The parameters may vary in number and type for each HIP engine. For example, a character-based HIP engine may use 10 parameters that are used to determine how the characters are distorted. For example, one parameter could specify a rotation angle. Meanwhile, a picture-based HIP engine may use 20 parameters to determine how a picture is distorted. For example, one parameter could specify a slope at which the picture is presented.","At step , the HIP engine may be selected based on the current configuration. As stated previously, the HIP engine may be selected randomly from the HIP engines specified in the current configuration. In the implementation where a traffic routing percentage is specified, the percentage may be incorporated into a randomization algorithm for selecting the HIP engine.","At step , values may be assigned to dynamic parameters. Each of the HIP engines  may include both static and dynamic parameters. The static parameters may include values that remain constant from one execution of the HIP engine  to the next.","The dynamic parameters, on the other hand may change values. In one implementation, the current configuration may specify dynamic parameters with a range of possible values. Accordingly, the HIP framework  may randomly assign one of the values within the specified range to each of the dynamic parameters. Advantageously, randomizing parameter values of the selected HIP engine may further complicate the challenge for the spammer software  to solve the HIP.","At step , the HIP may be generated. The HIP framework  may call the selected HIP engine with the parameters that are specified in the current configuration, including the dynamically assigned parameters. The HIP engine may then generate the HIP.","In one implementation, the HIP engine may be called through a component object model (COM) interface. At step , the HIP framework  may send the generated HIP to the spammer software .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["135","135","310","320","330","340"]},"The HIP manager  may perform management functionality of the HIP framework . For example, the HIP manager  may receive the HIP request, determine the current configuration, initiate a call to the selected HIP engine, and send the generated HIP to the spammer software .","In one implementation, the HIP manager  may also perform server-side functionality of the HIPs. Server-side functionality may include validating solutions to the HIP, or other functionality as implemented by the selected HIP engine.","The CCM  may be a data store that contains the configurations for generating the HIPs. In one implementation, the HIP manager  may select the current configuration from the CCM . In another implementation, the HIP manger  may provide a user interface (not shown) through which the resource provider may create customized configurations. The CCM  is described in greater detail with reference to .","As stated previously, the HIP engines  may be software that generates the HIP based on an algorithm and specified parameters. In one implementation, the HIP manager  may execute the selected HIP engine  through a COM interface.","The HIP manager  may also track activity on the HIP framework  in the activity logging . The activity logging  may be a data store that tracks the success of particular configurations in preventing the spammer software  from solving the generated HIPs.","In one implementation, the HIP manager  may update the CCM  to exclude configurations whose success rates fall below a certain threshold. The tracking may include several layers of granularity, including traffic routing percentages, HIP engines , and parameter values (static and dynamic) that are used for particular HIP engines .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["320","320"]},"The CCM  may include variables . The variable, \u201cCONFIG. ID\u201d may be used for the tracking log  to track the success rate of a particular configuration.","Each column of the values  may represent one configuration to be used for the period specified in variable , labeled, \u201cPERIOD OF EXECUTION.\u201d For example, configuration - may be used by the HIP manager  for a period of 2 days. After 2 days has lapsed, configuration - may become the current configuration for the next period of 7 days.","Variables -A, -B represent \u201cHIP ENGINE ,\u201d and \u201cHIP ENGINE ,\u201d respectively. These variables represent a set of HIP engines that are randomly selected from when generating the HIP. It should be understood that more than 2 HIP engines may be specified in the CCM . Further the HIP engines specified in the CCM  may be identified with labels, or any other information sufficient to identify the HIP engine  to the HIP manager .","Variables -A, -B, labeled \u201cTRAFFIC %AGE\u201d, represent the traffic routing percentage for \u201cHIP ENGINE \u201d and \u201cHIP ENGINE ,\u201d as described above. Variables -A, -B and -A and -B represent static and dynamic parameters, labeled \u201cSTATIC PARAMETER,\u201d and \u201cDYNAMIC PARAMETER,\u201d for \u201cHIP ENGINE \u201d and \u201cHIP ENGINE ,\u201d respectively. Variables -A and -B represent values for the static parameters. Variables -A and -B, labeled \u201cDYNAMIC VALUES,\u201d represent values for the dynamic parameters. The static parameters may be parameters whose values do not change during the period of execution for the current configuration. In contrast, the dynamic parameters may be parameters whose values do change throughout the period of execution for the current configuration.","While the CCM  illustrates only one static and one dynamic parameter for each HIP engine , it should be understood that the number of parameters, static and dynamic, may vary based on particular implementations of the HIP engines .","As shown, variables -A, -B may include ranges of values, sets of values, or the like. For example, in configuration -, DYNAMIC PARAMETER variable A has a value of \u201cDISTORTION.\u201d DYNAMIC VALUES variable -A specifies the value of the \u201cDISTORTION\u201d parameter to be in a range from \u201c0.0-2.0.\u201d These values may represent an amount of distortion to be applied to a particular HIP.","In configuration -, DYNAMIC PARAMETER variable -B has a value of \u201cFONT.\u201d DYNAMIC VALUES variable -B specifies the values of the \u201cFONT\u201d parameter to be a set of values, \u201cARIAL, COURIER, and TAHOMA.\u201d","Additionally, sets of potential values for a particular parameter type may vary depending on implementations of the CCM . For example, in configuration -, DYNAMIC PARAMETER variable -B also has a value of \u201cFONT.\u201d However, instead of the values specified above, the DYNAMIC VALUES variable -B specifies the values of the FONT parameter to be a set of values, \u201cCAMBRIA, and TIMES NEW ROMAN.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["130","130","521","522","523","522","521","130"]},"The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example, and not limitation, such architectures include Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus also known as Mezzanine bus.","The system memory  may include a read only memory (ROM)  and a random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system (BIOS) , containing the basic routines that help transfer information between elements within the HIP server , such as during start-up, may be stored in the ROM .","The HIP server  may further include a hard disk drive  for reading from and writing to a hard disk, a magnetic disk drive  for reading from and writing to a removable magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  for reading from and writing to a removable optical disk , such as a CD ROM or other optical media.
