title: Hosted IPTV system incorporating a gateway adapter for processing in a shared IPTV environment
abstract: A shared (or “hosted”) IPTV system including intermediate IPTV facilities controlled by a host operator and accessible to one or more hosted operators pursuant to a shared service arrangement includes a gateway adapter for intercepting and manipulating operator transactions with the intermediate IPTV facilities. The gateway adapter is operable to modify operator calls directed to the intermediate IPTV facilities to include indicia of data uniquely available to the operator initiating the calls, the data having been logically partitioned into respective subscriber groups; and to forward the adapted calls to the intermediate IPTV facilities to invoke the operator transactions. Advantageously, execution of the adapted call provides the sourcing operator access to account information of its corresponding subscriber group while restricting access to account information of other subscriber groups.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["This invention relates to the field of IPTV (Internet Protocol Television).","IPTV is a television delivery platform that relies on a packet-based network infrastructure, e.g., including broadband Internet access networks, to deliver television content to customers, typically as an alternative to traditional over-the-air broadcast, satellite and cable modalities. A typical IPTV solution will include five major areas: (1) head-end video acquisition equipment for receiving television content; (2) intermediate IPTV facilities (comprising, for example, Microsoft\u00ae Mediaroom\u2122) including server platforms and associated IPTV middleware; (3) IP networking devices (e.g., routers, switches and Firewalls) for content distribution between various IPTV nodes; (4) Access nodes comprising, for example, VDSL or xPON equipment to enable high-bandwidth transport to and from the customer premises; and (5) operator-controlled applications which manage the IPTV solution or provide end-user IPTV applications.","As can be appreciated, the cost of entry into the IPTV market can be substantial. As an example, representative startup costs include (on top of the costs of implementing the network and access portions), securing contracts with video content providers, and building and maintaining head-end and intermediate IPTV facilities. Not surprisingly, particularly for smaller operators, the cost of entry can be prohibitively high.","To address this problem, a shared (or \u201chosted\u201d) IPTV solution has been contemplated, whereby in return for annual service payments or the like, a \u201cmaster\u201d or \u201chosting\u201d operator with a deployed IPTV solution shares a portion of its IPTV infrastructure with one or more neighboring (or \u201chosted\u201d) operators. In one example, the shared IPTV infrastructure might include shared head-end facilities and a shared intermediate IPTV facility including Microsoft\u00ae Mediaroom\u2122 server platforms and associated middleware. Thus, the hosted IPTV solution could advantageously enable hosted operators to enter the IPTV market with relatively low entry costs, while allowing the hosting operator to offset the enormous cost of the IPTV deployment with recurring service payments from the hosted operators.","However, to implement such a hosted IPTV solution, there is a need to maintain account information associated with potentially multiple operators, each having multiple subscribers, at the shared intermediate facility; and to support operator interactions with exposed application programming interfaces (APIs) of the shared intermediate facility in a manner that maintains operator and subscriber privacy. The present invention is directed to addressing this need.","This need is addressed and a technical advance is achieved in the art by a hosted IPTV system incorporating a gateway adapter that logically resides between one or more hosted operator facilities and the APIs of the shared intermediate facility. The gateway adapter will intercept and manipulate operator interactions with the APIs in a manner that is transparent to the respective operators and yet ensures privacy of account information between different operators.","In one embodiment, there is provided a method for use in a shared IPTV system including intermediate IPTV facilities controlled by a host operator and accessible to one or more hosted operators pursuant to a shared service arrangement, the intermediate IPTV facilities maintaining account information associated with a plurality of operators including the host operator and one or more hosted operators. The method comprises logically partitioning the account information associated with each of the plurality of operators into a corresponding plurality of subscriber groups; and, utilizing a gateway adapter to intercept and manipulate operator transactions, providing operator access to account information of its corresponding subscriber group while restricting access to account information of other subscriber groups.","In another embodiment, there is provided a method for use in a shared IPTV system including intermediate IPTV facilities controlled by a host operator and accessible to one or more hosted operators pursuant to a shared service arrangement, the intermediate IPTV facilities including one or more application programming interfaces (APIs) defining interfaces and protocols for operator transactions with the intermediate IPTV facilities. The method comprises utilizing a gateway adapter to intercept at least one operator call attempting to invoke an operator transaction directed to the APIs; adapt the call to include indicia of data uniquely available to the operator initiating the calls, yielding an adapted call, the adapted call having a format consistent with the requirements of an API to invoke the operator transaction; and forwarding the adapted call to the API to invoke the operator transaction, wherein execution of the adapted call provides access to the data uniquely available to the operator initiating the call while restricting access to data of other operators.","In still another embodiment, there is provided a gateway adapter for use in a shared IPTV system including intermediate IPTV facilities controlled by a host operator and accessible to one or more hosted operators pursuant to a shared service arrangement, the intermediate IPTV facilities maintaining account information associated with a plurality of operators including the host operator and one or more hosted operators, the account information logically partitioned into a corresponding plurality of subscriber groups associated with the plurality of operators.","The gateway adapter includes means for receiving an operator call intended to invoke an operator transaction with the intermediate IPTV facilities, the operator call including indicia of a sourcing operator, and wherein execution of the operator call nominally provides access to account information associated with the plurality of operators. The gateway adapter further includes means for identifying a subscriber group corresponding to the sourcing operator; and means for modifying the operator call to include indicia of the subscriber group of the sourcing operator, yielding an adapted call. Still further, the gateway adapter includes means for forwarding the adapted call to the intermediate IPTV facilities to invoke the operator transaction as a proxy for the operator call, wherein execution of the adapted call provides the sourcing operator access to account information of its corresponding subscriber group while restricting access to account information of other subscriber groups.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","102","104","106","102","104","106"]},"In one embodiment, the head-end facilities ,  comprise national and video on demand (VoD) facilities for receiving national and video on demand (VoD) content, respectively. National head-end facility  receives national content from satellite receivers  and routes the content into H.264 encoders , which encodes the national content into a format acceptable to Microsoft\u00ae Mediaroom\u2122 specifications. VoD facility  receives VoD content from satellite receivers  and catches the content at VoD catcher  waiting for asset ingestion into Mediaroom\u2122. The national and VoD content is delivered unencrypted from facilities ,  to host-controlled intermediate IPTV facility  by routers  (as shown, Alcatel Lucent 7750 routers) using multicast IP technology.","The host-controlled intermediate IPTV facility  includes respective Mediaroom\u2122 Live Backend and Mediaroom\u2122 VoD Backend server platforms ,  for receiving and performing initial processing of the national and VoD content; Mediaroom\u2122 Branch platforms , for providing IPTV services such as Digital Rights Management protection, client authentication, billing, subscriber management and application enablement, and for differentiating between accounts and devices of each operator; routers  (as shown, Alcatel Lucent 7750 routers) for providing content distribution and messaging between the platforms ,  and ; and a firewall  for blocking unauthorized access to the intermediate IPTV facility .","The Live Backend platform  is responsible for ingesting, encrypting and streaming live TV service (i.e., national content) to the subscribers of all operators. In one embodiment, the national live TV service defines a shared resource that is accessible to both hosting Operator A and hosted Operator B. Thus, there are no operator-specific values present in the creation of the national live TV services. While there is potential to resell content in a tiered structure, this capability can be enabled by functionality in the Mediaroom\u2122 Branch platform  (rights\/grants, channel maps, etc.).","In one embodiment, the Live Backend platform  is subject to the following constraints:","1) The Live Backend  must be built geographically close to the national head-end facilities , preferably in the same location. This geographic proximity constraint is derived from Mediaroom\u2122 specifications for H.264 Encoder-to-AServer network requirements including: <10 ms round-trip time (RTT), <4 ms packet jitter and 10bit-error rate (BER).","2) The Live Backend must be aware of all geographic region codes (GRCs) for all operators utilizing the hosted Mediaroom\u2122 deployment. Blackouts must be triggered for the appropriate live TV events for each operator. This will add a requirement to build and operate an auxiliary system to trigger blackouts on the hosted Mediaroom\u2122 solution.","3) The hosting operator will be required to work out licensing and resell agreements for the distribution of the national live TV content.","The VoD Backend platform  is responsible for ingesting, encrypting and staging VoD assets for the subscribers of all operators. Like the national live TV content, the VoD content comprises a shared resource that is accessible to both hosting Operator A and hosted Operator B. A tiered resell agreement can be realized by assigning the appropriate rights to an operator via the Mediaroom\u2122 Branch  functionality. In one embodiment, the hosting operator will be required to work out licensing and resell agreements for the distribution of the VoD assets.","The Branch platform  maintains account information including, for example and without limitation, operator and\/or subscriber data relating to subscriber management, billing and provisioning, programming schedules, channel line ups, pay-per-view and VoD ordering mechanisms, and the like. In one embodiment, the Branch platform  includes one or more application programming interfaces (API) for interfacing with the operators and controlling operator interactions with the Branch platform to access account information. For example and without limitation, the APIs may define interfaces and protocols for controlling operator OSS\/BSS transactions (i.e., Operations Support System and\/or Business Support System transactions) and access to account information relating to such transactions.","As will be appreciated, the Branch platform  is the most complex portion of the shared environment to manage. One of the challenges of the shared Mediaroom\u2122 deployment is to make the IPTV services appear to be dedicated for a given operator, even though subscribers from various operators will be sharing the same server resources. In one embodiment, this is accomplished in part by logical groupings termed \u201csubscriber groups\u201d which are used to differentiate account information among potentially multiple operators each having multiple subscribers; and can designate membership for collections such as rights to a given channel package or even geographic location. Subscriber groups can span multiple \u201cService Groups,\u201d which define dedicated server resources for a given set of subscribers.","In one embodiment, operator-designation subscriber groups (specific to individual operators) are created to logically partition account information associated with each of potentially multiple operators dispersed across multiple Service groups, thereby avoiding the use of dedicated hardware for each operator. The use of subscriber groups creates the following advantages:","1) The Mediaroom\u2122 deployment can be much more densely populated, increasing the revenue generation capabilities of the solution. Since each Service Group can host up to 180 k devices (at time of writing), designating a Service Group for an operator which has only 2000 devices translates to wasted server resources and, thus, lost revenue opportunities. Also, a Mediaroom Branch can host up to a maximum of 11 Service Groups (10 active, 1 spare), which would cap the number of operators per Branch at 10. Using subscriber groups, the 2000 devices in the example above need not be dedicated to a particular Service Group, but rather can be dispersed among the 10 active (shared) Service Groups and the Service Groups can be utilized up to their full capacity. Thus, in the present example, the Mediaroom\u2122 Branch can serve up to 1.8M devices (180 k per Service Group\u00d710 Service Groups). Moreover, because the Service Groups are shared among multiple operators, the number of operators per Branch is not constrained by the number of Service Groups, but rather becomes a factor of the number of operator provisioned devices versus the total device capacity of the Mediaroom\u2122 Branch.","2) Catastrophic loss of a Service Group would potentially not result in a complete outage for any given operator. Since the accounts and devices for each operator are dispersed across the solution, such a failure would affect only the percentage of accounts and devices mapped to the failed Service Group. Other accounts and devices would be unaffected.","3) Adding a new operator is simply a provisioning task, assuming there is still capacity remaining in the Mediaroom\u2122 deployment. There would not be a requirement to add more server and storage hardware until such time as the capacity of the Mediaroom\u2122 deployment is exhausted.","4) Use of subscriber groups provides a straight-forward mechanism to distinguish each operator's accounts and devices in the system. Further, as will be described in greater detail in relation to , embodiments of the present invention include a privacy mechanism (\u201cgateway adapter\u201d) that make the shared Mediaroom\u2122 configuration transparent to the operators. Thus, the operators can use custom OSS\/BSS tools for operations, built per Microsoft specifications and interfaces, without any extra tweaks or customizations required.","5) A tiered or a la carte resell agreement for national live and VoD content can be easily achieved using operator-designation subscriber groups. Rights to the content can be assigned on a subscriber group-basis, allowing access to authorized operators but blocking access to operators which choose not to carry that content.","In one embodiment, the operator facilities  each include a Video Serving Office (VSO)  for performing certain video services that are not well suited for the shared portion of the hosted IPTV system. For example and without limitation, the VSO can provide local live TV services, Emergency Alert Services (EAS), Instant Channel Change (ICC), Reliable-UDP (R-UDP) and VoD streaming. In one embodiment, the VSO  comprises a relatively small local head-end and Mediaroom\u2122 Live Backend deployment (i.e., defining operator-controlled head-end and intermediate IPTV facilities that are small relative to the host-controlled head-end facilities ,  and Mediaroom\u2122 Live Backend facility ) to accommodate local channels at the operator facilities . The local head-end (not shown) receives local TV content over the air and routes it to H.264 encoders (not shown). The VSO Live Backend (not shown) will ingest and encrypt this content, and then stream it to the subscribers for the operator.","As shown, the operator facilities further include routing elements  (as shown, Alcatel Lucent 7750 router and 7450 switch) for providing content distribution and messaging within the operator sites  and to and from the operator-controlled Intermediate IPTV facility ; Access Nodes comprising, for example, VDSL or xPON equipment to enable high-bandwidth transport to and from the customer premises . The customer premises  include various client devices (e.g., set-top boxes, or STBs, not shown) for accessing IPTV content. In one embodiment, the operator sites further include IT Data Center Systems (not shown), operator-controlled applications which manage the IPTV solution or provide end-user IPTV applications.","As has been noted, the intermediate IPTV facilities of the IPTV system are distributed between host-controlled facilities  and the operator-controlled VSO . It has been further noted that by utilizing a full complement of service groups, the host-controlled intermediate IPTV facility  can serve up to 1.8M devices (180 k per Service Group\u00d710 Service Groups) and multiple operators. As has further been noted, one of the challenges of the shared Mediaroom\u2122 deployment is to make the IPTV services appear to be dedicated for any given operator, even though multiple operators, each serving multiple devices, will be sharing the same server resources. This translates to a requirement to allow operator interactions with the host-controlled Mediaroom Branch (including, without limitation, OSS\/BSS interactions) using the exposed APIs to access account information without compromising operator or subscriber privacy\/security.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","124","120","108","106","202","204","206","208","120","210","212","124"]},"Each of these devices includes respective processors and memory (not shown) for effecting certain transactions relating to the services and capabilities of the IPTV system . As will be appreciated, the components of  are functional components that may be distributed among multiple individual components or devices. Further, although the components of  are identified and will be described with respect to OSS\/BSS functionality, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the components of  may be utilized for virtually any instance of transactions with the host-controlled Mediaroom Branch including, but not limited to OSS\/BSS transactions.","The operator OSS\/BSS systems  are operator-implemented OSS\/BSS platforms located in the operator facilities , unique for each operator, that are responsible, for example and without limitation, for provisioning workflow, account maintenance and billing. To execute these functions, operator OSS\/BSS systems  initiate OSS\/BSS web service calls with the host operator site . In one embodiment, the OSS\/BSS web service calls are compliant with Microsoft Mediaroom OSS\/BSS API specifications (i.e., the OSS\/BSS systems  will perform Microsoft Mediaroom web service calls as if the Microsoft Mediaroom deployment was not shared). The OSS\/BSS calls comprise web method calls encapsulated in SOAP over HTTP or HTTPS. The underlying network protocol is TCP\/IP. The web method calls may be protected via SSL certificate (Secure Sockets Layer).","The operator ELS servers (External Login Servers)  are operator-implemented servers located in the operator facilities , unique for each operator, that provide additional custom authentication of STB clients.","The Mediaroom OSS\/BSS gateways  are servers of the Mediaroom Branch that are responsible for exposing the OSS\/BSS APIs and implementing the OSS\/BSS API logic.","The gateway adapter  logically sits between the operators OSS\/BSS systems  and the Mediaroom OSS\/BSS gateways  and is the key component that enables operator interactions with the OSS\/BSS APIs without compromising operator or subscriber privacy\/security.","As best shown in , the gateway adapter performs the following functions relating to processing OSS\/BSS transactions:","(1) Intercepts OSS\/BSS web method calls from the operators' OSS\/BSS systems . As shown, an inbound OSS\/BSS web method call from operator OSS\/BSS system , directed to the Mediaroom OSS\/BSS gateway , is intercepted by a gateway API interface  (\u201cGateway API Interface \u201d).","(2) Performs a translation to an \u201coperator-designation\u201d subscriber group and operator privilege level via indicia of the sourcing operator, such as an SSL certificate mapping or source IP address of the incoming call. In one embodiment, this comprises the gateway API interface  determining, based on the IP address of the inbound OSS\/BSS call, the particular operator (e.g., Operator A or Operator B) that sourced the call and determining, based on the identity of the sourcing operator, the appropriate operator-designation subscriber group and privilege level to be assigned to the call. This latter step is accomplished by querying or consulting an operator privilege and subscriber group mapping table  to find the operator-designation subscriber group and privilege level corresponding to the sourcing operator. This assumes the public IP addresses or the IP address range of each operator is known and is unique.","(3) Manipulates the OSS\/BSS web method call based on the translated data (i.e., per the operator privilege level and the operator-designation subscriber group), yielding an adapted OSS\/BSS web method call in which only data associated with the operator-designation subscriber group is accessible. For example, an inbound OSS\/BSS call from Operator A to retrieve all billing records for July 1 will be converted to a call to retrieve all billing records for July 1 for accounts belonging to the operator-designation subscriber group corresponding to Operator A.","(4) Forwards the adapted OSS\/BSS web method call to the Mediaroom APIs  (residing in Mediaroom OSS\/BSS gateway ) for processing, provided the operator privilege level is sufficient to execute the call. Processing of the call generally involves consulting subscriber data in the Mediaroom Databases  to perform an action, retrieve particular records, or the like. In one embodiment, certain OSS\/BSS calls can be designated as requiring higher privileges to execute, and the gateway adapter would only allow calls from operator(s) having a sufficient privilege level to execute the call (most likely, the \u201cmaster\u201d or \u201chost\u201d operator will have the highest privilege level). For example and without limitation, OSS\/BSS calls that can result in actions affecting multiple operators might be executable only by the \u201cmaster\u201d or \u201chost\u201d operator.","(5) Returns the resulting data, or error message, to the appropriate operator OSS\/BSS system . In one embodiment, if the operator OSS\/BSS system  does not have the appropriate privilege level to execute the requested OSS\/BSS web method transaction, the gateway adapter  returns an HTTP 401 Unauthorized error to the Operator OSS\/BSS system  and logs the unauthorized web method request.","Referring to , the gateway adapter  can also allow for each operator to maintain a unique instance of External Login Server (ELS)  for providing operator-customized authentication logic during STB bootstrap by performing the following:","(1) Receives ELS Device Login calls from the Mediaroom client-facing application servers . As shown, an inbound ELS call from the client-facing application servers , directed to the Operator ELS system , is intercepted by ELS gateway . In one embodiment, the Device Login calls comprise web method calls encapsulated in SOAP over HTTP. The underlying network protocol is TCP\/IP. The web method calls may be protected via SSL, per the operator security requirements.","(2) Performs a translation to a specific operator ELS based on the passed client IP address. In one embodiment, this comprises the ELS gateway  querying or consulting a client IP-to-operator mapping table  to determine the particular operator (e.g., Operator A or Operator B) and hence, the particular operator ELS system  associated with the IP address.","(3) Proxies the Device Login call to the operator ELS.","(4) Returns the login result (not shown) from the operator ELS to the Mediaroom client-facing application servers , thereby allowing authentication to complete.","In one embodiment, the gateway adapter  allows a user to define the following attributes for each operator: IP address range for STB clients belonging to the operator; IP address of the operator ELS; privilege level of the operator; operator name; operator-designation subscriber group; prefix string (to ensure uniqueness when creating objects within a shared Mediaroom environment); default routing response for an ELS Device Login web method request; use of SSL protection (Boolean); IP address or IP address range for operator OSS\/BSS system (for Network\/IIS ACLs); time-out value for OSS\/BSS web method calls; and user accounts which can access the User Interface. The gateway adapter  also allows a user to define the following global attributes: log retention periods; name of the hosting operator (e.g., performed at install time).","Now turning to , there is shown a generic illustration of various OSS\/BSS transactions supported by the gateway adapter . These transactions include, without limitation, update global settings , update operator metadata , view event history , request OSS\/BSS web method ; and request DeviceLogin web method . The steps of  are implemented, where applicable, by human operators at the host site or operator sites, or using stored software routines within the Mediaroom OSS\/BSS gateway , Mediaroom Client-facing application server , operator OSS\/BSS system  or Operator ELS instance  of the hosted IPTV system.","The update global settings operation  is performed by an authenticated host operator administrator at the hosting site, to modify global settings in the gateway adapter  affecting any or all operators. The global settings that are subject to modification may include, for example and without limitation, any operator name, the IP address range for any operator OSS\/BSS systems, the IP address range for STB clients belonging to any operator, the IP address range for any operator ELS instance, any operator-designation subgroup, any operator privilege level, any operator prefix string, the default routing response for DeviceLogin web method requests for any operator, the user accounts that can access the User Interface for any operator, OSS\/BSS timeout values for any operator, the requirement for SSL use to protect HTTP traffic for any operator, privilege level of a given Mediaroom OSS\/BSS web method, and the number of days worth of log files to retain for any operator.","The update operator metadata operation  is performed by an authenticated remote operator site operations engineer or host site operations engineer, where applicable, to create, update or delete metadata associated with a given operator. The operator metadata that is subject to modification may include, for example and without limitation, the IP address range for the operator OSS\/BSS system(s), the IP address range for STB clients belonging to the operator, the IP address range for the operator ELS instance, the default routing response for DeviceLogin web method requests for the operator, the user accounts that can access the User Interface for the operator, OSS\/BSS timeout values for the operator, and the requirement for SSL use to protect HTTP traffic for the operator.","The view event history operation  is performed by an authenticated remote operator site operations engineer or host site operations engineer, where applicable, to view events written in the current or archived event logs associated with the corresponding operator (in the case of the remote operations engineer) or all operators (in the case of the host site operations engineer).","The request OSS\/BSS web method operation  is performed by an operator OSS\/BSS system to access the Mediaroom OSS\/BSS APIs via the gateway adapter . In one embodiment, as described in relation to , the gateway adapter  will restrict certain OSS\/BSS web method calls per operator privilege levels, for example, such that only the host operator can execute OSS calls that can affect multiple operators. In one embodiment, the gateway adapter  will further use operator-designation subscriber groups to ensure privacy between operators (e.g., to allow the calling operator access to its own subscriber data but restrict access to other operators' subscriber data).","The request DeviceLogin web method operation  is performed by a Mediaroom client-facing application server  to access an operator ELS instance  via the gateway adapter . As described in relation to , the gateway adapter  will proxy the DeviceLogin web method requests to the appropriate operators ELS instance , so as to allow each operator to maintain a unique ELS instance . The operator ELS instance will execute their custom authentication logic and return the appropriate result to the Mediaroom platform via the gateway adapter .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIGS. 1-5"},"For example, the term \u201chosted IPTV system\u201d as used herein is generally defined as an IPTV system having one or more resources that are shared, under control of a \u201cmaster\u201d or \u201chosting\u201d operator, with one or more \u201chosted\u201d operators.
