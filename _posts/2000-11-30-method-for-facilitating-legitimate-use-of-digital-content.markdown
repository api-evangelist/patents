Technical Field","The present invention relates to a recording medium recording a program for a method of data management and a method of image creation, a transmission medium transmitting a program for a method of image creation, a recording medium recording a program for a method of image restoration, and a transmission medium transmitting a programs for a method of image restoration, and more particularly relates to a method of data management for distributing digital content with annex information visibly arranged, a recording medium recording a program for a method of image creation for using distributed image data in the method of data management, a transmission medium for transmitting the program, a recording medium recording a program for a method of image restoration for using distributed image data, and a transmission medium transmitting the program.","2. Description of Related Art","For software such as computer programs and electronic publications, computerized data are stored on magneto-optic disks (MO), DVD, floppy disks (FD), mini discs (MD), etc., and sold. These computerized data are easily duplicated, and illegal duplicates are frequently made. On this account, software vendors' and publishers' copyrights are notably encroached and profits notably hindered.","Computerized data including static images and moving images distributed via the Internet, CATV, etc. are also illegally duplicated, which spoils copyright holders' profits.","To protect computerized data referred to as \u201cdigital content\u201d stored on recording media or distributed via a network, the digital content is encrypted using an encryption key, and the encrypted substantive data are distributed.","For example, consider that a user accesses a distributor of content from his\/her personal computer and downloads digital content to the hard disk to use. Firstly, the user accesses a host computer to obtain a plug-in module for downloading. After that, an identification number of a hard disk drive being used, a CPU identification number of the computer being used, and other use-specific identification information are sent to the host computer.","On the content distributor end substantive data, in which digital content has been encrypted with a content key, and licensing data, in which the content key has been encrypted with user-specific identifying information, are sent to the user end.","The user stores the encrypted substantive data and the authorization information which are left encrypted on the hard disk. When the user uses the digital content, the user decrypts the authorization information using the identification information such as an identification number of the hard disk drive and obtains the content key. With the content key, the user decrypts the encrypted digital content to use.","In this case, an encryption key for coding digital content can be made to be common when right of digital content availability is granted to individual users, and the right of availability can be individually granted by coding a decryption key by using a user-specific information which differs depending on the user.","When data are distributed in the above manner, a data distributor needs to individually send encrypted digital content and authorization information which is a decryption key of encrypted digital content.","Meanwhile users need to individually store the encrypted digital content sent that has been sent in and their authorization information on a recording medium.","Therefore if authorization information is destroyed while it is being sent from a data distributor to a user, or is destroyed or lost on a user's recording media due to some accident, digital content cannot be used and a procedure for obtaining the authorization information must be performed again.","Further, in situations in which library apographs and art museum collections are by photographing or scanning imported as image data that is used by users, if the image data is completely encrypted, pinpointing the image data desired on the users' end before transacting authorization information is difficult.","Therefore it is desirable that part of the image can be checked by users and the image cannot be illegally diverted.","For this reason, it is conceivable that annex information such as copyright information is embedded in digital content and distributed as a visible digital watermark as shown in Japanese Laid-Open Pat. App. 1996-241403.","When annex information is embedded in digital content and distributed as a visible digital watermark, modulation data of color or brightness must be created for each pixel and be distributed with digital content with annex information to eliminate the annex information and restore the original digital content. Therefore there occur problems that transmission and receive of such data is time-consuming and large memory capacity for storing data is consumed.","The present invention provides a method of data management which facilitates use by legitimate users without violating copyright and literary property, a recording medium recording a program for a method of image creation to use distributed image data in this method, a transmission medium transmitting the program, a recording medium recording a program for a method of image restoration to use distributed image data, and a transmission medium transmitting the program.","A method of data management as determined in the present invention is for distributing digital content with annex information visibly arranged, and includes a step that a part of the above-mentioned digital content including a position where the above-mentioned annex information is visibly arranged is duplicated as a discrete data unit, and this discrete data unit is decrypted to create a decrypted discrete data unit, a step that image-compositing information concerning a position and size on the occasion when the above-mentioned annex information is arranged in the above-mentioned digital content, and authorization information including information of an encryption key into which the above-mentioned encrypted discrete data unit is encrypted are embedded in the above-mentioned digital content as an invisible information to create a authorization information-added data unit, a step that the above-mentioned annex information is visibly arranged on a position corresponding to a discrete data unit of the above-mentioned data part with the above-mentioned authorization information to create a data part with annex information, and a step that composite data composed of the above-mentioned encrypted discrete data unit and the above-mentioned data part with annex information is created and distributed.","Herein the annex information is embedded in the above-mentioned digital content as a visible digital watermark.","Annex information equivalent to annex information embedded in the above-mentioned digital content as a visible digital watermark can be configured so that it may be embedded in the above-mentioned discrete data unit as an invisible digital watermark and be encrypted to create an encrypted discrete data unit.","Furthermore, image-compositing information and authorization information can be configured so that they may be encrypted with a secret key and embedded in digital content as an invisible information, and the invisible information can be embedded in a part including a position where annex information of digital content is arranged.

The content administrator  embeds the authorization information  in the digital content  as an invisible digital watermark and merges the digital watermark and the encrypted discrete data unit into the distribution data .","Herein the content provider and content administrator  may be the same.","Content Administrator",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"2"},"The content administrator  is composed of a host computer and server applications, and includes: a content administration module ; a annex information input module  for input of annex information such as copyright information, and for determining the position where the annex information is embedded; an image processing module  functioning to duplicate a portion of the digital content, and to visibly embed annex information in an original image; an image encrypting module  for encrypting with a content key a discrete data unit duplicated from the digital content; an authorization information creating module  for encrypting image-compositing information indicating information concerning the content key, and position and size of the discrete data unit, in order to create authorization information, an information embedding module  embedding the information of the content key and the image-compositing information in digital content as invisible information, a content key administrating module  administrating a content key for encrypting the discrete data unit; and a user information acquisition module  for acquiring and administrating user information for the content user .","Content User",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"3"},"The content users  are made up of terminals such as personal computers and workstations, and an application for using content. The content user  is furnished with: a user information administrating module  for administrating user-specific identification information such as the identification number of a hard disk drive in use and the identification number computer's on-board CPU; a distribution data acquisition module  for acquiring distribution data from the content administrator ; an image-compositing information acquisition module  for extracting image-compositing information from the distribution data; a content key acquisition module  for acquiring information for content keys from the distribution data; an image decrypting module  for decrypting encrypted a discrete data unit among the distribution data; an image processing module  for compositing a decrypted discrete data unit with digital content; a user information managing module  for managing user information and availability information based on availability of content; and a content working module  for working digital content.","Content Distribution","The following describes, based on FIG.  and , operations performed by the content administrator  before digital content is distributed.","In step S, the content administrator  determines whether content information  concerning digital content to be distributed is input or not. The content information  is information concerning a copyright holder of the digital content  and information of an administrator distributing the digital content , and for being embedded in the digital content as a visible digital watermark. The content information can be obtained by input by an operator with an input device such as a keyboard, or extraction of corresponding information from a database file administrating the digital content.","In step S, if the content administrator  determines that the content information has been input, step  ensues. In step , the input content information  is stored in a storing device and administrated.","In step S, the content administrator  determines whether image-compositing information  concerning position where the content information  is embedded as a visible digital watermark, and concerning size has been input or not.","For example, operator input of the coordinates of an initial point P(x, y) and pixel numbers G(x) and G(y) with an input device such as a keyboard is regarded as input of image-compositing information  and step S ensues. The existence of image-compositing information  such as the coordinates of an initial point P(x, y) and pixel numbers G(x) and G(y) set by an application, also regarded as the input of image-compositing information , and step S ensues. In step S, the input image-compositing information  is stored in a storing device and administrated.","In step S, the content administrator  duplicates a part of the digital content  based on the image-compositing information  to create a discrete data unit . At the same time, the content administrator  embeds the content information  in a position corresponding to the discrete data unit  in the digital content. Methods involving color modulation or methods involving brightness modulation are available as ways of visibly embedding the content information .","In step S, the content administrator  embeds the content information  in the discrete data unit  as an invisible digital watermark to create an information-added discrete data unit . Information as an invisible digital watermark can be added by inserting the content information  in a specific frequency band of the discrete data unit or thinning out a portion of the data and inserting the content information  there.","In step S, the content administrator  encrypts the information-added discrete data unit  with a content key  to create an encrypted discrete data unit. The content administrator  administrates the content key , and the same key may perform encryption and decryption.","In step S, the content administrator  encrypts the image-compositing information  and the content key  with a secret key  to create authorization information . The secret key  is an encryption key created based on user information sent from the content user . The user information  is previously sent from the content user , and at least one of: user identification information such as user ID or password; identification information for devices loaded on the user-operated computer; identification information for the on-board CPU in the user-operated computer; identification information specific to a recording medium storing the digital content; or user login information registered in the user-operated computer, may be used as user information .","In step S, the content administrator  embeds the authorization information  as an invisible digital watermark in a position in information-added data unit  other than that which corresponds to the discrete data unit , which creates an authorization information-added data unit .","In step S, the content administrator  composites the authorization information-added data unit  and the encrypted discrete data unit  into composite data . The composite data  created in this way is distributed through an online network such as the Internet or recording media such as CD-ROMs and DVDs, in response to requests from content users .","Using Content","The following describes based on FIG.  and  operations when the content user  uses the distributed digital content.","In step S, composite data  is acquired from the content administrator . Herein, it is assumed that the content user  previously accesses the content administrator  and requests use of digital content administrated by the content administrator , sending user-specific information to the content administrator . The composite data  can be obtained by either downloading it via any type of network, or by the content administrator  distribution of recording media on which it is recorded. The acquired composite data  is stored on the hard disk used by the content user , or on another recording medium.","In step S, an encrypted data unit  and an authorization information-added data unit  are segregated. Herein, in the authorization information-added data unit , authorization information is embedded as an invisible watermark, and content information indicating copyright information and the like is embedded as visible digital watermark. In step S, the content user  displays the authorization information-added data unit . The authorization information-added data unit  that is displayed is visibly embedded with content information indicating copyright information and the like in the original digital content, and is configured in a position other than where the content information is embedded, so that the original digital content may be confirmed.","In step S, whether or not the content user  has made a use request is determined. If on the authorization information-added data unit  display the content user  has made an instruction to the effect that this is to be used, step S ensues.","In step S, the content user  extracts authorization information from the authorization information-added data unit . The authorization information  can be extracted by performing frequency analysis or image analysis.","In step S, the content user decrypts the authorization information  to pick out a content key  and image-compositing information . The authorization information  is encrypted with the secret key  based on the user information . On this account, the content user  creates a decryption key  corresponding to the secret key  based on such user information  as: user identification information such as user ID or password; identification information for devices loaded on the user-operated computer; identification information for the on-board CPU in the user-operated computer; identification information specific to a recording medium storing the digital content; or user login information registered in the user-operated computer. Then decrypting the authorization information  utilizing the decryption key  enables the content key  and the image-compositing information  to be picked out.","In step S, decrypting the encrypted discrete data unit  with the content key  that has been taken out restores the discrete data unit .","In step S, based on information relating to position and size of the discrete data unit  included in the image-compositing information , the content user  restores the original digital content  by replacing data in a predetermined position in the authorization information-added data unit  with the discrete data unit .","In step S, the content user  works the content by displaying the restored digital content  on the display, for example. Since content information such as copyright information is embedded as an invisible watermark in the replaced discrete data unit , the restored digital content  is such that content is embedded as invisible information, and the digital content  to be displayed includes content information as an invisible digital watermark.","Authorization Information Structure",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0098"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":"11"},"Authorization information  is composed of a secret key-type area  in which the type of the secret key used for encryption is stored, and secret key information area  in which information encrypted with the secret key is stored.","The secret key type stored in the secret key-type area  indicates what type of information from the user information is used as the secret key. For example, if the storage-medium ID for a magneto-optic disk (MO) on which data are stored by the user is a secret key, the value to be stored in the secret key-type area  is set to \u201c0\u201d in advance. If a password set by the user is the secret key, the value to be stored in the secret key-type area  is set to \u201c1\u201d in advance.","The secret key information area  is composed of pixel position area , X-pixel size area , Y-pixel size area , and content key area . The image position area  is for storing on initial point P(x, y) when duplicating the discrete data unit . For example, this initial point P(x, y) indicates the left top corner point, and is input when the content administrator  creates distribution data.","In the X-pixel size area  and Y-pixel size area , x-direction pixel number G(x) and y-direction pixel number G(y) for the discrete data unit  are stored respectively. The x-direction pixel and y-direction pixel numbers G(x) and G(y) are input when the content administrator  creates distribution data, as is the case with the initial point P(x, y).","In the content key area , the content key  administrated by the content administrator  is stored. Data stored in the pixel position area  of the secret key information area , the X-pixel size area , the Y-pixel size area , and the content key area  are encrypted with a secret key identified by data in the secret key-type area.","The authorization information embedded in the digital content  as an invisible digital watermark can be structured as shown in FIG. .","In this case, authorization information data  is composed of pixel position area , X-pixel size area , Y-pixel size area , secret key-type area , and secret area information area . The pixel position area , X-pixel size area , and Y-pixel size area  respectively store the initial point P(x, y) when the discrete data unit  is duplicated, the x-direction pixel number G(x), and the y-direction pixel number G(y). These data stored in pixel position area , X-pixel size area , and Y-pixel size area  are input when the content administrator  creates distribution data as described above, and stored without encryption.","The secret key-type area  stores secret key type information indicating what type of information from the user information  is used as a secret key. For example, if the storage-medium ID of a magneto-optic disk (MO) on which data are stored by the user is a secret key, the value to be stored in the secret key-type area  is set to \u201c0\u201d in advance. If a password set by the user is the secret key, the value to be stored in the secret key-type area  is set to \u201c1.\u201d","The secret key information area  stores information for the content key  encrypted with the secret key .","Access Restriction Method","If the decrypted content key , the discrete data unit  decrypted with the content key , and the restored digital content  are permitted to be saved in a memory or a recording medium in the process of distribution data being restored by the content user , there is the possibility that data is illegally distributed using the saved data. A method of access restriction to prevent this will be explained based on FIG. .","The application by which the content user  uses the distribution data has a monitoring function and activates a monitoring function program in step S at boot-up of the content utilization program.","This monitoring function program monitors for illegal programs (\u201cmemory hook\u201d command: an Application Programming Interface) that function to snatch data in transit among the plurality of libraries that are components of the content utilization program. If the monitoring function program detects the occurrence of a memory hook command, program utilization is restricted.","In step S, the monitoring function program determines whether or not a process by a memory hook-related command is started. If the monitoring function program determines that a process executing a memory hook-related command is started, step S ensues; otherwise step S ensues.","In step S, the monitoring function program executes error handling. In error handling, the monitoring function program displays an error display showing that an illegal program based on a memory hook command is started and step S ensues.","In step , the monitoring function program executes operations of an application for utilizing the digital content. In step S, the monitoring function program determines whether or not to end the application. If the user has instructed termination, step S ensues.","In step S, the monitoring function program terminates the application for utilizing the digital content.","By this means the program restricts data written in the memory from being snatched while the program is running, and thus prevents the content key  and the digital content  obtained from the distribution data from being saved illegally.","A completely different image can be composited in a position corresponding the discrete data unit  of the digital content  to composite the data part with annex information . In this case, an image to be composited may include the content information , and an image not including the digital content  can be composited.","After the content information  is embedded in a position corresponding to the discrete data unit  of the digital content  as a visible digital watermark, the encrypted authorization information  can be embedded as an invisible digital watermark to create the authorization information-added data unit .","The decryption key  for decrypting the authorization information  can be common to the encryption key  used when the encrypted authorization information  is created.","The secret key  used when the encrypted authorization information  can be used as a secret key, and the decryption key  previously provided for the content user  by content administrator  can be used as a public key.","Use count of the number of times the content user  has used digital content can be provided as an invisible digital watermark embedded in the digital content . In this case, the use count information with the authorization information  embedded in the authorization information-added data unit  as an invisible digital watermark can be embedded as a digital watermark to update the invisible watermark every time the content user  uses the digital content.","When the content user  gives an instruction with the intention of using digital content, utilization of digital content can be made to be restricted if the use count exceeds a predetermined value.","It is also possible to rewrite the authorization information embedded as an invisible digital watermark to restrict the digital content from being used thereafter if the use count exceeds a predetermined value.","A recording medium on which a program by the present invention as above described is recorded is included in the present invention. Herein computer-readable floppy disks, hard disks, semiconductor memory, CD-ROMs, DVDs and MOs (magneto-optical disks) are conceivable as recording media.","A transmission medium transmitting a program by the present invention as above-described is included in the present invention. \u201cTransmission media\u201d herein include communications media (fiber optics, radio circuitry) on a computer network (LAN, the Internet, or radio communications network) system for supplying program information by propagation as a carrier wave.","According to the present invention, annex information is visibly arranged in digital content, which is embedded with authorization information and image-compositing information and distributed with an encrypted discrete data unit. The discrete data unit includes the position where the annex information is arranged. The authorization information is embedded as invisible information including encryption key information for encrypting the discrete data unit. Therefore, delivering by a separate route a decryption key for decrypting the encrypted discrete data unit is unnecessary.
