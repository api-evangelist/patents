Technical Field","The present invention is related to a method and system for managing user privacy and, more particularly, to a method and system of evaluating privacy risk or reward in the provision of user data.","2. Art Background","Various consumer studies indicate that people have become increasingly concerned about their personal data in a networked environment, such as the Internet. Particularly, people feel that they have lost control over how their information is collected and used, and would like to regain control over their information. For example, once personal information is disclosed to another party, control over that information is relinquished to the receiving party. As such, trust plays a major factor in how much information one party is willing to provide to another.","When a person provides personal details, such as a profile or part of his or her personality profile, it can be considered a risk on his or her privacy. From another vantage point, the person should be rewarded on the completeness or thoroughness of his or her disclosure. It is difficult to assess the privacy risk related to the disclosure of personal information.","A method, stand-alone or distributed system, and computer program encoded on a memory medium are provided to evaluate a privacy indication of a request for one or more data items of user information by a requesting party based on at least one privacy attribute of one or more of the requested data items, and to provide to the requesting party one or more of the requested data items according to the evaluated privacy indication.","A method, stand-alone or distributed system, and computer program encoded on a memory medium are provided to receive user information including one or more of the requested data items, to evaluate a reward indication for received user information based on at least one reward attribute of one or more of the requested data items, and to provide a reward to the user according to the evaluated reward indication.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","110","110","102","104","106","108","100","102","104","106","108"]},"As shown in , user device  may include an evaluation engine  (EE) and user data. User device , in combination with the evaluation engine  (EE ), is configured to receive a request for user information from a requesting party, such as requester  or trusted party , to evaluate a privacy indication (or indicator or index) of the request for one or more data items of user information by the requesting party based on at least one privacy attribute of one or more of the requested data items, and to provide the requesting party with one or more or none of the requested data items according to the evaluated privacy indication.","In one embodiment, user device , in combination with evaluation engine  (EE), may be configured to receive a request for user information from requester  or trusted party ; to obtain and identify requested data items of user information and, if desired, a context of the request; to notify the user of the context of the request; to automatically or manually select data items to be evaluated; to compare the requested data items with stored data; to retrieve privacy attributes such as privacy values for identified items; to perform an evaluation of privacy indication for the request; to edit the combination of selected data items evaluated and to make a re-evaluation if necessary or indicated by the user; and to determine whether evaluated privacy indication(s) is acceptable (automatically or manually), and to transmit a response or reply to the requesting party. The notification of context of the request may involve, for example, notification to the user of non-identified requested data items and receipt from the user of additional data (e.g. for non-identified items or data edited by the user).","User device  may also be configured to receive rewards or benefits (e.g. coupons) such as from requester  or benefit provider , to store such rewards or benefits for future or immediate use, to verify possession of the benefits and\/or to conduct transaction to redeem the reward or benefit, e.g., to forward such benefit or reward to the party, which accepts the benefits or to employ such reward or benefit in an electronic or in-person transaction.","One or more of the above operations may be performed automatically by user device  or may require user input, such as user command, data entry or authorization.","Although each of the above-noted operations may be performed by user device , some or all of these operations may be off-loaded to trusted party , such as a profile server. As shown in , trusted party  may also maintain and manage user data for one or more users and include an evaluation engine, such as evaluation engine  (EE), which operates in a similar fashion to evaluation engine  (EE) discussed above. Trusted party , in combination with evaluation engine  (EE), may be configured to perform some or all of the operations discussed above for user device , e.g., providing user data to user device  or requester , evaluating request for user data, storing benefits or rewards, etc.","Trusted party  may be given rights to respond to the requester with or without notifying the user. Trusted party  may store all or some of the given responses, such as in a service log, so that a user may study afterwards what data has been given. Acquired benefits or rewards may be transmitted directly to the user from requester  or benefit provider , or may be transmitted to user device  through trusted party , or may be stored at the trusted party .","Evaluation engine  (EE) may employ data item attributes, such as values, which are given by the user or provided or generated by another party, such as trusted party . If values other than given or accepted by the user are used in the evaluation, the user may be notified on that preferably before the response is given.","Requester  may include an evaluation engine (EE) which interacts with a request generator, a benefits engine  (BE) and benefits or rewards data. Requester , in combination with evaluation engine  (EE), may be configured to receive responses to a request, to check on the degree of completeness of the response, to notify the responder (e.g., user device  or trusted party ) on incompleteness or to request additional data, and to evaluate the response. Evaluation engine  (EE ) may interact with a benefit engine  (BE) at requester  or benefit engine  (BE) of benefit provider  (e.g., a third party) which may also maintain benefit data. Benefit engine  or  (BE or BE) may determine and generate rewards and benefits to be provided to a user according to the evaluation of the response or notify the user of such rewards or benefits. The rewards or benefits may be part of a loyalty program, similar to mileage or hotel loyalty programs, or coupons, etc. The result of the evaluation may also be sent to the user.","Further, requester  may perform privacy indication evaluations on requested (or to be requested) data items, and provide such evaluations to user device  or trusted party . The evaluations may be provided along with the request or at other times or upon the user's or trusted party's request.","The risk and rewards processes herein may be implemented in various manners. A few embodiments or variations are discussed briefly below:","[1] User data including one or more data items relating to the user may be stored in whole or in part at user device  or trusted party . The user or trusted party may associate to some or all of the stored data items attributes, such as a number or a qualifying or quantifying attribute. Such an attribute indicates (or is a measure for) the amount of privacy revealed and may be referred to as a privacy value of the data item.","[2] Different privacy attributes may be combined to obtain a privacy indication or indicator (index) by using computational operations such as summing, weighted summing, or other forms of computational operations to provide some measure relating to privacy. If the attributes are qualifying such as LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH, the privacy indication may be obtained, for example, by counting the number of different attributes, by defining the indication to be the highest privacy attribute of the data items, by counting the number of data items, and so forth.","[3] Different privacy attributes (e.g., privacy values) may be used in different scenarios or contexts, such for different requesting parties, different purposes for the request, and so forth. For example, the data disclosed to official purposes may be valued differently from the data given to commercial purposes. Correspondingly, the data given to friends or to communities of which the user is a member may be given different privacy values. Along similar lines, different thresholds may also be employed for different scenarios or contexts.","[4] The privacy attribute for an item may be dependent on general statistics or other data. For example, the attribute for first or last name can be inversely proportional to the frequency of the first\/last name or the combination of them in a country or in a specified geographical area. The frequency may be obtained from official statistics, which may be accessed and maintained by user device  or trusted party . Correspondingly, the attribute for the street address may reflect the number of inhabitants or dwellings on that street. Other demographic data or available statistics may also be used for setting the privacy attribute of a data item.","[5] Evaluation of privacy indication may employ attributes which are given by the user or those accepted by the user. The attribute accepted by the user may be common to all users of a trusted party  or common to a group of users (a community, an association, membership, affiliation).","[6] The evaluation may be performed by user device  or another party, such as trusted party . Where the valuation is performed by trusted party , the user may specify which kind of queries user data may be given and\/or may specify the extent to which user data can be given to a requesting party. Further, trusted party  may provide the requested data items to a requesting party automatically without informing the user of the request if the user has accepted or set in advance such procedure.","The user may require notification as to any answered requests by trusted party , or the user may receive from trusted party  a list of all answered requests. The procedure may be different depending on the requesting party (e.g., different procedure for different requesters). If the result of the evaluation is above a set threshold value, trusted party  may notify the user, via user device , before replying with a denial to the requesting party. Accordingly, trusted party  may operate in different ways depending on various conditions and settings in conducting data transactions for one or more users.","[7] In another example, when a request is received from a requesting party, the requested data items (e.g., NAME, ADDRESS, etc.) are identified in the request and the user can evaluate the privacy indication for that request by using a resident program in user device  on an item-by-item basis or the evaluation may be performed automatically. The privacy indication may be outputted to the user as different data items are entered, such as on an electronic form or questionnaire, or the user may receive only the final privacy indication.","[8] A request may also be analyzed to ascertain characteristics of requested data items. The characteristic of the request may relate to whether a requested data item is an identified or non-identified data item (e.g., whether the data item is known or has attributes associated therewith). Thus, the user may be informed of non-identified data items or of other characteristics of requested data items (e.g., reward or privacy attributes from the requesting party, etc.). Such non-identified data items may be discarded or left off or provided with an attribute by the user or other systems, such as trusted party  or requester . Another context may be relate to whether a data item is required (mandatory) or not required (not mandatory). Similarly, this information may also be provided to the user. In such cases, the user may receive notifications, such as \u201cthe request cannot be completed without giving the phone number.\u201d Further, the evaluation can give as a result both the value for the mandatory items and the value for complete items, as desired.","The characteristics may be determined based on information provided by the requesting party, based on information retained by the user (such as on user service  or requester ), or based on information provided by the user (e.g., the user may define the characteristics).","[9] Various stages in the implementation of the risk or reward processes therein may be performed automatically or may require user input, such as user authorization to proceed or the opportunity for the user to edit the data items to be evaluated or re-evaluated. The user or other party may define such modes of operation. For example, the user may combine values for the privacy indication with actions, such as \u201cIf privacy index is smaller than 120, the answer may be given to the requester automatically\u201d or \u201cIf privacy index is greater than 180, and the requester is a commercial requester, show the request for editing before responding\u201d. Thus, the user may edit the answer even in such cases in which the response is generated automatically either by a program in user device  or by trusted party .","[10] The data items may be given values or attributes also by the requesting party, such as requester , and requester  may calculate or evaluate a privacy indication (also referred to in this case as \u201creward indication\u201d). The valuations for different data items and\/or their combinations may be shown to the user. Requester  may also combine any data item, a set of data items, and\/or the total value of the evaluated privacy indication with discount coupons, loyalty points, or other similar benefits. Requester  may disclose to the user in advance the conditions for receiving such benefits (e.g., 100 loyalty point for a disclosed indication of 150, 10 loyalty points for data item #, 20 loyalty points for data item ,  and , and so forth). The benefits may also be evaluated after the user has completed the request. For example, the user may receive a reward and notification of such a reward, e.g., \u201cyou are entitled to 5% discount on company A's products.","[11] Data items may be retrieved from stored user data or may be provided by the user (e.g., manually entered by user). For example, the request may be a data form to be filled out by the user, such as a questionnaire, application form, survey form, data requests forms in any electronic transaction, and so forth. Association and input of data for each data item may be performed automatically with user data or may involve user input. For example, the user may fill in the desired portions of the data form, and may be provided at the same time the privacy attributes for at least those data items and\/or an evaluated privacy indication for those inputted data items.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["102","102"]},"User device  may include a processor(s) , communications hardware\/interfaces for conducting wireless or wireline communications via antenna  and communication line(s) respectively, memory  and user interface(s) .

The rewards or benefits may be stored for future or immediate use. When using the rewards or benefits, user device  may verify possession of a reward or benefit and conduct a transaction to redeem the reward or benefit, e.g., to forward such benefit or reward to the party which accepts the reward or benefit.

Such a determination may involve a request to the user to edit or not edit and, accordingly, a user command corresponding to whether to edit or not edit. Alternatively, user device  may perform this automatically according to user settings, e.g., EDIT ON or EDIT OFF or upon some predetermined triggering event. For instance, editing is performed if the privacy indication is within a particular threshold (e.g., range of 50<privacy indication<100) or editing is not performed if the privacy indication is within another particular threshold (e.g., privacy indication>150).","If the determination is not to edit the current combination of data items for further evaluation, then the process proceeds to step  in which user device  may either provide no response to the request or request additional information, such as benefits information, context information or other information to assist the user in making an informed decision.

Likewise, one or more privacy attributes may also be removed as desired.","In the default setting, user device  gives the privacy attribute(s) of a data item or combination of data items a default attribute (e.g., predetermined value or privacy level). For instance, a new data item may be given a default attribute of 10 or LOW. Since there may be more than one privacy attribute for a given data item or combination of data items, a new data item or combination of data items may be given plural default privacy attributes for different contexts. These default values may be standard values or common values employed by other users or of a trusted party, such as trusted party , and may be updated from the trusted party.","In the automatic setting, user device  may automatically generate privacy attribute(s) for a data item or combination of data items according to related statistical data, such as official statistical data at step . Statistical data may be maintained in a statistical database  which may be accessed accordingly and, likewise, updated in a step  in which user device  acquires and\/or updates statistical information, such as from an Official Web Site or Official facility. Such statistical data may include demographic or other data as to names, age of people, nationality, origin, income, etc. in a particular region (e.g., country, state, city, street, etc.). This information may be analyzed to ascertain the likelihood in identifying the user based on a particular data item, e.g., name, or combination of data items, e.g., name and address.","For example, in the case where the user is John Smith who lives in New York City on 51Street, statistical information can be obtained to identify how many people with the name John Smith live in New York City or on 51Street. A corresponding attribute for the data item NAME or combination of data items NAME and ADDRESS may be defined according to the amount of people sharing the same name and location. For instance, if the number of people with the name John Smith living in New York City is greater than 10,000 then a privacy attribute may be a value 10 or LOW or if the number is less than 50 then the privacy attribute may be a value 50 or HIGH.","Once a value is generated, user device  updates the privacy attribute(s) for a data item or combination of data items in privacy attributes database . The update and storage may be performed automatically or may require confirmation from the user prior to performing such update and storage.","The generation or update of privacy attributes maybe performed by user device  or in conjunction with or by another system(s), such as trusted party . The generation and update processes may also similarly be employed to generate and update privacy thresholds or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0167","num":"0185"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":"1700"},"At step , user device  receives a request for data items of user information and benefit information. At step , user device  evaluates and ascertains combination(s) of data items based on benefit information and privacy attributes of one or more of the data items from privacy attributes database . For example, a max\/min algorithms may be performed to ascertain one or more combinations of data items in which the privacy indication is minimized while maximizing benefits or rewards. The combinations may also take into account whether a data item is required or not required, e.g., by filtering out combinations in which required items are missing. Likewise, other filtering may be employed to limit the number of potential combinations, such as filtering combinations including non-identified data items.","At step , a determination is made as to whether the privacy indication is acceptable according to predetermined privacy threshold(s). If not acceptable, the process may proceed to step  in which the combination of data items may be modified and re-evaluated or, alternatively, the process may be terminated. Otherwise, if acceptable, the acceptable combination of data items is provided to the requesting party.","Various examples of privacy indication or indicator evaluation and determination are discussed below in the Examples 1 through 3.","In one example, data items and sub-combinations of data items may have associated therewith one or more privacy attributes. These privacy attributes may take the form of a privacy value, e.g., 10, 20, 100, etc. The privacy indication or indictor (PI) may be determined based on summing, such as with the following expression: \n\n\nwhere:\n","PI is the privacy indication or indicator;","n is the number of data items involved in the evaluation (e.g., selected data items); and","pis the privacy value for the i-th data item where i=1 . . . n.","In other words, the privacy indication (PI) may be the sum of the privacy values of the data items. For example, data items NAME and ADDRESS may have privacy values 20 and 10, respectively. The privacy indication for the combination of data items NAME and ADDRESS would be 30, e.g., 20+10.","A simplified approach particularly if qualified privacy indication is desired is simply to set each privacy value p=1 so that PI would simply be the number of data items. If desired, the quantified PI may be expressed as a qualified PI based on the number of data items. For example, PI<5 is LOW (e.g., a low privacy concern) and PI>15 is HIGH (e.g., a high privacy concern). Any quantifiable PI may be converted to a qualified PI in a similar fashion.","However, in some circumstances, data items alone may not create a substantial privacy concern but when combined create a heightened concern over user privacy. To address this issue, one or more sub-combinations of data items may also have privacy attributes associated therewith. For example, the sub-combination of data items NAME and ADDRESS may have an added privacy value of 10. Accordingly, the privacy indication for the combination of data items NAME and ADDRESS would be 40, E.G., 20+10+10. Such an evaluation may be expressed as follows: \n\n\nwhere:\n","k is the number sub-combinations of data items involved in the evaluation; and","pis the privacy value for the j-th sub-combination of data items where j=1 . . . k.","An example of such an evaluation employing summing is described above with reference to .","While the above describes an examples of evaluating privacy indication, these evaluation techniques may also be employed to evaluate and determine a reward or benefit indication.","In another example, data items and sub-combinations of data items may have associated therewith one or more privacy attributes and weight factors. These privacy attributes may take the form of a privacy value, e.g., 10, 20, 100, etc. A weight factor may be employed to reflect various factors which may impact user privacy, such as the context of the request. For instance, a different weight may be applied to different data items according to the purpose of the request, the identity of the requesting party or other factors surrounding the request. These weight factors may also be stored along with the privacy attributes for data items and combinations of data items, as desired.","As one example, a weight factor of 1.5 may be applied for unknown requesting party and\/or a general purpose, a weight factor of 1.0 may be applied for known, business entity and\/or a commercial purpose, and a weight factor of 0.5 may be applied for a friend, official entity and\/or an official purpose.","The privacy indication or indictor (PI) may be determined based on weighted summing, such as with the following expression: \n\n\nwhere:\n","PI is the privacy indication or indicator;","n is the number of data items involved in the evaluation (e.g., selected data items);","pis the privacy value for the i-th data item where i=1 . . . n; and","wis the weight factor for the i-th data item where i=1 . . . n.","In other words, the privacy indication (PI) may be the sum of the privacy value multiplied by a weight factor for each data item.","As discussed above, sub-combinations of data items may also have associated therewith privacy attributes. Thus, these sub-combinations may also have weight factors associated with them. To address this issue, equation <3> may be modified as follows: \n\n\nwhere:\n","k is the number sub-combinations of data items involved in the evaluation; and","pis the privacy value for the j-th sub-combination of data items where j=1 . . . k.","wis the weight factor for the j-th sub-combination of data items where j=1 . . . n.","Instead of or in addition to employing weight factors on individual items, the evaluated result itself may have a weight applied thereto, which can be expressed as follows: \n\n\nwhere:\n","wis a weight factor applied to the sum of the privacy values.","This weight factor (w) may also be employed to reflect various factors which may impact user privacy, such as the context of the request. The other equations <2> through <4> may be modified in a similar fashion to incorporate such weight factoring.","In a further example, data items and sub-combinations of data items may have associated therewith one or more qualified privacy attributes. A privacy indication may be evaluated using various algorithms or techniques assessing such qualified attributes. For instance, the privacy indication may be the highest privacy level of a data item in a set of data items. That is, if data item A and data item B have attributes LOW and MEDIUM, the resulting privacy indication would be MEDIUM. However, as discussed above, sub-combinations may also implicate higher privacy concerns. The combination of data items A and B may have an attribute of HIGH. Accordingly, the resulting privacy indication would be HIGH.","Other techniques may also be employed to evaluate qualified attributes to reflect different privacy levels implicated by provision of different combinations of data items. Further, the privacy attributes and\/or privacy indications may be classified in a different form, such as LEVEL , LEVEL , or YES, NO, or RESTRICTED, UNRESTRICTED, etc.","The implementation of the system may also be performed with or without direct user input or intervention, such as automatically, semi-automatically or manually. An example 4 is provided below showing how user device  and\/or trusted party  may be configured to perform in such modes of operation according to the evaluation result.","While the above describes examples of evaluating privacy indication, these evaluation techniques, as in examples 1 through 3, may also be employed to evaluate and determine a reward or benefit indication.","In this example, various threshold levels are employed to ascertain whether to respond to a requesting party automatically without user input or with user input. Depending on the evaluated privacy indication, user device  and\/or trusted party  may provide the user with the ability to edit data items to be evaluated, or to provide some or all or none of the requested data items.","For example, a response to a request can be given automatically if the evaluated privacy index is within prescribed limits. Such limits may further be dependent on various factors, such as the requesting party, and\/or on the purpose of the request, and\/or the reliability of the requester.","In one example, user device  and\/or trusted party  may be configured (1) to provide data items to a requesting party without outputting an evaluation analyses or automatically if the evaluated privacy indication satisfies a first threshold (e.g., privacy indication<50 or LOW); to output the privacy indication along with other relevant information associated with the evaluation if the evaluated privacy indication satisfies a second threshold (e.g., 50<privacy indication<100 or privacy=MEDIUM) and to allow the user to determine whether to provide data items to the requesting party; or (3) to output the privacy indication or the like with other relevant information associated with the evaluation if the evaluated privacy indication satisfies a third threshold (e.g., privacy indication>100 or privacy indication=HIGH) and to allow the user to modify or edit the combination of data items for further evaluation or provide none of the requested data items.","This example is simply provided to show that various processes involved in the provision of user information may be performed automatically or semi-automatically or manually via user device  and\/or trusted party , as desired.","While various embodiments of the present invention have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation. It will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art that various changes in form and detail can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
