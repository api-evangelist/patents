title: Sensor system for construction equipment having wireless sonic sensor system
abstract: A sensor system for road construction equipment. The system includes a first conveyor for transporting material to a first auger that is positioned to receive the material. A first feeder sensor associated with the first conveyor is in over-the-air communication with a receiver to communicate the height of a material on the conveyor such that a master controller that is electrically connected to the receiver can regulate the amount of flow of material to the first conveyor.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This invention relates to construction equipment. More specifically, this invention relates to wireless sonic auger and feeder systems for road construction equipment.","In the road construction arts sonic auger and sonic feeders are placed in close proximity to people and other moving construction vehicles. Cables are utilized for these sensors including connectors for the cables where the cables and connectors often get damaged because of the close proximity to traffic and due to activity at busy construction sites. In addition, the sensor cable must be connected to the machine's control system and the body of the machine which additionally exposes the cables to damage.","Thus a need in the art exists for eliminating the cables of the sensors at a construction site. Further, a need exists for providing additional safety and efficiency at sites related to using sensors.","Thus, a principal object of the present invention is to utilize wireless sensors for construction equipment.","Yet another object of the present invention is to improve the efficiency of sensors on construction equipment. These and other objects, features, and advantages will become apparent from the specification and claims.","A sensor system for road construction equipment that has a first conveyor for transporting material to a first auger that is positioned to receive the material from the first conveyor. A first feeder sensor is associated with the first conveyor and has a transceiver. A receiver at the construction equipment has a first transceiver that is in over-the-air communication with the first feeder sensor to receive information from the transceiver of the first feeder sensor. A master controller is electrically connected to the receiver in order to receive communication from the receiver to control the flow of material onto the first conveyor.","The figures show a sensor system  utilized in association with construction equipment  that in a preferred embodiment is a material hopper utilized on a road construction work site. The construction equipment  includes a master controller  with machine control software that can have a manual user interface . The machine control software can include application programming interface that electrically communicates with a CAN BUS or the software  of a receiver  that is associated with the construction equipment . Thus, an electrical connection is provided between the receiver  and master controller  such that information including data can be transferred between the receiver  and master controller .","The receiver  additionally has first and second transceivers  and  for providing radio transmissions where in a preferred embodiment the transceivers ,  are 802.15.4 wireless radio links. In addition, by having first and second transceivers ,  instead of just a single transceiver the sensor system's bandwidth is increased, allowing the second transceiver  to scan radio channels for activity.","An opening  is disposed within the construction equipment  and is adjacent conveying equipment  that conveys materials  onto first and second conveyors or feeders  and  that are adjacent the opening  and receive the material . The first and second feeders ,  have a first feeder sensor  and second feeder sensor  respectively where the first feeder sensor  is associated with and adjacent the first feeder  and the second feeder sensor  is associated with and adjacent the second feeder . In a preferred embodiment each of the first and second feeder sensors ,  are sonic sensors. In addition, each of the first and second feeder sensors ,  have transceivers  that provide over-the-air communication with the first transceiver  of the receiver . Thus, the transceivers  of the sensors ,  have bi-directional communication with the first transceiver  of the receiver .","First and second augers  and  are presented adjacent the first and second feeders ,  such that the first auger receives material  conveyed across the first feeder  and the second auger  receives material  conveyed across the second feeder . To that end, the first and second augers ,  are positioned perpendicular to the first and second feeders ,  to move material  transversely. The first auger  has a first auger sensor  associated therewith while the second auger  has a second auger sensor  associated therewith where in a preferred embodiment the first and second auger sensors ,  are sonic sensors.","Each of the first and second auger sensors ,  have transceivers  that allow over-the-air communication with the first transceiver  of the receiver . Thus, similar to the first and second feeder sensors ,  the first and second auger sensors ,  provide a communication path in order to communicate information including data related to the first and second augers ,  to the receiver  that then communicates such information to the master controller  to control the flow of material  being placed on the first and second feeders , .","In operation, the receiver  transmit a time triggered time protocol beacon at time=zero, T, as shown in . Each one of the sensors, , , , and  responds with its positioning and status data in its respective time slot. Specifically, the sensors , ,  and  indicate the amount and height of material  at the respective locations. Simultaneously the second transceiver  of the receiver  can be used to collect wireless sensor data and to scan all radio channels to enable the receiver  to proactively command the sensors , , , and  to switch to a radio channel that has a minimum amount of traffic or less traffic than the current channel being utilized.","The receiver  then sorts the sensor data into a CAN message that is transmitted over the machine controlled CAN bus  to the master controller  which then controls the amount of material  provided to the first and second feeders  and . In an alternative embodiment the master controller  determines the elevation, and\/or the steering of the construction equipment . Specifically, the master controller  controls and automates the construction equipment  to accomplish a desired task. In addition, the master controller  can also poll the receiver status, and can poll sensor status. Additionally, the master controller  can be manually set to different channels using interface .","Thus provided is a sensing system  that is utilized on construction equipment  such as feeders ,  and augers ,  in order to automatically control the flow of material  for construction machines by sensing the height of the material and sending the height measurement back to the master controller  which in turn regulates the flow of material . This can be done for any type of construction including road construction and preferably road building applications. Thus, the sensing system  presents wireless sonic auger and sonic feeder sensors with the capability to read the multiple wireless sensors at a very high data rate through a time triggered custom wireless protocol. Additionally presented is the capability to actively switch to load traffic channels in a direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) system in a road construction environment. Thus, cables can be eliminated reducing the risks associated with the use of cables and at the very least all of the stated objective have been met.","It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other various modifications could be made to the device without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. All such modifications and changes fall within the scope of the claims and are intended to be covered thereby."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
