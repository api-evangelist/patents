title: Gyroscope stabilizer filter
abstract: A method, a filtering module, and a computer-readable medium are configured to filter measurements acquired in a sensor reference system. Filtered measurements of motion sensors and a magnetometer attached to the device may then be used to determine orientation of a device in a non-inertial reference system. The measurements are filtered in a reference system, whose position relative to the sensor system can be calculated, and in which gravity and Earth's magnetic field have substantially constant direction and magnitude during the filtering window.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present inventions generally relate to methods and devices for filtering measurements acquired in a sensor reference system.","As described in WO 2012\/044964, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, \u201csensor fusion\u201d is a term covering methods that determine the angular position of a device in an Earth-type reference system based on measurements of a magnetometer and motion sensors attached to the device.","An Earth-type reference system is a frame in which gravity and Earth's magnetic field have fixed known directions. For example, Earth frame, which is defined as having its x-axis pointing north and its z-axis pointing down in gravity's direction (thereby its y-axis pointing east), is an Earth-type reference system.","A sensor reference system is a frame whose axes are defined relative to the rigid body of a device on which the sensors are mounted. Since the device is changing its position and orientation, gravity and Earth's magnetic field do not have fixed and\/or known directions in the sensor reference system. The angular position (orientation) of the device in a target (e.g., Earth-type) reference system determines a transformation (i.e., rotations) from the sensor reference system into the target reference system.","Conventionally, sensor measurements are acquired and then filtered in the sensor reference system to remove jitter (insignificant fluctuations) and to separate time-dependent portions from stable portions thereof (e.g., to separate linear acceleration from gravity). That is, since the sensor fusion's goal is to determine a device's orientation and not a device's position, the focus is on extracting time-independent gravity from the accelerometer signal and not on time-dependent linear acceleration other than gravity. However, filtering sensor measurements in the sensor reference system leads to very poor results when the device (and thus the sensor reference system) is moving and changing its angular position.","A superior sensor fusion result would be achieved if the sensor measurements were filtered in the Earth-type reference system, where gravity and magnetic field directions are known. In this case, a filtered accelerometer measurement would match gravity, and a filtered magnetometer measurement would match the Earth's magnetic field. Since portions of the measurements (i.e., linear acceleration from the accelerometer signal and magnetic interference effects from the magnetometer signal) filtered out vary over time and depend on the device's motion, a low-frequency pass filter could be used to remove these portions of the sensor signals transformed in the Earth-type reference system, while keeping the desired (time-invariant or low-frequency varying) portions. However, since the angular position of the sensor reference system with respect to the Earth-type reference system is not known, the measurement cannot be transformed from the sensor reference system in the Earth-type reference system. Therefore, this ideal manner of filtering signals (i.e., in the Earth-type reference system) cannot be implemented.","Accordingly, it is desirable to provide methods for filtering sensor signals in a reference system whose position relative to the sensor reference system is known and in which the advantages of filtering in an Earth-type reference system are preserved.","Method and devices according to various embodiments perform filtering of sensor signals in a reference system (gyroscope reference system) different from the sensor reference system. In this gyroscope reference system, time-invariant portions of sensor signals can be separated from time-varying portions thereof more reliably than in the sensor reference system because gravity and Earth's magnetic field directions are fixed within the filtering window. One or more measurements are rotated in the gyroscope reference system, then filtered, and then rotated back into the sensor reference system. If the measurements were associated with acceleration or magnetic field, the filtered and rotated back measurements may be used as inputs to a sensor fusion method to determine the device's orientation in a non-inertial (Earth-type) reference system. The title \u201cgyroscope stabilizer filter\u201d indicates that filtering measurements in the gyroscope reference system has a stabilizing effect, for example, for the sensor fusion output. Sensor fusion with a gyroscope stabilizer filter yields better results than sensor fusion using conventional filtering in the sensor's reference system, because sensor fusion receives more accurate inputs.","According to one embodiment, there is a method for filtering a measurement acquired in a sensor reference system. The method includes determining a transformation from a sensor reference system to a gyroscope reference system using a previous angular position of the gyroscope reference system in the sensor reference system, and an angular velocity measured in the sensor reference system. The method further includes rotating at least one measurement from the sensor reference system to the gyroscope reference system using the transformation. The method also includes filtering the rotated at least one measurement to remove at least a high-frequency time-dependent portion thereof. The method then includes rotating the filtered at least one measurement back into the sensor reference system.","According to another embodiment, there is a computer-readable medium storing executable codes which when performed by a computer make the computer perform a method for filtering a measurement acquired in a sensor reference system. The method includes determining a transformation from a sensor reference system to a gyroscope reference system using a previous angular position of the gyroscope reference system in the sensor reference system, and an angular velocity measured in the sensor reference system. The method further includes rotating at least one measurement from the sensor reference system to the gyroscope reference system using the transformation. The method also includes filtering the rotated at least one measurement to remove at least a high-frequency time-dependent portion thereof. The method then includes rotating the filtered at least one measurement back into the sensor reference system.","According to yet another embodiment, there is a filtering module including a first input, a second input, an integration unit, a first rotation unit, a filter and a second rotation unit. The first input is configured to receive a current value of an angular velocity of a device. The second input is configured to receive a measurement of acceleration or a magnetic field from sensors mounted on the device. The integration unit is configured to receive the angular velocity and to determine a transformation to be applied to the received measurement. The first rotation unit is configured to receive the transformation and to apply the transformation to the received measurement. The filter is configured to modify the transformed measurement, so that the modified measurement corresponds to a substantially time-independent portion. The second rotation unit is configured to receive the transformation, to apply an inverse of the transformation to the modified measurement and to output a result thereof.","According to another embodiment, there is a method for filtering a measurement acquired in a sensor reference system. The method includes determining a transformation from a sensor reference system to an estimated Earth-type reference system using a fusion quaternion determined by applying a fusion method to a set of measurements previously acquired in the sensor reference system and integrating an angular velocity measured in the sensor reference system. The method further includes rotating at least one measurement from the sensor reference system to the estimated Earth-type reference system using the transformation. The method also includes filtering the rotated at least one measurement to remove a high-frequency time-dependent portion thereof, and rotating the filtered at least one measurement back into the sensor reference system.","The following description of the exemplary embodiments refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings identify the same or similar elements. The following detailed description does not limit the invention. The following embodiments are discussed, for simplicity, with regard to the terminology of sensor fusion methods in which a magnetometer and motion sensors are used to determine angular position of a device carrying them.","Reference throughout the specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure or characteristic described in connection with an embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearance of the phrases \u201cin one embodiment\u201d or \u201cin an embodiment\u201d in various places throughout the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Further, the particular features, structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.","Motion sensors attached to a device (e.g., a hand-held controller) measure motion-related quantities (e.g., angular velocity, acceleration) in a sensor reference system defined relative to the device's rigid body. The measured acceleration includes gravity and 3D linear acceleration. The magnetic field measured by a magnetometer attached to the device (i.e., in the sensor's reference system) includes Earth's magnetic field, other fields and\/or interference effects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["an Earth-type reference system (for simplicity, labeled \u201cEarth Frame,\u201d but this label is not limiting its axis definitions to x-axis pointing north and z-axis pointing down in gravity's direction),","a reference system that approximates the Earth-type reference system (labeled \u201cEstimated Earth Frame\u201d),","a sensor reference system (labeled \u201cSensor Frame\u201d) defined relative to the device's rigid body; and","a reference system (labeled \u201cGyroscope Frame\u201d) in which measurement filtering is performed according to various embodiments."]}}}},"The transition from one reference system to another includes one or more rotations corresponding to the angular position of one reference system relative to the other reference system. The angular position may be expressed in different ways, the most commonly used being Euler angles, rotation matrices, or a quaternion. In this document, the angular position of the device is expressed using a quaternion, but this manner of expressing angular positions should not be construed as a limitation. Thus, to convert (i.e., rotate) a measurement from one reference system to another reference system, it is enough to know a quatern ion representing the angular position of one reference system relative to the other reference system.","Sensors (e.g., an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a magnetometer) attached to the device acquire measurements in the sensor reference system. Conversion from the sensor reference system to the Earth-type reference system would require knowledge of a quaternion q, which is not known. The sensor fusion method described in WO 2012\/044964 uses sensor measurements to determine a fusion quaternion q, which enables conversion from the sensor reference system to the reference system that is close to the Earth-type reference system. This reference system that approximates the Earth-type reference system differs from the actual Earth-type reference system due to estimation error.","A reference system used for signal filtering is called \u201cgyroscope reference system\u201d because angular velocity often measured using a gyroscope is used to determine a transformation from the sensor reference system to this reference system. However, the word \u201cgyroscope\u201d is merely a label and does not imply that the angular velocity has to be measured using a gyroscope or any other similar limitation.","The gyroscope reference system is similar to the actual Earth-type reference system in that the gravity and Earth's magnetic field directions are substantially constant within the filtering window, but it differs from the Earth-type reference system because the gravity and Earth's magnetic field directions are not known. The advantage of this gyroscope reference system is that the quaternion qrepresenting the current angular position between the sensor reference system and the gyroscope reference system can be calculated by integrating the angular velocity starting from the previous angular position. An initial angular position may be arbitrarily chosen, for example, the gyroscope reference system may coincide with the sensor reference system at an initial instance.","If the angular velocity measurement and the integration were error-free, then the gravity and Earth's magnetic field directions in the gyroscope reference system would be time-independent. However, even if, in practice finding a current angular position is not error-free making the gyroscope reference system to drift relative to the actual Earth-type reference frame, such a drift is slow or small so that the gravity and Earth's magnetic field directions in the gyroscope reference system may be considered as being \u201cfixed\u201d (time-invariant) within the filtering window. Therefore, the time-independent portion of the measurement corresponding to gravity or Earth's magnetic field can be better separated in this gyroscope reference system than in the sensor reference frame, which makes filtering in the gyroscope reference system to provide a similar advantage to filtering in the Earth-type reference frame.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","210"],"sub":["g,n-1 ","n ","g,n ","g,n","g,n-1","\u03c9","\u03c9"],"br":[{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["q","=q","\u2295q"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0034"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["q","\u03c9"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":",","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"T","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mover":{"mi":["\u03c9","_"]},"mi":"n"}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"Method  then includes rotating at least one measurement v(i.e., a vector quantity) from the sensor reference system to the gyroscope reference system using the transformation, at S.
