title: Dual-tone multi-frequency signal classification
abstract: Various embodiments associated with signal classification are described. A repeating signal can be partially corrupted and therefore a receiver can obtain an incomplete signal. In one example, the incomplete signal can have discontinuous unobstructed segments. In order for the receiver to understand the contents of the signal, the receiver can identify repeated information in the discontinuous unobstructed segments. This repeated information can be processed to determine content of the signal. In one embodiment, the signal is a dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signal. The receiver can process the content of the DTMF, such as by employing a set of high and low band pass filters, and can identify a high and low frequency of the DTMF. With the high and low frequencies identified, the receiver can access a look-up table and identify a character indicated by the high and low frequency. The receiver can then use or send out the identified character.

A receiver that receives the communication signal, whether the receiver is a receiver intended by the transmitter or not, can attempt to process the communication signal. However, if at least some information about the communication signal is not known to the receiver, then processing the communication signal can be difficult and ultimately it can be difficult to use the content of the communication signal.","A system is disclosed comprising a high frequency identification component configured to identify a high frequency of a dual-tone multi-frequency signal. The system also comprises a low frequency identification component configured to identify a low frequency of the dual-tone multi-frequency signal. The system further comprises a classification component configured to determine a classification of the dual-tone multi-frequency signal based, at least in part, on the high frequency and a low frequency. In addition, the system comprises a non-transitory computer-readable medium configured to retain an information set that pertains to operation of the high frequency identification component, the low frequency identification component, the classification component, or a combination thereof.","A system is disclosed comprising a high frequency identification component configured to identify and rank, by likelihood, potential high frequency values of a dual-tone multi-frequency signal. The system also comprises a low frequency identification component configured to identify and rank, by likelihood, potential low frequency values of the dual-tone multi-frequency signal. In addition, the system comprises a classification component configured to produce a classification scheme of the dual-tone multi-frequency signal based, at least in part, on ranks of the potential high frequency values and based, at least in part, on ranks of the potential low frequency values. Further, the system comprises a processor configured to execute at least one instruction that pertains to operation of the high frequency identification component, the low frequency identification component, the classification component, or a combination thereof.","A system comprising a processor and a non-transitory computer-readable medium configured to store processor-executable instructions that when executed by a processor cause the processor to perform a method is described. The method comprises identifying unobstructed segments of a dual-tone multi-frequency signal, where the unobstructed segments are discontinuous from one another. In addition, the method comprises identifying a high frequency of the dual-tone multi-frequency signal through use of the unobstructed segments. Also, the method comprises identifying a low frequency of the dual-tone multi-frequency signal through use of the unobstructed segments. The method additionally comprises determining a classification of the dual-tone multi-frequency signal based, at least in part, on the high frequency and a low frequency.","A repeating signal can be partially corrupted and therefore a receiver, that comprises hardware, can obtain an incomplete signal. In one example, the incomplete signal can have discontinuous unobstructed segments. In order for the receiver to understand the type of the signal, the receiver can identify repeated information in the discontinuous unobstructed segments. This repeated information can be processed to determine the type of the signal.","In one embodiment, the signal is a dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signal. The receiver can process the content of the DTMF, such as by employing a set of high and low band pass filters, and can identify a high and low frequency of the DTMF. With the high and low frequencies identified, the receiver can access a look-up table and identify a character indicated by the high and low frequency. The receiver can then use or send out the identified character.","Aspects disclosed herein can be used in decoding the DTMF signal. A DTMF signal can be used in telephone signaling over a telephone line or other medium in a voice-frequency band to a call switching center, for signaling internal to a telephone network, for cable television broadcasters to indicate start and stop times of local commercial insertion points during station breaks for the benefit of cable companies, and other applications.","A DTMF signal can be decoded by a Goertzel algorithm and some DTMF receivers can reliably detect DTMF as short as 45 milliseconds for continuous signal. However, when the signal transmitted in a strong fading or interfering environment, the signal propagation is subjected to periodic obstructions. As a result, only a few discontinuous segments of the signal, each of a length, such as, and spaced seconds apart, are usable at the receiver. When the time interval of the signal segment is much shorter than 45 milliseconds, the DTMF tones may not be able to be decoded through use of the Goertzel algorithm and therefore other aspects can be practiced to recover the DTMF from the non-continuous signal segments.","A DTMF signal x(t) can be described as\n\n()=cos(2\u03c0+\u03a6)+cos(2\u03c0+\u03c6)\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere u is the low frequency chosen from: 697 Hz, 770 Hz, 852 Hz, and 941 Hz, and v is the high frequency chosen from: 1209 Hz, 1336 Hz, 1477 Hz, and 1633 Hz, a and b are amplitudes, and \u03a6 and \u03c6 are initial phases.\n","The following includes definitions of selected terms employed herein.

For example, the low frequency identification component  can identify the low frequency as 697 Hz while the high frequency identification component  can identify the high frequency as 1633 Hz. Based on these two frequencies, the classification component  can determine that the DTMF signal is signifying a character of \u2018A\u2019 and send an output that the character is \u2018A.\u2019","In one example, the low frequency and high frequency do not match up directly with values of the example look-up table. In one example, the low frequency can be 772 Hz and the high frequency can be 1625 Hz. Since these two frequencies are relatively close to 770 Hz and 1633 Hz, the classification component  can determine that the DTMF signal is signifying a character of \u2018B.\u2019","In one example, the low frequency and high frequency do not match up directly with values of the example look-up table and are less close to actual values. For example the low frequency can be 900 Hz and the high frequency can be 1631 Hz. The classification component  can determine that the classification is two potential classifications \u2018C\u2019 since 900 Hz is relatively close to 852 Hz and \u2018D\u2019 since 900 Hz is relatively close to 941 Hz yet neither 852 Hz nor 941 Hz are particularly close to 900 Hz. With this situation, the classification can comprise two outcomes, \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018D.\u2019 As part of the classification, the classification component  can include likelihood percentages on how likely \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019 are to being correct such as \u2018C\u2019 having a higher percentage than \u2018D\u2019 since 941 Hz is closer to 900 Hz then 852 Hz is to 900 Hz. These likelihood percentages can be outputted as part of the classification. While this example shows that the low frequency is not particularly close to an actual value one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the high frequency can also not be particularly close independent of closeness of the low frequency (e.g. just the high frequency is not particularly close or both the high and low frequencies are not particularly close).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","110","120","130","140","210","210","110","120","210","110","120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","110","120","130","140","310","320","310","320","110","120"]},"The DTMF signal received by the reception component  can have an obstructed portion and an unobstructed portion.

Thus, the confidence of the classification may also be relatively low. When the confidence is relatively low a device that uses the classification could potentially function with incorrect information. Therefore, the system  can function such that the classification is outputted (e.g., made available to the device, sent to the device, etc.) when the threshold is met (e.g., threshold reached, threshold exceeded, etc.). When the threshold is not met an error message can be emitted (e.g., a request sent to a transmitter to resend the DTMF signal, a notice to the device that the classification is unknown, etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["500","510","130","520","510","110","1","120","510","520","130","520","520","520","130"]},"Returning to the example above with the discussion of , the look-up table can be used to identify content of the DTMF signal. As discussed, the high frequency and\/or the low frequency can fall in between two frequencies of the look-up table. The identification component  can rank the likelihood of low candidate frequencies of the look-up table (697 Hz, 770 Hz, 852 Hz, and 941 Hz) and high candidate frequencies of the look-up table (1209 Hz, 1336 Hz, 1477 Hz, and 1633 Hz). Based on these ranks the classification scheme can be determined and outputted.","In one example, the low frequency can be 940 Hz and the high frequency can be 1420 Hz. The identification component  can evaluate the low frequency and the high frequency against the look-up table. Based on this the identification component  can rank (e.g., place in order, assign likelihood percentages, etc.) the low frequency and the high frequency. In this example, since the low frequency is almost equal to 941 Hz, the identification component  can order 940 Hz first with a high likelihood and 852 Hz, 770 Hz, and 697 Hz can be ranked as second, third and fourth respectively with the low likelihoods. Since the high frequency is closer to 1477 Hz than 1336 Hz, then 1477 Hz can be ranked first, with 1336 Hz being ranked second, 1209 Hz third, and 1633 Hz fourth. However, since the high frequency is not extremely close to 1336 Hz or 1477 Hz likelihood percentages of x % and y % can be assigned to 1336 Hz and 1477 Hz respectively. These likelihood percentages are numbers less than about 100%, but greater than 0%. The reason y % is greater than x % is because 1420 Hz is closer to 1477 Hz than 1336 Hz. The classification component  can access this information and determine the classification scheme from this information. In one example, the classification scheme can be such that \u2018#\u2019 is a most likely character since the greatest percentages are for 941 Hz and 1477 Hz and that \u20180\u2019 is also a likely character since 941 Hz and 1336 Hz have high percentages. These characters can also be given percentages of likelihood (e.g., y % and x % since they share the same low frequency). The classification scheme can include the most likely character, characters that have likelihoods that meet a threshold, a set number of characters, characters with a likelihood greater than about 0%, etc. The classification component  can output the classification scheme to the device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","510","130","520","610","610"]},"Returning to the example where the low frequency can be 940 Hz and the high frequency can be 1420 Hz.

Aspects can be practiced with or without band pass filters. In this example, band pass filters are not used. The lower frequency convolution result set is illustrated in  and shows that the maximum convolution value is corresponding to 697 Hz and the higher frequency convolution result set is illustrated at  and shows that the maximum convolution value is corresponding to 1477 Hz. Therefore, 697 Hz is chosen as the lower frequency, 1477 Hz is chosen as the higher frequency, and the DTMF key \u201c3\u201d is decoded (e.g., through comparison with a look-up table). This example demonstrates that discontinued small segments can be utilized in recovering the missing information for detecting the frequencies and decoding the DTMF signal.","Aspects disclosed herein can be practiced in various applications.
