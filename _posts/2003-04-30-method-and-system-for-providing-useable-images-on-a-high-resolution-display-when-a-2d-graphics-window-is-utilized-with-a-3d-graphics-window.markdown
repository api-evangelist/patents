{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to display technology and more particularly to providing useable images when 3D graphics windows are utilized with 2D graphics windows in a high resolution display.","Based on the improvement of display resolution and display density, it is possible to render the detail of drawing objects in a 3D graphics window. Accordingly, a typical display resolution is 100 pixels per inch, however a high resolution display has a resolution as high as 200 pixels per inch. In so doing, it is possible to provide fine detail in images. For example, the detail of light reflection on high resolution display can be shown, which can avoid the illusion made by Gouraud shading. On the other hand, the usage of a high resolution display causes usability problems when the icons in the 2D graphics window are not properly scaled. To illustrate this problem in more detail refer now to .  illustrates a CAD application  in which the blueprint of a car  is shown in conjunction with a toolbar  on the display.","In this example, the user can access the detail of the blueprint of a car  in the 3D graphics window using the high-resolution display. On the other hand, the icon and text in the toolbar  is rendered too small to manipulate. This is because the software application is designed to be able to zoom and pan freely in the 3D graphics windows but the same software specifies the text height of the menu font by, pixel count in 2D graphics window. In so doing, the software makes the physical size of the fonts too small to be manipulated.","In order to resolve this problem, the software has to specify the size of objects, by physical dimension such as mm, not by pixel count. Microsoft Windows or OpenGL, which are Widely used today, do not specify the physical dimension. Accordingly, the design of the software would have to change to specify the all GUI related objects, which is not practical or cost effective solution.","Accordingly, what is needed is a system and method for allowing high-resolution display to provide both a 3D graphics window at its highest resolution while allowing icons or fonts on a 2D graphics window on the same display to be manipulatable without changing the design of standard software applications. The present invention addresses such a need.","A graphics pipeline for use with a high resolution display is disclosed. The graphics pipeline comprises a frame buffer configuration. The frame buffer configuration includes a first mode area and a second mode area. The graphics pipeline further includes a display pipeline for obtaining data from the frame buffer configuration. The display pipeline includes a controller. The controller provides pixels from the first mode area to the display as is. Finally, the controller expands pixels from the second mode area and provides the expanded pixels to the display.","Accordingly, a system and method in accordance with the present invention solves the GUI problem (small icon and small menu text) of high resolution display by allowing the 3D Graphics Window to display fine pitch pictures while being able to display images in the 2D graphics window in a useable form. The system and method in accordance with the present invention does not depend on the types of drawing objects (line or surface), drawing order, and crossover.","The present invention relates generally to display technology and more particularly to providing useable images when 3D graphics windows are utilized with 2D graphics windows in a high resolution display. The following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and is provided in the context of a patent application and its requirements. Various modifications to the preferred embodiment and the generic principles and features described herein will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiment shown but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features described herein.","A system and method in accordance with the present invention takes advantage of the fact that application software uses one application programming interface (API) such as the OpenGL API in a 3D Graphics window while it uses a different API such as the Microsoft Windows API in a 2D Graphics windows to construct graphics user interface, such as menu and icon. In this case, each window's frame buffer configuration on a graphics card is different based on what graphics API the application uses. The present invention can be utilized advantageously using a super sample anti-aliasing (SSAA) graphics pipeline.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","100","102","104","102","104","106","108","106","110","108","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["106","100"]},"SSAA has become widely available on high end graphics cards. This technology (1) prepares multiple sub pixels for a single displayable pixel in a frame buffer and draws objects for the subpixels, and (2) lets CRTC scan the frame buffer and displays a non SSAA pixel as it was but displays averaged sub pixel values for a SSAA pixel.","In a system and method in accordance with the present invention SSAA is utilized in different manner. Therefore a system and method in accordance with the present invention (1) allocates multiple subpixels in a single pixel on a 3D graphics window (2) expands (to zoom) the color information of 2D graphics Window pixel when the CRTC creates its images, and (3) displays the color information of 3D graphics window subpixel as is.","Accordingly, a system and method in accordance with the present invention solves the GUI problem (small icon and small menu text) of high resolution display by allowing the 3D graphics window to display fine pitch pictures while being able to display images in the 2D graphics window in a useable form. The system and method in accordance does not depend on the types of drawing objects (line or surface), drawing order, and crossover.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"In a preferred embodiment, the graphics pipeline will program the CRTC to configure a subpixel count resolution. The CRTC will also be programmed to display the subpixels as is. The CRTC will display the 2D graphics in expanded form at a ratio of subpixels per pixel (in case of 4 subpixels per single pixel, the pixel will be expanded as \u00d72 (width) and \u00d72 (height).  shows clearly the differences between the conventional super sampling frame buffer configuration versus the under sampling frame buffer configuration in accordance with the present invention.","The following sections will describe a detailed implementation of a system and method in accordance with the present invention, however, the present invention is not restricted to this implementation and other implementations could be utilized and they would be within the spirit and scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["202","204","202","204","202","204","202","204"]},"Now, first consider the case scanning the pixels of R, R, R, U U, U. R, R, R indicate the pixels that are configured as being within the 2D graphics window and U, U, U indicate the pixels that are configured as being within the 3D graphics window. A set zoom factor is set as 2\u00d71 (twice in width, as it is for height) for R, R, R pixel utilizing a conventional zoom and pan function of graphics card. When a CRTC scans pixels R, R, R, it will generate the display signal as R R, R, R, R, and R. Now, since two CRTCs  and  now scan the same frame buffer, R, R, R pixels in the frame buffer will create display signals as:\n\n","On the other hand, in order to scan pixels in 3D Graphics window, a subpixel is selected from a pixel instead of averaging subpixels (subpixel selector).","The odd line CRTC  is programmed to select and to display the first subpixel and the second subpixel, and the even line CRTC  is also programmed to select and to display the third subpixel and the fourth subpixel Then, when odd line CRTC  scans U, U, U, it will display U-S, U-S, U-S, U-S, U-S, U-S and when even line CRTC  scans U, U, U, it will display U-S, U-S, U-S, U-S, U-S, and U-S. The programming can be performed in a variety of ways and they would be within the spirit and scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["14","12"]},"Accordingly, a system and method in accordance with the present invention solves the GUI problem (small icon and small menu text) of high resolution display by allowing the 3D graphics window to display fine pitch pictures while being able to display images in the 2D graphics window in a useable form.
