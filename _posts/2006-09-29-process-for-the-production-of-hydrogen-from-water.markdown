title: Process for the production of hydrogen from water
abstract: A method and device for the production of hydrogen from water and electricity using an active metal alloy. The active metal alloy reacts with water producing hydrogen and a metal hydroxide. The metal hydroxide is consumed, restoring the active metal alloy, by applying a voltage between the active metal alloy and the metal hydroxide. As the process is sustainable, only water and electricity is required to sustain the reaction generating hydrogen.

The idea of a fuel cell, able to convert hydrogen into water and electricity, has been around for over a century. The fuel cell however, has been ineffective as a viable commercial power source because of inefficiencies in the production of hydrogen. Hydrogen can be produced by many different methods. Common methods of producing hydrogen are steam reformation (SR), highly reactive metals, reactive metals, electrolysis, and high temperature electrolysis (HTE).","Steam reformation (SR) is believed to be the most economical and commercially viable process that is presently available. At high temperatures (700-1100\u00b0 C.) and in the presence of a metal-based catalyst, steam reacts with a hydrocarbon, such as methane, to yield carbon monoxide and hydrogen. For most hydrocarbons, including methane, temperatures in excess of 700\u00b0 C. are necessary. Carbon monoxide produced in the SR reaction is poisonous to most fuel cells. The carbon monoxide may be processed in a water gas shift reaction (WGS), an organic reaction which combines carbon monoxide with steam to produce hydrogen. Unfortunately, the WGS does not consume all the carbon monoxide requiring the fuel cell to be periodically cleaned. The carbon monoxide can also be partially removed by scrubbing or pressure swing adsorption, both of which are costly.","Highly reactive metals may also be used to produce hydrogen from water. Examples of such metals include: lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), cesium (Cs), francium (Fr), beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), radium (Ra), aluminum (Al), silicon (Si), phosphorus, (P), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), yttrium (Y), zirconium (Zr), niobium (Nb), lanthanum (La), hafnium (Hf), tantalum (Ta) and gallium (Ga). These metals oxidize in the presence of water creating hydrogen. Unfortunately they cannot be efficiently reduced back to the original metal.","Reactive metals have a reactivity less than the highly reactive metals, but are much more capable of being reduced back to the original metal once oxidized. Examples of reactive metals include: germanium (Ge), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo), indium (In), tin (Sn), cobalt (Co) and antimony (Sb). The reduction\/oxidation of iron was used as the primary industrial method for manufacturing hydrogen during the 19and early 20centuries. At elevated temperatures, iron strips oxygen from water, leaving pure hydrogen. Excess water is required to maximize hydrogen production from a given amount of iron. After the hydrogen is produced, excess water is condensed leaving an uncontaminated hydrogen gas steam. The steam reduction\/iron oxidation process produces hydrogen and wustite (FeO) and\/or magnetite (FeO). To regenerate the iron metal, carbon monoxide or carbon is used to capture the oxygen from the iron oxide, forming iron metal and carbon monoxide (CO) or carbon dioxide (CO). Another method of reducing the iron oxide is smelting the iron oxide, which requires high temperature due to the high melting point of iron (1538\u00b0 C.). Unfortunately, both these methods are inefficient and kinetically difficult.","Electrolysis is a simple way of producing hydrogen. In electrolysis, an electrical current is applied between a pair of inert electrodes immersed in water. The amount of electrical energy that must be used equals the change in Gibbs free energy of the reaction plus the losses in the system. The losses can (theoretically) be arbitrarily close to zero, so the maximum thermodynamic efficiency equals the Gibbs free energy change of the reaction divided by the enthalpy change.","High temperature electrolysis (HTE) may also be used to produce hydrogen at as high as twice the efficiently of simple room temperature electrolysis. HTE is more efficient than simple room temperature electrolysis because some of the energy is supplied as heat, which is cheaper than electricity, and because the electrolysis reaction is more efficient at higher temperatures. In fact, at 2500\u00b0 C., an electrical current is unnecessary because water breaks down to hydrogen and oxygen through thermolysis. However, such temperatures are impractical. Proposed HTE systems operate at 100 to 850\u00b0 C. HTE has been demonstrated in a laboratory, but not on a commercial scale. Unfortunately a significant amount of energy is lost in HTE electrolysis from the high pressures the water must be exposed to in order to maintain it as a liquid.","Therefore there exists a need for a more efficient method of producing hydrogen. An object of the following invention is for a continuous, self-renewing method of producing hydrogen, requiring only a supply of steam and electricity once started. A further object of the following invention is a method of producing hydrogen at temperatures above the boiling point of water, without having to maintain the reaction at higher pressures. Still yet another object of the following invention is a method of producing hydrogen with about a 30% increase in efficiency over HTE.","A method and device for the production of hydrogen from water and electricity using an active metal alloy. An active metal alloy layer is formed at the base of a container and continuously exposed to steam, producing a metal hydroxide layer above the active metal alloy layer, and hydrogen. At the same time, a voltage is continuously applied between the metal hydroxide layer and the active metal alloy layer, causing a reaction consuming the metal hydroxide layer and restoring the active metal alloy layer, while also producing more hydrogen. The hydrogen produced from the active metal alloy layer and the metal hydroxide layer is collected.","A method and device for the production of hydrogen through the employment of water and electricity using an active metal alloy. A liquid active metal alloy is placed in the base of a container forming an active metal alloy layer. The active metal alloy layer is continuously exposed to steam, creating a metal hydroxide, and hydrogen. The metal hydroxide, being less dense than and immiscible with the active metal alloy forms a metal hydroxide layer within the container and above the active metal alloy layer. A voltage is continuously applied to electrodes located in the metal hydroxide layer and the active metal alloy layer causing a reaction consuming the metal hydroxide layer and producing the active metal alloy, oxygen, and additional hydrogen. The active metal alloy replenishes the active metal alloy layer, and the hydrogen is collected by a trapping means.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","1","3","5","7","9","3","5","5","9","7","5","5","7","5","7","2","3"],"br":[{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"sub":["2","2"]},"A voltage source  supplies a voltage across the metal hydroxide layer  and the active metal alloy layer  via a first electrode , and a second electrode  respectively. The second electrode  has an insulator  electrically insulating the second electrode  from the metal hydroxide layer .","Additional hydrogen is generated, from a second (electrochemical) reaction:\n\nKOH+Bi+\u2192K\u2014Bi+\u00bdH+\u00bdO\u2003\u2003(Reaction 2)\n\nat the active metal alloy layer  and the metal hydroxide layer  interface. A voltage is supplied to the active metal alloy layer  via the second electrode , which is submersed through the metal hydroxide layer  in the active metal alloy layer . Oxygen is generated from the second reaction at the end of the first electrode , which is submersed in the metal hydroxide layer . In the preferred embodiment, oxygen produced at the first electrode  is preferably captured and sequestered by a shroud  over the first electrode . Hydrogen produced at the interface of the active metal alloy layer  and the metal hydroxide layer , is preferably captured by a closed vessel  over the container . Some steam will not react with the active metal alloy layer , and will ascend with the hydrogen, preferably into the closed vessel . In the preferred embodiment, the hydrogen and steam captured by the closed vessel  is processed to separate the steam and the hydrogen. Likewise un-reacted steam will ascend into the anode shroud and accompany the evolved oxygen.\n","The container  has a shape whereby the active metal alloy layer  and the metal hydroxide layer  are contained within the container . The container  is made of a material which does not dissolve and is resistant to heat from the active metal alloy layer , metal hydroxide layer , steam from the steam source , and combinations thereof. In the preferred embodiment, the container  is a cylindrical, closed-end tube, made of iron, having an open top, although any shape may be used. In the preferred embodiment, the entire container  or the inside walls of the container  contacted by the metal hydroxide layer  is electrically insulating. Insulating the container  prevents the electrochemical reduction of the active metal in the active metal alloy layer  from occurring away from the interface of the active metal alloy layer  and the metal hydroxide layer .","The active metal alloy layer  contains a combination of an active metal and a diluent. The active metal is a metal that is reactive to water. The diluent is an inert (unreactive) liquid or solvent. The active metal is preferably sodium (Na), potassium (K), lithium (Li), cesium (Cs), calcium (Ca), or combinations thereof. The diluent is preferably bismuth (Bi), lead (Pb), tin (Sn), tellerium (Te), or combinations thereof. The active metal alloy layer , is maintained at a temperature whereby the active metal alloy layer  is a liquid. As a liquid, more of the active metal in the active metal alloy layer  will be able to more readily react with steam. In the preferred embodiment, K, an active metal, is mixed with molten Bi, a diluent, producing Bi dissolved in K and possibly a small amount of KBi (solids). The K, Bi and KBi each react with the steam producing metal hydroxide. Preferably, the Bi and K are mixed at about 700 K (Kelvin), which is above the melting point of KOH and above the liquidus of K-15 mol %\/Bi-85 mol % solution. Preferably, the surface of the metal hydroxide layer  is exposed to a pressure less than about 10 ATM (atmospheres), more preferably the surface of the metal hydroxide layer  is at about atmospheric pressure.","The steam source  produces HO (steam) which is distributed to the active metal alloy layer . Preferably, the steam is distributed via a graphite or metal pipe, more preferably, an iron or low chromium-moly steel pipe. In the preferred embodiment, the steam is distributed via a bent pipe . The bent pipe  is preferably electrically insulated from the metal hydroxide layer . Other distribution means known in the art may also be used, such as a perforated pipe running along the bottom of the container , or perforations in the container  allowing steam to pass through the container , from an outside source. The active metal alloy layer  reacts with the steam raising the temperature (exothermic reaction), and creating hydrogen, and a metal hydroxide which replenishes the metal hydroxide layer . The steam is at a temperature which keeps the active metal alloy layer  as a liquid. Preferably, the steam is at the same temperature as the active metal alloy layer . When the preferred K\u2014Bi active metal alloy is used, the steam is preferably at a temperature of about 700-900 K to keep the K\u2014Bi in liquid form.","The metal hydroxide layer  is a layer having a metal hydroxide produced from the reaction of the active metal alloy layer  and steam from the steam source . In the preferred embodiment, the metal hydroxide layer  is liquid KOH.","The voltage source  is capable of continuously producing a voltage. The voltage source  is electrically connected to the first electrode , preferably by a first connector . The first electrode  is submersed in the metal hydroxide layer  completing the electrical connection between the voltage source  and the metal hydroxide layer . Likewise, the voltage source  is electrically connected to the second electrode , preferably by a second connector . The second electrode  is submersed in the active metal alloy layer  completing the electrical connection between the voltage source  and the active metal alloy layer . In the preferred embodiment, the second electrode  is electrically isolated from the metal hydroxide layer  by the insulator .","The first electrode  is made of an electrically conductive material and electrically connects the voltage source  to the metal hydroxide layer . The first electrode  is made of a material capable of withstanding the temperature of the metal hydroxide layer . Preferably, the first electrode  is made of a material that does not corrode in the metal hydroxide layer . Preferably, the first electrode  is made of platinum, RuO, or other stable, inert, oxygen anodes. More preferably, the first electrode  is made of platinum (Pt).","The second electrode  is made of an electrically conductive material and electrically connects the voltage source  to the active metal alloy layer . Preferably, the second electrode  is a graphite or metal conductor such as low chrome\/moly steel which does not dissolve or corrode in the active metal alloy layer . In the preferred embodiment, the second electrode , is made of iron. In the alternative, the second electrode  is omitted and an electrically conductive container  is used as the second electrode . In this embodiment, the metal hydroxide layer  would be insulated from the container, preferably by a coating on the inside walls of the container.","The insulation  of the second electrode  electrically isolates the second electrode  from the metal hydroxide layer , and is preferably a ceramic oxide. More preferably, the insulation  is zirconium dioxide (ZrO) or magnesium oxide (MgO). The insulation  is made of a material capable of withstanding the temperature and does not dissolve in the metal hydroxide layer , or the active metal alloy layer .","In the alternative, the container  is electrically conductive and provides a current path between the voltage source  and the active metal alloy layer . The steam source  is insulated from the metal hydroxide layer , or fed into the active metal alloy layer  below the active metal alloy layer  and metal hydroxide layer  interface.","The shroud  is preferably made of glass and has a bottom enclosure to prevent hydrogen from being sequestered with oxygen. Preferably, a diffusion barrier or frit is used to prevent hydrogen from being sequestered. In the preferred embodiment, the shroud has a frit  between the first electrode  and the interface between the active metal alloy layer  and the metal hydroxide layer , whereby hydrogen is deflected off the frit, and the metal hydroxide layer  is in contact with the first electrode .","The voltage supplied by the voltage source  is about the standard reference voltage of the metal hydroxide layer , about enough to break down some of the metal hydroxide layer , while also consuming heat (endothermic reaction). The breakdown of the metal hydroxide layer , from the second reaction, replenishes the active metal alloy layer , while also producing hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is sequestered by the shroud  above the first electrode , and the resulting hydrogen and steam that did not react with the active metal alloy layer  is captured by the closed vessel  above the container . A selected voltage is applied to the electrodes to replenish the active metal alloy layer . Preferably, the voltage supplied by the voltage source  is the voltage resulting in the lowest energy used by the reactor per mole of hydrogen. The energy used will depend upon temperature, voltage, and steam recuperation used in the production of hydrogen. Although the breakdown of the metal hydroxide layer  consumes heat, the creation of the metal hydroxide layer  generates a comparable amount of heat, making the reaction approximately thermoneutral (not generating or consuming heat).","In the preferred embodiment, the active metal alloy layer  is K\u2014Bi (bismuth dissolved in potassium), produced by mixing molten Bi with K. A small amount of KBi is also produced as an intermediate compound. Any KBi reacts with the water in steam in a similar reaction creating KOH and hydrogen. A steam at about 700-900 K from the steam source  is introduced by the bent pipe  creating the following reaction of Reaction 1:\n\nK\u2014Bi+HO\u2192KOH+\u00bdH+Bi\u2003\u2003(Reaction 1)\n\nK, the reactive metal, makes the reaction of Reaction 1 exothermic. However the reaction of Reaction 1 is significantly slowed to a less violent reaction by Bi, which both lowers the chemical activity of K and serves as a diluent. As shown in Reaction 1, steam (HO) and the active metal alloy layer  (K\u2014Bi) are consumed producing the metal Hydroxide layer  (KOH) and hydrogen. The hydrogen forms at the interface between the active metal alloy layer  and the metal hydroxide layer .\n","A voltage is then applied across the metal hydroxide layer  and the active metal alloy layer  in the following reaction of Reaction 2:\n\nKOH+Bi+\u2192K\u2014Bi+\u00bdH+\u00bdO\u2003\u2003(Reaction 2)\n\nAs shown in Reaction 2, KOH (the metal hydroxide layer ) and e (electrons from the voltage source ) react producing K\u2014Bi (replenishing the active metal alloy layer ), oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H). The oxygen (O) is produced at the end of the first electrode . The hydrogen is produced at the interface of the active metal alloy layer  and the metal hydroxide layer . The rate of reaction 1 (formation of KOH) is largely controlled by the rate of the steam feed. The rate of reaction 2 (electrolytic decomposition of KOH) can be adjusted by control of the applied potential. In this reactor these two rates are about equal so that a state of dynamic equilibrium exists in the cell.\n","From the Nernst equation applied to reaction 2, the cell voltage Eis:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["E","cell"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mn":"4.184","mo":"\u00b7","msub":{"mrow":[{"mi":["\u0394","G"],"mo":"\u2062"},{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"H","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"O"},"mo":",","mi":"g"}]}},{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"F"}]}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mi":"RT","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"F"}}},{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"n","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"p","msub":{"mi":"H","mn":"2"}},"mo":"\u00b7","msup":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":"p","msub":{"mi":"O","mn":"2"}}},{"mn":["1","2"],"mo":"\/"}]}},"msub":{"mi":"P","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"H","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"O"}}}}}],"mo":"\u2061"},{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mn":"4.184","mo":"\u00b7","msub":{"mrow":[{"mi":["\u0394","G"],"mo":"\u2062"},{"mi":["KOH","O"],"mo":"-"}]}},{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"F"}]}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mn":"4.184","mo":"\u00b7","msub":{"mrow":[{"mi":["\u0394","G"],"mo":"\u2062"},{"mi":["KOH","H"],"mo":"-"}]}},{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"F"}]}}],"mo":["-","-","+"]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Where \u0394Gis the Gibbs free energy for the formation of KOH into H, \u0394Gis the Gibbs free energy for the decomposition of KOH, \u0394Gis the Gibbs free energy for the formation of HO (steam); F is Faraday's constant; R is the universal gas constant; T is the temperature of the KOH (metal hydroxide layer ); p(H) is the partial pressure of hydrogen (H); p(HO) is the partial pressure of water (HO); and p(O) is the partial pressure of oxygen (O). \u0394Gand \u0394Ghave the same absolute value but are of opposite signs.
