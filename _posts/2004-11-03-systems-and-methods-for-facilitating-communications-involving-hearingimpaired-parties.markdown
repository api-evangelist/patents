{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION "],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/798,348 filed Mar. 12, 2004, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/699,823 filed Nov. 4, 2003, the disclosures of which are both hereby incorporated by reference herein. This application also claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 119 based on U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/545,954 filed Feb. 20, 2004 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/517,899 filed Nov. 7, 2003, the disclosures of which are both hereby incorporated by reference herein.","The present invention relates to providing communication services and, more particularly, to providing communication services for hearing-impaired parties.","A conventional telecommunication device for the deaf\/teletype (TDD\/TTY) enables people who are hearing-impaired or deaf to communicate with other parties via standard telephone lines. For example, one way in which a deaf party may communicate with another party is if both parties use a TDD\/TTY. In this case, a calling party may type using a standard keyboard included with the TDD\/TTY and the called party reads the message on a display associated with his\/her TDD\/TTY. The called party may similarly type a message using his\/her TDD\/TTY and the calling party may read the message using his\/her display.","A second way in which a hearing-impaired\/deaf person may communicate via standard telephone lines is referred to as relay. In this case, a hearing party wishing to communicate with a hearing-impaired party calls a designated telephone number associated with a relay service provider, typically an 800 number or a 711 number. The hearing party may then be connected to a communication assistant (CA) (also referred to as a relay operator). The CA may then ask the hearing party for the telephone number of the hearing-impaired party with whom he\/she would like to communicate. The CA may then dial the telephone number of the hearing-impaired party, who may be using a TDD\/TTY, and establish a connection with the hearing-impaired party. The CA may then type messages corresponding to messages voiced by the hearing party for display on the hearing-impaired party's TDD\/TTY. The CA also sends voice messages corresponding to text typed by the hearing-impaired party.","One problem with the relay method described above is that the hearing party must first dial a designated phone number associated with a relay service provider, such as an 800 number or 711 number, prior to establishing a connection to the hearing-impaired party. In many cases, the hearing party will not know the telephone number associated with the relay service provider. Alternatively, the hearing party may not bother to make the call to the hearing-impaired party due to its somewhat cumbersome approach in actually establishing a connection with the desired party. The end result is that telerelay services (TRS) are often not utilized or are under utilized by hearing parties to initiate communications to hearing-impaired parties.","According to one aspect of the invention, a method for providing communication services is provided. The method includes receiving a telephone call from a hearing party, where the telephone call has a terminating number corresponding to a telephone number associated with the hearing-impaired party. The method also includes forwarding the telephone call to a communication assistant and establishing a communication link from the communication assistant to the hearing-impaired party based on the terminating number.","According to a further aspect of the invention, a system including a server and a first device associated with a communication assistant is provided. The server is configured to receive a telephone call from a hearing party, where the telephone call has a terminating number. The server is also configured to identify a communication assistant and forward the telephone call. The first device is configured to receive the forwarded telephone call and establish a communication link with the hearing-impaired party based on the terminating number.","Another aspect of the present invention provides a method that includes receiving a telephone call from a first party, where the telephone call has a terminating number corresponding to a telephone number associated with a hearing-impaired party. The method also includes identifying a first communication method associated with the hearing-impaired party and establishing a communication link to the hearing-impaired party using the first communication method.","In still another aspect of the invention, a method is provided that includes receiving first information identifying at least one method by which a hearing-impaired party wishes to communicate. The method also includes receiving second information identifying an order with respect to attempting to establish communications with the hearing-impaired party via the at least one method. The method further includes storing the first and second information.","Other features and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in this art from the following detailed description. The embodiments shown and described provide illustration of the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is capable of modifications in various obvious respects, all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the drawings are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","120","130","140","150","100"]},"Network  may include one or more wired and\/or wireless networks that are capable of receiving and transmitting data and voice signals. For example, network  may include one or more public switched telephone networks (PSTNs) or other type of switched network.

Network  may also include one or more wireless networks and may include a number of transmission towers for receiving wireless signals and forwarding the wireless signals toward the intended destination.","Network  may further include one or more devices, such as a network gateway, that allow divergent transport networks to communicate and cooperatively carry traffic. A network gateway may provide for interoperation at two levels, e.g., between different signaling schemes and between different media forms. For example, the network gateway may adapt between SS7 signaling used in a portion of network  and session initiation protocol (SIP) or H.323 protocols used by another portion of network . The network gateway may also adapt analog or pulse code modulation (PCM) encoded voice signals to a packetized data stream suitable for transport over network .","User device , consistent with the present invention, may include any device that is able to execute some form of text messaging. For example, user device  may include a conventional TDD\/TTY. User device  may also include a conventional plain old telephone system (POTS) phone with a text screen to display text messages or an Internet protocol (IP) telephone with a text screen that is configured to transmit and receive voice messages using, for example, voice over Internet protocol (VoIP). User device  may also include a computing device, such as a personal computer (PC), laptop computer, personal digital assistant (PDA) or a web-based appliance that is able to execute a text messaging program, such as an instant messaging program, and transmit and receive data via network . User device  may further include any wireless device, such as a cellular telephone, a PDA or a pager, that executes a wireless application protocol (WAP), or another protocol, that enables user device  to transmit and receive data via a network, such as network .","Server  may include any server\/computing device that is able to connect to *network  and transmit and receive data via network . Server  may include a firewall (not shown) that provides security-related services for server .","Server  may also include a gateway (not shown) that supports persistent, full duplex transmission control protocol (TCP)\/Internet Protocol (IP) connections between server  and user device  and other devices\/parties, such as CA . For example, the gateway may include one or more call processors that enable a client application programming interface (API) to maintain a persistent socket connection between a client application executed by user device  and server  and\/or CA . Server  enables a hearing party to establish communications with a hearing-impaired party by simply placing a call to a telephone number associated with the hearing-impaired party, as described in more detail below.","CA  may represent any conventional CA workstation\/computer and operator used to facilitate communications between a hearing-impaired party and a hearing party. CA  may include a workstation or computer, such as a personal computer or laptop. CA  may be used in any TRS environment, such as a voice carry over (VCO) environment, a hearing carry over (HCO) environment, a speech-to-speech (STS) environment, etc.","In an exemplary implementation consistent with the invention, CA  may include a voice recognizer that performs voice or speech recognition. The voice recognizer may include software and\/or hardware that is able to convert received voice messages into text messages.","CA  may also include a high speed text input device, such as a stenographic device, a communication access real-time translation (CART) device, etc. These high speed text input devices may enable an operator at CA  to keep up with a conversation between a hearing party and a hearing-impaired party.","CA  may also include any conventional telephone (not shown), such as one used by a hearing party, that interfaces with the PSTN to place and receive telephone calls. For example, the telephone device may be a standard telephone, a cordless telephone, a cellular telephone or any other type of conventional telephone. The telephone device may also include any type of device that is capable of transmitting and receiving voice signals to\/from a data network. For example, the telephone device may include any client, such as a computer device, a web-based appliance, etc., that is configured to provide telephone functions. The telephone device may, for example, be a session initiation protocol (SIP)-based telephone device. In this case, the SIP-based telephone device may take the form of a standalone device, e.g., a SIP telephone designed and configured to function and appear like a conventional telephone. A SIP-based telephone device may also include a software client that may run, for example, on a conventional PC, laptop computer or other computing device.","Telephone device  may include any type of device that is capable of transmitting and receiving voice signals to\/from a data network, such as network .

Server  and CA  are illustrated in  as being connected via network . In alternative implementations, server  and CA  may be connected directly to each other, connected via a LAN, connected via a private network, etc. In still other alternative implementations, the functions performed by server  and CA , described in more detail below, may be performed by a single device\/platform.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["130","140","130","140","210","220","230","240","250","260","270","280","210","130","140"]},"Processor  may include any type of conventional processor or microprocessor that interprets and executes instructions. Memory  may include a random access memory (RAM) or another dynamic storage device that stores information and instructions for execution by processor . Memory  may also be used to store temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions by processor .","ROM  may include a conventional ROM device and\/or another static storage device that stores static information and instructions for processor . Storage device  may include a magnetic disk or optical disk and its corresponding drive and\/or some other type of magnetic or optical recording medium and its corresponding drive for storing information and instructions.","Input device  may include one or more conventional mechanisms that permit an operator to input information to server , such as a keyboard, a mouse, a pen, voice recognition and\/or biometric mechanisms, etc. Output device  may include one or more conventional mechanisms that output information to the operator, including a display, a printer, one or more speakers, etc. Communication interface  may include any transceiver-like mechanism that enables server  to communicate with other devices and\/or systems. For example, communication interface  may include a modem or an Ethernet interface to a LAN. Alternatively, communication interface  may include other mechanisms for communicating via a network.","Server , consistent with the present invention, provides a platform through which a hearing-impaired party may be assigned a telephone number and register preferences with respect to receiving communications from hearing parties. CA , consistent with the present invention, provides a platform through which a hearing party at telephone device  and a hearing-impaired party at user device  communicate. According to an exemplary implementation, server \/CA  may perform various processes in response to processor  executing sequences of instructions contained in memory . Such instructions may be read into memory  from another computer-readable medium, such as storage device , or from a separate device via communication interface . It should be understood that a computer-readable medium may include one or more memory devices or carrier waves. Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in memory  causes processor  to perform the acts that will be described hereafter. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the present invention. Thus, the present invention is not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"310"},"For example, a hearing-impaired party at user device  may connect to server  via network  by entering an Internet address (e.g., a website address or a uniform resource locator (URL)) in a browser being executed by user device . Alternatively, user device  may execute a WAP that enables a party associated with user device  to enter an Internet address associated with server . In still other alternatives, the hearing-impaired party (or someone acting on behalf of the hearing-impaired party) may dial a telephone number associated with server  to register over the telephone or a sales person associated with server  may contact the hearing-impaired party and register the hearing-impaired party. Server , consistent with the invention, may be affiliated with a service provider that has reserved  digit telephone numbers (i.e., area code plus seven digit phone number) in a number of area codes for hearing-impaired parties.","Assume that the hearing-impaired party has contacted server  via network . In this case, server  may provide a user interface (UI) to the hearing-impaired party that requests that the hearing-impaired party enter various identifying information. For example, the UI may request the name, email address and state and city of residence of the hearing-impaired party. The UI may also request that the hearing-impaired party provide an instant messaging screen name used by the hearing-impaired party when communicating via instant messages (IMs).","The UI, consistent with the invention, may include one or more drop down boxes that facilitate entry of the above information. The hearing-impaired party enters the information and transmits the information to server . Server  receives and stores the user identification information (act ).","In an exemplary implementation, once server  has received the identification information, server  may transmit a second UI to the hearing-impaired party. This second UI allows the hearing-impaired party to select one or more preferences regarding methods of communicating and to assign an order for the selected methods (act ). The order may represent the most preferred communication method to the least preferred communication method of the hearing-impaired party. For each selection, user device  of the hearing-impaired party may include the particular software and\/or hardware that enables user device  to communicate via the selected method.","For example, a number of different methods or services associated with communications involving hearing-impaired parties may be available. These services may include, for example, a number of methods of communicating via the Internet, referred to as Internet protocol (IP)-relay. IP-relay may allow a hearing-impaired party to receive text messages via any computer device, PDA, wireless device, etc. IP-relay may include a number of individual types of communications, such as video relay service (VRS), short message service (SMS), instant messaging, etc. Other types of services that may be available include paging, TDD\/TTY, telephone with text display, etc. These services will be described briefly below. It should be understood that additional methods\/services may also be used to facilitate communications involving hearing-impaired parties, such as other Internet related communication methods, and these other methods\/services may also be available for selection via the UI.","IP-relay as discussed above may include a VRS service. VRS is a service that allows a hearing impaired party to communicate with other parties using sign language. For example, a hearing-impaired party and a CA may be coupled via a high speed Internet link that allows each party having a camera to transmit video images over the high speed link. The hearing-impaired party may then send sign language images to a video interpreter (i.e., the operator) at CA . The operator at CA  may receive the video images and voice a message to the hearing party corresponding to the received sign language images. The operator at CA  may also translate the hearing party's voice messages to sign language and transmit the sign language images to the hearing-impaired party via the video link.","SMS is a service that allows a hearing-impaired party to receive and send short text messages via a wireless device, such as a cellular telephone or PDA. Using SMS, the operator at CA  may transmit SMS messages that correspond to voice messages from a hearing party for display on the hearing-impaired party's wireless device. The hearing-impaired party may also transmit SMS messages to the operator at CA , who relays voice messages corresponding to the SMS messages.","Instant messaging is a service that utilizes conventional instant messaging software, such as AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), Microsoft Messenger, etc., to transmit the text messages. For example, the operator at CA  may receive voice messages from a hearing party and type corresponding IMs for transmission to the hearing-impaired party. The operator at CA  may also receive IMs from the hearing-impaired party and voice the corresponding message to the hearing party.","Paging is a service that allows a hearing-impaired party to receive and send text messages via a pager device. Using paging, the operator at CA  may transmit messages that correspond to voice messages from a hearing party for display on the hearing-impaired party's pager. The hearing-impaired party may also transmit messages via the pager to the operator at CA , who relays voice messages corresponding to the pager messages.","TTY\/TDD is a service that allows a hearing-impaired party to receive and send text messages via a conventional TTY\/TDD.","Telephone with text display is a service that allows the hearing impaired party to receive phone calls via a conventional telephone with a text display. The telephone may be used for situations, such as voice carry over (VCO), where the hearing-impaired party can speak, but is unable to hear. In this case, the operator at CA  may type text messages corresponding to received voice messages for display on the text display associated with the hearing-impaired party's telephone. The hearing-impaired party may read the text message and voice a reply for transmission to the hearing party (without retranslation by the operator at CA ). In this service, the telephone used by the hearing-impaired party may be a POTS telephone device, an IP-based telephone that utilizes voice over IP (VoIP) or another type of conventional telephone.","The UI downloaded to user device  may include boxes for selecting each of the above described services and may also include variations or sub-selections for each of the above services, as described in more detail below. The UI may instruct the hearing-impaired user to select one or more services he\/she wishes to use when communicating with others, such as hearing parties, and an order associated with the selected service(s).","The hearing-impaired party may then make his\/her selection(s), provide the order of preference with respect to the selection(s) and transmit the information to server . Server  receives the selection(s) and order information and stores this information (act ). As discussed above, some of the selections may require that the hearing-impaired party provide a further selection regarding the selection.","For example, if the hearing-impaired party selects instant messaging, the UI (or a subsequent UI) may request a further selection regarding a particular type of instant messaging software he\/she uses (AOL IM (AIM), Microsoft Messenger, Yahoo IM, etc).","After receiving the selection\/order information, server  may assign a telephone number to the hearing-impaired party (act ). Server , consistent with the invention, may store the telephone number and other information in a database for use when a call to the hearing-impaired party is received, as described in more detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","130","250","400","130","400","410","420","430","410","420","430"]},"As an example, the first entry in database  stores the telephone number 571-123-4567 in field , the email address bsmith@aol.com, screen name bsmith1 and the name Bill Smith in other field . This information indicates that Bill Smith, who has an email address of bsmith@aol.com and a IM screen name of bsmith1, has been assigned the telephone number 571-123-4567. The information stored in field  represents Bill's selected preferences with respect to communicating with others. In this example, Bill's preferred communication method\/service is VRS, followed by IP-AIM, TTY, SMS and pager (in that order), as indicated by the information stored in fields - through -. Server  and\/or CA  uses the information in database  when attempting to establish communications with Bill, as described in more detail below.","In an exemplary implementation consistent with the invention, after a hearing-impaired party has been assigned a telephone number, server  may perform a validation process before the telephone number may be used. For example, once the identification and preference\/order information has been received, server  may provide the hearing-impaired party with his\/her assigned telephone number along with instructions for validating\/activating the telephone number (act ).","The telephone number and instructions may be forwarded to the hearing-impaired party via network  as part of the registration process. Server  may also send a confirmation number and\/or tracking number that allows the hearing-impaired party to check on the status of the telephone number at a later time (e.g., determine whether the telephone number has been activated, deactivated, etc).","The validation instructions provided to the hearing-impaired party may request that the hearing-impaired party log into his\/her instant messaging client using the same instant messaging screen name previously provided to server  (e.g., at act ). The instructions may further request that the hearing-impaired party send an IM to server , (identified, for example, by the screen name MYIPRELAY) with the key word \u201cvalidate\u201d and the telephone number provided by server .","Server  receives the IM and determines whether the screen name via which the IM was received matches the IM screen name previously provided by the hearing-impaired party. If the screen names match, server  validates the information and activates the telephone number (act ). If the screen names do not match, server  may deny validation of the telephone number. This validation process ensures that screen name provided by the hearing-impaired party (at act ) is valid and also prevents an individual from signing up for hearing-impaired services using other party's screen names.","Other methods of validating the information provided by the hearing-impaired party may also be used in alternative implementations. For example, server  may verify the hearing-impaired party's email address is the same as that provided. Server  may also verify that other information provided by the party signing up for the service is accurate and could only be provided by that party. In one implementation, server  may access external databases, such as a local or long distance telephone company's databases to ensure that the information provided matches information in the external database. Server  may also email a personal identification number (PIN) to the hearing-impaired at an address known to be associated with the hearing-impaired party. The hearing-impaired party may be instructed to then send an email to server  with this PIN.","Once the telephone number has been provided and validated, any party may use the assigned telephone number to establish communications with the hearing-impaired party, as described in more detail below. In each case, the calling party may simply place the call to the hearing-impaired party's telephone number and server  automatically routes the call.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"],"b":["150","510","130","350"]},"After placing the telephone call, one or more devices\/platforms in system  (not shown in ) may forward the call to server . That is, one or more devices\/platforms associated with routing the call may store a list of telephone numbers that represent telephone numbers associated with hearing-impaired parties. If the terminating telephone number matches one of these numbers associated with a hearing-impaired party, these devices\/platforms may forward the call to server .","Server  receives the call and verifies that the terminating telephone number is associated with a hearing-impaired party (act ). That is, server  searches database  to determine whether the terminating telephone number is stored in one of the entries in field . If the terminating telephone number is not stored in database , server  may simply forward the call back to a device\/platform that forwarded the call to server  and instruct that device\/platform to forward the call on to its destination.","Assume that the terminating telephone number is stored in database . In this case, server  identifies the preferred communication method\/service via which the hearing-impaired party wishes to communicate (act ). That is, server  reads the identifier in field - of the entry in database  corresponding to the terminating telephone number to determine the preferred communication method\/service.","For example, assume that the terminating telephone number is 571-123-4567 (i.e., entry  in database  of ). In this case, server  reads field - and determines that VRS is the preferred service by which Bill Smith wishes to communicate.","Server  may then identify a CA capable of handling the call (act ). For example, server  may search a table containing a list of CAs and their respective. statuses. The status of each CA may indicate whether that particular CA is currently handling a call (e.g., involved in a conversation between a hearing-impaired party and a hearing party), is off-line\/not available or is available to help a caller. The table may be stored, for example, in storage device  ().","The table may also include information indicating the particular types of calls that the CA can handle (e.g., VRS calls, IM calls, TDD\/TTY calls, etc.). The table may further include information regarding particular skills of the respective operators at each CA workstation, such as whether the operator speaks a foreign language (e.g., Spanish, French, etc.).","Assume that server  determines that CA  is equipped to handle VRS calls and that CA  is available to help a caller. Further assume that server  identifies CA  as the appropriate CA to assist in the current call. Server  may then forward the telephone call to CA  (act ).","CA  receives the call and the terminating telephone number associated with the hearing-impaired party. The operator at CA  may then attempt to establish a connection to the hearing-impaired party via the preferred method previously selected by the hearing-impaired party (VRS in this example) (act ).","For example, in one implementation, the hearing-impaired party at user device  may have loaded VRS software on user device  that allows user device  to communicate via VRS using a high speed Internet connection. In this implementation, the operator at CA  may attempt to connect to the hearing-impaired party at user device  via VRS software loaded on CA  that is similar to the VRS software on the user side. The VRS software loaded on CA  may, however, be \u201cserver side\u201d software of a client\/server VRS software program. The server side software on CA  may access information stored in database , such as the user name, email address and other information for attempting to connect to user device  via the VRS program. In an exemplary implementation, CA  may automatically attempt to connect to the hearing-impaired party at user device  via the VRS software based on information stored in database  without input from the operator at CA .","CA , consistent with the invention, maintains the telephone connection with the calling party (i.e., the hearing party at telephone device ) while attempting to establish a connection with the hearing-impaired party at user device . In this example, assume that user device  is powered up and online at the time that CA  attempts to establish a connection with the hearing-impaired party. CA  then \u201crings\u201d the hearing-impaired party at user device . Upon receiving the call, the VRS software executed at user device  may signal the hearing-impaired party that an incoming call has been received. The signal may include, for example, displaying a flashing telephone icon to indicate that an incoming call has been received.","If a connection is established (act ), CA  may facilitate a conversation between the hearing party at telephone device  and the hearing-impaired party at user device  (act ). For example, assume that the hearing-impaired answers the call by, for example, clicking on the ringing telephone icon. CA  may receive an indication that the call has been answered. The hearing-impaired party at user device  may then answer the call by signing \u201cHello, this is Bill\u201d. CA  may receive the signed message via the high speed Internet link and may voice the corresponding voice message to the hearing-impaired party at telephone device . As discussed previously, the VRS system requires that each party (CA and hearing-impaired party) has a camera that permits transmission of video images to the other party.","The hearing party at telephone device  may receive the voice message from CA  and may voice a message, such as, \u201cHi Bill, this is Jim, how are you doing?\u201d The operator at CA  may then translate this voice message into sign language, sign the message and transmit the video images to the hearing-impaired party at user device . The conversation between the hearing party at telephone device  and the hearing-impaired party at user device  may then proceed in this manner, with the CA  acting as an interpreter between the hearing and hearing-impaired parties. That is, the operator at CA  receives voice messages from the hearing party at telephone device  and signs the message using, for example, American Sign Language, for transmission to the hearing-impaired party at user device . The hearing-impaired party at user device  may then sign his\/her responses and the operator at CA  voices the corresponding message the hearing party at telephone device .","In the event that the called party is not available via the VRS system (act ) (e.g., the called party's user device  was not able to receive the VRS call or the VRS software at user device  was not activated), CA  (or server ) may attempt to establish a link via the next preferred method of communicating (act ). That is, CA  may read the information in field - to identify the next preferred method of communicating (IP-AIM in the example in ).","In this case, CA  may access the hearing-impaired party's screen name stored in other field  and send an IM to the hearing-impaired party's screen name. If the hearing-impaired party is on-line, a message window may be \u201cpopped\u201d on the screen of user device  indicating that a call has been received. The message window may include the telephone number of the calling party.","If the hearing-impaired party at user device  is online when the message is popped, the hearing-impaired party may type a message, such as \u201cHello, this is Bill\u201d. CA  receives the IM and voices the corresponding message to the calling party at user device . CA  may then type IMs corresponding to the voice messages of the hearing party at telephone device  and transmit the IMs to the hearing-impaired party at user device . The hearing-impaired party may IM his\/her response, which the operator at CA  may voice to the hearing party at telephone device .","If the hearing-impaired party does not respond to the second preferred method, CA  (or server ) may try the third preferred method by reading the information stored in field - and so on until a connection is established.","If CA  is unable to establish a connection via any of the methods stored in database , CA  may inform the hearing party at telephone device  that the called party is not available and may take a message for the hearing-impaired party (act ). The message may be stored and made available for later retrieval by the hearing-impaired party (act ). For example, CA  may store the message and provide an indication to user device  that a message has been stored from a caller. The hearing-impaired party at user device  may then retrieve the stored message at a later time.","In the manner described above, a hearing party may establish a communication link to a hearing-impaired party without first calling a designated relay number. That is, the hearing party may initiate a telephone call to the hearing-impaired party by simply placing a call to the hearing-impaired party's telephone number. Server  and\/or CA  then automatically establish the communication link to the hearing-impaired party without first requesting additional information from the calling party, such as requesting the name and\/or telephone number of the hearing-impaired party. This greatly simplifies the process of establishing communications with a hearing-impaired party and makes it much more likely that hearing parties will initiate communications with hearing-impaired parties.","A similar process may occur when a hearing-impaired party wishes to establish communications with a hearing party. For example, a hearing-impaired party may contact server  to establish communications with another party. Server  may identify an appropriate CA and forward the connection from the hearing-impaired party to the CA. The CA may then retrieve the information stored in database  to identify the preferred communication method and other information, such as screen name, associated with the call. CA  may then establish a connection with telephone device . The hearing-impaired party, via user device , and CA  may then communicate via, for example, streaming text messages, video images, IMs, etc., as described above, with CA  acting as the conduit for the conversation between the hearing party at telephone device  and the hearing-impaired party at user device .","As discussed above, CA  and\/or server  may attempt to initiate communications with a hearing-impaired party by any one of a number of methods identified in database . For example, CA  may establish communications with user device  via any number of wired and\/or wireless systems. Examples of wired systems include the PSTN and the Internet. In implementations in which communications is established via the Internet, CA  may establish a connection to user device  using, for example, an IP address associated with user device , a screen name associated with user device , an email address associated with user device , etc. In implementations in which communications is established via wireless systems, CA  may establish a connection to user device  using, for example, a conventional wireless network, a satellite-based network, etc. Wireless communications, such as wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) and Bluetooth may also be used by user device  and\/or CA  in implementations consistent with the invention.","CA , consistent with the invention, may also establish communications with user device  via specialized software (e.g., VRS). CA  may also establish communications with user device  via conventional instant messaging software, SMS software or other text messaging software. In still other implementations, CA  may establish communications by placing a telephone call to user device . The telephone call may be placed to the telephone number assigned to the hearing-impaired party and the connection to user device  may be made via the PSTN and\/or the Internet. CA  may further establish communications with user device  via a paging system or a TDD\/TTY system. In each case, user device  may be configured to receive the particular type of communication. That is, if specialized software or hardware is required at user device , user device  may download the software via server  or another platform, if necessary, or obtain the necessary hardware from another party, such as a service provider associated with providing services for the hearing-impaired. In some implementations, modifications to conventional programs, such as text messaging programs, may be needed to facilitate communications between a hearing-impaired party, a CA and a hearing party. In this case, server  or another platform may provide the modified software to the hearing-impaired party.","The connection between user device  and CA , as described above, may be a persistent, full duplex link. As described herein, the term \u201cpersistent, full duplex\u201d refers to a communication link that is always connected and allows both parties to simultaneously transmit information. Such links do not require either the hearing-impaired party or the party at the opposite end (e.g., an operator at CA ) to press a \u201csend\u201d or \u201creceive\u201d button. Further, such full duplex links allow each party to view messages in a streaming manner as the messages are being typed in real-time or near real-time without waiting for the sending party to complete the message and press \u201csend\u201d. This helps prevent the \u201cconversation\u201d between the hearing-impaired party at user device  and the operator at CA  from getting out of synchronization when communicating with each other. The full duplex link may be implemented using, for example, Java, JavaScript or another programming language.","Systems and methods consistent with the present invention facilitate communications between hearing parties and hearing-impaired parties by allowing a hearing party to initiate communications by simply placing a call to a telephone number associated with the hearing-impaired party. Server  and\/or CA  may then automatically determine an appropriate communication method based on the terminating telephone number and establish a communication link to the hearing-impaired party.","In this disclosure, there is shown and described preferred embodiments of the invention, but, as aforementioned, it is to be understood that the invention is capable of use in various other combinations and environments and is capable of changes or modifications within the scope of the inventive concept as expressed herein.","For example, encryption may be utilized in one or more of the communication methods described above. In addition, the present invention has been described above with respect to a hearing-impaired party registering for a telephone number and being assigned a telephone number. In some implementations, server  may determine the area code in which the hearing-impaired resides and provide the hearing-impaired party with a telephone number in that particular area code. Alternatively, server  may request that the hearing-impaired party select an area code. In this implementation, the hearing-impaired party may select an area code that allows him\/her to place and receive \u201clocal\u201d calls in that particular area code. In still other implementations, the hearing-impaired party may be provided with a personal toll free number (e.g., an 800 number). This personal toll free number may allow any party to place a call to the hearing-impaired party without the calling party incurring any charges. This may help further increase the number of calls that hearing parties initiate to hearing-impaired parties.","Further, the present invention has been described with the example of server  assigning a \u201cnew\u201d telephone number to the hearing-impaired party. In other implementations, server  may use the hearing-impaired party's existing telephone number to provide the services described above. That is, server  may request that the hearing-impaired party provide his\/her telephone number. Server  may then store this telephone number in database  along with the selected communication method(s) by which the hearing-impaired party wishes to communicate. When a telephone call with this number is received, one or more devices\/platforms will forward this call to server . Processing may then proceed as described above.","In addition, the present invention has been described with respect to an entity, such as a service provider, assigning a telephone number to a hearing-impaired party and then performing various processes associated with facilitating communications involving the hearing-impaired party once a call has been received. In some implementations, one or more entities that are not associated with each other may be involved in the above described processes. That is, a first entity may assign a telephone number to a hearing-impaired party. A second entity not affiliated with or associated with the first entity may then perform one or more of the other processes described above, such as providing options to the hearing-impaired party with respect to the various methods of communicating or providing CA related services.","Further, voice recognition software may be used in one or more of the methods described above to automatically generate text messages based on the received voice messages and automatically send the text messages to the hearing-impaired party via a text messaging program. Further, text messages received by a CA may be automatically translated into voice messages using text-to-voice software. This may eliminate the need for a human operator at CA workstations.","Lastly, series of acts have been described with respect to . The order of the acts may be varied in other implementations consistent with the present invention. Moreover, non-dependent acts may be performed in parallel.","No element, act, or instruction used in the description of the present application should be construed as critical or essential to the invention unless explicitly described as such. Also, as used herein, the article \u201ca\u201d is intended to include one or more items. Where only one item is intended, the term \u201cone\u201d or similar language is used.","The scope of the invention is defined by the claims and their equivalents."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Reference is made to the attached drawings, wherein elements having the same reference number designation may represent like elements throughout.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
