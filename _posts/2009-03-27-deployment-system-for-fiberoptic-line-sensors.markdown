{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","CROSS REFERENCE TO OTHER RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND OF INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","None.","1) Field of the Invention","The present invention is directed to underwater fiber optic sensors and in particular to deployment systems for the fiber optic sensors.","2) Description of Prior Art","Fiber optics and fiber optic sensors can be used as an alternative or replacement for traditional sensors to measure rotation, acceleration, electric and magnetic field measurement, temperature, pressure, acoustics, vibration, linear and angular position, strain, humidity and viscosity among other measurements. Fiber optic sensors are lightweight, small, passive, low powered, resistant to electromagnetic interference, high sensitivity, wide bandwidth and environmentally rugged. These sensors can be used in harsh environments including underwater environments such as the ocean floor. This compatibility of optical sensors within a harsh marine environment creates opportunities to use fiber optic sensors for tactical or reconnaissance applications.","For example, a long fiber optic sensor deployed along the ocean floor for several miles can be used to monitor submarine traffic covertly leaving an enemy port. Any submarine that passes over the fiber optic sensor is detected. This presence is communicated through an antenna section to distant command groups. However, a need still exists for a deployment system that can reliably deploy the fiber optic sensor.","A system and method in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention are directed to underwater deployment systems for fiber optic line sensors.","The deployment system of the present invention positions fiber optic line sensors within littoral environments. Once positioned, the line sensors remain in their deployed positions for extended periods of time.","The deployment system includes a buoyant antenna section in communication with a control electronics section. The antenna of the antenna section is used to transmit signals from the fiber optic line sensors.","In one embodiment, the deployment system works in combination with a large Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) to deliver the fiber optic sensor to the desired location. Once the UUV is positioned in the desired location, the UUV signals a linear actuator to trigger two quick release devices. The first quick release device is on the antenna section and the second quick release device is on the electronic canister section. The electronic canister section includes control electronics and a power supply for the fiber optic line sensor.","Using the first and second quick release devices, both sections would then separate from the large UUV. As the two sections combined are negatively buoyant, these sections fall away from the large UUV. After the two sections have fallen a safe distance from the UUV (which is equal to the length of a retractable lanyard disposed between the two sections and the UUV); a spring band disposed between the two sections is released. Releasing the spring band allows the buoyant antenna section to separate from the electronics canister. The electronics canister continues falling toward the seafloor and the antenna section rises to the surface.","The electronics canister eventually comes to rest on the seafloor. The fiber optic line sensor remains disposed between the electronics canister that is now resting on the seafloor and the UUV. The UUV moves away from the electronics canister in accordance with a pre-determined pattern to deploy the fiber optic line sensor along that pattern.","Once deployed, the system remains in a standby position. When a submarine passes over the sensor, a pressure signal is detected by the deployed fiber optic line sensor. The pressure signal is processed by the electronics in the electronics canister. The resulting information is relayed to a central location via the buoyant antenna section.","Referring initially to , an exemplary embodiment of a deployment system for a fiber optic line sensor arranged for use with a UUV is illustrated. The deployment system includes three sections, a buoy antenna section , an electronics canister section  and a \u201cfishline\u201d spool section . The antenna section  contains an antenna  that is used to transmit detection signals to a monitoring station, for example, a localized Navy command group. The antenna section  is positively buoyant such that the antenna section will float to the surface of a body of water.","In one embodiment, the antenna section  is generally cylindrical and one end of the antenna section is in contact with the electronics canister section . The antenna section  in combination with the electronics canister section  is negatively buoyant because the electronics canister section is more negatively buoyant than the antenna section is positively buoyant.","During transport and at initial deployment, the antenna section  is securely attached to the electronics canister section . Preferably, a breakaway interface is provided between the antenna section  and the electronics canister section . In one embodiment, the breakaway interface is a circumferential spring band  that surrounds the interface joint between the cylindrical antenna section  and the cylindrical electronics canister section . The spring band  secures the two sections together until triggered to spring open.","In one embodiment, the spring band  is triggered to spring open when the two connected sections drop a safe distance-away from a launch vehicle . In another embodiment, the launch vehicle  can be considered part of the deployment system.","In one embodiment, the deployment system includes a triggering mechanism  to trigger the spring band . The triggering mechanism  can be a retractable lanyard or other suitable rigging that is secured between the launch vehicle  and the spring band . The triggering mechanism  has a length sufficient to allow the antenna section  and the electronics canister section  to travel a safe distance from the launch vehicle  before the antenna section is separated from the electronics canister section.","Once the spring band  has been released by the triggering mechanism , the buoyant antenna section  is free to ascend to the surface of the ocean while the electronics canister section  descends to the ocean floor. As the buoyant antenna section  ascends away from the electronics canister section , a sufficient length of communications cable  or buoyant antenna cable is paid out between the two sections. The communication cable  is fixedly secured to both sections and is in communication with both the antenna  in the antenna section  and the control electronics  within the electronics canister section . The antenna section  remains connected to the electronics canister section  through the communications cable . Therefore, the communication cable  also serves as an anchor line for the antenna section . The communication cable  has a sufficient length to reach the surface of the ocean when the electronics canister section  is on the ocean floor and a sufficient strength to hold the buoyant antenna section  in place against the force of wind, waves and ocean currents.","The electronics canister section  contains the control electronics  required to power and to operate the fiber optic line sensor  and to detect approaching vessels. These control electronics include, but are not limited to, power supplies such as batteries, electronics, communication interfaces, memory devices, light sources and central processing units. The electronics canister section , once deployed, also functions as an anchor for the buoyant antenna section  and the fiber optic line sensor . In one embodiment, the electronics canister section  is cylindrical. Initially, one end of the electronics canister section  is in contact with an end of the antenna section  and is secured to the antenna section by the breakaway mechanism .","The electronics canister section  is initially connected to the antenna section . However, once the launch vehicle  releases the two sections, the sections will separate after achieving a safe distance from the large UV. In one embodiment, separation is achieved by a combination of a mechanical spring band as the breakaway mechanism  and a retractable lanyard . The electronics canister section  continues a descent until striking the ocean floor. As the electronics canister section  falls, the section draws the fiber optic line sensor  from a spool  located within the spool section .","The electronics canister section  also includes two protective covers  located at either end of the electronics canister section. These protective covers include a first protective cover  between the electronics canister section  and the antenna section  and a second protective cover  between the electronics canister section  and the spool section . The protective covers are visible on the outside and define the rounded shape of the two ends of the electronics canister section .","Referring now to , each protective cover  is convex. The protective covers  are arranged to protect the delicate control electronics  contained inside the electronics canister section  as well as the fiber optic line sensor  and the buoyant antenna cable . The protective covers  are constructed from a thin material (e.g. metal or plastic) which absorbs the shock of impact. The protective covers  can dent or deform without damaging any other components of the deployment system. The protective covers  are also generally circular to accommodate the cylindrical sections and include a central hole or aperture  to accommodate either the communications cable  or the fiber optic line sensor \u2014depending on the end of the electronics canister section  to which the cover is attached. A well  is disposed around the central hole  to prevent damage to the communications cable  or the fiber optic line sensor  when the electronics canister section  contacts the seafloor.","The wells  prevent the connectors from being bent if the canister section  lands on an end. The wells  also protect the fiber optic line sensor  and the cable  from being pinched or kinked. Each protective cover  includes a plurality of openings, apertures or holes  to allow water to flow freely through the protective cover. Attachment to the electronics canister section  can be provided by fasteners passed through a plurality of apertures or holes  in the protective cover .","Returning to  and , both ends of the electronics canister section  include an end plate  disposed between the ends of the electronics canister section and the protective covers. The end plates  provide the watertight seal for the electronics canister section . The antenna cable  and the fiber optic line sensor  pass through the end plates  while maintaining the watertight seal.","Referring now to , an embodiment of the end plate  is illustrated. The end plate  is arranged as a circular flange to accommodate the cylindrical sections and includes a plurality of fastener apertures or holes  to attach to the end plate  of the electronics canister section .","The spool section  can contain up to several miles of the fiber optic line sensor , which is, precision wound around a spool . The fiber optic line sensor  is loosely wound to minimize the tensile load during deployment. In one embodiment, the spool section  is cylindrical.","The spool section  is free-flooded, so that seawater is allowed to flow freely in and out. One end of the spool section  is in contact with the electronics canister section  and includes an internal plate  disposed between the electronics canister section  and the spool .","As illustrated in , the internal plate  includes a plurality of flow ports or apertures  to allow seawater to flow freely into the spool section . In one embodiment, the internal plate  is circular and includes a central aperture  to allow passage of the fiber optic line sensor .","The other end of the spool section  opposite the end in contact with the electronics canister section  includes an end cover . Another end cover  is attached to the antenna section  on an end opposite the end attached to the electronics canister section . As illustrated in , each end plate  is arranged as a convex cap on one end of the deployment system and includes a plurality of flange apertures  to be used in connecting the end cap to the appropriate sections.","In one embodiment, the fiber optic line sensor  may be wound with a weak binder to prevent the fiber optic line sensor from unraveling. Alternatively, the fiber optic line sensor  is freely wound. In another embodiment, the fiber optic line sensor  is pre-twisted or precision wound to ensure that the fiber optic line sensor pays out straight without tangles and loops along a length once the fiber optic line sensor is deployed on the seafloor.","In one embodiment, a winding drum is contained inside the spool section  to assist with and to contain the loose winding of the fiber optics when a binder is not used. In this situation, finger strips (not shown) are placed inside the winding drum to separate layers or rows of the concentrically coiled line sensor. As the fiber optic line sensor  deploys, the fiber optic line sensor pays out from the concentrically-coiled winding drum while moving back and forth similar to the operation of a fishing reel.","The electronics canister section , the antenna section  and the spool section  are suspended beneath launch vehicles using at least one section support band  attached to each section. As illustrated in , each section support band  is arranged as a cylindrical sleeve that encircles a section of the deployment system and includes a plurality of fasteners  (for example, a plurality of nut and bolt fasteners) to constrict the band around the section and secure the section support band . Supports run from the section support bands  to the launch vehicle . These supports include quick release shackles  running between the launch vehicle  and the antenna section  and the electronics canister section  and one rigid mount  running between the launch vehicle and the spool section .","Referring now to , the two mechanical quick release shackles  are used to support the weight of the electronics canister section  and the antenna section  underneath the launch vehicle . In one embodiment, each quick release shackle  is attached to one of the bolt fasteners . Once the launch vehicle  reaches a designated location, a linear actuator attached to the launch vehicle pulls a cord that is attached to a release mechanism  on each one of the quick release shackles . This pulling causes the two quick release shackles  to open. The quick release shackles  are activated at the same time, such that the assembly is simultaneously released at both points and falls away from the launch vehicle  in a generally straight and level fashion.","The rigid mount  is disposed between the spool section  and the launch vehicle \u2014for example, attaching to one of the bolt fasteners . The rigid mount  does not release the spool section  from the launch vehicle  when the quick release shackles  release the electronics canister section  and the antenna section . As the launch vehicle  moves away from the electronics canister section  that has been released from the launch vehicle and is resting on the ocean bottom, the spool section  moves along with the launch vehicle. This relative movement between the electronics canister section  and the spool section  dispenses the fiber optic line sensor . The launch vehicle  travels in a predetermined pattern laying down the fiber optic line sensor  in accordance with that predetermined pattern. Once the launch vehicle  has traveled the full length of the fiber optic line sensor , the free end of the fiber optic line sensor falls out of the spool section . This disconnects the fiber optic line sensor  from the launch vehicle . The launch vehicle  returns to the rendezvous point.","A loose interface is maintained between the electronics canister section  and the spool section  such that they are not rigidly connected. This allows the electronics canister section  and the antenna section  to freely separate from the spool section  and fall away from the launch vehicle  when the quick release shackles  are opened.","The curved shape of the protective cover  on the forward end of the electronics canister section  has another purpose. The curved shape of the protective cover  is used to force the electronics canister section  and antenna section  away from the spool section  as the protective cover falls away from the launch vehicle . Because the protective cover  is curved, the cover extends inside of the spool section . As such, the protective cover  cannot fall straight down. The protective cover  must push back and away as the protective cover falls away from the spool section . By doing so, the fiber optic line sensor  is prevented from being sheared off as the electronics canister section  slides past the spool section .","The fiber optic line sensor  is used to sense the pressure fluctuations that are created by a passing surface ship or submarine. The fiber optic line sensor  has a tensile strength that is strong enough to prevent the fiber optic line sensor from breaking under deployment tensile loads. The fiber optic line sensor  is also negatively buoyant such that the fiber optic line sensor will sink and pull out of the spool section  as the fiber optic line sensor falls to the seafloor.","The mechanical spring band  is used to connect the antenna section  to the electronics canister section . In one embodiment, the mechanical spring band  is secured using a safety clip and lock. The spring band  is locked in place when the sections are assembled. The locks remain in place while the sections are being handled and loaded underneath the launch vehicle . The locks are removed after the deployment system is prepared for final deployment. At that point, the safety clips prevent the spring bands  from releasing. The lanyard  removes the safety clips once the electronics canister section  and the antenna section  have fallen a predetermined distance from the launch vehicle . The spring band  is then released. The release allows the antenna section  to separate from the electronics canister section  and ascend to the surface. The spring band  remains attached to the electronics canister section  at a hinge point.","Once the lanyard  has reached the end of its length, the lanyard will pull a safety clip (not shown) off the mechanical spring band . Once the safety clip is removed, the lanyard  retracts back into a housing to avoid entanglement with the propulsion system of the launch vehicle .","The launch vehicle  is capable of delivering the antenna section  and the electronics canister section  to a shallow water coastal environment. In addition, the launch vehicle  lays down the fiber optic line sensor  in a prescribed pattern. In one embodiment, the launch vehicle  includes a linear actuator (not shown) that is connected, via a cord, to the quick release shackles . Once in position, the launch vehicle  operates the linear actuator and starts deploying the fiber optic line sensor .","The deployment system of the present invention minimizes the tensile load placed on the fiber optic line sensor  by loosely winding the sensor and by using a weak binder. Other methods, which make use of a capstan, place much greater loads on the sensor. By deploying the fiber optic line sensor  from a loose winding, the tensile loads are limited to the strength of the binder and the comparatively small inertial loads created by the weight of the sensor . The only other loads that are experienced by the sensor  are friction loads and water resistance loads.","Another operational advantage of the fiber optic deployment system is coastal accessibility. The fiber optic deployment system does not have to be deployed from surface ships or submarines that do not have access to shallow water coastal areas. The deployment system of the present invention can be used in areas as shallow as fifteen feet. The deployment system of the present invention can include a reflective coating on the exterior of sections to mirror the surroundings of the deployment system.","The deployment system of the present invention can be used with various launch vehicle platforms. The deployment system can be deployed from surface ships, small boats, helicopters, and planes, in addition to being deployed from a large UUV.","The ends of the electronic canister section  are arranged with protective covers. The protective covers act as a damage avoidance system and minimize shock loads during bottom impact. The protective covers also prevent the electronics canister section  from landing upright and vertical after deployment. In addition, the protective sections prevent the fiber optic line sensor  and the buoyant antenna cable from being pinched or damaged when the electronics canister section hits the seafloor.","When the launch vehicle is a large UUV, the quick release shackles  are actuated by a linear actuator and the lanyard  releases the spring band. A slight modification to these features may be necessary for some of the alternative deployment options. If the launch vehicle is a surface ship or craft, the quick release shackles  and lanyard  would not be necessary as the electronics canister section and buoy antenna section could be tossed over the side of the surface ship. The fishline spool section may be hung over the side. The ship would then pay out the fiber optic line sensor  in much the same way as the large UUV.","If the launch vehicle is an aircraft, the quick release shackles  and lanyard  would not be necessary. The electronics canister section  and the antenna section  could be thrown from the aircraft. The spool section  would remain with the aircraft in an analogous way as the large UUV.","The fiber optic sensor deployment system is arranged for containment inside a cylinder, which is compatible with all submarine torpedo tubes. In the submarine deployment application, no quick release shackles or lanyards would be necessary. The sections are deployed using the same weapon ejection system used for torpedoes. The spool section  would remain inside the torpedo tube while the antenna section  and electronics canister section  is ejected.","Referring to , an embodiment of a deployment system in accordance with the present invention including an UUV is illustrated deploying the fiber optic line sensor . Initially, the quick release shackles attached to the buoyant antenna section  and the electronics canister section  are triggered and these two sections fall away from the UUV. The lanyard attached to the UUV and the spring band extends and the electronics canister section  begins to pull the fiber optic line sensor  from the spool section . The spool section  remains attached to the UUV by a fixed mount.","As shown in , when the lanyard  extends to a full length, the spring band  is opened. This allows the positively buoyant antenna section  to separate from the negatively buoyant electronics canister section . The electronics canister section  falls to the ocean floor and the antenna section  continues to rise to the surface; thereby, extending a communication cable between the two sections (). The fiber optic line sensor  continues dispense from the spool section  as the UUV moves away in accordance with a predefined path. The antenna section  reaches the surface where the antenna section can broadcast to a receiving station and the UUV follows the prescribed path until the length of the fiber optic line sensor  is dispensed ().","It will be understood that many additional changes in details, materials, steps, and arrangements of parts which have been described herein and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals and symbols designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 14"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
