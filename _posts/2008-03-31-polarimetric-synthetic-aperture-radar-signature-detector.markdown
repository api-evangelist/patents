title: Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar signature detector
abstract: A method is provided for processing an acquired polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image of a region to identify a candidate pixel that correlates to a target representation. The polarimetric SAR image is composed of a plurality of pixels, and the candidate pixel corresponds to a position in the region that contains a candidate object. The process includes deconstructing J parameter components each sample, obtaining acquired values for the image from select parameter components, acquiring reference values that characterize said parameter components for the target representation, determining distance values each reference value and each acquired value, comparing the distance values against a classification criterion to determine whether the candidate pixel conforms to the target representative. The process may further include extracting N sub-apertures from the polarimetric SAR image, and combining the distance values for the sub-apertures together to obtain distance summations for comparison. The process may additionally include multiplying the distance summations with their corresponding weighting factors to obtain weighted results and combining these to produce a weighted log-likelihood function that identifies whether the pixel conforms to the target. Determining a difference may further include subtracting reference values from their respective acquired values to respectively obtain set of differences, assigning normalized defaults to the differences in response to the difference having a specified relation to parameter thresholds, and otherwise normalizing the difference, and determining natural logs of unity minus said each difference to obtain their distance values.

In particular, this invention enables accurate detection and monitoring of objects with specific sizes and shapes across a wide area imaged by a polarimetric SAR platform.","SAR is a coherent, microwave imaging radar system with day, night and all-weather capabilities. SAR systems provide high resolution imagery over wide areas under conditions of poor visibility, which make them useful in target detection, tracking and monitoring applications. SAR systems can collect data in three modes: strip-map mode (i.e., antenna pointed in a fixed direction relative to the flight path), spot-light mode (i.e., antenna maneuvered during data collection to radiate only a desired area of terrain), or scan mode (i.e., antenna maneuvered during data collection to radiate a desired swath at any arbitrary angle relative to the flight path). Also, SAR systems can be used in the interferometric mode to obtain high resolution digital terrain elevation information over the imaged area. SAR systems can be installed on airborne and\/or satellite platforms.","A polarimetric SAR system transmits and receives pulses with both horizontal & vertical polarizations. Polarimetric SAR imagery consists of two, three or four independent channels of complex data (amplitude plus phase) consisting of HH (Horizontal transmit, Horizontal receive), HV (Horizontal transmit, Vertical receive), VV (Vertical transmit, Vertical receive), and VH (Vertical transmit, Horizontal receive). For a fully polarimetric or quad-polarization SAR system (four channels), all four combinations HH, HV, VV and VH are employed. In the case of three channels, either VH or HV is dropped. Two channel systems exist where there is one transmit polarization and dual receive channels (HH and HV combination or VV and VH combination). The complex, 2\u00d72 polarimetric scattering matrix of each individual source of radiation scatter (or \u201cscatterer\u201d) is represented by the returns from all four channels HH, HV, VH, VV. The scatterer response is reciprocal if and only if the condition HV=VH holds.","One conventional method for utilizing the extra information in polarimetric SAR produces a false color image in which each pixel has a red-green-blue (rgb) value based on the HH, HV, and VV amplitudes at that pixel. This method ignores the phase information contained in the polarimetric SAR data and has some limited utility in classifying ground cover over large areas. The typical approach to exploiting the polarimetric SAR data applies a decomposition transformation to the three or four complex (i.e., real plus imaginary) numbers associated with each pixel in the complex SAR image(s). Standard decompositions include Huynen, Freeman-Durdin, Cameron, Touzi, Krograger and Cloude, used by the technical community with proponents for each. These apply a non-linear transformation to the complex numbers associated with a pixel and classifying the result as one of a small number of basic scattering center types. For example, the Cameron decomposition classifies all symmetric scatterers (i.e., scatterers that have an axis of symmetry in the plane orthogonal to the radar's line of sight) as either trihedral, dihedral, cylinder, narrow diplane, dipole; or quarter wave.","For all of the standard decomposition approaches, each pixel gets classified as one of the scattering types defined by the decomposition used. However, no conventional mechanism is available to determine the validity of the classification. In most cases, there are multiple scattering centers in the resolution cell (e.g., pixel), and the classification is performed based on the combined return from the multiple scattering centers irrespective of the actual shape of any of the scattering centers in the resolution cell\/pixel. This in turn leads to an unacceptably high false alarm rate when trying to detect any specific objects.","Independent of polarimetric SAR, a well known technique is to convert a full resolution SAR image into a sequence of lower resolution sub-aperture images that can be displayed as a short movie loop. This sequence looping has provides a visual cue to stationary scattering centers as well as speckle phenomena and non-stationary scattering centers. This has significantly aided manual analysis of single polarization SAR images, but has not resulted in any significant automated analysis methods to date. Sub-apertures can be formed in either the \u201cfast time\u201d (swath-range) or \u201cslow time\u201d (cross-range, azimuth) dimensions. Another well known technique incoherently averages sub-aperture images (for a single polarization) to produce a \u201cmulti-look\u201d image having reduced speckle (i.e., the graininess associated with SAR imagery).","Conventional target identification techniques using SAR images yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, various exemplary embodiments provide procedures for identifying a candidate pixel in a polarimetric SAR image composed of pixels for a region that correlates to a target representation.","Various exemplary embodiments extract N sub-apertures from the polarimetric SAR image, derive J parameter components from each sub-aperture, obtain acquired values for that sub-aperture from select parameter components, acquire reference values that characterize the parameter components for the target representation, determine distance values between the reference and acquired values, combine the distance values d for the sub-apertures together to obtain distance summations, compare the distance summations against a classification criterion to determine whether the candidate pixel conforms to the target representation or target signature.","Distance values d may be determined by subtracting reference values from their respective acquired values, adjusting the resulting differences D to fall in the range [0,1] in response to the difference having a specified relation to parameter thresholds, and finally computing the natural logs of unity minus each difference, i.e., In (1\u2212D). The process may further multiply the distance summations \u03a3d with their corresponding weighting factors w to obtain weighted results and combine these to produce a weighted log-likelihood function Lthat identifies whether the pixel conforms to the target.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of various exemplary embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which various exemplary embodiments may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Various exemplary embodiments provide capability to detect and monitor objects with specific sizes and shapes in polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. This enables screening of large geographic areas for specific objects of interest and monitoring the presence of those objects over time. Various exemplary embodiments provide an enhanced detection capability while simultaneously reducing the false alarm rate by many orders of magnitude. Whereas the conventional techniques allow the classification of scattering centers by shape, exemplary embodiments estimate the size as well as the shape of these scatterers.","I. SAR Description: Beginning with a simplified description of SAR data collection geometry, the examples described herein relate to an airborne SAR system.  show cross-range (or travel direction)  and slant-range (or lateral)  views, respectively, of the exemplary airborne configuration with a side-looking SAR-equipped platform (e.g., aircraft)  collecting data over a terrain (e.g., ground)  in the strip-map mode.  shows the cross-range or azimuth viewing angles and as the SAR platform  travels forward from first to second positions to , the distance traveled forming a synthetic aperture (i.e., length) . Intersection of the either viewing angle or (sometimes referred to as antenna beam width) with the ground  yields the cross-range or azimuth extent  along the ground . The synthetic aperture  corresponds to the distance the SAR platform  covers during the period in which a target (or scatterer)  can be observed from the forward extent of the azimuth view angle on the platform's approach to the aft extent of the azimuth view angle upon its departure. This longer synthetic aperture  enables the SAR to achieve a much finer cross-range resolution than is available from a smaller physical antenna.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 2"],"b":["180","120","130","190","130","180"]},"SAR determines slant-range from the platform  to the target  by measuring the round-trip-time from a first event when the platform  transmits a pulse to the target  to a second event when the pulse returns from the target  back to the platform  (i.e., the round trip pulse propagation time). As with other types of radar systems, the SAR range resolution is a function of the transmitted pulse width. A balancing trade-off may be considered and implemented between achieving finer range resolution by transmitting a shorter duration pulse and a high signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio (for enhancing target detectability) by transmitting a longer duration pulse. A matched filter'receiver with a proper transmit waveform (e.g., chirped pulse) enables both high range resolution and high SNR to be achieved by employing pulse compression techniques to decouple range resolution from the transmitted pulse length. For this case, the range resolution only depends on the frequency bandwidth of the transmitted pulse, making possible the use of longer duration, higher energy pulses to achieve high SNR, while achieving finer range resolution by increasing the frequency bandwidth.","SAR system may be distinguished from other radar systems by SAR's ability to accomplish much finer cross-range or azimuth resolution. Fine azimuth resolution with a physical antenna necessitates extending antenna length in the azimuth direction to often impractical dimensions. The SAR system synthesizes a large antenna length in the azimuth direction by moving the platform  with respect to the target . The along-track motion (or flight-path trajectory) of the platform , combined with a relatively large antenna beam-width, can record a large number of radar returns from each target  on the ground  while passing through the antenna aperture on the platform . The large synthetic aperture  thus forms along the platform's trajectory, whose length is determined by the along track separation of the points at which the target  may be acquired and then lost.","Targets at different azimuth positions produce echoes or returns at different Doppler frequencies. Just as the measured round-trip time of the pulse traveling from the platform  to the target  and back determines the target's position in the slant-range direction, the Doppler frequency shift of the returned signal determines the cross-range or azimuth position of the target . As the target  passes through the synthetic aperture , the large number of radar returns from each target  on the ground  are collected by coherent (in phase and in quadrature) demodulation to preserve their relative phases. These returns may be processed into an image by individually adjusting their phases and adding them coherently in a fashion mathematically similar to that used to focus data from an array antenna. This process may produce a two-dimensional (i.e., slant-range and azimuth) SAR image, consisting of pixels having values with complex quantities to denote both magnitude and phase.","II. SAR Image Processing:  show images relating to the transformation of SAR raw data to a resolvable (i.e., viewable) image. These images were collected in July 1994 over Half Moon Bay, Calif., by the NASA\/JPL airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar system, AIRSAR.  show complex (i.e., amplitude and phase) L-band HH SAR images  under progressive processing.  shows an intensity image  for raw SAR data with orthogonal image axis vectors slant-range  and cross-range (or azimuth or flight path in this case) . The results of the two main stages of SAR raw data processing, namely range compression and azimuth compression, are shown in . The slant-range  and azimuth  directions are also shown in these figures.  shows an intensity image  produced by range compression of the complex SAR raw data.  shows an intensity image  with additional azimuth compression of the complex range-compressed SAR data. An outlined rectangle  is highlighted as enlarged in corner image  to provide detail of the pixel return from an 8-ft triangular trihedral corner reflector placed at the Half Moon Bay airport as a calibration device.","Other stages in raw data processing may also be introduced for motion compensation and auto focusing, which improve the quality of processed images by removing blurring due to motion and other effects. The output of a full-aperture SAR raw data processor may be a complex SAR image, generally referred to as the Single-Look Complex (SLC) image. The next step after processing the data in all four polarimetric channels (i.e., HH, HV, VH and VV) into SLCs may be to accurately register them and then perform polarimetric calibration (i.e., phase calibration, cross-talk removal, amplitude calibration and channel gain imbalance correction) to correct for instrumentally induced errors in the phase and amplitude relationships between the polarization channels. Accurate polarimetric registration and calibration is essential in ensuring that the results of polarimetric decomposition reflect the true nature of the scattering target or scatterer.","III. Cameron Polarimetric Decomposition and Classification: Polarimetric SAR data may be transformed or decomposed into a new set of observable variables by a variety of techniques. Cameron Coherent Decomposition represents an example of such pixel element transformation to generate a set of observable variables. See W. L. Cameron, N. N. Youssef and L. K. Leung, \u201cSimulated Polarimetric Signatures of Primitive Geometrical Shapes\u201d, , vol. 34, no. 3, pp. 793-803, May 1996. This reference coherently decomposes an arbitrary complex scattering matrix into three mutually orthogonal components, consisting of a nonreciprocal component, a maximum symmetric component, and a minimum symmetric component. Each Cameron decomposition component has representative parameters that are related to the physical properties of the target (e.g., scatterer type, target orientation), thereby providing an advantage. The Cameron decomposition parameters considered in this approach include the Symmetric Scatterer Type (denoted by z), Maximum Symmetric Normalized Amplitude (denoted by a), Symmetry Angle (denoted by \u201ctau\u201d or \u03c4), Reciprocity Angle (denoted by \u201ctheta\u201d or \u03b8) and Symmetry Weight (denoted by s).","The Cameron polarimetric classification technique classifies a symmetric scatterer (i.e., a scatterer that has an axis of symmetry in the plane orthogonal to the radar's line of sight) as either trihedral, dihedral, cylinder, narrow diplane, dipole, or quarter wave depending on where its scatterer type value falls within the complex (i.e., real and imaginary axes) Unit Disc representing the Symmetric Scatterer Space. In this classification scheme, the complex Unit Disc is divided into six distinct sub-regions, with each region representing the six elementary shapes: trihedral, cylinder, dipole, narrow diplane, dihedral and quarter-wave device. A trihedral return (or a return signal resulting from an odd number of \u201cbounces\u201d) prevails in the natural world and therefore not indicative of an artificial (i.e., man-made) target artifact. Trihedral corner reflectors (three orthogonal plates connected along common edges), flat plates, and spheres are common examples of objects that produce trihedral returns.","The ideal trihedral return is represented by the complex scatterer type (+1, 0) in the complex Unit Disc. A dihedral return (or a return signal resulting from an even number of \u201cbounces\u201d) is the more prevalent return from artificial objects. An example of a dihedral shape is an object with two relatively flat surfaces of comparable size sharing a single edge at a 90\u00b0 angle. The ideal dihedral return is represented by the complex scatterer type (\u22121, 0) in the complex Unit Disc. A cylinder return, representative of curved surfaces, resembles a trihedral return but weaker in either the HH or VV component of its return. Similarly, a narrow-diplane return resembles a dihedral return but weaker in one its component directions. An example of a narrow-diplane shape is a dihedral object whose component plates have a smaller width than length (or vice versa). The ideal cylinder and ideal narrow-diplane returns are represented by the scatterer type values (+\u00bd, 0) and (\u2212\u00bd, 0) in the complex Unit Disc, respectively. An ideal dipole, represented by the scatterer type (0, 0), has a return in only one direction, either HH or VV but not both. A quarter-wave device has a return characterized by a delay (represented by a phase shift) between its HH and VV components. The ideal quarter-wave device return is represented by two equivalent scatterer types (0, +i) and (0, \u2212i) in the complex Unit Disc (where i=\u221a\u22121). An example of a quarter-wave device is a pipe mounted perpendicular to a flat plate.","IV. Deconstruction Approach: The process operations for generating Single-Look Complex (SLC) imagery, subdividing these images into sub-aperture data, deconstructing the information into characteristic features, and performing signature analysis are described in  and supplemental steps that follow. Processing the complex-valued SAR image (or the SLC), in various exemplary embodiments yields a set of sub-aperture complex images using conventional SAR processing techniques. Each sub-aperture image has lower resolution than the original and corresponds to a different view angle and\/or frequency range in the chirped pulse. The target resolution of each sub-aperture image corresponds to the size of the scattering center for screening. Excess bandwidth is transformed into more sub-apertures rather than used for higher resolution. This ensures maximum signal to clutter for the targeted scattering centers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","410","420","410","420","422","424","426","428","422","426","424","120","428","430","420","440","430","450"]},"Polarimetric calibration effectively estimates and removes the effect of each polarimetric channel relative to others and involves phase calibration, cross-talk removal, amplitude calibration and channel-gain-imbalance correction. Phase calibration corrects for instrument-induced errors in the phase relationships between the channels. Cross-talk may be caused by imperfections in the radar antenna, resulting in impure polarization states for the individual polarization combinations measured directly by the hardware. Amplitude calibration and channel-gain-imbalance correction are performed using backscatter measurements from known targets to correct for residual amplitude offsets in the various polarization channels and to correct for absolute gain of the radar system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","510","520","530","540"]},"After the formation of the registered and calibrated SLC images , a Sub-Aperture Processor  (shown in greater detail in ) creates sub-aperture complex images for each polarimetric channel using conventional SAR processing techniques.

The Log-Likelihood Processor  generates a matrix of Candidate Scatterers  (corresponding to pixel positions in the SAR image) along with their likelihood values. Each identified scatterer denotes a target-candidate to be further investigated.

The first step in this Process  uses the Weighted Log-Likelihood Processor  to generate target-specific detection metrics or likelihood values for each scatterer in the SAR image. The weighted Log-Likelihood Processor  includes a Likelihood Generator , which determines a likelihood function value , and a Maximizing Processor  to determine the pixel having the maximum likelihood value.","The Likelihood Generator  receives the Measured Radar Data , Theoretical Data  and Auxiliary Data  as inputs and calculates a target-specific weighted log-likelihood Lfor each offset k between theoretical and measured sub-apertures. The Maximizer  then selects the maximum among all likelihoods (associated with the k offsets) calculated for each scatterer and outputs the result into a Maximum Likelihood.

A target-specific threshold operator  can subsequently be applied as detection threshold to discard all scatterers with unacceptably low likelihood values. The remaining \u201cDetected\u201d or \u201cCandidate\u201d Scatterers with their corresponding Target-Specific Likelihood Values  then provide the basis for detecting and discriminating the size and\/or shape of the object or target of interest.","V. Signature Determination: Each of the decomposition observables for each of the sub-apertures may be treated as an independent observation. Depending on the amount of overlap of the sub-apertures, this may not be strictly true but nonetheless represents a useful statistical assumption. The signature consists of a weighted log-likelihood computation where the likelihood for each observation is based on the observed variable's distance from the theoretical response for the target scattering center type. The distance in each case is a nonlinear function whose parameters are determined through the use of acquired data in order to account for the operational performance of the sensor. Weights (i.e., weighting factors) for the weighted log-likelihood may be determined by the relative importance of the observables.","For the distance function, the computed distance imposes a zero difference between the theoretical value of the observable and the expected departure from that value due to system noise and collateral (i.e., non-target) artifacts. As the difference in values increases, the distance function typically follows in a monotonic fashion. A simple distance function that satisfies these requirements is called a nonlinear ramp function. For each pixel, the weighted log-likelihood function may be computed for different sub-aperture offsets in order to align the actual response with the theoretical response based on the actual orientation of the scattering center. This enables the response change to be exploited as a function of orientation and produces an estimate of the orientation of the scattering center.","The preference for the offset variable is exemplified by the glint off of a flat plate that occurs for a sensor that is perpendicular thereto. The largest amplitude occurs at broadside and decreases away from broadside in a manner dependent on the size of the plate relative to the wavelength of the radiation used. In a SAR image, the aperture can be anything from a few degrees to more than 45\u00b0 or \u00bc\u03c0. The orientation of the plate (or more generally the scattering center) may not be known \u00e0 priori, so multiple offsets may have to be implemented corresponding to different angles away from the aperture center for where the response peaks.","The resultant log-likelihood can be compared to a detection threshold to provide simple detections, or the log-likelihood values can be retained to provide a ranking of detections in a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) application. For a given scattering center type, signatures may be applied based on variations in size and shape, thereby providing a viable means to discriminate both the size and shape of an object of interest. The various decompositions provide features that form the basis for discriminating shape, while the amplitude falloff provides the basis for discriminating the size of a particular shape. This approach also enables a new type of change detection to be performed. Because the orientation of detected scattering centers may be determined, subsequent SAR collections taken from different geometries can be processed and the resultant signature detections can be compared. This type of change detection has much less stringent collection conditions than Coherent Change Detection (CCD) or Two Color Multi-View.","VI. Summary of Advantages: The advantages from the various exemplary embodiments described herein include the following:\n\n","VII. Exemplary Ideal Dihedral Target Representation: Some exemplary results of the approach described herein are presented in this section. The chosen target of interest is a dihedral object or shape that is commonly present in many man-made objects.  shows an isometric Cartesian illustration  of a dihedral on a planar surface . The dihedral comprises a first plate  joined at an edge to a second plate , with the edge forming a perpendicular angle . The surface  is defined by the planar vectors {circumflex over (x)} and \u0177, and a normal vector {circumflex over (z)}. An edge vector \u00e2 where the plates join is coplanar with the surface  and is depicted in this example as parallel to planar vector \u0177. The first plate  is angularly tilted from the surface  along a plate vector {circumflex over (n)} perpendicular to the edge vector \u00e2. In this example, the first and second plates ,  are tilted from the surface  by an angle of 45\u00b0. Radar energy  may be directed towards the surface  and the dihedral plates ,  along a transmission vector {circumflex over (k)} (along the negative vertical or \u2212{circumflex over (z)} direction). This configuration, referred to as the broadside setup, ensures maximum radar return from the dihedral object. In terms of the radar look angles as specified by the azimuth and elevation angles, the broadside set up in this example has an azimuth angle of 0\u00b0 (zero) and an elevation angle of 45\u00b0.  illustrates an isometric representation  of a dipole visualization of an ideal dihedral. The dihedral can be represented by two dipoles , , separated by a distance \u0394r=\u03bb\/4 .

Decomposition Observables and Features: Exemplary implementations of the signature approach are described in Sections XI, XII and XIII. A plurality of N overlapping sub-aperture SAR images and their corresponding Cameron decomposition data sets are acquired. This example assumes 50% overlap between adjacent sub-apertures. Thus, for a given pixel, an observation space may consist of N ordered Cameron feature sets, with each set consisting of the following parameter list: (z, a, \u03c4, s)|where subscript Q represents acquired data (measured or simulated) and subscript\/counts sub-apertures from 1 to N. In the exemplary embodiments described herein, Cameron's symmetric scatterer Orientation Angle, \u03c8(\u2212\u03c0\/2\u2266\u03c8\u2266\u03c0\/2), measured relative to radar's line-of-sight, is presently not used as an observable for the maximum log-likelihood detectors. In addition for the exemplary embodiments, the Symmetric Scatterer Type zcounts as two parameters, with its real (Re) and imaginary (Im) components considered as separate parameters.","Parameters for data acquired for each pixel are defined such that: zis Symmetric Scatterer Type having a complex value, ais maximum symmetric normalized amplitude, \u03c4is symmetry angle, \u03b8is reciprocity angle, and sis symmetry weight. The complex-valued Symmetric Scatterer Type can be expressed as z=(Re(z), Im(z)) and |z|\u22661. The Maximum Symmetric Normalized Amplitude has the limits a\u03b5(0,1), where max {a|}=1. The symmetry angle has limits 0\u2266\u03c4\u2266\u03c0\/4 in which \u03c4=0 represents a symmetric scatterer and \u03c4=\u03c0\/4 represents an asymmetric scatterer. The reciprocity angle has limits 0\u2266\u03b8\u2266\u03c0\/2 where \u03b8=0 represents a scatter that strictly obeys the reciprocity principle and \u03b8=\u03c0\/2 represents a scatterer that violates the reciprocity principle. The symmetry weight srepresents the ratio of the magnitude of the symmetric component of the sum of to the magnitude of all components of the scattering matrix. Thus, the shown feature list for acquired SAR data includes a plurality of J parameters, where J=6 for each sub-aperture i: Re(z), Im(z), a, \u03c4, \u03b8, s. Similarly, each log-likelihood detector, as described in Section XI, is defined as having M sub-apertures or components, with each sub-aperture consisting of the same six Cameron decomposition feature parameters listed above (z, a, \u03c4, \u03b8, s)|, where subscript R represents a specific target and subscript j counts detector sub-apertures from 1 to M.","Preferably, all detectors have their \u03c4|values set at 15\u00b0, \u03b8|values set at 9\u00b0, and s|values set at 0.5. This is because sub-aperture pixels that have \u03c4\u226715\u00b0 or s\u22670.5 are not considered to be adequate symmetric scatterers and hence are assigned very small likelihood values. Moreover, sub-aperture pixels that have \u03b8\u226715\u00b0 are not considered to be reciprocal scatterers and hence are also assigned very small likelihood values.","XI. Shape-Specific Log-Likelihood Detectors: An exemplary implementation of Weighted Log-Likelihood Detectors for four elementary shapes (edge glint, dihedral, trihedral, and quarter-wave device) is described in the following paragraphs. Note that this implementation was originally designed for one particular SAR system, the NASA\/JPL Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) system and uses particularly the Cameron decomposition (although other methods may be used instead). Because the AIRSAR system had a small bandwidth, this implementation does not include the size discrimination component except in the case of a Dihedral Detector described subsequently.","The Edge Glint Detector (e.g., for a wing boundary) is assumed to exhibit the following characteristics: (1) Maximum Symmetric Normalized Amplitude profile (a|) shows the brightest return occurring over one sub-aperture (or at most two adjacent sub-apertures) with rapid falloff over other sub-apertures; and (2) Symmetric Scatterer Type profile (z|) sets the Symmetric Scatterer Type of the brightest sub-aperture return to the complex value [0.25, 0.0], a value halfway between the Cameron Symmetric Scatterer Type values of an ideal dipole and an ideal Cylinder, and sets the Symmetric Scatterer Type values of all other sub-aperture returns to Not Classifiable (NC) or Unusable\/Invalid (i.e., their returns are assumed to be dominated by clutter). This detector can be implemented using an odd number of sub-apertures with symmetry about the middle sub-aperture (i.e., j=M\/2+1), which may be assigned the brightest return, or alternatively, using an even number of sub-apertures, with symmetry about the boundary joining the two middle sub-apertures (i.e., j=M\/2 and M\/2+1). Values for a three sub-aperture (i.e., M=3) and a four sub-aperture (i.e., M=4) implementations of an Edge Glint Detector are listed.

Similar to the Edge Glint Detector, the Dihedral Detector can be implemented using an odd number of sub-apertures with symmetry about the middle sub-aperture (i.e., j=M\/2+1), which may be assigned the brightest return, or alternatively using an even number of sub-apertures, with symmetry about the boundary joining the two middle sub-apertures (i.e., j=M\/2 and M\/2+1).

Single Scattering Center Phase History Reconstruction: A key aspect of the Polarimetric SAR signatures approach described herein is to use the change in the observables\/features (normally derived using a polarimetric decomposition technique) across the chirp (or range) and\/or across the synthetic aperture (or cross-range\/azimuth) in the detection process. As explained via the exemplary embodiments herein, one method of implementing this approach is to form a sequence of complex sub-aperture images in range and\/or cross-range from the Single-Look-Complex (SLC) image of each polarimetric SAR channel and compute the decomposition observables\/features separately for each sub-aperture image. This sub-aperture based method has the advantage of being expedient (e.g., fast and easy) to implement, but has two main disadvantages that in some cases may affect the ability to detect and discriminate signatures. The first disadvantage involves trading spatial domain resolution for time domain resolution. In other words, spatial domain resolution is sacrificed in the process of obtaining additional information about the temporal changes in the signal. As an example, a complex image with one-meter cross-range resolution divided into four sub-apertures (with no spectral overlap in the frequency domain) yields four lower resolution sub-aperture images, each having a cross-range resolution of four meters. To the extent that bandwidth or synthetic aperture can be spared, the lower spatial resolution of the sub-aperture images, however, might not actually present a disadvantage. The second disadvantage is that sub-aperture processing results in a very coarse temporal sampling of the observables or features used in signature detections as well as in the averaging of the observable values.","Although these disadvantages do not prevent the useful processing of polarimetric SAR data into signature detections, the desire to overcome these limitations has led to the development of an improved method for extracting signatures as described herein. This improved method is useful upon making a potential detection, so the sub-aperture based signatures approach can serve as a pre-screener (with somewhat looser detection settings than before). With this potential detection, a variation of Rihaczek's approach, described below, may be employed to analyze the radar return signals in manners unique to conventional treatments.","The exemplary steps include performing the following steps, for each of the polarimetric SAR Single-Look Complex images (i.e., SLC, SLC, SLC, SLCor the available subset):","(i) Fourier Transform the complex image;","(ii) Reduce the dimensions of the frequency domain image as required to remove any zero padding (typically about 20% to meet the Nyquist requirement);","(iii) If the data has not been previously windowed, apply a suitable window function (e.g., Hanning);","(iv) Inverse Fourier Transform to the original (complex) spatial domain;","(v) Extract one-dimensional cuts in range and cross-range through each potential signature detection for analysis. The cuts may preferably be 16 pixels long, approximately centered on the peak of interest.","Subsequently, for each one-dimensional cut, the following steps can be performed:","(vi) On each side of the peak of interest in the one dimensional cut, find the inflection points and zero every bin outside the inflection points;","(vii) Fourier Transform the result, zero pad by a factor of eight, and inverse Fourier Transform, producing an interpolated time domain version of the original peak;","(viii) Add a factor of eight zero padding to the result of step (vi), and Fourier Transform, producing an interpolated frequency domain representation of the peak of interest;","(ix) Divide the result of step (viii) by the window function applied earlier (step iii) to obtain a close approximation to the actual phase history of the scattering center across the synthetic aperture (for a cut in cross-range) or across the chirp (for a cut in range).","The graphs in  illustrate the expected amplitude response of an ideal dihedral in both time and frequency domains at different stages of performing steps (i) through (ix). The data samples for these plots were synthetically generated using full-wave electromagnetic simulations, which recorded the complex (phase and magnitude) backscattering response of an ideal dihedral with an edge size equal to one meter, positioned at broadside with respect to the radar transmitter\/receiver (e.g., in a monostatic system) for a transmission frequency interval ranging from linearly from 200 to 450 MHz (i.e., a frequency ramp or \u201cchirp\u201d). The line of sight distance between the dihedral and the radar was set at 100 meters to ensure a far-range response and the radiated signal was a plane-wave. The generated data points hence represent the frequency domain response of the dihedral to a chirp (or more precisely to a Linear Frequency-Modulated (FM) Chirp waveform after the application of range-compression) in the Mie region, a region in which the object size (in this case the dihedral's edge size) is comparable to, the radar wavelength:  presents a graph  of the simulation results, which is an example of the expected response in step (ii). The abscissa  represents frequencies in cycles-per-second (Hz), while the ordinate  represents amplitudes. Plotted curve  represents an ideal dihedral's HH amplitude response in the frequency domain to a linear FM chirp waveform after range compression. The amplitude response of the dihedral is non-stationary across the chirp in this case, and this variation can be exploited in the signature method described herein to discriminate the object's shape and size.","As a further observation, the dihedral response shown in  represents an example of a scattering center whose response is non-stationary in phase and in amplitude across the chirp. Variations in both the amplitude and phase responses defocus the return, causing the signal to progressively expand (i.e., spread out) in the spatial domain image with increasing non-stationary. The amplitude variation observed in graph  across the chirp along exemplifies the raw signal being utilized by the detectors in the signature method described herein. The response curve  can be adequately sampled to provide the signature detector with a more accurate representation of the dihedral's amplitude response in time than can be obtained using sub-aperture processing.","An example of the expected response in step (iii) is shown in . This figure presents a graph  showing the effect of applying a Hanning Window to the amplitude response curve  shown in . The abscissa  represents frequencies in Hz, while the ordinate  represents Hanning-windowed amplitudes. Curve  represents the Hanning-windowed HH amplitude response of an ideal dihedral in the frequency domain. An example of an expected response in step (i) is shown in . This figure shows a spatial (or time) domain amplitude response graph  which was derived by inverse Fourier transforming the response curve  shown in . The abscissa  represents time bins, while the ordinate  represents amplitudes. Curve  then represents the ideal dihedral's HH amplitude response in the spatial domain to a linear FM chirp waveform after range compression.","An example of an expected response in step (iv) is shown in . In this case, step (v) is also included, as the dihedral results are derived only at broadside (i.e., at azimuth angle of zero only or one cross-range cut).  shows a spatial domain amplitude response graph , where the abscissa  represents time bins, while the ordinate  represents amplitudes. Note that the range of the abscissa has been narrowed in this figure to show the response curves in more detail. Curve  is equivalent to curve  in , included in this figure for comparison purposes. Curve , derived by inverse Fourier transforming the response curve  shown in , represents the Hanning-windowed HH amplitude response of an ideal dihedral in the spatial domain. Comparing response curves  and , the application of a Hanning window in the frequency domain results in the widening of the main lobe and lowering the peak of the amplitude response in the spatial domain.","Performing steps (vi), (viii) and (ix) on response curve , the original frequency domain amplitude response can be closely reconstituted without loss of spatial resolution.  shows a graph  comparing the reconstituted and original frequency plots. The abscissa  represents frequencies in Hz, while the ordinate  represents amplitudes. Curve  is the original frequency spectrum, equivalent to curve  in , included in this plot for comparison purposes. Curve  is the reconstituted spectrum following the described approach. A comparison of curves  and  reveals that curve  presents a useful estimate of the original frequency response. This important result shows the possibility of recovery of interpolated versions of responses across the chirp and\/or synthetic aperture using this reconstruction method, without any loss in spatial domain resolution as would be the case with sub-aperture processing. Furthermore, as opposed to the coarse sampling achieved using sub-aperture processing, the variations in the amplitude response shown in graph  (in ) can be reasonably sampled at twenty or more locations to provide a more accurate and refined characterization of the response in time for use in the signature approach, as explained via the exemplary embodiments. This level of sampling, can be obtained without degrading spatial resolution and thereby adversely influencing the results.","XV. Implications: A sub-aperture image may be formed by extracting a complex image, Fourier transforming the image, zeroing all but a subset of the spectrum, and inverse Fourier transforming the result. However, the spectrum cannot then be used to recover signature information because the spectrum is a linear superposition of all the returns from all the scattering centers in the original complex image. By operating preferably in the image domain the amplitude and phase information can be recovered from the scattering center of interest. The approach of A. W. Rihaczek in -, Artech House\u00a9 1996, provides only an estimate of the frequency response of the scattering center of interest. However, performing a Fourier transform on a complex SAR image (with increasing range in the down direction), yields vertical frequency bins that correspond to the wavenumber responses to the different frequencies contained in the chirp. By contrast, the horizontal bins contain the wavenumber responses to the different azimuths sampled (by the individual pulses) across the synthetic aperture. In the case of a single scattering center, applying Rihaczek's approach results in the wavenumber responses of the scattering center as a function of azimuth and\/or chirp frequency. Most importantly, these responses can be sampled as densely (i.e., often within a sampling interval) as desired. Each frequency bin corresponds to the plane-wave response of the scattering center. In the case of a range cut, the response is integrated over azimuths, while in the case of a cross-range cut, the response is integrated over the chirp frequencies. The signature approach, as explained via the exemplary embodiments, uses the change in the polarimetric amplitudes and phases across the synthetic aperture and the chirp as well. This reconstruction approach allows recovery of accurate estimates of the plane-wave responses of the scattering center as a function of the azimuth and\/or chirp frequency as illustrated in .","XVI. Limitations and Information Theory: The accurate recovery of the plane-wave responses is based on separation of the response (peak) of the desired scattering center from the signal produced by other scattering centers. The signatures approach described via the exemplary embodiments herein prefers that the scattering center of interest be the dominant source of return energy in the resolution cell. The reconstruction approach allows the use of full resolution rather than reduced resolution (as is the case with the sub-aperture approach), where the probability of having multiple scattering centers within a resolution cell is much higher.","To address the information content of this reconstruction approach, a pure point response can be used as a limiting example, representing a sin c function in the original complex image. As an aside, a normalized sin c function for digital signal processing and communication theory may be expressed as",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0180","num":"0188"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00008","num":"00008"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"sin","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"c","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}}},"mo":"\u2261","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"sin","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["\u03c0","x"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}},{"mi":["\u03c0","x"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}]}},"mo":","}}},"br":{}},"XVII. Signature Derivation: The amplitude and phase of a scatterer's response by themselves provide only minimal information as exemplified by the pure point response. However, variations of the amplitude and phase of the response across the synthetic aperture and\/or chirp drive the signature detectors. For example, for a pure (i.e., idealized) point target, the signature information derives from the knowledge that both the amplitude and phase of the response remain constant across the synthetic aperture, whereas for the dihedral target, the signature information derives from the observed variations in both amplitude and\/or phase of the response across the chirp (as in ). Thus, both the change and its absence in the responses across the chirp and\/or synthetic aperture have the necessary information content to identify imaged candidates that correspond to a target scatterer. The signature method is driven by the quality of characterizing the variations in amplitude and phase responses with minimal or no loss in spatial resolution. Thus, the actual information content arises from adequate sampling of phase and amplitude information at multiple azimuth bins and using the sampled values in the signature analysis process. The Single Scattering Center Phase History Reconstruction provides a method for sampling responses at a high level across the synthetic aperture and\/or the chirp and to recover interpolated versions of these responses, without degrading spatial resolution and adversely influencing target detection and discrimination.","The signature approach described herein can be used with any of the polarimetric decomposition techniques. The theoretical responses can sometimes be derived and alternatively be determined with computational electromagnetic codes. The size and number of the sub-apertures can be chosen based on the bandwidth of the SAR system and the size of the desired objects to be detected and classified. The parameters in the distance functions used in the weighted log-likelihood function can be determined using collected data or estimated using a basic knowledge of SAR systems. These embodiments can preferably be used with virtually any two, three or four channel polarimetric SAR, and can be adapted to both high and low resolution\/bandwidth systems.","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art.
