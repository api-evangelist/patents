title: Sampling rate conversion system
abstract: A sampling rate conversion system reduces the signal processing burdens carried by cellular phones, headsets, and other electronic devices. Because the system consumes fewer resources to convert between signal sampling rates, the system may significantly reduce processing time and resource requirements in the device. As a result, the device may instead devote resources to performing other useful tasks, such as interacting with the user through a graphical user interface and performing selected processing tasks.

Technical Field","This disclosure relates to signal processing, and in particular, to sampling rates of signals.","2. Related Art","Electronic devices that communicate with one another process signals at different sampling rates. To use a signal, a device may need to convert a signal having one sampling rate into a signal having a different sampling rate. For instance, a Bluetooth headset for a cellular phone may up-sample the signal obtained from the cellular phone before the headset further processes the signal. In the context of telephony, signals are often band limited to between less than 300 Hz to 3.4 kHz, thereby severely limiting speech quality. Accordingly, pre-processing functions, such as increasing the sampling rate using interpolation, may be performed prior to an analysis done on the band limited signal in order to generate an extended bandwidth signal that supports enhanced speech quality.","Sampling rate conversion techniques, specifically up-sampling techniques, may use interpolation, such as Lagrange interpolation and cubic splines polynomial fitting. Other systems may convert between sampling rates by highly over-sampling a signal and choosing the closest artificially generated time sample. In these systems, the higher the over-sampling rate, the lower the corresponding error is, Some systems may use a quasi-continuous interpolation of individual samples x(n) of a continuous absolutely integrable signal x(t), employing the sinc function, to generate a signal value at the desired sampling time T, as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"maths":[{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["T","a"]}}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"\u221e"}},"mi":"\u221e"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"n"}},{"msub":{"mi":["h","s"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["T","a"]},{"mi":["nT","in"]}],"mo":"-"}}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}],"mo":"="},"mo":[",","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":{}},"mi":"with"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001-2","num":"00001.2"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["h","s"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"mrow":{"mi":"sin","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"c","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["f","in"]},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"t"}}}},"mo":":=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"sin","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["\u03c0","t"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["f","in"]}}}},{"mi":["\u03c0","t"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["f","in"]}}]}}],"mo":"="},"mo":","}}}],"br":{},"sub":["in ","in "]},"These systems and methods may require a large amount of resources. Some systems may need a long computing time to perform calculations. Other systems may require a large amount of memory to store sample information. Thus, sampling rate conversion remains a significant problem in modem signal processing systems and in modem devices that often have severely limited processing capability, memory resources, and power reserves.","Therefore, a need exists for an improved sampling rate conversion system.","A sampling rate conversion system decreases signal processing burden on cellular phones, headsets, and other electronic devices. Such devices may have limited processing, memory, and power resources. The conversion system in the device may consume significantly less computing time and memory resources to convert between sampling rates. Relieved of some of the signal processing burden, the device may instead execute other useful tasks and operations.","The sampling rate conversion system converts an input signal sampling rate to a different output signal sampling rate. The system may produce the output signal sampling rate by processing the input signal using up-sampling, filtering, time-delaying, weighting, and adding logic. The system may down-sample an intermediate signal to produce an output signal. The filtering may use a finite impulse response filter and convolution. A controller may choose appropriate weight factors and down-sample factors in order to create a correspondence between sampling instants of the input signal and sampling instants of the output signal at a chosen output signal sampling rate. The system may also convert time-dependent sampling rates of the output and\/or input signals by using buffers.","Other systems, methods, features and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the following claims.","A sampling rate conversion system adapts the sampling rate of an input signal into a different sampling rate for an output signal. The input signal may be a digital signal sampled from an analog signal at an input signal sampling rate. The system may generate an output signal from the input signal using logic that implements up-sampling, filtering, time-delaying, weighting, adding, and other operations. The system may also filter the signal during processing using a low-pass filter that may be a finite impulse response filter. The system may also down-sample an intermediate signal (such as the signal obtained by the adder) to produce the output signal. The system may generate time-dependent sampling rates for the output signal and\/or the input signal by using buffers or other logic. The sampling rate conversion system may use a relatively small amount of computing resources and memory, thereby freeing the device that processes the signal to devote more resources to other useful operations, such as interacting with a user through a graphical user interface, executing user commands, and other operations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","116","120","120","102","104","106","108","110","112","114","118"],"sub":["out","out ","in"]},"The up-sampler  may up-sample the input signal x(n) to a sampling rate f>fby a factor of L, where L is an integer, e.g., f=L f.

Parameters (e.g., conditions and thresholds), and other data structures may be separately stored and managed, may be incorporated into a single memory or database, or may be logically and physically organized in many different ways.
