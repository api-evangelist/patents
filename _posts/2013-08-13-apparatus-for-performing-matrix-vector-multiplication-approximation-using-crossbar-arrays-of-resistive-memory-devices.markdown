No. 61\/848,775 having been filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Dec. 19, 2012 and now incorporated by reference herein.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.","Matrix-vector multiplication is one of the most commonly used mathematical operations in science and engineering computations. Mathematically, a matrix is usually represented by a two-dimensional array of real numbers, and a vector is represented by a one-dimensional array of real numbers. Since a matrix can be viewed as an array of vectors, the matrix-vector multiplication operation can be generalized to vector-vector multiplication (inner product) or matrix-matrix multiplication operations. In today's computer systems, matrix-vector multiplication operations are performed by digital integrated circuits, in which the numbers are represented in binary format and the computation is performed by Boolean logic circuits.","The existence of resistive memory devices, such as the memristor, resistive random-access memory (RRAM), and spintronic switches, were predicted in circuit theory nearly forty years ago. However, it wasn't until 2008 that the first physical realization was demonstrated by HP Labs through a TiOthin-film structure. Afterward, many resistive memory materials and devices have been reported or rediscovered. The resistive memory device has many promising features, such as non-volatility, low-power consumption, high integration density, and excellent scalability. More importantly, the unique property to record the historical profile of the excitations on the device makes it an ideal candidate to perform storage and computation functions in one device.","For the purpose of succinct description, the present invention uses the terminology \u201cmemristor\u201d to represent the category of \u201cresistive memory device\u201d. For the remainder of the patent description, references to \u201cmemristor\u201d shall be regarded as referring to any \u201cresistive memory device\u201d.","Based on circuit theory, an ideal memristor with memristance M builds the relationship between the magnetic flux \u03c6 and electric charge q that passes through the device, that is, d\u03c6=M\u00b7dq. Since the magnetic flux and the electric charge are time dependent parameters, the instantaneous memristance varies with time and reflects the historical profile of the excitations through the device.","When developing actual memristive devices, many materials have demonstrated memristive behavior in theory and\/or experimentation via different mechanisms. In general, a certain energy (or threshold voltage) is required to enable a state change in a memristor. When the electrical excitation through a memristor is greater than the threshold voltage, e.g., |v|>|v|, the memristance changes. Otherwise, the memristor behaves like a resistor.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus that performs mathematical matrix-vector multiplication approximation.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus that utilizes resistive memory devices to store matrix coefficients so as to facilitate matrix-vector multiplication approximation.","It is yet a further object of the present invention to apply matrix-vector multiplication approximation to facilitate auto-associative neural network recall functionality.","Briefly stated, the present invention is an apparatus that performs mathematical matrix-vector multiplication approximation operations using crossbar arrays of resistive memory devices (e.g. memristor, resistive random-access memory, spintronics, etc.). A crossbar array formed by resistive memory devices serves as a memory array that stores the coefficients of a matrix. Combined with input and output analog circuits, the crossbar array system realizes the method of performing matrix-vector multiplication approximation with significant performance, area and energy advantages over existing methods and designs. This invention also includes an extended method that realizes the auto-associative neural network recall function using the resistive memory crossbar architecture.","In this invention, we describe a matrix-vector multiplication approximation hardware method and design based on crossbar arrays of resistive memory devices.","By nature, the memristor crossbar array is attractive for the implementation of matrix-vector multiplication operations. The crossbar array inherently provides capabilities for this type of operation. In this invention, we focus on a hardware architecture and realization of the matrix-vector multiplication approximation assuming all of the memristors have been pre-programmed to store the elements of the matrix. During the multiplication operations, the voltages across the memristors are constrained below the threshold voltage so that all the memristance values remain unchanged. The crossbar architecture can naturally transfer the weighted combination (matrix) of input voltages (input vector) to output voltages (output vector). We also describe a fast approximation mapping method so that the matrix can be mapped to pure circuit element relations.","As shown in , the proposed hardware method and design includes two crossbar arrays of resistive memory devices, M for positive elements of the matrix and M for negative elements of the matrix. The input vector is represented by the input voltages VI that are driving the row (horizontal) wires  of the crossbar arrays. The matrix-vector multiplication approximation resulting vector is represented by the outputs VO of the analog subtraction amplifier circuits  connected to the column (vertical) wires  of the crossbar arrays.","This invention also includes an extended method and design that realizes the auto-associative neural network recall function using the resistive memory crossbar architecture (see  and ). The Brain-State-in-a-Box (BSB) model recall operation will be used as an example to illustrate the method.","A. Crossbar Array Implementation of Matrix","Referring to , the present invention uses an N-by-M memristor crossbar array as a basic building block to achieve matrix-vector multiplication approximation computation functionality.","A set of input voltages VI={vi, vi, . . . , vi} are applied on each of the N word-lines (WLs)  of the array, and the current is collected through each of the M bit-lines (BLs)  by measuring the voltage across a sensing resistor . The same sensing resistors are used on all the BLs with resistance r, or conductance g=1\/r. The output voltage vector is VO={vo, vo, . . . , vo}. Assume the memristive device (i.e., memristor)  sitting on the connection between WLand BLhas a memristance of m. The corresponding conductance is g=1\/m. Then the relation between the input and output voltages can be approximated by:\n\n\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nHere, C is an MA-by-N matrix that can be represented by the memristors  and the sensing (load) resistors  as:\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"C","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["D","G"],"mo":"\u00d7"},{"mrow":[{"mi":"diag","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"d","mn":"1"},{"mi":["d","M"]}],"mo":[",","\u2062",","],"mi":"\u2026","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}}},{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"msub":{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mn":["1","1"],"mo":","}}},{"mi":"\u2026"},{"msub":{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":",","mi":"N"}}}]},{"mtd":[{"msub":{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mn":["2","1"],"mo":","}}},{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"msub":{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":",","mi":"N"}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mi":"\u22ee"},{"mi":"\u22f1"},{"mi":"\u22ee"}]},{"mtd":[{"msub":{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mi":"M","mo":",","mn":"1"}}},{"mi":"\u2026"},{"msub":{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mi":["M","N"],"mo":","}}}]}]}}],"mo":"\u00d7"}],"mo":"="}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["d","g","g","i=",". . . , M."],"sub":["i","s","k=1","i,k"],"sup":"N"},"Eq.

The memristor crossbar arrays have the same dimensions as the BSB weight matrix A transposed.","Summation-Subtraction Amplifiers:","In the present invention, the input signal v(t) along with v(t) and v(t), the corresponding voltage outputs of two memristor crossbar arrays , , are fed into a summation-subtraction amplifier . The design of the summation-subtraction amplifier circuit  can be found in .","Resulting from the decayed mapping method, the required v(t) and v(t) should be g\/gtimes of the generated v(t) and v(t), respectively. In the present invention R=R=R=1\/gand R=R=R=R=1\/g.

Meanwhile, each v(t+1)\u03b5V(t+1) is compared to vand \u2212vso that when vequals to either vor \u2212v, we deem the output i as having \u201cconverged\u201d. The recall operation stops when all N outputs reach convergence. In total, N comparators  are needed to cover all the outputs.","There are three major physical constraints in the circuit implementation: (1) For any v(0)\u03b5V(0), the voltage amplitude of initial input signal v(0) is limited by the input circuit; (2) boundary voltage vmust be smaller than vof memristors ; and (3) the summation-subtraction amplifier  has finite resolution.","In the BSB recall function, the ratio between boundaries of S(y) and the initial amplitude of x(0), x(0)\u03b5x(0) determines the learning space of the recall function. If the ratio is greater than the normalized value, the recall operation will take more iterations to converge with a higher accuracy. Otherwise, the procedure converges faster by lowering stability. Thus, minimizing the ratio of |v(0)| and vcan help obtain the best performance. However, the real amplifier has a finite resolution and vis limited within vof the memristor . Continuously reducing |v(0)| eventually will lose a significant amount of information in the recall circuit.","Having described preferred embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to these precise embodiments, and that various changes and modifications may be affected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
