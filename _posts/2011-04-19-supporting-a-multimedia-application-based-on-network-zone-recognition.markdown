title: Supporting a multimedia application based on network zone recognition
abstract: In an embodiment, a user equipment (UE) determines that a current serving network is associated with a network support zone of a given type, wherein network support zones of different types are characterized by different levels of support for a multimedia client application configured to manage server-arbitrated communication sessions at the UE. The UE loads zone-specific network procedures for supporting the multimedia client application within the network support zone of the given type, and then executes the zone-specific network procedures at the UE. In another embodiment, an application server determines that the current serving network of the UE is associated with the network support zone of the given type. The application server selects zone-specific network parameters and/or features based on the determination, and then interacts with the multimedia client application within the network support zone of the given type with the selected zone-specific network parameters and/or features.

Field of the Invention","Embodiments of the invention relate to supporting a multimedia application based on network zone recognition.","2. Description of the Related Art","Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations, including a first-generation analog wireless phone service (1G), a second-generation (2G) digital wireless phone service (including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks) and a third-generation (3G) high speed data\/Internet-capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use, including Cellular and Personal Communications Service (PCS) systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), the Global System for Mobile access (GSM) variation of TDMA, and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.","The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association\/Electronic Industries Association in TIA\/EIA\/IS-95-A entitled \u201cMobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d referred to herein as IS-95. Combined AMPS & CDMA systems are described in TIA\/EIA Standard IS-98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT-2000\/UM, or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000\/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA (W-CDMA), CDMA2000 (such as CDMA2000 1xEV-DO standards, for example) or TD-SCDMA.","In W-CDMA wireless communication systems, user equipments (UEs) receive signals from fixed position Node Bs (also referred to as cell sites or cells) that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Node Bs provide entry points to an access network (AN)\/radio access network (RAN), which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Therefore, the Node Bs generally interact with UEs through an over the air interface and with the RAN through Internet Protocol (IP) network data packets.","In wireless telecommunication systems, Push-to-talk (PTT) capabilities are becoming popular with service sectors and consumers. PTT can support a \u201cdispatch\u201d voice service that operates over standard commercial wireless infrastructures, such as W-CDMA, CDMA, FDMA, TDMA, GSM, etc. In a dispatch model, communication between endpoints (e.g., UEs) occurs within virtual groups, wherein the voice of one \u201ctalker\u201d is transmitted to one or more \u201clisteners.\u201d A single instance of this type of communication is commonly referred to as a dispatch call, or simply a PTT call. A PTT call is an instantiation of a group, which defines the characteristics of a call. A group in essence is defined by a member list and associated information, such as group name or group identification.","In an embodiment, a user equipment (UE) determines that a current serving network of the UE is associated with a network support zone of a given type, wherein network support zones of different types are characterized by different levels of support for a multimedia client application configured to manage server-arbitrated communication sessions at the UE. The UE loads a set of zone-specific network procedures for supporting the multimedia client application within the network support zone of the given type, and then executes the set of zone-specific network procedures at the UE. In another embodiment, an application server determines that the current serving network of the UE is associated with the network support zone of the given type. The application server selects a set of zone-specific network parameters and\/or features based on the determination, and then interacts with the multimedia client application within the network support zone of the given type with the selected set of zone-specific network parameters and\/or features.","Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.","The words \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d are used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term \u201cembodiments of the invention\u201d does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation.","Further, many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by, for example, elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)), by program instructions being executed by one or more processors, or by a combination of both. Additionally, these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus, the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms, all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition, for each of the embodiments described herein, the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as, for example, \u201clogic configured to\u201d perform the described action.","A High Data Rate (HDR) subscriber station, referred to herein as user equipment (UE), may be mobile or stationary, and may communicate with one or more access points (APs), which may be referred to as Node Bs. A UE transmits and receives data packets through one or more of the Node Bs to a Radio Network Controller (RNC). The Node Bs and RNC are parts of a network called a radio access network (RAN). A radio access network can transport voice and data packets between multiple access terminals.","The radio access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the radio access network, such core network including specific carrier related servers and devices and connectivity to other networks such as a corporate intranet, the Internet, public switched telephone network (PSTN), a Serving General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) Support Node (SGSN), a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN), and may transport voice and data packets between each UE and such networks. A UE that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more Node Bs may be referred to as an active UE, and can be referred to as being in a traffic state. A UE that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel (TCH) connection with one or more Node Bs can be referred to as being in a connection setup state. A UE may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel. A UE may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash device, external or internal modem, or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the UE sends signals to the Node B(s) is called an uplink channel (e.g., a reverse traffic channel, a control channel, an access channel, etc.). The communication link through which Node B(s) send signals to a UE is called a downlink channel (e.g., a paging channel, a control channel, a broadcast channel, a forward traffic channel, etc.). As used herein the term traffic channel (TCH) can refer to either an uplink\/reverse or downlink\/forward traffic channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","120","102","126","102","108","110","112","102","108","110","112"]},"Referring back to , the components of the wireless communications system  and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System  is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote UEs, such as wireless client computing devices , , ,  to communicate over-the-air between and among each other and\/or between and among components connected via the air interface  and RAN , including, without limitation, core network , the Internet, PSTN, SGSN, GGSN and\/or other remote servers.","The RAN  controls messages (typically sent as data packets) sent to a RNC . The RNC  is responsible for signaling, establishing, and tearing down bearer channels (i.e., data channels) between a Serving General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) Support Node (SGSN) and the UEs \/\/\/. If link layer encryption is enabled, the RNC  also encrypts the content before forwarding it over the air interface . The function of the RNC  is well-known in the art and will not be discussed further for the sake of brevity. The core network  may communicate with the RNC  by a network, the Internet and\/or a public switched telephone network (PSTN). Alternatively, the RNC  may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Typically, the network or Internet connection between the core network  and the RNC  transfers data, and the PSTN transfers voice information. The RNC  can be connected to multiple Node Bs . In a similar manner to the core network , the RNC  is typically connected to the Node Bs  by a network, the Internet and\/or PSTN for data transfer and\/or voice information. The Node Bs  can broadcast data messages wirelessly to the UEs, such as cellular telephone . The Node Bs , RNC  and other components may form the RAN , as is known in the art. However, alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated. For example, in another embodiment the functionality of the RNC  and one or more of the Node Bs  may be collapsed into a single \u201chybrid\u201d module having the functionality of both the RNC  and the Node B(s) .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["126","126","160","165","175","175"]},"Generally, GPRS is a protocol used by Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) phones for transmitting Internet Protocol (IP) packets. The GPRS Core Network (e.g., the GGSN  and one or more SGSNs ) is the centralized part of the GPRS system and also provides support for W-CDMA based 3G networks. The GPRS core network is an integrated part of the GSM core network, provides mobility management, session management and transport for IP packet services in GSM and W-CDMA networks.","The GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) is the defining IP protocol of the GPRS core network. The GTP is the protocol which allows end users (e.g., access terminals) of a GSM or W-CDMA network to move from place to place while continuing to connect to the internet as if from one location at the GGSN . This is achieved transferring the subscriber's data from the subscriber's current SGSN  to the GGSN , which is handling the subscriber's session.","Three forms of GTP are used by the GPRS core network; namely, (i) GTP-U, (ii) GTP-C and (iii) GTP\u2032 (GTP Prime). GTP-U is used for transfer of user data in separated tunnels for each packet data protocol (PDP) context. GTP-C is used for control signaling (e.g., setup and deletion of PDP contexts, verification of GSN reach-ability, updates or modifications such as when a subscriber moves from one SGSN to another, etc.). GTP\u2032 is used for transfer of charging data from GSNs to a charging function.","Referring to , the GGSN  acts as an interface between the GPRS backbone network (not shown) and the external packet data network . The GGSN  extracts the packet data with associated packet data protocol (PDP) format (e.g., IP or PPP) from the GPRS packets coming from the SGSN , and sends the packets out on a corresponding packet data network. In the other direction, the incoming data packets are directed by the GGSN  to the SGSN  which manages and controls the Radio Access Bearer (RAB) of the destination UE served by the RAN . Thereby, the GGSN  stores the current SGSN address of the target UE and his\/her profile in its location register (e.g., within a PDP context). The GGSN is responsible for IP address assignment and is the default router for the connected UE. The GGSN also performs authentication and charging functions.","The SGSN  is representative of one of many SGSNs within the core network , in an example. Each SGSN is responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the UEs within an associated geographical service area. The tasks of the SGSN  includes packet routing and transfer, mobility management (e.g., attach\/detach and location management), logical link management, and authentication and charging functions. The location register of the SGSN stores location information (e.g., current cell, current VLR) and user profiles (e.g., IMSI, PDP address(es) used in the packet data network) of all GPRS users registered with the SGSN , for example, within one or more PDP contexts for each user or UE. Thus, SGSNs are responsible for (i) de-tunneling downlink GTP packets from the GGSN , (ii) uplink tunnel IP packets toward the GGSN , (iii) carrying out mobility management as UEs move between SGSN service areas and (iv) billing mobile subscribers. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, aside from (i)-(iv), SGSNs configured for GSM\/EDGE networks have slightly different functionality as compared to SGSNs configured for W-CDMA networks.","The RAN  (e.g., or UTRAN, in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) system architecture) communicates with the SGSN  via a Iu interface, with a transmission protocol such as Frame Relay or IP. The SGSN  communicates with the GGSN  via a Gn interface, which is an IP-based interface between SGSN  and other SGSNs (not shown) and internal GGSNs, and uses the GTP protocol defined above (e.g., GTP-U, GTP-C, GTP\u2032, etc.). While not shown in , the Gn interface is also used by the Domain Name System (DNS). The GGSN  is connected to a Public Data Network (PDN) (not shown), and in turn to the Internet , via a Gi interface with IP protocols either directly or through a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) gateway.","The PDP context is a data structure present on both the SGSN  and the GGSN  which contains a particular UE's communication session information when the UE has an active GPRS session. When a UE wishes to initiate a GPRS communication session, the UE must first attach to the SGSN  and then activate a PDP context with the GGSN . This allocates a PDP context data structure in the SGSN  that the subscriber is currently visiting and the GGSN  serving the UE's access point.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 1","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B"],"b":["100","1","120","1","3","120","162","162","188","175","182","184","186","170","2","5","120","164","162","164","188","175","182","184","186","170","4","175","175"]},"Referring to , UEs ,  and  . . . N are illustrated as wireless cell-phones, UE  is illustrated as a wireless tablet-PC and UE  is illustrated as a wired desktop station. However, in other embodiments, it will be appreciated that the wireless communication system  can connect to any type of UE, and the examples illustrated in  are not intended to limit the types of UEs that may be implemented within the system. Also, while the AAA , the provisioning server , the IMS\/SIP registration server  and the application server  are each illustrated as structurally separate servers, one or more of these servers may be consolidated in at least one embodiment of the invention.","Further, referring to , the application server  is illustrated as including a plurality of media control complexes (MCCs)  . . . N B, and a plurality of regional dispatchers  . . . N A. Collectively, the regional dispatchers A and MCCs B are included within the application server , which in at least one embodiment can correspond to a distributed network of servers that collectively functions to arbitrate communication sessions (e.g., half-duplex group communication sessions via IP unicasting and\/or IP multicasting protocols) within the wireless communication system . For example, because the communication sessions arbitrated by the application server  can theoretically take place between UEs located anywhere within the system , multiple regional dispatchers A and MCCs are distributed to reduce latency for the arbitrated communication sessions (e.g., so that a MCC in North America is not relaying media back-and-forth between session participants located in China). Thus, when reference is made to the application server , it will be appreciated that the associated functionality can be enforced by one or more of the regional dispatchers A and\/or one or more of the MCCs B. The regional dispatchers A are generally responsible for any functionality related to establishing a communication session (e.g., handling signaling messages between the UEs, scheduling and\/or sending announce messages, etc.), whereas the MCCs B are responsible for hosting the communication session for the duration of the call instance, including conducting an in-call signaling and an actual exchange of media during an arbitrated communication session.","Referring to , a UE , (here a wireless device), such as a cellular telephone, has a platform  that can receive and execute software applications, data and\/or commands transmitted from the RAN  that may ultimately come from the core network , the Internet and\/or other remote servers and networks. The platform  can include a transceiver  operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d ), or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The ASIC  or other processor executes the application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d)  layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory  of the wireless device. The memory  can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform  also can include a local database  that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database  is typically a flash memory cell, but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EEPROM, optical media, tape, soft or hard disk, or the like. The internal platform  components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna , display , push-to-talk button  and keypad  among other components, as is known in the art.","Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention can include a UE including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements, software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example, ASIC , memory , API  and local database  may all be used cooperatively to load, store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively, the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore, the features of the UE  in  are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.","The wireless communication between the UE  or  and the RAN  can be based on different technologies, such as code division multiple access (CDMA), W-CDMA, time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. For example, in W-CDMA, the data communication is typically between the client device , Node B(s) , and the RNC . The RNC  can be connected to multiple data networks such as the core network , PSTN, the Internet, a virtual private network, a SGSN, a GGSN and the like, thus allowing the UE  or  access to a broader communication network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art, voice transmission and\/or data can be transmitted to the UEs from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly, the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.","Multimedia and real time applications configured to handle server-arbitrated communication sessions (e.g., VoIP sessions, PTT sessions, data sharing sessions, etc.) on cellular networks typically deploy an \u2018always-on\u2019 packet data service or data session and use multiple links (for e.g., multiple PDP contexts in case of a UMTS system or multiple PPP sessions in case of CDMA systems) to enable mobile terminated (MT) signaling while the mobile is inactive and to improve performance. To achieve the always-on data service on cellular networks, multimedia applications employ keep alive mechanisms and\/or other network-based mechanism (e.g., long dormancy timers, etc.) in order to provide reliable service and a good user experience. The network may further assist delay sensitive application with preferential Quality of Service (QoS) treatment.","These types of optimized or enhanced services on networks are typically available in the home network of the cellular application provider that provides such specialized services like PTT over packet switched network and VoIP like applications. The services are also typically available on affiliate networks, which are not true home networks but are configured to allocate resources to the UEs in a similar manner as in the home network. When the UEs roam to a roaming network (i.e., a non-home and non-affiliate network) and packet data roaming is allowed in the roaming network, the enhanced services (e.g., always-on data session, multiple PDPs, preferential QoS, etc.) may not be available to the roaming UEs.","Under such circumstances the network assumptions considered for supporting the multimedia application in the home network are no longer valid. For example, the multimedia application may be configured to function with the assumption that the always-on data session is available. Thus, if the always-on data session is not supported in the roaming network, the multimedia application may not receive any mobile terminated data when the mobile is idle and the multimedia application may not function properly. In another example, the multimedia application may be configured to function with the assumption that its packet transfer will be supported with expedited data forwarding treatment (e.g., reduced latency, etc.). Thus, if the multimedia application is not allocated the expedited data forwarding treatment in the roaming network, the performance of the multimedia application may diverge from expectations.","As will be appreciated, the network conditions in the roaming network are difficult for the UEs to predict (e.g., some roaming networks may provide full support for the multimedia application while others may not) and can potentially be disruptive to the multimedia application's operation. Also, the battery performance of the UE can degrade in roaming networks if the UE performs operations that are designed for the home and\/or affiliate networks which are wasted in the roaming networks. Accordingly, in the roaming networks, the multimedia application will typically either fail to work or will work with compromised quality that can impact the user experience and\/or battery life of the UE.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A"],"b":["400","405","400","405","405","400","405","170"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4B"],"b":["400","405","170","400","400","400","405","170","400"]},"For example, the given UE B can send data to the roaming RAN  which is forwarded to the roaming SGSN , the roaming routing unit  and then to a GRPS roaming exchange (GRX) network B.

In the GRX network B, data from the given UE B arrives at GRX server B and is forwarded over a peering interface to the GRX server B. The data is then forwarded from the GRX server B to the home routing unit , the home GGSN  and the application server  (or QAS). Also shown in the home network A is a home location register (HLR) B.

However, because the roaming network A is not configured to fully support the given multimedia application, at least a portion of the resource request is rejected in D. For example, the resource request of D may correspond to a QoS reservation request that is rejected in D. Moreover some resources may be taken away from the network at a later stage without a notification to the UE (for e.g. PDP may be deactivated or PPP session may be released). Thus, while the resource denial is shown as occurring directly in response to the resource request in , it will be appreciated that the resource denial can correspond to a resource withdrawal of previously allocated resources in other embodiments.","In D, because the given UE did not obtain its requested level of resources, the given UE determines whether to support the multimedia application with best-effort resource protocols while the given UE is being served by the roaming network A.

If the QoS resource request were denied altogether, the current network would be considered a blue or a red zone network. Otherwise, the current network can be considered to be a green zone network. Moreover, during the initial registration with the application server , the UE can notify the application server  that the UE is getting service from a green or a blue zone. Thus the application server  can also apply zone specific procedures. Additional examples whereby the determination or classification of B is performed based on a network ID comparison (instead of a dynamic performance-evaluation as described above) will be described in greater detail below.","In B, based on the determination or classification of B, the given UE determines whether the new network is expected to provide any level of enhanced feature support for the multimedia application. If the given UE determines that the new network is not expected to provide any level of enhanced feature support for the multimedia application (for e.g., registration for VoIP or PTT service), such as when the new network is classified as a red zone network, the process advances to B.","In B, the given UE refrains from requesting resources (e.g., QoS, etc.) for supporting enhanced support features of the multimedia application, and the given UE also refrains from executing network procedures associated with enhanced support features of the multimedia application, B. For example, in B, the given UE can refrain from attempting service discovery procedures and\/or registering with the application server  while in the red zone A.","The given UE also notifies a user thereof via a user interface (UI) that the enhanced support features will not be supported in the given UE's new network, B. Optionally (for e.g., based on user input), the given UE can attempt to support the multimedia application in the new network via best-effort protocols in the absence of guaranteed support for the enhanced features of the multimedia application, B. Also, the given UE can optionally notify the application server  that is configured to arbitrate communication sessions of the multimedia application with regard to the given UE's transition to the new network and\/or with respect to the given UE's new zone, B. While not shown explicitly in , the application server  can update the manner in which it supports the given UE based on the notification of B, such that certain features are reduced or disabled when the given UE is in the blue zone A or the red zone A. After B, the process returns to B and waits for the given UE to transition to a different network.","Referring to , if the given UE determines that the new network is expected to provide a given level of enhanced feature support for the multimedia application, such as when the new network is classified as a green or blue zone network, the process advances to B. In B, the given UE determines a set of zone-specific network procedures for supporting the multimedia application within the net network based on the zone-determination. For example, if the new network is determined to be within the green zone A in B, the given UE determines green zone specific network procedures in B. Likewise, if the new network is determined to be within the blue zone A in B, the given UE determines blue zone specific network procedures in B.","The given UE also requests a zone-specific level of resources from the network and the application server  for supporting the multimedia application within the new network based on the zone-determination from B. For example, if the new network is determined to be within the green zone A in B, the given UE requests full-resources in B and the UE uses application level timers and de jitter buffers optimized for low latency performance. Otherwise, if the new network is determined to be within the blue zone A in B, the given UE requests partial-resources in B and notifies the application server to assist the UE in the enhancing the reliability and performance of the service using longer de jitter buffers for smoother audio payout. For example, the application server  can send, to the UE, dummy packet(s) with a data payload above an Event threshold so as to trigger a transition of the UE by the RAN  to a dedicated-channel (DCH) state (e.g., E-DCH or DCH).","In B the given UE can notify the application server  with regard to its current zone and\/or network. While not shown explicitly in , the application server  can update the manner in which it supports the given UE based on the notification of B, such that certain features are reduced (conservative application layer reliability) or disabled when the given UE is in the blue zone A. Alternatively is the UE is in the green zone, the application layer service is optimized for low latency and higher performance. In B, the given UE and the application server  executes the set of zone-specific network procedures so long as the given UE remains within the new network and\/or its current zone. While the network procedure is executing in B, the process returns to B and waits for the given UE to transition to a different network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 5C","FIG. 5C","FIG. 5B","FIG. 5C"],"b":["505","510"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["i.
