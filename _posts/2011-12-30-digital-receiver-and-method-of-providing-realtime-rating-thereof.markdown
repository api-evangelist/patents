Accordingly, the terms used herein should be understood not simply by the actual terms used but by the meaning lying within and the description disclosed herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"As illustrated in , the broadcasting system including a display device according to one embodiment of the present invention includes a content provider (CP) , a service provider (SP) , a network provider (NP) , and a home network end user (HNED) . The HNED  corresponds to, for example, a client  which is a display device according to the embodiment of the present invention. The client  corresponds to the display device according to one embodiment of the present invention, wherein examples of the display device include network TV, smart TV, and IPTV.","The content provider  manufactures various contents and provides them. Examples of the content provider  include a terrestrial broadcaster, a cable system operator (SO), a multiple system operator (MSO), a satellite broadcaster, and an Internet broadcaster, as illustrated in .","Also, the content provider  may provide various applications in addition to broadcast contents, which will be described in more detail later.","The service provider  can provide contents provided by the content provider  by service packaging them. For example, the service provider  of  can package first terrestrial broadcasting, second terrestrial broadcasting, cable MSO, satellite broadcasting, various kinds of Internet broadcasting, application, etc. and provide the packaged one to a user.","In the mean time, the service provider  may provide a service to the client  by using a unicast or multicast mode. The unicast mode is to transmit data between a single transmitter and a single receiver 1:1. In case of the unicast mode, for example, if the receiver requests a server to transmit data, the server can transmit data to the receiver in accordance with the request. The multicast mode is to transmit data to a plurality of receivers of a specific group. For example, the server can transmit data to a plurality of receivers, which are previously registered therewith, at one time. For this multicast registration, IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) can be used.","The network provider  may provide a network for providing a service to the client . The client  may construct a home network end user (HNED) to receive a service.","In the system of the aforementioned display device, conditional access or content protection can be used to protect contents which are transmitted. For conditional access or content protection, a cable card or downloadable conditional access system (DCAS) can be used.","In the mean time, the client  may provide contents through the network. In this case, the client  may be a content provider contrary to the above. The content provider  may receive contents from the client . In this case, it is advantageous in that bidirectional content service or data service is available.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"As illustrated in , a display device  according to another embodiment of the present invention is connected with a broadcast network or Internet network. Examples of the display device  include network TV, smart TV, and HBBTV.","Also, the display device  includes a broadcast interface , a section filter , an AIT filter , an application data processor , a broadcast data processor , a media player , an Internet protocol processor , an Internet interface , and a runtime module , for example.","Application information table (AIT) data, a real-time broadcast content, application data, and stream event are received through the broadcast interface . In the mean time, the real-time broadcast content may be designated as a linear A\/V content.","The section filter  performs section filtering for four kinds of data received through the broadcast interface . Then, the section filter  transmits AIT data to the AIT filter , the linear A\/V content to the broadcast data processor , and stream event and application data to the application data processor .","In the mean time, a non-linear A\/V content and application data are received through the Internet interface . The non-linear A\/V content may be content on demand (COD) application, for example.","The non-linear A\/V content is transmitted to the media player , and the application data is transmitted to the runtime module .","Moreover, the runtime module , as illustrated in , includes an application manager and a browser, for example. The application manager controls a lifecycle for an interactive application by using the AIT data. The browser serves to display and process the interactive application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},"The service provider performs service provider discovery (S). The display device transmits a service provider (SP) attachment request signal (S). If SP attachment is finished, the display device receives provisioning information (S). Moreover, the display device receives a master SI table from the service provider (S), receives a virtual channel map table (S), receives a virtual channel description table (S), and receives a source table (S).","Hereinafter, the process steps for receiving channel information will be described in more detail.","The service provider discovery may mean that service providers, which provide IPTV related services, discover a service discovery (SD) server that provides information on the service providers.","For example, three methods for discovering an address list that can receive information (for example, SP discovery information) on the SD server will be provided as follows. First of all, an address previously set by the display device or an address set by a manual operation of the user can be used. Second, a DHCP based SP discovery method can be used. Third, a DNS SRV-based SP discovery method can be used. Also, the display device accesses a server of an address acquired by any one of the above three methods and receives a service provider discovery record that includes information required for service discovery per SP. Then, the display device performs a service search step by using the received service provider discovery record. The above steps can be performed in a push mode or pull mode.","The display device performs a registration procedure (or service attachment procedure) by accessing the SP attachment server designated by an SP attachment locator of the SP discovery record.","Moreover, after performing a separate authentication procedure by accessing an SP authentication service server designated by an SP authentication locator, the display device may perform a service authentication procedure.","In the mean time, after the service attachment procedure is successfully performed, data transmitted from the server to the display device may be a form of a provisioning information table.","The display device transmits the data to the service attachment server during the service attachment procedure, wherein the data includes ID and location information of the display device. The service attachment server can define a service subscribed by the display device, based on the received data. Moreover, address information that can acquire service information desired to be received by the display device is provided in the form of the provisioning information table. The address information corresponds to access information of the master SI table. In this case, it is easy to provide a customized service per subscriber.","The service information includes a master SI table record that manages access information and version on the virtual channel map, a virtual channel map table that provides a package type service list, a virtual channel description table that includes detailed information of each channel, and a source table that includes access information that enables actual access to services.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0098"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"]},"The mater SI table includes location information that can receive each virtual channel map and version information of each virtual channel map.","Each virtual channel map is uniquely identified by a virtual channel map identifier, and virtual channel map version represents version information of the virtual channel map. If any one of all tables connected to one another along an arrow starting from the master SI table illustrated in  is changed, version of all upper tables (to reach master SI table) is increased together with increase of the corresponding table. Accordingly, it is advantageous in that the display device can identify change on all SI tables directly by monitoring the master SI table.","For example, if there is any change of the source table, version of the source table is increased, and version of the virtual channel description table for reference of the source table is also changed. Accordingly, change of a lower table causes change of an upper table, whereby version of the master SI table is finally changed.","The master SI table may exist per service provider. However, if configuration of the service is varied per location or subscriber (or subscriber group), the service provider is designed to have a plurality of master SI tables, thereby providing a customized service per each unit. In this way, if the service provider is designed, it is possible to efficiently provide a customized service for location of a subscriber and subscription information through the master SI table.","The virtual channel map table may have one or more virtual channels, and includes location information that can acquire detailed information of the channel without including the detailed information in the virtual channel map. Virtual channel description location of the virtual channel map table indicates location of the virtual channel description table that includes detailed information of the channel.","The virtual channel description table includes detailed information of the virtual channel, and can access the virtual channel description table by using the virtual channel description location of the virtual channel map table.","The source table provides access information (for example, IP address, port, AV codec, transport protocol, etc.) per service, wherein the access information is required for actual access to the service.","The aforementioned master SI table, the virtual channel map table, the virtual channel description table, and the source table are transferred through four flows, which are logically divided from one another, in a push mode or pull mode. In the mean time, the master SI table can be transmitted in a multicast mode for version management, and monitors version change by receiving multicast streaming.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0107"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"]},"The display device  includes a network interface , a TCP\/IP manager , a service delivery manager , a demultiplexer (Demux) , a PSI& (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder , an audio decoder , a video decoder , a display A\/V and OSD module , a service control manager , a service discovery manager , a metadata manager , an SI&Metadata DB , a UI manager , and a service manager .","The network interface  receives packets from a network, and transmits the packets to the network. In other words, the network interface  receives services, contents, etc. from the service provider through the network.","The TCP\/IP manager  is involved in packets received in the display device  and packets transmitted from the display device , i.e., packet transfer from the source to the destination. The TCP\/IP manager  sorts the received packets to correspond to a proper protocol, and outputs the sorted packets to the service delivery manager , the service discovery manager , the service control manager , and the metadata manager .","The service delivery manager  takes the role of control of received service data. For example, if the service delivery manager  controls real-time streaming data, it can use RTP\/RTCP. If the service delivery manager  transmits the real-time streaming data by using RTP, it parses the received packets in accordance with RTP and transmits the parsed packets to the demultiplexer  or stores the parsed packets in the SI&Metadata DB  under the control of the service manager . The service delivery manager  feeds the received information back to a server, which provides a service, by using RTCP.","The demultiplexer  demultiplexes the received packets to audio, video and PSI (Program Specific Information) data and then transmits the demultiplexed data to the audio decoder , the video decoder , and the PSI& (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder , respectively.","The PSI& (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder  decodes service information such as PSI, for example. Namely, the PSI& (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder  receives and decodes PSI section, PSIP (Program and Service Information Protocol) section or SI (Service Information) section, which is demultiplexed by the demultiplexer .","Also, the PSI& (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder  decodes the received sections to make a database for service information, and stores the database for service information in the SI&Metadata DB .","The audio\/video decoders \/ decode the video data and the audio data, which are received from the demultiplexer . The audio data decoded by the audio decoder  and the video data decoded by the video decoder  are provided to the user through the display .","The UI manager  and the service manager  manage the whole state of the display device , provide a user interface, and manage other managers.","The UI manager  provides a graphic user interface for the user by using an on screen display (OSD), and performs a receiving operation based on a key input from the user. For example, if a key input signal for channel selection is input from the user, the UI manager  transmits the key input signal to the service manager .","The service manager  controls managers related to the service, such as the service delivery manager , the service discovery manager , the service control manager , and the metadata manager .","Also, the service manager  makes a channel map and selects a channel by using the channel map in accordance with the key input signal received from the UI manager . The service manager  receives service information of the channel from the PSI& (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder  and sets audio\/video PID (Packet Identifier) of the selected channel in the demultiplexer .","The service discovery manager  provides information required to select the service provider that provides services. If a signal related to channel selection is received from the service manager , the service discovery manager  discovers a corresponding service by using the received information.","The service control manager  takes the role of selection and control of the service. For example, if the user selects a live broadcasting service like the existing broadcasting mode, the service control manager  uses IGMP or RTSP. If the user selects a video on demand (VOD) service, the service control manager  selects and controls the service by using RTSP. The RTSP protocol can provide a trick mode for real-time streaming. Also, the service control manager  can initiate and manage a session through IMC gate by using IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The above protocols are only exemplary, and other protocols may be used depending on embodiments.","The metadata manager  manages metadata related to the service and stores the metadata in the SI&Metadata DB .","The SI&Metadata DB  stores the service information decoded by the PSI& (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder , the metadata managed by the metadata manager , and the information required to select the service provider provided by the service discovery manager . Also, the SI&Metadata DB  may store setup data for the system.","The SI&Metadata DB  may be implemented by using a NonVolatile RAM (NVRAM) or a flash memory.","In the mean time, the IG  is a gateway where functions required for access to IMS based IPTV services are gathered.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0126"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"]},"Referring to , a display device  according to one embodiment of the present invention includes a broadcast receiver , an external device interface module , a memory module , a user input interface module , a control module , a display module , an audio output module , a power supply module , and a camera module (not shown). The broadcast receiver  includes a tuner , a demodulation module , and a network interface module . As occasion demands, the broadcast receiver  may be designed in such a manner that it includes a tuner  and a demodulation module  but does not include a network interface module . On the contrary, the broadcast receiver  may be designed in such a manner that it includes a network interface module  but does not include a tuner  and a demodulation module .","The tuner  selects one of RF (radio frequency) broadcast signals received through an antenna, which corresponds to a channel selected by the user or all previously stored channels. Also, the tuner  converts the selected RF broadcast signal to an intermediate frequency signal or a baseband video or audio signal.","For example, if the selected RF broadcast signal is a digital broadcast signal, the tuner  coverts the selected RF broadcast signal to a digital IF (DIF) signal. If the selected RF broadcast signal is an analog broadcast signal, the tuner  coverts the selected RF broadcast signal to an analog baseband video or audio signal (CVBS\/SIF). In other words, the tuner  can process both the digital broadcast signal and the analog broadcast signal. The analog baseband video or audio signal (CVBS\/SIF) output from the tuner  may directly be input to the control module .","Also, the tuner  can receive RF broadcast signal of a single carrier based on an advanced television system committee (ATSC) mode and RF broadcast signal of multiple carriers based on a digital video broadcasting mode (DVB).","In the mean time, the tuner  sequentially selects RF broadcast signals of all broadcast channels stored through a channel memory function from RF broadcast signals received through the antenna, and converts the selected RF broadcast signals to intermediate frequency signals or baseband video or audio signals.","The demodulation module  receives the digital IF (DIF) signal converted by the tuner  and demodulates the received digital IF signal.","For example, if the digital IF signal output from the tuner  is based on the ATSC mode, the demodulation module  performs 8-vestigal side band (8-VSB) demodulation, for example. Also, the demodulation module  may perform channel decoding. To this end, the demodulation module  may include a trellis decoder, a de-interleaver, and a Reed-Solomon decoder to perform trellis decoding, de-interleaving, and Reed-Solomon decoding.","For example, if the digital IF signal output from the tuner  is based on the DVB mode, the demodulation module  performs coded orthogonal frequency division modulation (COFDMA) demodulation, for example. Also, the demodulation module  may perform channel decoding. To this end, the demodulation module  may include a convolution decoder, a de-interleaver, and a Reed-Solomon decoder to perform convolution decoding, de-interleaving, and Reed-Solomon decoding.","The demodulation module  can output a stream signal (TS) after performing demodulation and channel decoding. At this time, the stream signal may be a signal where a video signal, an audio signal and a data signal are multiplexed. For example, the stream signal may be MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) where a video signal of an MPEG-2 specification and an audio signal of Dolby AC-3 specification are multiplexed. Specifically, the MPEG-2 TS may include a 4 byte header and 184 byte payload.","In the mean time, the aforementioned demodulation module  may be provided separately depending on the ATSC mode and the DVB mode. Namely, an ATSC demodulation module and a DVB demodulation module may be provided separately.","The stream signal output from the demodulation module  may be input to the control module . The control module  performs demultiplexing, video\/audio signal processing, etc. and then outputs video to the display module  and audio to the audio output module .","The external device interface module  may connect an external device to the display device . To this end, the external device interface module  may include an A\/V input\/output unit (not shown) or a wireless communication unit (not shown).","The external device interface module  is connected to external devices such as Digital Versatile Disks (DVD), Blu-rays, game devices, cameras, camcorders, computers (e.g., notebook computers), etc. through wire\/wireless cables. The external device interface module  transmits a video, audio, or data signal externally input through an external device connected thereto, to the control module  of the display device . Also, the external device interface module  outputs the video, audio or data signal processed by the control module  to the external device. To this end, the external device interface module  may include an A\/V input\/output unit (not shown) or a wireless communication unit (not shown).","The A\/V input\/output unit of the external input circuit may include a USB terminal, a composite Video Banking Sync (CVBS) terminal, a component terminal, an S-video terminal (analog), a Digital Visual Interface (DVI) terminal, a High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) terminal, an RGB terminal, a D-SUB terminal, etc., to input video and audio signals of the external device to the display device .","The wireless communication unit may perform a short-distance wireless communication with other electronic devices. For example, communication standards such as Bluetooth, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), infrared Data Association (IrDA), Ultra Wideband (UWB), ZigBee, Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA), etc. can be used for the short-distance wireless communication, whereby network connection between the display device  and other electronic devices can be performed.","In addition, the external device interface module  may be connected to various set-top boxes through at least one of the above-mentioned various terminals to perform input\/output operation with the set-top boxes.","In the mean time, the external device interface module  receives an application of a neighboring external device or list of applications and transmits the received application or the list of applications to the control module  or the memory module .","The network interface module  provides interface for connecting the display device  with wire\/wireless networks including Internet network.

In this case, the first server  may be a server provided by a manufacturer of the digital receiver , and the second server  may be an EPG provisioning server.","As described above, the digital receiver  may receive EPG data from service information within the digital broadcast signal received from the broadcasting station  and\/or the second server .","However, in case of the EPG data received from the broadcasting station , the digital receiver should receive a digital broadcast signal by tuning a corresponding channel, or the EPG data provided by an PEG information provider such as the second server  have low service coverage per area (less than 50%, approximately), whereby there is difficulty in providing EPG service suitable for actual broadcasting environment. In other words, the digital receiver may fail to provide a sufficient and exact EPG service for search or request of the user even though it uses the EPG data.","In this respect, in this specification, in order to satisfy EPG service request of the user, the first server  provides EPG service by collecting EPG data of each digital receiver and storing the collected EPG data in the database.","In other words, unlike the digital receiver of the related art, the present invention suggests that the first server  collects EPG data received from a plurality of digital receivers having the same service list and\/or combines EPG data of the second server  to obtain processed EPG data and transmits the processed EPG data to each digital receiver to provide an advanced EPG service, which includes latest update information, for a short time.","Hereinafter, a method of providing EPG service through a digital receiver  in accordance with the present invention and a digital broadcasting system will be described in detail with reference to .  is a flow chart illustrating a method for providing EPG through a digital broadcasting system according to the present invention.","The digital receiver  performs a registration procedure by performing communication with the first server  to provide an EPG service.","For example, the digital receiver  initially transmits its device information to the first server (A, S), and receives a setting value based on the device information transmitted from the first server , i.e., service list set ID (C, ).","In this case, the device information includes a device-country, a receiver-type and a service list. The device-country may mean Korea (KR), Germany (DE) and England (UK). Also, the receiver type may mean terrestrial, cable, satellite, and IPTV. Also, the service list may mean a list of services or channels that can be accessed by the corresponding digital receiver through auto scan. In the present invention, the service list is configured in a 3-id type, for example, and is transmitted and received between the digital receiver  and the first server .","In this case, the 3-id may include original network identifier, transport stream identifier and service identifier. The 3-id serves as a reference that allows a country to search for the same service per receiver type. In this case, the service list may further include corresponding service name or channel name information.","For example, the digital receiver  may configure device information as country of (UK), receiver type of (DVB-T) and service list of 3-id in a format of dvb:\/\/233a.2f.1 and transmit the configured device information to the first server . In this case, 233a may mean original network identifier, 2f may mean transport stream identifier, and 1 may mean service identifier.","The digital receiver  may further include at least one of device type information such as model number or model name of the corresponding device, device language information such as language supported and used by the corresponding device, and user ID information previously registered in the first server in the aforementioned device information and transmit the information to the first server .","The first server  determines a group to which the corresponding digital receiver belongs, on the basis of the device information transmitted from the digital receiver , and transmits identification information of the corresponding group, i.e., the aforementioned service list set identifier to the corresponding digital receiver in accordance with the determined result. Hereinafter, the group will be referred to as a super set. The service list set identifier provides information as to whether the first server  configures a super set to be managed together with country and receiver type information on the basis of the country and receiver type information of the device information of each digital receiver, and information as to a super set to which a specific receiver has been allocated.","The service list set identifier serves as identification information between the digital receiver  and the first server . In other words, each digital receiver  and the first server  may perform all the procedures through the service list set identifier in updating the EPG data from each digital receiver to the first server  or receiving the EPG data from the first server .","In the present invention, the service list set identifier is a value for identifying a bundle of service lists, i.e., super sets if the first server  manages the EPG data per service list. As described above, two types of the device information, i.e., country and receiver type may generally constitute the super set. For example, in case of Europe, if 3-ids are equally used in one country per receiver type, the service lists may be regarded as the same service.","Afterwards, each digital receiver transmits the EPG data to the first server  and updates the EPG data (B, S). In this case, initial transmission of the EPG data may be performed at the aforementioned step S. However, if each digital receiver transmits the EPG data to the first server and updates the EPG data at the step S, the first server  transmits the service set identifier of each digital receiver and the corresponding EPG data, which are previously allocated at the step S. Also, the transmitted EPG data may be configured in a 3-id format.","The transmitted EPG data are read by the digital receiver  from service information which includes EPG data within a digital broadcast signal transmitted from the broadcasting station . As described above, the service information, which includes EPG data, includes event and SDT on a service, i.e., EIT on a program, in case of DVB terrestrial. In other words, the digital receiver  extracts data for EPG by parsing SDT and EIT from the digital broadcast signal, stores the extracted data in a memory module, configures the stored data in the aforementioned 3-id format, and transmits the configured data to the first server .","At the step S, each digital receiver may transmit the EPG data shown in  to the first server , .","The first server  may receive the EPG data from each digital receiver and process the received EPG data. The first server  may use the EPG data of the second server  when processing the EPG data received from each digital receiver. However, if the EPG data of the second server collide with the EPG data of each digital receiver during the processing procedure, SI information may first be used.","Hereinafter, the processing procedure of the EPG data in the first server  will be described in more detail.","If the device information of each digital receiver is received at the aforementioned step S, the control module  transmits the device information to a crawler module . The crawler module  configures a super set having the same service list on the basis of the device information of each digital receiver and returns an identifier of the configured super set, i.e., service list set identifier to the control module .","The control module  returns the service list set identifier returned from the crawler module  to each corresponding digital receiver.","Also, if updated EPG data are received from each digital receive after the service list set identifier returns, the control module  transmits the updated EPG data to the crawler module  (S).","The crawler module  transmits the updated EPG data of each digital receiver, which are input through the control module , to the processing module  (S).","In this case, the crawler module  may analyze an updated parameter from the updated EPG data of each digital receiver.","Also, the crawler module  may process the analyzed result on the basis of the service list set identifier to read out the service list set identifier and transfer the analyzed result to the processing module  together with the read service list set identifier.","In this case, although each digital receiver may transmit the EPG data to the first server  at the same time, it may transmit the EPG data to the first server  at different times.","In this case, after analyzing the EPG data received from the specific receiver, if the updated parameter of the updated EPG data is the same as a parameter updated previously through the other receiver at a previous time or has a version lower than the previously updated parameter, the crawler module  may remove the updated parameter without transferring it to the processing module .","The crawler module  may transmit the EPG data to the processing module  whenever the EPG data are received from each digital receiver. However, in this case, since load may occur in the processing module , a parameter updated at a sufficient level may be accumulated or may periodically be transmitted to the processing module , whereby overall load of the server may be reduced.","The processing module  receives the EPG data from the second server  periodically or non-periodically.","The processing module  sorts the EPG data received from the crawler module  and the second server  on the basis of a previously set super set, i.e., service list set identifier.","The processing module  processes the sorted EPG data and stores the processed EPG data in the database  in a unit of the aforementioned super set (S).","For example, translation and merge may be used for the processing procedure, and may be configured by addition of the service list set identifier for later EPG data search and basic information required for channel change per broadcast standard.","The data processing for the advanced EPG service is performed through the aforementioned steps including the step S.","Hereinafter, a procedure of providing an EPG service request from each digital receiver if any will be described.","If an EPG request is received from the user, the digital receiver  transmits a search parameter to the first server  together with the previously received service list set identifier to request the first server  to provide the EPG service (S).","In this case, the search parameter may include query information, start index (startIndex) information, maximum result (maxResults) information, category information, and sort information. In particular, the EPG may be set to the category information to request EPG service in accordance with the present invention. However, if the category is set to \u2018all\u2019, for example, information on CP tap (for example, YouTube tap) as well as real time tap may be received.","The control module  checks the request of the digital receiver  and determines whether the corresponding request is transmission of the updated EPG data or EPG service request at the step S.","As a result, if the corresponding input is the EPG service request, the control module  transmits a search request to a search module  together with the search parameter (S).","The search module  analyzes the search parameter included in the search request of the control module .","The search module  transmits the result of the analyzed search parameter to a search engine , and the search engine  searches for respective databases  and  based on the transmitted search parameter (S).","The search engine  receives the searched result from the respective databases  and  and transmits the received result to the search module .","The search module  analyzes the search result received from the search engine , configures the analyzed result in a response format corresponding to the request of the step S, and returns the response to the control module  (S).","In this case, the returned response of the search module  may be xml format, for example.","The control module  transmits the EPG data returned from the search module  to the corresponding digital receiver (S).","The corresponding digital receiver parses the EPG data received from the first server  in accordance with the EPG request, and configures the EPG from the parsed result to provide the configured EPG to the user through the screen (S). In this case, the parsed EPG data may be stored in the memory module.","The digital receiver and the operation method thereof according to the present invention may be configured by selective combination of all or some of the aforementioned embodiments without limited application of the embodiments, whereby various modifications may be made in the embodiments.","In the mean time, the operation method of the digital receiver according to the present invention may be implemented in a recording medium, which can be read by a processor provided in the multimedia device, as a code that can be read by the processor. The recording medium that can be read by the processor includes all kinds of recording media in which data that can be read by the processor are stored. Examples of the recording medium include ROM, RAM, CD-ROM, magnetic tape, floppy disk, and optical data memory.
