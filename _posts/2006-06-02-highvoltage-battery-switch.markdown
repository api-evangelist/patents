No. 10\/457,698 filed May 16, 2003, titled \u201cBattery Mechanism\u201d to Joseph F. Sharrow, Kurt W. Solomon, Frank E. Peterkin, Jack S. Bernandes and Brian J. Hankla, and assigned Navy Case 832237.","The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy, and thus, the invention herein may be manufactured, used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates generally to the battery mechanisms, and more particularly to such mechanisms that preferably can safely, reliably and remotely combine multiple battery assemblies.","High-powered electrical devices at least occasionally require portable operation. This means that the devices must be able to be used off battery power. Such high-powered electrical devices include those used in pulsed power systems, which may find applicability in both military and non-military scenarios.","The high voltage needed to power the electrical devices means that battery packs which power such electrical devices must themselves be able to provide high voltage. Such high-voltage battery packs are inherently dangerous, however. Incorrect installation or assembly of the battery packs, or defective battery packs, can potentially severely injure personnel or even cause fatalities.","Conventional battery assemblies yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, various exemplary embodiments provide a battery assembly for safe and controllable electrical concatenation in series. The battery assembly includes a plurality of battery packs, a switch, a receiver, and an actuator.","In various exemplary embodiments provide for each battery pack to include a plurality of rechargeable battery cells electrically connected in series. The switch electrically connects and disconnects first and second battery packs of the plurality together. The receiver transmits power from the switch. The actuator operates the switch to connect and disconnect the battery packs.","In preferred embodiments, the switch includes first and second buses and a deflector. The first bus electrically contacts the first battery pack. The second bus electrically contacts the second battery pack. The deflector moves the first bus to electrically connect and disconnect with the second bus in response to communication with the actuator.","An electrical connector is further provided for mechanical engagement and disengagement of electrical conduction to a terminal. The connector includes a block and a plurality of contacts. The block includes a plurality of openings. Each contact is disposed into a corresponding opening in the block.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Conventional battery power switching mechanisms lack capabilities of scalable connectivity with multiple battery cell packs that provide reasonable levels of safety for personnel for installation and other pre-activation operations. Various exemplary embodiments address these limitations.","A battery assembly  including a pair of battery units  is illustrated in isometric view in  shown from port (left) and starboard (right) sides, respectively, of the front battery unit's perspective, as illustrated with a compass-rose.
