abstract: Changes, increase or decrease, in the body fluid are passively detected by using a single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure, which can be extended to general biomedical measurement and diagnosis instruments. More specifically, the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure in applied on the hot spots of rheumatic arthritis or breast cancer detection problem using passive two-color infrared imaging, as well as to passively detect blockages in the body fluid circulatory system that might be of importance for coronary artery bypass surgery, diabetes and deep vein thrombosis. Other applications of the mentioned algorithm include a pair of cameras for video, a pair of antennas for cell phones, and in situ data gathering or imaging using multiple mode fiber-optical sensing, as well as selective amplification hearing aids through two-ear binaural processing for de-noise echo cancellation and signal classification.

More particularly, a statistical, multiple pixel, blind source separation algorithm (procedure), termed ICA (Independent Component Analysis), is known in the art and is based on the factorization of joint probability density. However, these algorithms require that a tumor has reached sufficient size, that is, larger than a pixel, so that its neighborhood can contribute to the determination of the identical mixing matrix [A] shared by all pixels without more unknowns as in the opposite limit of a small tumor having the space-variant [A] for different pixels. In other words, an image of the tumor spreads across at least several neighborhood pixels having similar mixing matrix before the tumor can be identified.","That is, other statistical Independent Component Analyses (ICA) methodologies suffer pixel-averaging blurring effects since the average over neighborhood pixels must implicitly assume an identical breast-medium heat transfer matrix MTF [A] for the space-invariant imaging. This would be true only for a large tumor requiring no earlier target detection.","It would be more desirable to detect a tumor as early as possible in the life cycle of the tumor, before the tumor has reached sufficient size to spread across more than one pixel.","Standard Blind Source Separation (BSS) is known in the art, and is referred to as \u201cBell-Sejnowski, Amari, and Oja (BSAO)\u201d\u2014four groups of researchers. \u201cBSAO\u201d has addressed the linear version of BSS. \u201cBSAO\u201d assumed the identical mixing matrix for all pixels using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as all pixel data post-processing collectively in order to factorize the joint-probability density function of all pixels known mathematically as the Independent Component Analysis (ICA).

In multi-spectral imaging applications (remote sensing, breast cancer detection, fiber-optic data gathering in tissue) the ensemble average property will cause a loss of details that in some cases (breast cancer detection, detection of small objects in the remote sensing) could be unacceptable.","In addition, a single-pixel, remote-sensing ad hoc method, a feedback, linear, Lagrange Constraint Neural Network, by H. Szu is known in the art. This method is based on a gradient descent (or slope) method and is applicable to the far-field radiation linear problems only.

Unfortunately, this procedure has generated too much variability to be reliable and reproducible.","In addition, supervised algorithms are known in the art. In supervised algorithms, a standard library is needed but each person is unique in tumor development and personal response physiology that a supervised library approach will create a biased estimation.","Further, trained, supervised neural networks used for medical applications are known in the art. Supervised networks have the limitation of requiring another method of accurately determining the value of the parameter under different conditions. Further, the accuracy of supervised networks is dependent upon the amount of such available \u201ctraining\u201d.","An unsupervised learning process separating unknown source signals with both mixture characteristics and original sources unknown, but using independent component analysis (ICA), which assumes spatial invariance, is known in the art. That is, the assumption is made that mixing matrices of the sources represented in nearby pixels are the same. Spatial invariance assumptions are appropriate for images with high pixel on target values (that is, an image of a large tumor), but lead to significant error when applied to images with small pixel on target values (that is, an image of a small tumor or pre-tumor). Thus, harnessing the ICA algorithm to detect small growths or other such aberrations that can not characterize the early stages of a pathological disorder.","In addition, a Fast Simulated Annealing algorithm by H. Szu is known in the art (Szu and Hartley, \u201cFast Simulated Annealing\u201d, , volume 122, number 3, pp. 157-162, 1987, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference).","Overview of the Present Invention: A closed, warm room at a temperature T, if left alone, will become messy at a maximum entropy S by Shannon's Theorem. When energy (that is, input\/output or I\/O) is applied to the room, then the room will be less messy, reaching a most probable trade-off state. Likewise, there are multiple routes to travel to New York City from Washington, D.C., and, given a data vector [{right arrow over (X)} or X], the most probable route to travel (that is, the source vector [{right arrow over (S)} or S]) from Washington, D.C. to New York City would be the route which requires the least amount of energy and the least time, and would typically be taken as a common-sense way by thousands of travelers.","The present invention postulates that the information (I\/O) energy E as a first order, feed-forward estimation error energy, and adopts the isothermal equilibrium condition at the minimum of the Helmhotz free energy H=E\u2212TS. This generalized information theory for open dynamic equilibrium becomes an aspect of the resolution of multiple choices of solutions as the unique solution. The present invention claims the application embodiments of this new theory.","One requires multiple sensors to measure multiple features to cover all possible sources with enough signal-to-noise ratio, then their unknown mixture may be de-mixed in the smallest possible image size, single pixel emitted from an unknown source medium, e.g., tissue and surrounding. This single-pixel nonlinear blind de-mixing algorithm (or procedure or method) of the present invention is unique because the present invention imposes the minimum Helmholtz free energy for the most probable equilibrium situation, and thus does not use the neighborhood pixel gray values in order to seek the mathematical transformation that leads to the factorization of the joint-probability\u2014density function (which is the theory of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) which works only for there are enough number of pixels over a large size of tumor to form the probability distribution).","The present invention measures multiple radiation components forming a data vector per single pixel X=(X, X, . . . ) in order to determine uniquely the underlying sources forming a source vector S=(S, S, . . . ) propagating through a nonlinear mixing medium. The present invention adopts that the thermal diffusion is constrained isothermally at the equilibrium free energy, known as Helmholtz free energy: H=E\u2212TS where E is the energy, T is the equilibrium reservoir temperature and S denotes the classical Shannon information theory entropy. In this sense, present invention generalizes the classical Shannon information theory, which states the special case of a closed system E=0 and the entropy must be evolving toward the maximum for the absolute equilibrium. The present invention postulates the state of an open equilibrium system defined by the feed-forward first order error energy E(X\/S)=\u03bc{g([W]X)\u2212S}. The present invention seeks among all possible vector sources S=(S, S, . . . ) the one that satisfies the minimum H for arbitrary mixing matrix [A] and smooth nonlinearity g: X=g{[A]S}. This physical condition of isothermal equilibrium is a strong constraint which permits the present invention to invert the single-pixel data blindly for S, without knowing ahead the mixing matrix and non-linearity.","The present invention departs from the traditional ICA solution, which must use the additional neighborhood pixel data by furthermore assuming the space-invariant imaging condition, namely an identical [A] for all pixels so that using neighborhood data will not increase more unknowns. Unfortunately, this space-invariant condition is valid only when many pixels cover a very large tumor. In medical diagnosis, one wishes to detect early the smallest possible malign tumor, of which the heat transport mixing matrix [A(pixel)] must in general vary from its home pixel to its neighborhood.","The practice of this patent has demonstrated the possibility of an early detection by taking two pictures using two spectral cameras non-intrusively. Each pair of input pixel data vector has two components, a long wavelength (8-12 micrometer) and a middle wavelength (3-5 micrometer). Such a pair per pixel is defined as a vector X(pixel, t)=(X(pixel, t), X(pixel, t)), where t indicates a repetition time that can reveal the growth of a malign tumor which is usually mixed with a benign one in terms of a unknown percentage source vector S(pixel, t)=(S(pixel, t), S(pixel, t)). This expectation is realistic because the physics of radiation source indicates a shift toward a shorter wavelength spectrum X(pixel, t) associated with the massive nutrition feed of a warmer lymph and blood toward a rapid growth of a malign tumor (biologically known as the Angiogenesis property). Then, the quantitative value of the malign tumor source S\/(S+S) can be determined by imposing the generalized information theory at a local equilibrium in terms of the Helmholtz free energy.","Accordingly, an aspect of the present invention is an embodiment of a single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm (or procedure) with pairs of nonlinear sensors that together can provide pixel by pixel nonlinear blind recovery of noisy heat source signals. The pixel by pixel blind recovery is thus possible for real time massively pixel-parallel implementation without latency associated with the batch mode signal processing. This feature is crucial for the real world space-time variant propagation medium.","The present invention provides an exact, global solution to the above-mentioned non-linear problem that is numerically based. The single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm, or procedure, of the present invention is also referred to as a non-linear Lagrange Constraint Neural Network (non-linear LCNN, or unsupervised learning artificial neural network) algorithm, or procedure, and is an unsupervised algorithm (procedure).","A further aspect of the present invention is application of the single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm to general biomedical measurement and diagnoses systems. More specifically, neural network systems and devices embodying the single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm of the present invention are applied to the detection of cancers in the mammalian breast and blockages in the body fluid circulatory system by using single axis multiple-camera system.","Yet another aspect of the present invention is application of the single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm to the in situ multiple-mode fiber-optical data gathering or imaging devices.","A further aspect of the present invention is application of the single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm to the amplification hearing aids problem based on the two-ear binaural processing for de-noise echo cancellation and signal classification.","The algorithm, or procedure, of the present invention, referred to, variously, as single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm, a non-linear LCNN, and a feed-forward Lagrange Constraint Neural Network (feed-forward LCNN), makes pixel by pixel blind source separation (BSS) possible for real time implementation without latency associated with the batch mode signal processing based on stochastic ICA, and without the latency associated with supervised algorithms. This feature is important for the real world space-time variant propagation medium.","One assumption made is that the unknown sources are equally probable and seek optimization balanced by the constraints of data measurement model times the Lagrange Multipliers.","The present invention is directed to a single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm modeled on the human visual\/brain unsupervised learning system and enables detection of heat radiated by abnormally reproducing breast cancer cells.","The single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm of the present invention, is based on the Lagrange Constraint Neural Network (LCNN) and multiple spectral data per pixel, and enhances the sensitivity and accuracy of breast cancer testing.","That is, the present invention includes methods and devices that passively detect changes in the body fluid flow by use of a sensor pairs smart processing system, including a digital heat spectrum local thermometer usable for core temperature maintenance, based on the single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm.","The sensor pairs smart processing system (including the single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm) is modeled on the human visual\/brain unsupervised learning system and enables detection of heat radiated by abnormally reproducing breast cancer cells.","Abnormally reproducing cells demand greater nutrition through increased oxygen supply, thus generating higher concentrations of heat in specific areas. Applying the single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm of the present invention enables classification of the infrared heat distribution given off by these cells, and thus enables a digital heat spectrum local thermometer for core temperature maintenance.","The single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm per pixel of the present invention is based on the information derived directly from spectral data alone. To reveal the hidden spectral features included in a single pixel image data vector X=[A]S, the matrix must be inverted without knowing both the breast-medium heat-transfer matrix (MTF) [A] and the heat source S which both vary from pixel to pixel, and the single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm provides the solution to reveal these spectral features.","The single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm of the present invention is a space-variant imaging algorithm. The single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm of the present invention following spectral data vector analysis and the physics constraints of thermodynamics free energy minimization achieves subpixel accuracy.","With the single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm of the present invention, similar to a pair human eyes, a pair of cameras at different infrared wavelengths (Medium wavelength IR (3-5 micrometers) camera and Long wavelength IR (8-12 micrometers) camera, both having about 10 milli Kelvin degrees in the minimum resolvable temperature difference (MRTD)) transcribes this thermal diffusion process into two images, which are then filtered for shared signals while disagreement noise is minimized. This process detected early stage ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in a test patient using a double-blind procedure.","The present invention provides multi-spectral, sub-pixel super-resolution potentially more accurate than current methods by an order of magnitude, and offers a passive, inexpensive, non-intrusive, convenient means of screening pre-cancer patients without radiation hazard, and may potentially detect in situ carcinomas long before a mammogram might detect them.","The application of the single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm of the present invention may offer an unbiased, more sensitive, accurate, and generally more effective way to track the development of breast cancer than the thermal breast scanning of the related art, without demanding the variables of along wait in a cold room, increasing the variability inaccuracy in thermal detection and causing patient discomfort.","The single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm, which is an unsupervised classification algorithm, of the present invention applied to multi-spectral imagining potentially improves the early detection process for breast cancer and possibly other dermal carcinomas.","The present invention emphasizes a single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm without using statistics. In single-pixel, unsupervised learning of the present invention, one's own library is built. Moreover, unsupervised algorithms do not face the hindrances of supervised algorithms discussed herein above related to building and maintaining libraries.","Moreover, the present invention includes blind signal separation of detailed algorithms specific to the function of neural networks.","The present invention assumes spatial variance to address the problem of unknown mixture characteristics and original sources. Thus, the present invention has the capability to find sub-pixel irregularities such as tumors and track their behavior over time. Such abilities lead to greater insights in medical inquiries relating to how and why such abnormalities originate and burgeon.","Moreover, the present invention relates to the method and devices for passively detecting changes in the increase or decrease of thermal flow by the use of the single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm based on the Statistical Mechanical thermodynamics principle of unsupervised fusion of sensor pairs. More specifically the embodiment of unsupervised fusion of sensor pairs, known as artificial neural networks, is applied to general biomedical instrument measurement and diagnoses systems. Most specifically the neural network system (which is coined as Lagrange Constraint Neural Network\u2014LCNN, or feed-forward LCNN) and a device are applied to detection of cancer in the mammalian breast and hot spots of rheumatic arthritis or conversely the blockages in the blood circulatory system that might be of importance for coronary artery bypass surgery, diabetes and deep vein thrombosis.","The system of the present invention, which includes the single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm and supporting detection equipment is used to detect anomalies in the image. Additional biomedical applications of the single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm of the present invention include in situ data gathering or imaging using multiple mode fiber-optical sensing as well as selective amplification hearing aids through two-ear binaural processing for de-noise echo cancellation and signal classification.","The single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm of the present invention is referred to, variously, as the feed-forward LCNN, the sensor pairs smart processing system, unsupervised smart (learning) algorithm, general brain like smart algorithm, feed-forward LCNN unsupervised learning algorithm, non-linear LCNN, and unsupervised nonlinear feed-forward Lagrange Constraint Neural Network (LCNN) signal and image classification procedure.","These together with other aspects and advantages which will be subsequently apparent, reside in the details of construction and operation as more fully hereinafter described and claimed, reference being had to the accompanying drawings forming a part hereof, wherein like numerals refer to like parts throughout.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Overview of the Present Invention: An overview of the present invention is now presented in terms of a number-theoretical description of the philosophy of the present invention.","Without presenting the analytical solutions, the single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm of the present invention may be intuitively justified as follows. Human beings are endowed with two pairs of sensors. Two ears, two eyes, one nose but two passages, one tongue but two sides and front-back, two hands, two feet, groups of tactile sensors that generate the vector but not scalar time series, may be taken for granted. The vector data allow searching of the subspace where the unknown mixing vectors span by the concept of a killing or elimination weight vector. One possibility for having two sensors is if one is damaged, the other would still be available. That certainly gave a hardware fault tolerance, so-to-speak.","In addition, being more sophisticated and learning, like a bat, two sensors together could provide direction finding. Indeed, human beings are equipped with a true-time delay filter bank having about a milli-second acoustic propagation time difference across two ears. More importantly, these sensors are used for a learning strategy without the need of a teacher and its guidance delay: \u201cwhile two sensors disagreed it should be noise, agreement should be signal\u201d, . More particularly,  is an illustration of the present invention related to a general brain-like unsupervised fusion of sensor pairs (the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm of the present invention) which is based on the minimum Helmholtz energy squeeze learning strategy \u201craw pairs of data in and garbage out\u201d that requires no teacher.","For example, if someone called out your name in a windy hill for an imminent danger, your two ears could immediately reject the wind noise by comparison and selectively amplified the agreed signal for a quick response in turning ones head for an immediately second hearing and looking. With the help of the short term memory, one has four ears and four eyes, from which the degree of agreement could be ranked in order that allowed the coincidence amplification to sharpen the sighting and hearing. These provide intuitive reasons why the present invention includes a pair of microphones to eliminate the recording wind noise, similarly binaural hearing aids, as well as two infrared cameras at distinct different infrared spectral bands in order to image the angiogenesis process and process the data fusion in a brain-style smart processing.","How could the brain achieve biologically the smart sensor processing without a teacher? When the external signals entered through a set of sensors into the brain, hundred millions excitations were generated by sensory neurons that took a lot of energy to sustain and therefore most of all redundancy would have to be decaying toward random brain waves to make room for further stimulus. What happened along the way of the naturally decaying process. Did the neuron-pathway take the advantage of the inevitable decaying to learn something? This suggests that the energy decaying process is naturally driven by the second law of thermodynamic that says that \u201cas the energy diffuses, the entropy always increases\u201d. The entropy increase processing needed no teacher because, for whatever the inputs the outputs at, the finish of learning happened at an energy minimization and local maximum entropy characterization of randomized diffusion of brain waves. Such an unsupervised learning of ANN had successfully reproduced the minimum redundancy correlation set of sensor pairs inputs in the form of oriented edge maps observed in cats first by Hubel and Wiesel in the multiple octave resolution. In the lowest resolution of pair sensor agreement, one's represented the binary agreement and the disagreement by zeros, and the location of the sparse one's is different from other oriented edges in the two-dimensional (2D) space. In so doing, the synaptic weight matrix among neurons extracts the edge features without the need of a teacher since the identical de-correlated outputs required no teacher to specify it for any inputs. A person with one eye could learn without a teacher by trying harder width the help of hardware multiplexing using internal memory by taking a second look. Such a capability of unsupervised learning turned out to be the key-learning ingredient of advanced Machine-IQ beyond the average robots.","Real world applications are mostly nonlinear or pseudo-linear. The present invention addresses the real world applications that are either nonlinear or linear by means of the second law of thermodynamics formulated in terms of the Lagrange Constraint Neural Network (LCNN). The linear LCNN algorithm is a special case of the nonlinear LCNN version (the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm of the present invention). A feed-forward version of the LCNN (the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm of the present invention)  is shown in .  is the single pixel, non-linear blind de-multiplexing algorithm  (the feed-forward LCNN Neural Network) of the present invention which is using the source ensemble average for the stochastic gradient that might have different mixing matrix [A] for each pixel and enjoyed the real-time pixel-by-pixel computation. Here, the feed-forward term means that learning is formulated in terms of the [W] matrix that represents inverse of the mixing matrix [A].","The single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm of the present invention is formulated on a pixel by pixel basis and consequently does not suffer from blurring effects due to pixel ensemble averaging operations.","In multi-spectral imaging applications (remote sensing, breast cancer detection, fiber-optic data gathering in tissue) the pixel ensemble average property will cause a loss of details that in some cases (breast cancer detection, detection of small objects in the remote sensing) could be unacceptable. The single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm used the source ensemble average for the stochastic gradient that might have different mixing matrix [A] for each pixel and enjoyed real-time pixel-by-pixel computation.","The acceptance of a new procedure, single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure, depended on its ability to make predictions. The thermodynamics entropy balance existed naturally in LCNN between the action and the reaction. On the other hand, there were those emotional Intelligence Quotient (e-IQ) that is known to like action and reaction influence our thought processes, \u201cthinking through feeling\u201d, which were emotion, timing, rhythm, guts feeling, body temperature etc. How could such novel capability be substantiated with the ANN model? The single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm accomplishes that because the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm predicted something else other than the neurons themselves must be involved in unsupervised learning. Without the external detail supervision, Lagrange constraints from the environmental heat reservoir {right arrow over (\u03bc)}  provided the necessary reaction forces to balance the action of neuron excitations generated by input data {right arrow over (x)} . The brain anatomy revealed that there were neurons modulating the synaptic weights for information processing and memory. In addition to neurons in the brain, millions of housekeeping cells whose active role in information processing was suspected but not yet been verified.","Theory of the present invention seemed to suggest that the Lagrange constraint forces play the role of those millions of cells doing more than the housekeeping of neurons activity but also maintaining the dynamic equilibrium of thermal reservoir. Thus, both neurons' actions and housekeeping cells reactions were simultaneously present in the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm, which is an LCNN model of ANN.","Since the sensor data vector {right arrow over (x)} has the physical dimensionality of Volts, about 100 milli-volts across the axon synaptic junction as measured by 1952 Nobel Laureate Hodgkin and Huxley, the Lagrange constraints {right arrow over (\u03bc)} that multiplied the data {right arrow over (x)} to produced the internal energy E must have the physical dimensionality of Amperes, pico-Ampere per ion channel measured by 1991 Nobel Laureates Neher and Sakmann in the dendrite tree as an active data pre-processing. It represented the housekeeping tutor for unsupervised learning truly without an outside teacher. Any direct or indirect evidences in biological and neuropsychological experiments of homeostasis unsupervised learning theory would be timely. The hypothalamus that sits above the pituitary gland, so-called \u201cthird eye\u201d in animal kingdom, located right at the geometric center of the brain, and can regulate many functions of brain and body. For example, the body temperature for a warm blood homeostasis animal is kept at a fixed temperature (37\u00b0 C. for most humans) in order to maintain a proper activity of the immune system and the enzymes catalytic reaction rate that balances the chemical reaction by a negative feedback system by means of the hormonal pathway (organic molecules e.g., antidiuretic hormone (ADH) regulated through the membranes, the intracellular (thyroxin to mitochondria), and the blood stream (e.g., adrenal, an enlarged ganglion, secrete adrenalin versus Amygdale fear and the depression Serotonin versus neurotransmitter). The balance is further controlled by the limbic (loop circuit) system connecting the Cerebral Cortex with the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland to translate complex emotion and drive into actions that in turn guide the motion perception and learning experience. From the definition of thermodynamic Helmholtz free energy, a constant cybernetic temperature Tallows simultaneously minimizing the internal energy for supervised categorization and the maximization of the entropy for unsupervised component analysis.","Mathematically, artificial neural network models of unsupervised learning seemed to predict a constant temperature Tfor minimization of the thermodynamic Helmholtz free energy, H=E\u2212TS. While the supervised learning (with implicit or explicit teaching) may be driven by the internal energy minimization, the unsupervised learning (sensory pre-processing) may be driven by the relaxation decaying processes by means of the maximization of local entropy. These models suggest it may also be important to the intercellular communication-mediated learning mechanism. Furthermore, minimization of the Helmholtz free energy H\u2261E\u2212TS at a constant Tthat involves the internal energy E and the entropy S is believed to have maintained the thermodynamic equilibrium of those intercellular communication mechanisms useful for Hebbian synaptic modification.","Infrared (IR) breast imaging using the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure of the present invention is based on all long, mid, and short infra-red (IR) wavelengths simultaneously capable for fusion and classification as the present invention is accomplished  based on the human brain pairs sensor unsupervised learning. Two color IR images registered properly  could provide physicians with better breast cancer diagnosis. Two registered color images  are components of the data vector X (or {right arrow over (X)}) and represent inputs to the LCNN algorithms. Outputs of the LCNN algorithms  are components of the source vector S (or {right arrow over (S)}). Unlike mammography which includes radiation hazards, there is no such risk in the passive two-color IR screening . In a case of massive deployment of U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) IR technology for the first-line home defense that will imply low cost of IR technology based medical equipment.","In situ fiber-optical data gathering or imaging devices using the single pixel, non-linear de-mixing procedure of the present invention  would be based on multiple mode fiber optical  for multiple sensing . Outputs of the multiple mode fiber  are components of the data vector X while outputs of the LCNN algorithm  are components of the source vector S.","Selective amplification hearing aids using the single pixel, non-linear de-mixing procedure of the present invention  would take the advantage of two-ear binaural processing  for de-noise echo cancellation and signal classification simultaneously. In two-ear binaural processing extracted signal is transmitted by a PDA-like device  to an earpiece . Components of the data vector X correspond with input to the LCNN algorithm . Components of the source vector S correspond with the output of the LCNN algorithm .","To differentiate benign from abnormal heat sources of the breasts by using the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure of the present invention, a pair of infrared imaging cameras is used to be complimentary to the X-ray mammogram as a convenient, inexpensive and non-intrusive first-line defense, which could be recommended as a massive screening supplement as well as tracking the risky patients longitudinally in time as frequently as deemed to be necessary without the radiation hazard.","A contribution of the present invention is the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure of the present invention together with the necessity of two cameras to take breasts' images simultaneously at two different spectrum bands (e.g., at the wavelength 1-3 \u03bcm or 3-5 \u03bcm & 8-12 \u03bcm) which is similar to the success of remote sensing at the satellite platform without the ground truth\u2014\u201cfrom tanks to tumors.\u201d","Indeed, U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) technology transition of Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) was traditionally implemented with a library of templates to determine close match with input data within a threshold. Unfortunately such a library approach could not be reliably applied to the breast thermal imaging that might vary according to capillary fluid flow constriction or dilation pattern that might be Angiogenesis carcinoma modulated by breast size, fatty tissue and skin textures to a lesser but unpredictable way.","The present invention includes an unsupervised classifier using the statistical mechanics based Lagrangian techniques in terms of the second law of thermodynamics contrast function, without relying on either the classical library hard templates or the modern artificial neural network (ANN) soft look-up extrapolation table based on supervised learning exemplars. Instead, following the biomimetics of two eyes, the present invention applies at least two imaging cameras  that give two spectral components of each pixel  forming a vector data set {right arrow over (x)}. System designed such that data vector X already correspond with the source signal S is only a special case of the present invention.","The present invention furthermore assumes that the breast tissue is a conservative propagation medium in the sense of neither sinks nor sources that the mixing matrix having two unit vectors that could be of any angles except in parallel . The reason why a pair could learn without a teacher might be explained by a unique orthogonal property that existed only in the vector domain called the vector inner product: given a mixture unit vector {circumflex over (\u03b1)}=(\u03b1,\u03b1), one could exhaustively find in a subspace a unit weight vector \u0175=(\u0175,\u0175)called the killing vector such that the summation of its products of the corresponding Cartesian components of the mixture vector happened to become zero.\n\n()\u2261+{circumflex over (\u03b1)}{circumflex over (\u03b1)}=0.\u2003\u2003(1)\n","According to the second law of thermodynamics, a suitable contrast function is the Helmholtz free energy so that one could systematically search the local minima generated by means of the killing weight vectors happened to nullify any one of two unknown mixing vectors. The mathematics is equivalent to a numerical game that might be called \u201cname that numbers\u201d, similar to a popular TV show of \u201cNAME THAT TONE\u201d. One had to guess what two positive integers in another person's mind were when that person gave two different combinations of these two hidden integers. The under-determined problem of special case of positive inverse problem is that 4 unknowns (\u03b8, \u03c6, s, s) must be determined from two data (X, X). In other words, each pixel of two images obtained from two cameras is considered as forming 2D vector.

From it, the sigmoid threshold and Hebbian learning, etc. attributes of ANN Models, , were successfully derived. Moreover, the Stat-Mech had achieved for the first time the truly unsupervised learning of the brain intelligence without the need of an outside supervisor, FIG. .","Since the brain wet-ware could be considered merely as another classical many cellular body problem, it should be equally suited for the Stat-Mech treatment. The general theory of the present invention began with the laws of thermodynamics that correctly proclaimed about the inevitable death of any macroscopic system including life systems: \u201cwhen the energy diffused, its entropy always increased\u201d. How could this law be utilized to model ANN? While the entropy increased, a data-constraint optimization achieved the balance. What would be the representation of data? The present invention assumed a local representation that permitted a linear matrix and vector algebra that could be generalized to nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus, the brain data {right arrow over (x)}(t) are a vector time series represented the energy-excited state of arbitrary dimension N. The present invention asked for the underlying minimum redundancy sources {right arrow over (s)}(t) of the dimension M that is unknown and equal to or less than N by the redundancy reduction Stat-Mech methodology.\n\n()=([()),\u2003\u2003(22)\n\nwhich gives:\n\n()=[(()),\u2003\u2003(23)\n\nwhere the unknown vector {right arrow over (g)}(\u2218) could be non-isotropic heat diffusion breast tissue function of the unknown sources {right arrow over (s)}(t) or and [W]\u2245[A]. The linear expansion coefficient matrices [A] and [W] were also unknown and had to be determined by the thermodynamic equilibrium theory. The mathematics of the blind inverse problem is peculiar and required the Stat-Mech skills when dealing with unknown or ill-defined matrix inversion algebra. Given the data vector, {right arrow over (x)}(t) one had to invert the nonlinear matrix-vector Eq.(24) to find the most probable sources {right arrow over (s)}(t) without knowing the coupling matrix [A].

In: , Cambridge, Mass., Blackwell Science, pp, 231-258, 1996) as an integral part of an early breast cancer, is of key importance for understanding the success of the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure of the present invention (the brain-like smart sensors pair unsupervised LCNN algorithm) to detect breast cancer as a class which is different from the healthy tissue. His concept was reiterated in 1996 by Guido and Schnitt (Guidi A. J., and Schnitt S. J., \u201cAngiogenesis in preinvasive lesions of the breast,\u201d 2: 364-369, 1996), whose observations suggested that angiogenesis is an early event in the development of breast cancer. They noted that it might occur before tumor cells acquired the ability to invade the surrounding stoma and even before there was morphologic evidence of a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Anbar (Anbar M, \u201cHyperthermia of the cancerous breast: Analysis of mechanism,\u201d 84: 23-29, 1994; Anbar M., \u201cBreast cancer,\u201d in: , Ann Arbor, Mich.: CRC Press, pp. 84-94, 1994), using an elegant biochemical and immunological cascade, suggested that the empirical observation that small tumors capable of producing notable IR changes could be due to enhanced perfusion over a substantial area of breast surface via tumor-induced nitric oxide vasodilatation. That enables the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure of the present invention based on a multiple color IR sensory system to classify a tumor from healthy tissue that can be 1 mm in diameter and which can help to detect cancers that are not visible through mammography that was already shown for standard single-camera based thermography (Head J. F., Wang F., and Elliott R. L., \u201cBreast thermography is a noninvasive prognostic procedure that predicts tumor growth rate in breast cancer patients\u201d, 698:153-158, 1993).","The two-color camera is designed to operate in the long IR band between 8 and 12 \u03bcm. In that band physics of the blackbody radiation described in (equation) data model (6) will enable angular separation between mixing angles of the order of 0.1\u00b0 for the two objects with temperature difference of 0.1\u00b0 K. with the absolute temperature of 310\u00b0 K. Because at given temperature the blackbody radiation is maximal in the band between 8 and 12 \u03bcm this will give maximal signal level to the detector. In order to maximize signal-to-noise ratio camera must be cooled to minimize dark current level. In this regard, the quantum well IR photodetectors are very promising technology long IR detectors due to the property of the quantum well detectors to narrow bandgap of the detector without having to deal with the poor properties of narrow-gap semiconductors. This enables low-energy long IR photons (8 and 12 \u03bcm) to generate significantly more currents i.e., to increase efficiency. Because dark current level is governed by temperature this reduces cooling requirements on the quantum-well detectors that operate in the region between 8 and 9 \u03bcm. Consequently, cooling at the refrigerator level could be enough to compensate for dark current effect.","Following the logic of the angiogenesis concept, which due to the enhanced perfusion over a substantial area of breast surface via tumor-induced nitric oxide vasodilatation enabled early breast cancer detection as a class which is different from healthy tissue, the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure of the present invention can be applied to passively detect blockages in the body fluid circulatory system as well.","In situ fiber-optical data gathering or imaging devices using the single pixel, non-linear de-mixing procedure of the present invention are accomplished using the embodiment of the multiple mode fiber optical for multiple sensing as illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0207","num":"0206"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":["2300","2302","2304"],"sub":["1","2"]},"As shown in , an image of the tissue () is presented by the ocular lens () to the Dual-mode fiber relay (), which transmits the image to the ocular lens ().

The independent classes of the left breast shown in  represent thermal classes of normal diffusive heat coming from large blood vessels since most large heat classes come from the blood vessels inside of the breast (Ch. Gorman, \u201cRethinking Breast Cancer,\u201d , pp. 50-58, Feb. 18, 2002). The left breast de-mixed data into good and bad classes is shown in  while the original data are shown in . The right upper half near the nipple, marked with the white circle, had a broken ring of small white pixel dots (less than millimeter in size each and connected in the outside right quadrant) sharing the same texture of capillary shallow blood heat supply as the rest but they should not be there since the nipple does not usually have such an abnormal characteristics unless a stage zero ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Left top is good thermal class (healthy tissue) because it represents a large heat class that comes from the inside of the chest. Unless DCIS exists the nipple does not usually has such characteristic (Ch. Gorman, \u201cRethinking Breast Cancer,\u201d , pp. 50-58, Feb. 18, 2002), because the physiology of the breast suggests no existence of such heat sources around the normal healthy nipple.","According to (Ch. Gorman, \u201cRethinking Breast Cancer,\u201d , pp. 50-58, Feb. 18, 2002) around 83% of the tumors were formed in the upper breast hemisphere. That gave strong indication that the mentioned right nipple surrounding region could be a DCIS. Tracking IR imaging history or histology would indicate whether DCIS were present. Following the same line of argumentation the left breast, shown in de-mixed independent classes in , could be considered to be healthy one since no such anomalies could be observed there. Here the texture representing blood heat supply comes all around the nipple without a break in the texture continuity.","The single-pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm of the present invention, based on the feed-forward Lagrange Constraint Neural Network (LCNN) and multiple spectral data per pixel, increase the effectiveness of surveillance systems.","Thus, the present invention comprises features including:","1. a two-stage implementation of the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure (the unsupervised nonlinear feed-forward Lagrange Constraint Neural Network (LCNN) signal and image classification algorithm) according to Equations (1)-(52) and  where in  first stage includes linearization or rectification and the second stage includes linear deterministic blind signal separation algorithm applied on linearized or rectified data vector assuming that the linearity condition g(x)=xis satisfied.","2. the linear version of the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure (the nonlinear feed-forward LCCN algorithm) as in feature 1., according to the linearity condition g(x)=xfor unsupervised linear signal and image separation and classification as described by the Equations (1)-(52) the flow-chart diagram of which has been shown in .","3. implementation of the linear non-linear version of the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure (nonlinear or linear feed-forward LCNN algorithm) as in features 1. and 2. in a scalable way on analog and mixed (analog and digital) VLSI circuits based on the design shown in , , , and  and an example of such scalable solution for 0.25 micrometer VLSI implementation shown in .","4. implementation of the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure as an unsupervised nonlinear signal and image separation and classification algorithm coined Lagrange Constraint Neural Network (feed-forward LCNN) as described by equations (1)-(52) and in features 1 and 2 on a digital signal processor (DSP) or Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) in accordance with the flow-chart diagram shown in .","5. a two-camera single optical axis based IR imaging system such as shown in .","6. early breast pre-cancer ductal carcinoma in situ tumor classification, diagnosis and tracking by using multiple camera sensory system as discussed in feature 5 and the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure as a smart unsupervised feed-forward LCNN algorithm as discussed in features 1, 2, 3, and 4.","7. tracking IR imaging history or histology by using a two-camera single optical axis based sensory system as discussed in feature 5 and the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure as a smart unsupervised LCNN algorithm as discussed in features 1, 2, 3, and 5 in a way as discussed in feature 6.","8. in situ fiber-optical data gathering by means of a multiple mode fiber-optic recording as shown in  and the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure as a smart unsupervised feed-forward LCNN algorithm for image processing and classification as discussed in features 1, 2, 3, and 4.","9. passive detection of blockages in the human body fluid circulatory system using the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure as an unsupervised LCNN algorithm as discussed in features 1, 2, 3, and 4 and multiple sensors based imagining and diagnostic equipment as discussed in features 5, 6, 7, and 8 and infrared imaging as well as to passively detect blockages in the body fluid circulatory system that might be of importance for coronary artery bypass surgery, diabetes, and deep vein thrombosis.","10. passive detection and diagnosis of rheumatic arthritis by means of two-camera single optical axis based sensory system as discussed in feature 5., and the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure as a smart unsupervised feed-forward LCNN algorithm as discussed in features 1., 2, 3, and 4.","11. selective amplification hearing aids through de-noise echo cancellation and signal classification simultaneously by means of two-ear binaural processing as shown in  and based on the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure as an unsupervised nonlinear or linear feed-forward LCNN algorithm as discussed in features 1., 2., 3., and 4.","In addition, the single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing procedure of the present invention can be used to enable a digital local thermometer to detect early pre-cancer in a home-screening environment using a single camera in which an exposure is taken of a particular body area, the film used is electric film (such as a charge-coupled device (CCD)) and is placed in electronic or freon cooling (refrigeration) overnight, and a second exposure of the same body area is taken using the same camera and the same film the next day.

Temporal integration is applied, such that the sequence is picture, cooling, picture again the next day, thus eliminating thermal noise (Brownian motion noise).","In addition, the Fast Simulated Annealing algorithm by H. Szu is used to seek the global minimum of Helmholtz Free energy of the isothermal system.","The present invention measures multiple radiation components forming a data vector per single pixel X=(X, X, . . . ) in order to determine uniquely the underlying sources forming a source vector S=(S, S, . . . ) propagating through a nonlinear mixing medium. The present invention adopts that the thermal diffusion is constrained isothermally at the equilibrium free energy, known as Helmholtz free energy: H=E\u2212TS where E is the energy, T is the equilibrium reservoir temperature and S denotes the classical Shannon information theory entropy. In this sense, the present invention generalizes the classical Shannon information theory, which states the special case of a closed system E=0 and the entropy must be evolving toward the maximum for the absolute equilibrium. The present invention postulates the state of an open equilibrium system defined by the feed-forward first order error energy E(X\/S)=\u03bc{g([W]X)\u2212S} which can be reduced to the second order Least Mean Square (LMS) error energy for a specific Lagrange constraint vector \u03bc. The present invention seeks among all possible vector sources S=(S, S, . . . ) the one that satisfies the minimum H for arbitrary mixing matrix [A] and smooth nonlinearity g: X=g{[A]S}. This physical condition of isothermal equilibrium is a strong constraint which permits the present invention to invert the single-pixel data blindly for S, without knowing ahead the mixing matrix and non-linearity.","Moreover, the practice of this patent has demonstrated the possibility of an early malign tumor detection by taking two pictures using two spectral cameras non-intrusively. Each pair of input pixel data vector has two components, a long wavelength (8-12 micrometer) and a middle wavelength (3-5 micrometer). Such a pair per pixel is defined as a vector X(pixel, t)=(X(pixel, t), X(pixel, t)), where t indicates a repetition time that can reveal the growth of a malign tumor which is usually mixed with a benign one in terms of a unknown percentage source vector S(pixel, t)=(S(pixel, t), S(pixel, t)). This expectation is realistic because the physics of radiation source indicates a shift toward a shorter wavelength spectrum X(pixel, t) associated with the massive nutrition feed of a warmer lymph and blood toward a rapid growth of a malign tumor (biologically known as the Angiogenesis property). Then, the quantitative value of the malign tumor source S(pixel, t)\/(S(pixel, t)+S(pixel, t)) can be determined by imposing the generalized information theory at a local equilibrium in terms of the Helmholtz free energy.","The present invention furthermore generalizes the physical demixing system to include brain-like unsupervised learning artificial neural networks. The present invention observes that input pairs (e.g., two eyes Xand X) can stimulate the binding of otherwise random brain waves which must diffuse to make room and save the energy E at an isothermal reservoir brain-temperature T (known as the cybernetic temperature of biological homeostasis theory).","The system also includes permanent or removable storage, such as magnetic and optical discs, RAM, ROM, etc. on which the process and data structures of the present invention can be stored and distributed. The processes can also be distributed via, for example, downloading over a network such as the Internet.","The many features and advantages of the invention are apparent from the detailed specification and, thus, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such features and advantages of the invention that fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation illustrated and described, and accordingly all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and various other features and aspects of various exemplary embodiments will be readily understood with reference to the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like or similar numbers are used throughout, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","302","304","306","308","301"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","404","406","402"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"500"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"600"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"700"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":"800"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":"900"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIGS. 10A and 10B","b":["1002","1004"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":"1100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":"1200"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":"1300"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 15","sub":["1","1"],"b":"1500"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":"1600"},"The single pixel, non-linear blind de-mixing algorithm (or procedure) of the present invention is embodied in hardware, software (as a computer program), or a combination of both, as discussed with respect to the following  and B.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 17"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 20","b":"2004"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIGS. 16-19"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 22"],"b":["2202","2204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":["2302","2304"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 24","b":["2402","2406","2408"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIGS. 27A and 27B","b":["2702","2704"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIGS. 28A and 28B","b":["2802","2804"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIGS. 29A and 29B","b":["2902","2904"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIGS. 30A and 30B","b":["3002","3004","3002","3004"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
