No. 60\/316,063, filed Aug. 30, 2001 which are incorporated by reference in their entireties.","The general field of the invention relates to peptides that comprise amino acid sequences having the ability to facilitate penetration of a substance of interest into cells and\/or cell nuclei.","Several techniques have been developed thus far to transfer DNA into cells, but none demonstrate real satisfaction. One of them, derived from the Mandel and Higa technique, based on acquisition by susceptible to transformation by treatment with CaCl, consists of co-precipitating DNA with calcium phosphate or DEA dextran, and introducing the precipitate obtained directly into the cell or nucleus. This method, besides the fact that it is toxic, is not selective.","Another method of directly introducing DNA, electroporation, consists of giving the cells a brief electric shock of several thousand volts, which allows the DNA to pass through the cytoplasmic membrane and to be introduced into the cell. This method is very toxic to the cells, involving high mortality and great variability, depending on the cells used. Other methods use receptors on the membrane to screen the entry of the gene into the cells. The DNA can then penetrate into the cell through either a specific ligand of these receptors, or specific antibodies of membrane constituents. The DNA-ligand complex thus penetrates into the cell by a process of endocytosis. This process is limited due to the fact that there is major destruction of the complex used in the lysosomal vesicles. Several processes have been developed to eliminate these disadvantages, but none gives complete satisfaction.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,635,383 describes another type of complex vector, based on polylysine, for transferring nucleic acids into cells.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,521,291 describes another method based on the use of a conjugate formed from a virus linked to a substance having a strong affinity for DNA via an antibody. Such conjugates are hard to use, and certain risks are associated with the use of viruses.","To try to eliminate these disadvantages, a process was described in patent application No. WO 97\/02840 that is used in vitro and consists of using anti-DNA murine antibodies, or their F(ab\u2032)2 and Fab\u2032 fragments, capable of penetrating inside live cells, as immunovectors for intracytoplasmic and\/or intranuclear transfer of biologically active substances. Although these vectors are highly effective, they can be complicated to use in some applications. Using molecules the size and complexity of antibodies can also be a major disadvantage in their handling and implementation.","Patent application No. WO 99\/07414 described how it was possible to use peptides in vitro, derived from anti-DNA murine antibodies, described in the above-mentioned application WO 97\/02840, as intracytoplasmic and intranuclear internalization vectors for biologically active substances.","Although these murine-origin peptide vectors are coded by the germinal line and carry no mutation, and consequently, should be antigenically close to those encountered in humans, the risk of an immune reaction in humans cannot be excluded.","There is a need for peptides and amino acid sequences that eliminate the disadvantages described above, namely that can be used as, or in, a cell internalization vector in humans and would pose none of the risks mentioned above. Having tools that make it possible to transfer substances of interest effectively from the outside medium to the inside of cells, and more specifically cell nuclei, is a major advantage in the field of biotechnology, especially to produce proteins or peptides to regulate the expression of genes, to analyze and screen intracellular signaling paths, or to analyze the properties of a given substance on a cell. Another important application of such tools concerns the field of gene therapy since, up until the present time, the various gene therapy processes have run into the same need, not met in an optimal way, which is to be able to have vectors that can transfer biologically active ingredients into the cytoplasm and\/or the cell nucleus from the host organism being treated, without thereby altering either the genome of the host or the biological properties of the active ingredients transferred.","The present invention is based in part on the discovery of peptides having the ability to facilitate penetration into a cell. In one aspect, the peptide comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of a) (XBBBXXBX); b) (XBBXBX); c) (BBXBBX); d) (XBBXXBX); and e) (BXBB), wherein B is a basic amino acid; X is a non-basic amino acid; each m is independently an integer from zero to five; each n is independently an integer between one and ten; and each o is independently an integer between zero to five. In various embodiments n is 2 or 3 and X is a hydrophobic amino acid. A preferred amino acid sequence of the invention is VKRGLKL (SEQ ID NO: 1). The peptide is further characterized by its ability to interact with aminoglycans. Preferred aminoglycans include heparin and chondroitin sulfate.","The peptide described above may further comprise an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of a) a CDR3 region of a human anti-DNA antibody; b) a CDR2 region of a human anti-DNA antibody; c) a CDR3 region of a murine anti-DNA antibody, and d)a CDR2 region of a murine anti-DNA antibody.","In another aspect, the invention provides a peptide having the ability to facilitate penetration into a cell, which comprises at least two or more domains, wherein one of the domains comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of a) XBBBXXBX; b) XBBXBX; c) BBXBBX; d) XBBXXBX; and e) BXBB, and wherein a second domain comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of a) XBBBXXBX; b) XBBXBX; c) BBXBBX; d) XBBXXBX; e) BXBB; and f) an antibody fragment, wherein B is a basic amino acid; X is a non-basic amino acid; each m is independently an integer from zero to five; each o is independently an integer between zero to five. In a preferred embodiment, the at least one domain comprises the amino acid sequence VKRGLKL (SEQ ID NO: 1).","In yet another aspect, the invention provides a peptide having the ability to facilitate penetration into a cell, which comprises at least two domains, wherein each of the domains comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of a) a CDR3 region of an anti-DNA antibody; and b) a CDR2 region of an anti-DNA antibody.","The anti-DNA antibody is of human origin. Alternatively, the anti-DNA antibody is of murine origin. In one aspect, the peptide comprises a CDR2 region and a CDR3 region. A preferred peptide comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6. Alternatively, the peptide comprises at least two CDR3 regions. A preferred peptide comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 15. In yet another embodiment the peptide comprises a CDR2 region flanked on each side by a CDR3 region. A preferred peptide comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 14.","The peptides of the invention are derived from a human protein. Preferably, the peptides are derived from a human lipoprotein B. Most preferably the peptides of the invention comprise the amino acid sequence VKRGLKL (SEQ ID NO: 1). Alternatively, the peptides of the invention comprise an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 25-48. In yet another embodiment the peptides of the invention may have the amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 17-21, 25-48.","The peptides of the invention are linked to a substance of interest. Generally, the substance of interest is any active ingredient of a drug, whether it be a chemical, biochemical, natural or synthetic product. The molecules can be small, with a molecular weight of around 500 D, or large like proteins of several thousand Daltons. The substance of interest is directly active or alternatively can be activated in situ by the amino acid sequence, by a distinct agent or by environmental conditions.","In one aspect, the invention provides a method of producing a translocatable conjugate between a peptide of the invention and a substance of interest. This method includes coupling the substance of interest to anyone of the peptides of the invention to form a peptide-substance conjugate.","In another aspect, the invention provides a method of translocating a substance into the cytoplasm and the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell. This method includes coupling the substance to anyone of the peptides of the invention to form a peptide-substance conjugate and contacting a cell culture in the presence of the peptide-substance conjugate.","In another aspect, the invention provides a method of increasing the intracellular concentration of a substance within a eukaryotic cell. This method includes coupling the substance to any one of the peptides of the invention to form a peptide-substance conjugate and contacting the cell with the peptide-substance conjugate, under conditions promoting active metabolism of the eukaryotic cell.","In yet another aspect, the invention provides a composition comprising a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of anyone of the peptides of the invention conjugated to a therapeutically active substance, and an acceptable carrier.","Also disclosed is a kit comprising in one or more containers, a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of the composition of the invention.","The invention discloses a method of treating or preventing a disease. The method of the invention includes administering to a subject in which such treatment or prevention is desired a composition according to the invention in an amount sufficient to treat or prevent the disease in the subject.","The invention also provides a vector for intracytoplasmic and intranuclear transport. The vector includes anyone of the peptides of the invention. Preferred peptides contain the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 5, 7, 10 or 13.","Also provided in the invention is a method for producing anyone of the peptides of the invention. The method includes transfecting a production cell with a vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule encoding the peptide operably linked to an expression control sequence, culturing the production cell under conditions that permit production of the peptide, and isolating the peptide.","In another aspect, the invention provides a peptide comprising an amino acid sequence capable of translocating into the cytoplasm and the nucleus of a cell, wherein the peptide is derived from a lipoprotein, the peptide comprises at least 4 basic amino acids, and is characterized by the ability to interact with aminoglycans in vivo, as measured by binding to at least one aminoglycan selected from the group consisting of heparin, heparin sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. The peptide may be derived from a human lipoprotein, and more preferably from human lipoprotein B.","Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In the case of conflict, the present Specification, including definitions, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.","The present invention discloses peptides which comprise amino acid sequences that have the ability to facilitate penetration of a substance of interest inside cells. In one aspect, the amino acid sequence is characterized by the fact that it comes from a protein of human origin and is capable of reacting with aminoglycans. In the invention, one especially preferred amino acid sequence comes from a protein synthesized by a human cell. Advantageously, the protein synthesized by a human cell is chosen from among the proteins linked to heparin-type or chondroitin sulfate-type aminoglycans. For example, it is an amino acid sequence that comes from human lipoprotein B.","\u201cFacilitate penetration\u201d is understood to mean facilitating the passage or translocation of a substance across a biological membrane, i.e., from the outside medium into the intracellular medium, and quite specifically into the cytoplasm and\/or the nucleus of the cell. The biological membrane can be those of prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. They can include membranes of organelles, either single- or double-membrane bound organelles, as well as plasma membranes. The biological membranes are for example a phospholipid membrane, mitochondrial membrane, or nuclear membrane. This penetration can be determined by various processes, for example by a cell penetration test having a first incubation step for the amino acid sequence in the presence of culture cells, followed by a fixing step and permeabilization of those cells, and then revelation of the presence of the amino acid sequence inside the cell. The revelation step can be done with another incubation in the presence of antibodies marked and directed against the sequence, followed by detection in the cytoplasm or in immediate proximity of the cell nucleus, or even within it, of the immunologic reaction between the sequence and the marked antibodies. Revelation can also be done by marking an amino acid sequence in the invention and detecting the presence of the marking in the cell compartments. A cell penetration test was described in the above-mentioned patent application No. WO 97\/02840.","Generally, the amino acid sequences of the invention include a high number of basic amino acids, as is the case in lysine, arginine or histidine, for example. \u201cHigh number\u201d should be understood as at least equal to 3.","One preferred type of amino acid sequence for use in the invention is composed of, or contains, at least one group of amino acids with one of the following formulae: a) (XBBBXXBX)n; b) (XBBXBX)n; c) (BBXmBBXo)n; d) (XBBXXBX)n; and e) (BXBB)n, wherein B is a basic amino acid; X is a non-basic, preferably hydrophobic amino acid, such as alanine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, valine or tyrosine; m is a whole number between 0 and 5; n is a whole number between 1 and 10, preferably between 1 and 3; and o is a whole number between 0 and 5.","Generally, the amino acid sequences have less than 100 amino acids, less than 50 amino acids is considered better, and less than 25 amino acids better yet. Advantageously, the amino acid sequences in the invention have between 6 and 25 amino acids.","Preferred amino acid sequences for use in this invention are those identified by SEQ ID NO: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23, 25, 26, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39. Among them, those especially preferred are the sequences identified by SEQ ID NO: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 16, 19, 20, 21, 23, 25, 26, 30, 36 and 38.","Another preferred type of peptide, for use in this invention, is composed of or includes at least two domains, one of those domains containing an amino acid sequence with the formula: a) XBBBXXBX; b) XBBXBX; c) BBXBBX; d) XBBXXBX; or e) BXBB, and the other of those domains having an amino acid sequence with the formula: a) XBBBXXBX; b) XBBXBX; c) BBXBBX; d) XBBXXBX; e) BXBB; or f) an antibody fragment, wherein B is a basic amino acid, X is a non-basic amino acid, preferably hydrophobic, m is a whole number between 0 and 5, o is a whole number between 0 and 5.","One particularly interesting amino acid sequence is the sequence SEQ ID NO: 1, to the extent that (1) in the state at least of dimer, it has the desired properties and (2) in the state of monomer or polymer, it gives another amino acid sequence to which it is coupled the properties or substantially potentiates those properties when the sequence already has them. Similarly, the peptides designated HBP3, (HBP3), HBP6, HBP7, HBP10 and HBP13 have this potentiation capacity.","More specifically, in one case or another, the desired properties of these amino acid sequences are that they react with heparin, the chondroitin sulfates and their derivatives. The peptides binding to the GAG or, more generally, to the aminoglycans, and in particular to heparin, heparin sulfate and the chondroitin sulfates (peptides generally designated by HBP, for \u201cheparin-binding peptide,\u201d even if heparin is only one example of aminoglycan) can be natural in origin, like the peptides described above, or artificial. They can be used in their natural or polymer (dimer, trimer, etc.) form.","It is known that a very large number of cell regulations depend on interactions between the proteins and the glycosaminoglycans (GAG) on the surface of cells (Cardin & Weintraub, Arteriosclerosis 9:21 (1989); Merton et al., Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 8:365 (1992); David, FASEB J. 7:1023 (1993); Salmivira & Jalkanen, Experimentia 51:863 (1995); Caldwell et al., Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 18:203 (1996); Fromm et al., Arch. Biochem. Bioph. 343:92 (1997)). Such interactions occur, for example, in the control of hemostasis (Hirsch, New Engl. J. Med. 324:1565 (1991)) in the proliferation of smooth muscle cells (Castellot et al., J. Cell Biol. 102:1979 (1986)), in the expression of the activity of the growth factors (Ruoslahti & Yamazuchi, Cell 64:867 (1991)), in the expression of the lipolytic activity of enzymes Robinson, Adv. Lip. Res. 1:1 (1963), in the integrity of the extracellular matrix (Kallunski & Tryggvason, J. Cell Biol. 116:559 (1992)) and others. In a given system, these biological effects are due to the interaction of one or a limited number of proteins with the GAG on the cell surface. The GAG are constituents very well preserved in the course of evolution, present on the surface of all eukaryotic cells. The GAG are saccharide polymers; for example, heparin is a polymer of disaccharide \u03b1-1,4-2-iduronic acid\u2192D-glucosamine and the chondroitin sulfates are polymers of disaccharide N-acetyl chondrosine, containing a very large number of sulfate groups and hence negatively charged. The proteins that react specifically with the GAG all contain, in their sequence, one or more peptide segments that are responsible for the interaction of those proteins with the GAG. The length of these segments varies from one protein to another, ranging from four to thirty amino acids. Nearly all these peptides are positively charged and contain a high number of basic amino acids, above all lysine and arginine. It has been shown that these amino acids participate in preponderant fashion in the interaction of these proteins with the GAG (Cardin & Weintraub, Arteriosclerosis 9:21 (1989); Merton et al., Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 8:365 (1992); David, FASEB J. 7:1023 (1993); Salmivira & Jalkanen, Experimentia 51:863 (1995); Caldwell et al., Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 18:203 (1996); Fromm et al., Arch. Biochem. Bioph. 343:92 (1997)).","\u201cHeparin or chondroitin sulfate derivatives\u201d or \u201caminoglycans like heparin or chondroitin sulfate\u201d are understood to mean any product or sub-product as defined in the publications cited in references (Cardin & Weintraub, Arteriosclerosis 9:21 (1989); Merton et al., Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 8:365 (1992); David, FASEB J. 7:1023 (1993)).","In one embodiment of the invention, the amino acid sequence is coded by the germinal line, and thus does not carry any mutations (substitution, deletion, addition, etc.).

They are sequences HBP10 and HBP15. These two sequences are characterized by their high basic amino acid content, and more particularly by the fact that they do not contain any lysine residue, contrary to the sequences useful for intracytoplasmic transport.","Each of the sequences described in Table 1 has at least 20% lysine residues, and at least 50% of the residues are basic amino acids out of the total number of residues in the sequence.","The invention also shows that coupling peptides, or their polymer forms, with a ligand, whose function is to react with a receptor present on the cell membrane, substantially increases that ligand's capacity to attach itself to the cell membrane.","In another aspect, the invention is aimed at using the amino acid sequences defined above to prepare compositions designed to transfer substances of interest into cells. This capacity of the peptides in the invention is an advantage to allow the transport of active substances through biological membranes and, quite specifically, through the hematoencephalic, hematoretinal, intestinal and pulmonary barriers. The peptides in the invention have the interest of being able to be used in forms of administration adjusted to both the active substance to which they are coupled and to the type of cell targeted, particularly those requiring passage through the above barriers.","\u201cSubstance of interest\u201d is understood to mean any product presenting an interest, particularly biological, pharmaceutical, diagnostic, tracing, or agro-food. They can be nucleic acids (ribonucleic acid, deoxyribonucleic acid) that can have various origins, and particularly, human, viral, animal, eukaryotic or prokaryotic, vegetable, synthetic, etc., and able to vary in size, ranging from a simple oligonucleotide to a genome or genome fragment. It can also be a viral genome or plasmid or a radio-opaque material. The substance can also be a protein, such as an enzyme, a hormone, a cytokine, an apolipoprotein, a growth factor, an antigen, an antibody, an antibody fragment, etc. The antibody can be a monoclonal antibody, such as IgG or IgM. The antibody fragment can be a single chain scFv. The substance of interest can also be a pharmaceutical composition such as a toxin, antibiotic, antiviral molecule or immune modulator. The scope of the invention extends to combinations of the amino acid sequence with a substance of interest as defined above.","A substance of interest is insulin. As used herein the term \u201cinsulin\u201d shall be interpreted to encompass insulin analogs, natural extracted insulin, or recombinantly produced insulin that is biologically active. By biologically active is meant the molecule has the ability to suppress or prevent disease symptoms of diabetes, e.g. decrease serum glucose. Biologically active insulin includes preproinsulin, proinsulin, insulin alpha chain, insulin beta chain and mature insulin, e.g., alpha and beta chain. The insulin can be derived from any species such as human, bovine, porcine, equine, canine or murine.","The term is intended to encompass the polypeptide normally used in the treatment of diabetes in a substantially purified form but encompasses the use of the term in its commercially available pharmaceutical form, which includes additional excipients. Insulin for use in the present invention can be obtained from numerous commercial sources such as Novo Laboratories (Danbury, Conn.), Nordisk-USA (Rockville, Md.) and Eli Lilly and Co. (Indianapolis, Ind.).","Porcine-derived insulin, human semi-synthetic insulin (Nordisk-USA) and cloned recombinant insulin (Eli Lilly) can be used when practicing the method of the present invention. The insulin is preferably recombinantly produced and may be dehydrated or in solution.","The term \u201cinsulin analog\u201d and the like are used interchangeably herein and are intended to encompass any form of \u201cinsulin\u201d as defined above, wherein one or more of the amino acids within the polypeptide chain has been replaced with an alternative amino acid and\/or wherein one or more of the amino acids has been deleted or wherein one or more additional amino acids has been added to the polypeptide chain or amino acid sequences, which still has at least one function of native insulin such as for example, decreasing blood glucose levels. In general, the term \u201cinsulin analogs\u201d of the present invention include \u201cinsulin lispro analogs\u201d, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,547,929, incorporated hereinto by reference in its entirety; insulin analogs including LysPro insulin and humalog insulin, and other \u201csuper insulin analogs\u201d, wherein the ability of the insulin analog to affect serum glucose levels is substantially enhanced as compared with conventional insulin as well as hepatoselective insulin analogs which are more active in the liver than in adipose tissue.

Examples that can be cited are the peptides in sequences SEQ ID NO: 2, 3, 17, 18, 19, 20,21, 33, 34, 37 and 38.","The second group of peptides of the invention has amino acid sequences capable of allowing penetration of a substance of interest inside the cell and the cell nucleus. Examples that can be cited are the peptides in sequences SEQ ID NO: 26, 35 and 39. It has been found that these peptides can be used both in vivo and in vitro as agents for internalizing substances of interest into cells.","A vector in the invention is characterized by the fact that it is composed of, or includes, an amino acid sequence as defined above.","As a variation, the vector is based on coupling, on one hand, of amino acid sequences reacting with aminoglycans and, on the other hand, of new peptides derived from the variable part of human anti-DNA antibodies. The coupling of amino acid sequences reacting with aminoglycans and peptides derived from variable parts of human anti-DNA antibodies inside one and the same molecule results in the preparation of a peptide vector that is particularly effective in translocation and intracellular transfer of substances of interest, above all when the amino acid sequences reacting with the aminoglycans are human in origin.","This combination also gives rise to a translocation and transfer vector specially adapted for use in humans. Indeed, as indicated above, although the peptide vectors of murine origin known from WO 97\/02840 are coded by the germinal line and carry no mutations, and consequently should be close to those encountered in humans in terms of antigens, it is possible that their injection into humans would induce an immune reaction. The peptide vector formed from HBP according to the invention and from peptides derived from anti-DNA antibodies, both of human origin, coded by the germinal line and carrying no mutations, prevents this problem.","The general characteristics of these peptides derived from human anti-DNA antibodies are close to those of the peptides of murine origin described in publication WO 99\/07414, while they have additional properties that distinguish them from the latter, namely:","1) The ability to penetrate inside cells, they have to have an active cell metabolism (culture temperature between 25\u00b0 C. and 39\u00b0 C., preferably and 37\u00b0 C.), while the murine peptides are clearly less dependent;","2) They react much less strongly with DNA than the murine vectors;","3) Their penetration capacity is not significantly influenced by the molecule they are going to transport inside the cell;","4) They penetrate better inside cells of human origin than inside cells of other origins.","The invention provides a vector composed of a HBP and one or more antibody fragments, preferably polyreactive, and more specifically one or more fragments that come from hypervariable regions of the antibody. Preferably, the vector that is the subject of the invention is characterized by the fact that it contains a fragment of the heavy chain of an antibody.","In the above-mentioned patent application WO 99\/07414, only fragments of a monoclonal IgG were used, which is a monomer immunoglobulin that is small in size and has a low molecular weight. The invention shows that it is also possible to use a fragment that comes from an IgM, which is a pentamer immunoglobulin, with a very high molecular weight.","The subject of the invention is therefore a vector for cell internalization, characterized by the fact that it contains one or more HBP and one or more fragments of an IgM or an IgG. Preferably, the vector contains all or part of the CDR2 region of an antibody. As a variation, the vector contains all or part of the CDR3 region of an antibody. More specifically, the vector contains at least one CDR3 region of an anti-DNA human antibody, selected from the group consisting of RTT79, NE-1 and R172.","In another variation, the vector of the invention can also contain all or part of region CDR2, and all or part of region CDR3.","By \u201call or part\u201d it is understood that the vector of the invention can contain either the whole CDR region concerned, or only part of it, provided that the vector retains the capacity to penetrate into the cells (functional homologue). By \u201cpart of CDR region\u201d is understood a CDR region deprived of one or more terminal amino acids. It can also be a CDR region in which one or more internal residues have been deleted or substituted for other amino acids, preferably amino acids of the same nature (basic amino acids, for example).","Some of the examples given in this patent application are based on the use of SEQ ID NO: 1 which comes from human lipoprotein B, but for a person skilled in the art, it is obvious that any natural or artificial HBP can be used.","As indicated above, the vector of the invention is particularly well suited for intracellular and intranuclear transport and transfer of substances of interest.","Unlike other techniques of internalization of a substance of interest into a cell, the techniques of the present invention rely on energy. Penetration of the peptides is completely inhibited by incubating the cells at 4\u00b0 C. It is also partly inhibited by inhibitors of cell metabolism, like sodium azide (inhibitor of ATPase) and genistein (inhibitor of tyrosine kinase and the bond to ATP). Therefore the mechanism for internalization of the peptides of the invention, and hence of the substances of interest coupled to the peptides, is dependent on energy. The vectorization using the peptides of the invention is therefore done via a receptor. The amino acid sequences of the invention are therefore characterized by their capacity to be fixed to a receptor located on the cell membrane and to cross the cell membrane via the receptor. Thus, the amino acid sequences of the invention are characterized by their capacity to be able to cross the cell membranes by an active mechanism, then to lodge in the cytoplasm and\/or cell nucleus. They are therefore distinguished from the peptide transporters in the prior art that were capable of crossing the cell membrane in a passive way.","It is thus possible to have a vector whose use is not limited, when it passes into the cell, by the size of the substances being transported. Indeed, the vectors of the invention are capable of transporting drugs, ranging from small chemical molecules (low molecular weight) to proteins or plasmid-type nucleic acids (high molecular weight). The use of these vectors thus opens a new path in intracellular protein therapy or gene therapy. This special capacity of the vectors of the invention for penetration makes it possible to target \u201cdrugs\u201d in the cells in a preferential way, thus contributing to a potential reduction in the toxicity of the drugs and a potential increase in the efficacy index.","The invention is therefore aimed at supplying a vector such as the one described above, characterized by the fact that it contains a substance of interest naturally, or not naturally, that can be incorporated into the cells and\/or the nuclei of the cells.","More specifically, the subject of the invention is a vector whose penetration capacity is quite independent from the nature of the substance of interest that is coupled to it. This characteristic, proper to these human vectors compared to the murine vectors, is of primary interest in the planned use of these vectors. But the invention is also interested in vectors that are adapted to the substance of interest which is coupled to it.","However, the interaction must be solid enough that the vector does not dissociate before or during cell penetration. For this reason, the coupling preferred in the invention is covalent coupling, although it can be non-covalent coupling. The substance of interest can be coupled directly to the peptide either on one of those terminal ends or on a side chain or one of the amino acids. The substance of interest can also be coupled indirectly by a connecting arm either to one of the terminal ends of the peptides or to a side chain of one of the amino acids.","The coupling can be done by any chemical, biochemical, enzymatic or genetic coupling process known to a person skilled in the art, but it is generally preferred to use a homofunctional or heterofunctional bridging reagent like succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC). Other coupling means that can be cited are those chosen from among: bi-functional or multi-functional agents containing alkyl, aryl, aralkyl or peptide groups; esters; aldehydes or alkyl, aryl or aralkyl acids; anhydride, sulfhydrile or carboxyl groups such as maleymil benzoic acid and maleymil propionic acid derivatives and succinimidyl derivatives; groups derived from bromide or cianogenic chloride, carbonyldiimidazole, succinimide esters or sulphonic halogenides.","In another embodiment of the invention, the substance of interest can also be coupled by any genetic engineering technique known to a person skilled in the art. \u201cGenetic engineering\u201d means using an expression vector in which the DNA coding for peptide vectors is cloned in phase in 5\u2032 and\/or 3\u2032 of the complementary DNA of the gene of interest. Expression of the fusion protein is under the control of a promoter. The expression system can be used in a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell for the production of the fusion protein. In a first form of embodiment, the substance of interest is coupled at the N-terminal end of the amino acid sequence in the invention. In a second form of embodiment of the invention, the substance of interest is coupled at the C-terminal end of the sequence.","Surprisingly, it has been shown that the vector that is the subject of the invention is capable of potentiating the biological activity and, potentially, reducing the toxicity of the coupled substance. The invention therefore also has as its subject a vector characterized by the fact that it makes it possible to increase the biological activity of the substance of interest to which it is coupled.","It has also been shown that the vector of the invention permits transfection of cells in vitro.","In one embodiment of the invention, the vector is coupled to the substance of interest by at least one molecule (called an \u201canchoring molecule\u201d) that has a strong natural affinity for the substance of interest to be internalized. The natural affinity of the anchoring molecule for the substance of interest allows the transporter to interact non-covalently with the substance of interest, and hence to carry it along in intracellular travel.","Another especially interesting advantage of this type of transporter consists of the fact that, due to the natural affinity of the anchoring molecule for the substance of interest, these two elements are coupled in a totally natural way, with no chemical or biochemical interaction.","This type of transporter is particularly interesting in a case where the substance of interest, due to its size and\/or its structure, proves difficult to couple directly to the amino acid sequence. This type of transporter can also prove particularly useful when the substance of interest is not very stable, and when any kind of chemical interaction for coupling it could degrade it or alter its activity.","In addition, the transporter in the invention cannot be specific for a single substance of interest, but can, on the contrary, permit internalization of several different substances of interest inside cells and\/or cell nuclei.","The invention also concerns eukaryotic cells that contain an amino acid sequence of the invention. It also concerns eukaryotic cells that contain a vector and\/or a transporter according to the invention. It also concerns any type of eukaryotic cell that has been transfected by a vector and\/or transporter according to the invention.","The invention also concerns a process to transfer a substance of interest inside a cell in vitro and to increase the biological activity of the substances of interest that has the following steps:","a) coupling the substance to an amino acid sequence, to a vector or to a transporter according to the invention, as described above, and","b) incubating the cell with the coupling product at a culture temperature that permits active metabolism of the cell.","Such a temperature is between 25\u00b0 C. and 39\u00b0 C., preferably 37\u00b0 C.","This invention also concerns a composition having as its active ingredient either vectors or transporters loaded with at least one substance of interest according to the invention, or eukaryotic cells that have been transfected according to the invention. Its subject is also the use of such compositions for the formulation and preparation of biological, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and agro-food products.","The scope of the invention extends to pharmaceutically acceptable alkaline or acidic addition salts, hydrates, esters, solvates, precursors, metabolites or stereoisomers, of the vectors and transporters loaded with at least one substance of interest. The scope of the invention also extends to pharmaceutical formulations having a vector or transporter loaded with at least one substance of interest in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, diluent or excipient.","The expression \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salts\u201d refers to non-toxic salts of the amino acid sequences in the invention that can generally be prepared by having the free base react with a suitable organic or inorganic acid.

The expression \u201cpharmaceutically effective quantity\u201d means a quantity capable of making the substance of interest penetrate sufficiently to induce the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human as expected by the researcher or attending physician.","The invention also covers pharmaceutical compositions suitable for the introduction of a substance of interest into a cell or cell nucleus. The compositions contain an effective quantity of a vector or transporter according to the invention, loaded with at least one substance of interest, alone or in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable supports.

The avidity of the different peptides with chondroitin sulfates A, B and C is, on the whole, on the same order of magnitude as that for heparin.

The modified peptide SEQ ID NO: 28 ((HBP3)+RGD) lost its affinity for heparin.","The cells are cultivated in the presence of the different peptides carrying, on the N-terminal side, biotin in decreasing concentrations (50 to 6 \u03bcg\/ml) in the culture medium for variable times (1-18 hours).","At the end of the culture, the cells are washed three times with PBS (0.15 M NaCl buffered with 0.01 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4) then fixed 15 minutes in ethanol at \u221220\u00b0 C. The penetration of the peptide is evaluated after incubation for 30 minutes with streptavidin conjugated with peroxidase (abbreviated S-PO for streptavidin-peroxidase). Then, the S-PO is eliminated, and the cells are washed. The activity of the peroxidase internalized is revealed by diaminobenzidine in the presence of HOand the cells are examined under a microscope (Ternynck & Avrameas, Editions INSERM (1987)). The microscopic examination showed that some of the peptides used (SEQ ID NO: 1, 4, 11, 12, 17 and 18) do not give any positive intracellular cytochemical coloration. With the other peptides, positive colorations, but of variable intensity, were noted. Faint coloration was observed with SEQ ID NO: 2, 6, 8 and 19, while, intensive colorations were obtained with the other peptides.","It is interesting to note that all peptides that contain SEQ ID NO: 1, that is HBP of human lipoprotein B, give a positive coloration except for SEQ ID NO: 1 itself (monomer) and SEQ ID NO: 11.","As far as SEQ ID NO: 1, 17 and 18 are concerned, they are short peptides that correspond to the HBP of human lipoproteins B and E and agrine. Unlike those monomer peptides, their dimers (SEQ ID NO: 2) and especially the trimer of SEQ ID NO: 1 (SEQ ID NO: 3) give clearly positive colorations.","As for SEQ ID NO: 11, it is composed of SEQ ID NO: 1 and CDR3 of anti-DNA human monoclonal antibody RT72 (coded by the germinal line), which contains only one basic amino acid (K). Unlike SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 5, 7, 9 and 10, which are composed of SEQ ID NO: 1 and CDR2 and\/or CDR3 of anti-DNA monoclonal antibodies (coded by the germinal line), contain a high number of basic amino acids and give intense coloration.","On one hand, these results suggest that a minimum of 3 to 5 excess basic amino acids must be present in the peptide sequence so that the peptide is able to penetrate inside the cells. On the other hand, SEQ ID NO: 1 is capable of increasing the translocation power of anti-DNA CDR2 and\/or CDR3 only when the latter have a high number of basic amino acids.

They are then diluted in 1 ml of complete culture medium, filtered on a 0.2 micron membrane and incubated with the cells for 4 hours. The cells are then washed three times with PBS.","To study the penetration of the complexes under a microscope, the cells are fixed as before for 15 minutes in ethanol at \u221220\u00b0 C., they are washed with PBS, and the activity of the internalized peroxidase is shown by diaminobenzidine in the presence of HO. To measure the quantity of peptide\/S-PO or A-PO complexes internalized, the cells are trypsinized, transferred into microtubes and counted. They are washed twice by centrifugation, then the residue is suspended in 200 \u03bcl of lysis buffer (Tris buffer, 0.1 M, pH8, 0.5% Nonidet). After 15 minutes, the peroxidase contained in the lysis buffer is dosed onto 96-well plates with ortho-dianisidine and HOby comparison with a standard curve for S-PO. The reading is taken at 450 nm. The quantity contained in the different samples is expressed in picograms (pg) per 10cells.","Generally, the results obtained by examining the cells under an optic microscope correlate well with the results obtained by measuring the internalized peroxidase.

This is in agreement with the results from Example 25, indicating that a time of incubation in HBSS longer than 4 hours alters the Caco-2 cell barrier.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0468","num":"0472"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00035","num":"00035"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 31"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"TEER Measurements"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Insert","TEER before","TEER after"]},{"entry":[{},"n\u00b0","incubation (\u03a9 \u00b7 cm)","transport (\u03a9 \u00b7 cm)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Insulin 1 h","1","458","478"]},{"entry":[{},"2","592","561"]},{"entry":[{},"3","445","425"]},{"entry":["Insulin 4 h","1","510","305"]},{"entry":[{},"2","451","324"]},{"entry":[{},"3","606","325"]},{"entry":["Insulin 8 h","1","442","151"]},{"entry":[{},"2","451","145"]},{"entry":[{},"3","498","151"]},{"entry":["HBP7-insulin 1 h","1","515","143"]},{"entry":[{},"2","434","202"]},{"entry":[{},"3","542","178"]},{"entry":["HBP7-insulin 4 h","1","639","129"]},{"entry":[{},"2","548","112"]},{"entry":[{},"3","600","116"]},{"entry":["HBP7-insulin 8 h","1","543","123"]},{"entry":[{},"2","583","95"]},{"entry":[{},"3","473","112"]},{"entry":["HBP10-insulin 1 h","1","553","537"]},{"entry":[{},"2","656","660"]},{"entry":[{},"3","599","573"]},{"entry":["HBP10-insulin 4 h","1","678","553"]},{"entry":[{},"2","451","386"]},{"entry":[{},"3","498","416"]},{"entry":["HBP10-insulin 8 h","1","650","194"]},{"entry":[{},"2","613","190"]},{"entry":[{},"3","605","186"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Free insulin concentrations were measured with an ELISA kit from Dako (ref. K6219). HBP-insulin conjugates were detected by a self-manufactured assay. Briefly, HBP-insulin conjugates were absorbed on heparin-coated wells in 96-well microtiter plates. The levels of HBP-insulin conjugates were quantified by an ELISA-derived assay using a mouse anti-insulin monoclonal antibody and a peroxydase-coupled secondary antibody.","The samples colected after incubation with the Caco-2 cells were transferred in BSA coated microtubes and at \u221220\u00b0 C. until insulin levels were measured. Free insulin levels stayed stable in the apical medium during the whole experiment. In contrast, the apical concentration of HBP-insulin conjugates decreased as a function of the time. At 8 hours, the levels of HBP7-insulin and HBP10-insulin corresponded to 25% and 35% respectively of the initial loading (). Significant decreases in HBP-insulin conjugate levels were also observed at 1 and 4 hours (). At these two time points, the levels of HBP-insulin conjugates were 70% of the initial loading at 1 hour for both conjugates. 54% and 64% of the initial loading at 4 hours, for HBP7-insulin and HBP10-insulin respectively.","A small quantity of free insulin was detected in the basolateral medium, (0.2% of the loaded material). No significant amounts of HBP-insulin conjugates were detected in the basolateral medium, possibly because the assay for the detection of HBP-insulin conjugates is 1000 fold less sensitive than the Dako assay for the detection of free insulin. Taking this difference of sensitivity into account, it would have been unlikely to detect such a small quantity of HBP-insulin conjugate.","A very small quantity of free insulin was found in the cell lysate, (approximately 0.004% of the initial loading). In contrast, the quantity of HBP7-insulin and HBP10-insulin detected in the cell lysate after one hour of transport reached 1% and 4% of the initial loading, respectively (). These levels were stable throughout the experiment, suggesting that the compounds did not accumulate intracellularly, and could exit the Caco-2 cells.","The filters on which Caco-2 cells were grown were also analysed for the presence of insulin and HBP-insulin conjugates. Free and HBP-insulin conjugates were detected on the filters using the same quantitation assay, allowing a direct comparison of the quantities of compounds that remained on the filters.","Results indicated that only a small amount of free insulin was remaining on the filters. In contrast, when coupled to HBP10 or HBP7, insulin conjugates clearly stayed trapped on the cell culture inserts.","HBP-insulin conjugates were synthesized as described in Example 30. In order to validate the measurement of conjugate concentration, several tests are performed. Recognition of insulin-HBP conjugates is verified using an RIA test. A standard concentration curve is established in vitro for each conjugate, in parallel with free insulin, so as to make sure that the conjugates are recognized by the anti-insulin antibody as well as to determine whether the conjugates can be quantified with a correct sensibility using the RIA test.","HBP-insulin conjugates were synthesized as described in Example 30. The activity of HBP-insulin conjugates are assessed in vivo, after a subcutaneous injection of appropriate levels of conjugates in hyperglycemic rats. Controls are injected with either free insulin or NaCl. Blood samples are collected at predetermined time points and analyzed for both insulin and glucose concentrations, using an ELISA and glucose oxidase method, respectively. An increase in blood insulin concentration and a subsequent decrease in blood glucose levels indicates that the HBP-insulin conjugates are biologically active.","In order to assess the passage of the intestinal barrier by the HBP-insulin conjugates, compounds are inserted into the ileal lumen of hyperglycemic rats. Controls are administered with either free insulin or NaCl, before evaluation of the passage of insulin in the blood of the treated rats.","Glycemia is controlled for all animals every 15 minutes for at least three hours following administration, then every hour for the following 12 hours. Blood samples are collected at predetermined time points and analyzed for glucose concentrations using a glucose oxidase method. A decrease in blood glucose levels indicates the passage of insulin through the intestinal barrier.","For those animals in which the in vivo tests indicate no biological activity of insulin however, in vitro quantification was possible using the RIA test, blood is taken at one time point after the subcutaneous injection and the level of insulin conjugate is determined by RIA in each blood sample. This direct detection of the insulin allows for the determination whether the conjugate has crossed the intestinal barrier.","Small intestinal ileal tissue of the hyperglycemic rats contacted with the HBP-insulin conjugates is collected in order to verify the integrity of the tight junctions. An immunocytochemical study is performed after a single time point (30 or 60 minutes) to demonstrate transcellular transport of insulin."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 5","sub":"1 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 11A-B","FIG. 11A","FIG. 11B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 13A-B","FIG. 13A","FIG. 13B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 14A-B","FIG. 14A","FIG. 14B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 15A-F","FIG. 15A","FIG. 15B","FIG. 15C","FIG. 15C","FIG. 15E","FIG. 15F"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 16A-F","FIG. 16A","FIG. 16B","FIG. 16C","FIG. 16D","FIG. 16E","FIG. 16F"],"sup":["125","131"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 17A-B","FIG. 17A","FIG. 17B"],"sub":"6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 18A-C","FIG. 18A","FIG. 18B","FIG. 18C"],"sub":"6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 21","sup":["14","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 22","sup":["14","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 23","sup":["14","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 25"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
