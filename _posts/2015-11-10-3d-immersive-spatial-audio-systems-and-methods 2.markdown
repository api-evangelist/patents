{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 62\/078,074, filed Nov. 11, 2014, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","In many situations it is desirable to generate a sound field that includes information relating to the location of signal sources (which may be virtual sources) within the sound field. Such information results in a listener perceiving a signal to originate from the location of the virtual source, that is, the signal is perceived to originate from a position in 3-dimensional space relative to the position of the listener. For example, the audio accompanying a film may be output in surround sound in order to provide a more immersive, realistic experience for the viewer. A further example occurs in the context of computer games, where audio signals output to the user include spatial information so that the user perceives the audio to come, not from a speaker, but from a (virtual) location in 3-dimensional space.","The sound field containing spatial information may be delivered to a user, for example, using headphone speakers through which binaural signals are received. The binaural signals include sufficient information to recreate a virtual sound field encompassing one or more virtual signal sources. In such a situation, head movements of the user need to be accounted for in order to maintain a stable sound field in order to, for example, preserve a relationship (e.g., synchronization, coincidence, etc.) of audio and video. Failure to maintain a stable sound or audio field might, for example, result in the user perceiving a virtual source, such as a car, to fly into the air in response to the user ducking his or her head. Though more commonly, failure to account for head movements of a user causes the source location to be internalized within the user's head.","This Summary introduces a selection of concepts in a simplified form in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the present disclosure. This Summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure, and is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the disclosure or to delineate the scope of the disclosure. This Summary merely presents some of the concepts of the disclosure as a prelude to the Detailed Description provided below.","The present disclosure generally relates to methods and systems for signal processing. More specifically, aspects of the present disclosure relate to processing audio signals containing spatial information.","One embodiment of the present disclosure relates to a method for providing three-dimensional spatial audio to a user, the method comprising: encoding audio signals input from an audio source in a virtual loudspeaker environment into a sound field format, thereby generating sound field data; dynamically rotating the sound field around the user based on collected movement data associated with movement of the user; processing the encoded audio signals with one or more dynamic audio filters; decoding the sound field data into a pair of binaural spatial channels; and providing the pair of binaural spatial channels to a headphone device of the user.","In another embodiment, the method for providing three-dimensional spatial audio further comprises processing sound sources with dynamic room effects based on parameters of the virtual environment in which the user is located.","In another embodiment, processing the encoded audio signals with one or more dynamic audio filters in the method for providing three-dimensional spatial audio includes accounting for anthropometric auditory cues from the surrounding virtual loudspeaker environment.","In yet another embodiment, the method for providing three-dimensional spatial audio further comprises parameterizing spatially recorded room impulse responses into directional and diffuse components.","In still another embodiment, the method for providing three-dimensional spatial audio further comprises processing the directional and diffuse components to generate pairs of decorrelated, diffuse reverb tail filters.","In another embodiment, the method for providing three-dimensional spatial audio further comprises modelling the decorrelated, diffuse reverb tail filters by exploiting randomness in acoustic responses, wherein the acoustic responses include room impulse responses.","Another embodiment of the present disclosure relates to a system for providing three-dimensional spatial audio to a user, the system comprising at least one processor and a non-transitory computer-readable medium coupled to the at least one processor having instructions stored thereon that, when executed by the at least one processor, causes the at least one processor to: encode audio signals input from an audio source in a virtual loudspeaker environment into a sound field format, thereby generating sound field data; dynamically rotate the sound field around the user based on collected movement data associated with movement of the user; process the encoded audio signals with one or more dynamic audio filters; decode the sound field data into a pair of binaural spatial channels; and provide the pair of binaural spatial channels to a headphone device of the user.","In another embodiment, the at least one processor in the system for providing three-dimensional spatial audio is further caused to process sound sources with dynamic room effects based on parameters of the virtual environment in which the user is located.","In another embodiment, the at least one processor in the system for providing three-dimensional spatial audio is further caused to dynamically rotate the sound field around the user while maintaining acoustic cues from the surrounding virtual loudspeaker environment.","In yet another embodiment, the at least one processor in the system for providing three-dimensional spatial audio is further caused to collect the movement data associated with movement of the user from the headphone device of the user.","In still another embodiment, the at least one processor in the system for providing three-dimensional spatial audio is further caused to process the encoded audio signals with the one or more dynamic audio filters while accounting for anthropometric auditory cues from the surrounding virtual loudspeaker environment.","In another embodiment, the at least one processor in the system for providing three-dimensional spatial audio is further caused to parameterize spatially recorded room impulse responses into directional and diffuse components.","In yet another embodiment, the at least one processor in the system for providing three-dimensional spatial audio is further caused to process the directional and diffuse components to generate pairs of decorrelated, diffuse reverb tail filters.","In still another embodiment, the at least one processor in the system for providing three-dimensional spatial audio is further caused to model the decorrelated, diffuse reverb tail filters by exploiting randomness in acoustic responses, wherein the acoustic responses include room impulse responses.","In one or more embodiments, the methods and systems described herein may optionally include one or more of the following additional features: the sound field is dynamically rotated around the user while maintaining acoustic cues from the surrounding virtual loudspeaker environment; the movement data associated with movement of the user is collected from the headphone device of the user; each audio source in the virtual loudspeaker environment is input as a mono input channel together with a spherical coordinate position vector of the audio source; and\/or the spherical coordinate position vector identifies a location of the audio source relative to the user in the virtual loudspeaker environment.","Embodiments of some or all of the processor and memory systems disclosed herein may also be configured to perform some or all of the method embodiments disclosed above. Embodiments of some or all of the methods disclosed above may also be represented as instructions embodied on transitory or non-transitory processor-readable storage media such as optical or magnetic memory or represented as a propagated signal provided to a processor or data processing device via a communication network such as an Internet or telephone connection.","Further scope of applicability of the methods and systems of the present disclosure will become apparent from the Detailed Description given below. However, it should be understood that the Detailed Description and specific examples, while indicating embodiments of the methods and systems, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the concepts disclosed herein will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this Detailed Description.","The headings provided herein are for convenience only and do not necessarily affect the scope or meaning of what is claimed in the present disclosure.","In the drawings, the same reference numerals and any acronyms identify elements or acts with the same or similar structure or functionality for ease of understanding and convenience. The drawings will be described in detail in the course of the following Detailed Description.","Various examples and embodiments of the methods and systems of the present disclosure will now be described. The following description provides specific details for a thorough understanding and enabling description of these examples. One skilled in the relevant art will understand, however, that one or more embodiments described herein may be practiced without many of these details. Likewise, one skilled in the relevant art will also understand that one or more embodiments of the present disclosure can include other features not described in detail herein. Additionally, some well-known structures or functions may not be shown or described in detail below, so as to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the relevant description.","In addition to avoiding possible negative user experiences, such as those discussed above, maintenance of a stable sound field induces more effective externalization of the audio field or, put another way, more effectively creates the sense that the audio source is external to the listener's head and that the sound field includes sources localized at controlled locations. As such, it is clearly desirable to modify a generated sound field to compensate for user movement, such as, for example, rotation or movement of the user's head around the x-, y-, and\/or z-axis (when using the Cartesian system to represent space).","This problem can be addressed by detecting changes in head orientation using a head-tracking device and, whenever a change is detected, calculating a new location of the virtual source(s) relative to the user, and re-calculating the 3-dimensional sound field for the new virtual source locations. However, this approach is computationally expensive. Since most applications, such as computer game scenarios, involve multiple virtual sources, the high computational cost makes such an approach unfeasible. Furthermore, this approach makes it necessary to have access to both the original signal produced by each virtual source as well as the current spatial location of each virtual source, which may also result in an additional computational burden.","Existing solutions to the problem of rotating or panning the sound field in accordance with user movement include the use of amplitude panned sound sources. However, such existing approaches result in a sound field containing impaired distance cues as they neglect important signal characteristics such as direct-to-reverberant ratio, micro head movements, and acoustic parallax with incorrect wave-front curvature. Furthermore, these existing solutions also give impaired directional localization accuracy as they have to contend with sub-optimal speaker placements.","Maintaining a stable sound field strengthens the sense that the audio sources are external to the listener's head. The effectiveness of this process is technically challenging. One important factor that has been identified is that even small, unconscious head movements help to resolve front-back confusions. In binaural listening, this problem most frequently occurs when non-individualised HRTFs (Head Related Transfer Function) are used. Then, it is usually difficult to distinguish between the virtual sound sources at the front and at the back of the head.","Accordingly, embodiments of the present disclosure relate to methods and systems for providing (e.g., delivering, producing, etc.) three-dimensional, immersive spatial audio to a user. For example, in accordance with at least one embodiment, the three-dimensional, immersive spatial audio may be provided to the user via a headphone device worn by the user. As will be described in greater detail below, the methods and systems of the present disclosure are designed to recreate a naturally sounding sound field at the user's (listener's) ears, including cues for elevation and depth perception. Among numerous other potential uses and applications, the methods and systems of the present disclosure may be implemented for virtual reality (VR) applications.","The methods and systems of the present disclosure are designed to recreate an auditory environment at the user's ears. For example, in accordance with at least one embodiment, the methods and systems (which may be based on various digital signal processing techniques implemented using, for example, a processor configured or programmed to perform particular functions pursuant to instructions from program software) may be configured to perform the following non-exhaustive list of example operations:","(i) Encode the incoming audio signals into a sound field format. This allows for efficient presentation of a higher number of sources.","(ii) Dynamically rotate the complex sound field around the user while maintaining all room (e.g., environmental) acoustic cues. In accordance with at least one embodiment, this dynamic rotation may be controlled by user movement data collected from an associated VR headset of the user.","(iii) Process the encoded audio signals with sets of advanced dynamic audio filters, accounting for anthropometric auditory cues with emphasis on externalization.","(iv) Decode the sound field data into a pair of binaural spatial headphone channels. These can then be fed to the user's headphones just like conventional left\/right audio channels.","(v) Process the sound sources with dynamic room effects, designed to mimic the parameters of the virtual environment in which the source and listener pair are located.","In accordance with at least one embodiment, the audio system described herein uses native C++ code to provide optimum performance and grant the widest range of targetable platforms. It should be appreciated that other coding languages can also be used in place of or in addition to C++. In such a context, the methods and systems provided may be integrated, for example, into various 3-dimensional (3D) video game development environments in the form of a plugin.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["120","100","120","120","115"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","205","215"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["205","215","200","205","215","120"]},"In , M denotes the number of active sources being rendered by the system and method at any one time. In accordance with at least one embodiment, each of blocks  (Distance Effects),  (HOA Pan),  (HRIR (Head Related Impulse Response) Convolve),  (RIR (Room Impulse Response) Convolve), and  (Downmix) represents a processing step in the system , while blocks  (Anechoic Directional IRs) and  (Reverberant Environment IRs) denote dynamic impulse responses, which may be pre-recorded, and which act as further inputs to the system . The system  is configured to generate a two channel binaural output ().","The following description provides details about one or more components in an example system for providing three-dimensional, immersive spatial audio to a user, in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein. It should be understood, however, that one or more other components may also be included in such a system in addition to or instead of one of or more of the example components described.","Encoder Component","In accordance with at least one embodiment, the M incoming mono sources () are encoded into a sound field format so that they can be panned and spatialized about the listener. Within the system (e.g., system  shown in ), an instance of the class AmbisonicSource () is created for each virtual object which emits sound, as illustrated in the example class diagram  shown in . This object then takes care of distance effects, gain coefficients for each of the ambisonic channels, recording current source location, and the \u201cplaying\u201d of the source audio.","Panning Component","A core class, referred to herein as AmbisonicRenderer (), may contain one or more of the processes for rendering each AmbisonicSource (). As such, the AmbisonicRenderer () class may be configured to perform, for example, panning (e.g., Pan( )), convolving (e.g., Convolve( )), reverberation (e.g., Reverb( )), downmixing (e.g., Downmix( )), and various other operations and processes. Additional details about the panning, convolving, and downmixing processes will be provided in the sections that follow below.","In accordance with at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, the panning process (e.g., Pan( ) in the AmbisonicRenderer () class) is configured to correctly place each AmisonicSource about the listener, such that these auditory locations exactly match the \u201cvisual\u201d locations in the VR scene. The data from both VR object positions and listener position\/orientation are used in this determination. In one example, the listener position\/orientation data can in part be updated by a VR mounted helmet in the case where such a device is being used.","The panning operation (e.g., function) Pan( ) weights each of the channels in a spatial audio context, accounting for head rotation. These weightings effect the compensatory panning need in order to maintain the system's virtual loudspeakers in stationary positions despite the turning of the listener's head. In addition to the head rotation angle, the gain coefficient selected should also be offset according to the position of each of the virtual speakers.","Convolution Component","In accordance with one or more embodiments described herein, the convolution component of the system is encapsulated in a partitioned convolver class  (in the example class diagram  shown in ). Each filter to be implemented necessitates an instance of this class which may be configured to handle all buffering and domain transforms intrinsically. This modular nature allows optimizations and changes to be made to the convolution engine without the need to alter any of the rest of the system.","One or more of the spatialization filters used in the system may be pre-recorded, thereby allowing for careful selection of HRIR distances and the ability to ensure that there was no head movement allowed during the recording process, as is the case with some publicly available HRIR datasets. Further, the HRIRs used in the example system described herein have also been recorded in conditions deemed well-suited to providing basic externalization cues including early, directional part of the room impulse response. Each of the Ambisonic channels is convolved with the corresponding virtual loudspeaker's impulse response pair. The need for a pair of convolutions results from creation of binaural outputs for listening over headphones. Thus, there are two impulse responses required per speaker, or in other words, one for each ear of the user.","Reverberation Component","In accordance with one or more embodiments described herein, the reverberation effects applied in the system are designed for simple alteration by the sound designer using an API associated with the methods and systems of the present disclosure. In addition, the reverberation effects are also designed to automatically respond to changes in environmental conditions in the VR simulation in which the system is utilized. The early reflection and tail effects are dealt with separately in the system. For example, the reverberant tail of a room response may be implemented with a pair of convolutions with de-correlated, exponentially decaying filters, matched to the environments reverberation time.","Downmix Component","In the Downmix( ) function\/process, the virtual loudspeaker channels are down mixed into a pair of binaural channels, one for each ear. As the panning stage described above (e.g., with respect to the Pan( ) function\/process) has already accounted for the combination of each channel to the surround sound effect, the downmix process is rather straightforward. It is in this function also that the binaural reverberation channels are mixed in with the spatialized headphone feeds.","Virtual Soundcard","In accordance with one or more embodiments described herein, a complementary feature\/component of the 3D virtual audio system of the present disclosure may be a virtual 5.1 soundcard for capture and presentation of traditional 5.1 surround sound output from, for example, video games, movies, and\/or other media delivered over a computing device. Once the audio has been acquired it can be rendered.","As an example use of the systems and methods described herein, software which outputs audio typically detects the capabilities of the audio endpoint device and sets its audio format accordingly, in terms of sampling rate and channel configuration. In order for the system to work with existing playback software, an endpoint must be presented that offers at least an illusion of being able to output surround sound audio. While one solution to this is to require physical surround-sound capable hardware be present in the user's machine, this may incur an additional expense for the user depending on their system, or may be impractical or not even possible in a portable computer.","As such, in accordance with at least one embodiment described herein, the solution to this issue is to implement a virtual sound card in the operating system that has no hardware requirements whatsoever. This allows for maximum compatibility with hardware and software configurations from the user's perspective, as the software is satisfied to output surround sound and the user's system is not obliged to satisfy any esoteric hardware requirements. The virtual soundcard can be implemented in a variety of straightforward ways known to those skilled in the art.","Audio Acquisition","In accordance with one embodiment, communication of audio data between software and hardware may be done using an existing Application Programming Interface. Such an API grants access to the audio data while it is being moved between audio buffers and sent to output endpoints. To gain access to the data a client interface object must be used, which is linked in to the audio device of interest. With such a client interface object, an associated service may be called. This allows the programmer to retrieve the audio packets being transferred in a particular session. These packets can be modified before being output, or indeed can be diverted to another audio device entirely. It is the latter application that is of interest in this case. The virtual audio device is sent surround sound audio which is hooked by the audio capture client and then brought into an audio processing engine. The system's virtual audio device may be configured to offer, for example, six channels of output to the operating system, identifying itself as a 5.1 audio device. In one example, these six channels are sent 16-bit, 44.1 kHz audio by whichever media or gaming application is producing sound. When the previously described audio capture client interface intercepts this audio, a certain number of audio \u201cframes\u201d are returned.","Parameterization of Room Impulse Responses","In accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, there is provided a method of directional analysis and diffuseness estimation by parameterizing spatially recorded Room Impulse Responses (e.g., SRIRs) into directional and diffuse components. The diffuse subsystem is used to form two de-correlated filter kernels that are applied to the source audio signal at runtime. This approach assumes that the directional components of the room effects are already contained in the Binaural Room Impusle Responses (BRIRs) or modelled separately.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","450"]},"The diffuseness estimation method is based on the time-frequency derivation of an instantaneous acoustic intensity vector which describes the current flow of acoustic energy in a particular direction:\n\n()=()(),\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere I(t) denotes sound intensity, p(t) is acoustic pressure, and u(t) is particle velocity. It is important to note that I(t) and u(t) are vector quantities with their components acting in x, y, and z directions. The Ambisonic B-Format signals can comprise of one omnidirectional components (W) that can be used to estimate acoustic pressure, and also three directional components (X, Y, and Z) that can be used to approximate acoustic velocity in the required direction x, y, and z:\n\n()=()\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nand\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"u","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"msqrt":{"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":"z","mn":"0"}}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"i"},{"mrow":{"mi":"y","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"j"},{"mrow":{"mi":"z","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"k"}],"mo":["+","+"]}}}],"mo":"="},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"0 "},"Thus, the instantaneous acoustic intensity vector in the frequency domain, approximated with B-Format signals can be expressed as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"I","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c9"}},{"mfrac":{"msqrt":{"mn":"2"},"msub":{"mi":"z","mn":"0"}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"Re","mrow":{"mo":["{","}"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msup":{"mi":"W","mo":"*"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c9"}},{"mi":"U","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c9"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}],"mo":"="},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"4"}}]}}}},"br":{},"u":"t"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"\u03d5","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c9"}},{"mi":"arctan","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"-","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["I","y"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c9"}}},{"mo":"-","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["I","x"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c9"}}}]}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"5"}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"\u03b8","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c9"}},{"mi":"arctan","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["I","z"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c9"}}},"msqrt":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msubsup":{"mi":["I","x"],"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c9"}},{"msubsup":{"mi":["I","y"],"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c9"}}],"mo":"+"}}}}}],"mo":"="},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"6"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["x","y","z"]},"Now, in order to be able to extract a directional portion from the B-Format Spatial Room Impulse Response (SRIR), the diffuseness coefficient can be estimated that is given by the magnitude of short-term averaged intensity referred to the overall energy density:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00005","num":"00005"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"\u03c8","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c9"}},{"mn":"1","mo":"-","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msqrt":{"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mi":"Re","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["{","}"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msup":{"mi":"W","mo":"*"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c9"}},{"mi":"U","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c9"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}}}},{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mi":"W","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c9"}}},"mn":"2"},"mo":"+","mrow":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mi":"U","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c9"}}},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\/","mn":"2"}}]},"mo":"."}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"7"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"In the following example, a full SRIR has been processed in order to achieve a truly diffuse response.

In accordance with at least one embodiment, using this technique, a cardioid microphone (e.g., Mid or M) is facing forward (optionally it can be replaced with an omnidirectional microphone) and a bi-directional microphone (e.g., Side or S) is directed to the sides, so that its rejection zone is directly in the front. In M-S, the stereophonic images are created, for example, by means of matrixing of the M and S signals because in order to derive the stereo output signals with this technique, a simple decoding matrix is needed:\n\n\u2003\u2003(8)\n\n\u2003\u2003(9)\n","Real-Time Implementation Using Partitioned Convolution","As with the directional filtering performed by the HRTF convolution, reverberation effects are produced by convolution with appropriate filters. In order to accommodate the inherently long filters required for modelling reverberant spaces, a partitioned convolution system and method are used in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure. For example, this system segments the reverb impulse responses into blocks which can be processed sequentially in time. Each impulse response partition is uniform in length and is combined with a block from the input stream of the same length. Once an input block has been convolved with an impulse response partition and output, it is shifted to the next partition and convolved once more until the end of the impulse response is reached. This reduces the output latency from the total length of the impulse response to the length of a single partition.","Exploiting Randomness in Acoustic Responses","In the case when recorded SRIRs are unavailable, the diffuse reverberation filters can be modelled by exploiting randomness in acoustic responses. Consider the following model of a room impulse response. Let p[n] be a random signal vector of length N (where \u201cN\u201d is an arbitrary number) whose entries correspond to the coefficients of a random polynomial. Point wise multiply such a signal with a decaying exponential window w[n]=e\u2212\u03b2n also of length N. The room impulse response can thus be modelled as:\n\n\u2003\u2003(10)\n\nwhere  is the Hadamard product for vectors.\n","The reverberation time RTis the 60 dB decay time for a RIR. In the case of a model signal this can be easily derived from the envelope w[n] and can be obtained by solving:\n\n20 log()=\u221260 (dB)\u2003\u2003(11)\n\nto get\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00006","num":"00006"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"RT","mn":"60"},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"\u03b2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"ln","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msup":{"mn":["10","3"]}}},"mo":"."}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"12"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["H","z","P","e","z","z+z"],"sup":["\u03b2","N","\u03b2"],"sub":["n=1","n","n"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00007","num":"00007"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"H","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"z"}},{"mrow":{"mi":"P","mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"ln","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msup":{"mn":["10","3"]}}},"msub":{"mi":"RT","mn":"60"}}},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"z"}},"mo":"."}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"14"}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00008","num":"00008"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b2","mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":"-","mrow":{"mi":"ln","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"msub":{"mi":["z","n"]}}}}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"15"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"n"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00009","num":"00009"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"RT","mn":"60"},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"ln","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msup":{"mn":["10","3"]}}},{"mrow":[{"mi":"ln","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"msub":{"mi":["z","n"]}}}},{"mi":"ln","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"N"}}],"mo":"-"}]}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"16"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"The method outlined above deals with a constant reverberation time across frequency.
