{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE RELATED ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure is directed to a system for cross platform authentication, authorization and device access control. More particularly, the present disclosure is directed to a first and a second independent software platform where a user can share a network device, such as a digital video camera, between the first and second independent software platforms.","Social networks are known in the art. These software platforms are very advantageous for communicating and sharing information between vast numbers of users. Once a user accesses the social network, a listing of friends is provided whereby a user can communicate with a number of friends on the access list. Users would desire however to effectively share many devices with friends on a social network. However, if a user accesses multiple different software platforms with each different independent software platform having a number of access lists, sharing devices can be difficult, due to the inoperability between different social networks.","There are technological solutions that attempt to map user login information across multiple platforms; however this solution merely provides accessing multiple platforms at the same time in a secure manner and not sharing devices in a secure manner over multiple different social platforms. The prior art does not allow a user to gain access of a user's network devices along multiple platforms in a convenient, secure and easy manner.","According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a system for sharing a device. The system has a first computing device operating on a first software platform. The system is for authenticating at least a first user and accessing a first user's access list having at least one address of a second user. The system also has a second computing device operable with the first user and a second different software platform. A destination across the first and the second software platforms is mapped to selectively control the device associated with the first user from the first user's access list with the second user operating on the second computing device.","In yet another aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a system for sharing a network device between users using at least two different software platforms. The system has a first communication device communicatively coupled to a communication network and a first software platform operable on the first communication device or operable on the communication network.","The system also has a second communication device communicatively coupled to the communication network. A second software platform is operable on the second communication device or operable on the communication network. The first software platform comprises a first authentication program and a first access list. The first software program includes program instructions to select the network device desired to be shared.","The second software platform has a second authentication program and a second access list. The first software platform accesses the first access list to select an address associated with the second communication device. The first software platform communicates an output of the network device to users associated with the first or the second access lists associated with the first or the second software platforms.","In another embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a method of controlling a network device operable on a first software platform from a second software platform using an access list associated with the first or the second software platform. The method accesses the first software platform having a first access list and authenticates a first user using the first software platform. The method maps a path of at least a second user using the first access list in the first software platform. The second user accesses the second software platform and authenticates the second user.","The method provides an output of the network device to the second user using at least one of, or both of, the second software platform and the first software platform. The method manages the network device by controlling the network device with the first or the second software platform.","According to yet another embodiment of the present disclosure there is provided a recordable computer medium that comprises program instructions for authenticating at least a first user and accessing a first user's access list having at least one address of a second user. The recordable computer medium further comprises program instructions for mapping a destination across a first and a second software platform to selectively control or access a device by the second user from the first user's access list with the second user operating on a second computing device.","According to yet another embodiment of the present disclosure there is provided a system for sharing a device. The system includes a first computing device operating on a first software platform for authenticating at least a first user and accessing a first user's access list having at least one address of a second user.

After a number of unsuccessful login attempts, the method  will end and the system can suspend the account.","Turning now to , there is shown a method  showing access control of the network device across at least two independent software platforms. The method  commences at step , where user A associates a first software platform user account with a second software platform user account as shown in . At step , preferably the access list of user A is accessed for mapping along with the applicable network devices that are available, such as for example, an IP camera, or DVR recorder.","At step , the method  continues where user A can select a second user from an access list associated in the second software platform. For example, user A can select a second user in a FACEBOOK FRIENDS LIST\u00ae or in a different access list stored on a social network or the like. This chosen second user may not be a registered first software platform user. Turning now to step , user A selects an owned network device or a network device that user A has connected with the data manager  of  and that user A can control. Alternatively, the network device may be a device that user A can access from a different independent software platform. Preferably, the network device is one that user A is authorized to access; one that user A can receive data in a safe and secure manner; and one that user A can provide and receive control commands.","Turning now to decision block , a decision is reached whereby user A can manage and control the first network device through the first software platform along line  to step  or can share the first device along line  to step . At step , user A can add a second user from the access list of the second software platform as an authorized user that can view the output from the first network device and that can control the first network device within the second software platform. The second user is associated with the second software platform and may not be associated with the first software platform.","At step , the second user while staying in the second software platform can now access the output of the shared device from user A. The second user can control the first device as the network device is displayed as an available device in the second software platform for the second user. At step , the second user can select the network device for accessing and control purposes. At step , the network device can output video data from the network device through the first software platform to the second software platform to the second user.","Alternatively, the network device in the first software platform can send the data to the second user to view the data in the second software platform. For example, in the case where the first device is a network camera, the second user in the second software platform can view the output of the digital video camera, leave comments on the graphical display associated with the digital video camera, chat with user A while viewing the digital video, or can control the digital video camera to pan, tilt, zoom or perform any other control functions associated with the first digital camera.","Generally, in operation, the computer system operable with that method shown in  is controlled by an operating system. Typical examples of operating systems are MS-DOS and Windows95 from Microsoft Corporation, or Solaris and SunOS from Sun Microsystems, Inc., or the Apple OSX from Apple Corporation. As the computer system operates, input such as input search data, database record data, programs and commands, received from users or other processing systems, are stored on storage device. Certain commands cause the processor to retrieve and execute the stored programs. The programs executing on the processor may obtain more data from the same or a different input device, such as a network connection. The programs may also access data in a database for example, and commands and other input data may cause the processor to index, search and perform other operations on the database in relation to other input data. Data may be generated which is sent to the output device for display to the user or for transmission to another computer system or device. Typical examples of the computer system are personal computers and workstations, hand-held computers, dedicated computers designed for a specific purpose, and large main frame computers suited for use many users.
