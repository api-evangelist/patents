title: Method, system and program product for screensaver breakthrough of prioritized messages
abstract: Authorized priority alerts are permitted to “pop up” on top of a running screensaver in a computer display without suspending operation of the screensaver. A windows manager monitors for priority alerts from applications. If the screensaver is active in the display, the windows manager determines if the alert issuing application and alert type are permitted to breakthrough the screensaver. If so, an alert notification window identifying the content of the alert is generated and displayed in z-order on top of the screensaver, without interrupting the operation of the screensaver displayed underneath. Some notification windows implement security features by displaying only a portion of the content of the corresponding alert or completely obscuring the content of the alert and only notifying of the presence of the alert. An additional security feature requires the user to enter a password in the notification window before the content or type of alert is displayed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to information processing systems, and more particularly to a methodology and system for providing computer notification of prioritized messages.","2. Description of the Related Art","Computer desktop environments of all major operating systems support multi-threaded processing and multiple window displays. Separate running computer processes or applications are represented by graphical interfaces in separate desktop windows. Many users try to maximize their usable display space by using large monitors or possibly using multiple monitors to display multiple overlapping windows on the display.","A screensaver for a computer work station provides a computer user with the means of manually or automatically obscuring the display when the computer user is either absent or inactive at the work station for some period of time. In operation, the screensaver blanks the display or presents an attractive pattern or image, which is usually repetitively displayed until the user engages the computer. Although screensaver functions are successful in obscuring the entire display, there are certain types of information the user would like to continue to observe or monitor even while the screensaver is in operation. In particular, there are certain prioritized messages and notifications that would be preferable to receive, but are otherwise hidden by the screensaver. For example, it would be desirable for the user to see, either briefly or permanently, instant message windows, new email subject lines, severe weather alerts, stock ticker information or alerts, etc. Unfortunately, with screensaver functionality currently provided in modern computer systems, prioritized messages generated by executing processes communicating new and possibly time-critical information are hidden from view by the screensaver and cannot be observed by the user.","In accordance with the present invention, improved methods, systems and articles of manufacture for providing alert notification in a data processing system are disclosed. In one embodiment of the present invention, a windows manager monitors for receipt of an alert from a process requesting display of alert information in the display device of the data processing system while a screensaver is being displayed in a display device. The windows manager displays a notification window indicating the alert in a z-order above the display of the screensaver in the display device, wherein the screensaver continues operating to obscure at least a portion of the display device during display of the notification window. In one embodiment, the windows manager determines that the process and alert are authorized to breakthrough the screensaver before displaying the notification window.","All objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed written description.","With reference now to the figures, and in particular with reference to , a computer system  includes a processor unit , which is typically arranged for housing a processor circuit along with other component devices and subsystems of the computer system . The computer system  also includes a monitor unit  (which may be a CRT, a liquid crystal display, flat panel or other display device), a keyboard  and a mouse or pointing device , which are all interconnected with the computer system illustrated. Also shown is a connector , which is arranged for connecting a modem or network card within the computer system to a communication line such as a telephone line, cable or other communication medium. The connector  may also be implemented in a cellular or other wireless network.","Several of the major components of the system  are illustrated in the block diagram of . A processor circuit  is connected to a system bus , which may be any host system bus. It is noted that the processing methodology disclosed herein will apply to many different bus and\/or network configurations. A cache memory device  and a system memory unit  are also connected to the bus . A modem  is arranged for connection to a communication line, such as a telephone line, through a connector  (). The modem , in the present example, selectively enables the computer system  to establish a communication link and initiate communication with another computer system, or network or database server. Modem  may be an analog, Digital Subscriber Line or cable modem, for example.","The system bus  is also connected through an input interface circuit  to a keyboard  and a mouse or pointing device . The bus  is also coupled to a network interface subsystem  and a diskette drive unit . A video subsystem , which may include a graphics subsystem, is connected to a display device . A storage device , which may comprise a hard drive unit and\/or an optical CD, is also coupled to the bus . The diskette drive unit provides a means by which individual diskette programs may be loaded on to the hard drive, or accessed directly, for selective execution by the computer system . As is well known, program diskettes containing application programs represented by magnetic indicia on the diskette, may be read from the diskette drive, and the computer system is selectively operable to read such magnetic indicia and create program signals. Such program signals are selectively effective to cause the computer system to present displays on the screen of a display device and respond to user inputs in accordance with the functional flow of the application program on the diskette.","In general, an implementing computer system may include a plurality of processors in a multi-bus system in a network of similar systems. However, since the workstation or computer system implementing the present invention in an exemplary embodiment is generally known in the art and composed of electronic components and circuits generally known to those skilled in the art, the computer system details beyond those shown in  are not specified to any greater extent than that considered necessary as illustrated for the understanding and appreciation of the underlying concepts of the present invention and in order not to obfuscate or distract from the teachings of the present invention.","In , there is shown a functional block diagram of the user interface system implemented as a part of or in conjunction with the software operating environment within the exemplary system . As will be appreciated, while a software embodiment is disclosed, those skilled in the art will recognize that the functionality implemented by the user interface system can also be implemented through an entirely hardware environment of electronic components and circuits, or through a combination hardware and software environment including components from both. In this exemplary software operating environment, one or more applications and software modules comprising the user interface system interact with various modules and components of what is known in the art as an operating system. In addition, the various modules and components of the operating system interface with each other. Finally, the modules and components interface with hardware present on the computer system through what is known in the art as a device driver module and\/or through an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) adaptation layer. The specific device drivers, modules and applications identified in  control user interface devices in computer system . They are loaded into system\/cache memory \/, executed by processor  and managed by the computer's operating system (not shown).","As illustrated in , the user interface software system includes a windows management module  for implementing the screensaver breakthrough function as provided in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The user interface software system further includes a trackball device driver  coupled between a mouse trackball device (not shown) and a trackball interpretive module . The trackball device may be a movable mouse riding on a trackball or a stationary base unit for a trackball mounted on the base. The output of the trackball interpretive module  provides trackball input signals to the windows management module (WMM) . The trackball input signals are representative of user inputs from the mouse\/pointing device . The keyboard  is coupled through a keyboard device driver  and a keyboard interpretive module  to furnish inputs to WMM . A communication (COMM) device driver  couples the modem  to a COMM interpretive module  which, in turn, provides inputs to WMM . An internal disk or diskette drive  is operable to run disk and diskette applications  and provide application input to WMM .","WMM  is a process that runs on top of the operating system. In Linux, this is the X-windowing system. Applications make calls to the Window Manager's Application Programming Interface (API), which allow for the input\/output of data to the screen. In order to accommodate the large number of different application needs, operating systems typically provide such APIs to provide processes access to a wide variety of functionality that is common to many different applications. Any one application generally uses only a small subset of the available APIs. Providing a wide variety of APIs frees application developers from having to write code that would have to be potentially duplicated in each application.","WMM  coordinates the screen data flow from the various devices and applications into an orderly presentation of windowed information on the display device . WMM  generates display graphics to a flat panel or other display device by providing input signals to a display device driver  connected to the display device  in the exemplary illustration. WMM  has many internal subroutines to accomplish its overall function. As part of integrating keyboard, mouse, application and modem (e.g. Internet) input, WMM  must serve as the window manager for the system and handle window creation, window movement, window iconization, window resizing, window z-ordering and \u201cbring-window-into-focus\u201d (i.e., make it active), amongst many other functions. In order to manage these windows efficiently, it is necessary for WMM  to maintain a database, called a \u201cTable of All Windows,\u201d identifying all windows displayed or \u201cinconified\u201d for a particular session.","Screensaver functionality can be generated by the operating system, an application or WMM  directly. When a \u201cscreensaver\u201d function is invoked, WMM  prevents any processes from displaying data on the display. Additionally, some of the devices that interface with WMM  are masked off, while other devices may continue to function and update window images sent to WMM  even though the screen is \u201clocked\u201d by the screensaver function and will not update or change the display in response to the updates while the screensaver is running.","In any modem operating system (Linux, UNIX, Windows), multiple user identifiers are used for the separation of privileges. In UNIX\/Linux, the most powerful user is the \u201croot\u201d user, or the \u201cadministrator\u201d in Windows. The most critical processes requiring elevated privileges execute as the \u201croot\u201d user. In the case where certain software executing in the system has an urgent message for the user, the system's window manager allows the application to \u201cpop-up\u201d a window to the top of the user's z-ordered window scheme to be displayed at the top of the stacked windows in the display. In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, certain specified applications are permitted to display a notification window at the top of the z-ordering, even above the display created by a screensaver executing in the display.","As shown in , a table  is an exemplary Table of All Windows for the computer, and contains information about the contents of each window present in the display, including information regarding the nickname, z-order and the X-Y limits of the pixels of each window as it exists in the display. Each entry for a window also contains an identifier or \u201cnickname\u201d for the window, which is usually the same or similar to the identifier or \u201cnickname\u201d commonly seen in the activate button or \u201cpull-down bar\u201d for a window. The user also can cause the X-Y coordinates of each window within the display to change by moving or resizing windows about the screen. Software functions that create or modify the content of each window (such as applications executing in the computer system) create or modify the display values of the actual pixels identified in the table . In order to correctly perform this function, these software functions must always first obtain the X-Y coordinate data from table . From these X-Y coordinates, the height and width of the window can be derived. Although an actual table is far more complex, for this example, the screen is depicted as a 100\u00d7100 matrix. The last column of each entry for a window is the disk location of the last saved copy of the window.","The table entries in  would result in the exemplary screen display shown in . As the highest level z-order (i.e. \u201c1\u201d in the exemplary table ), the \u201cFax Viewer\u201d window  is displayed on top of all other windows. The order of display for the other windows is also determined by their z-order, except for Iconified applications (for example, the email application is currently Iconified) and is shown as an Icon (not shown) instead of as a separate Window in the display. The user can change the Bordering and the X-Y coordinates of any entry by taking actions like mouse clicking or window \u201cdrag\u201d and \u201cresize\u201d functions. Table  always contains one default entry that describes the background layer for the entire screen display and is always locked at the bottom of the Bordering by WMM . All active windows are displayed above the background in the user's display, even when the background is brought into focus (i.e., active) by the user clicking on the background.","Once a screensaver is activated in the display, the currently displayed windows are replaced by a static or dynamic image, animation, or in some cases a blank (black) screen. An event in the system will trigger WMM  to suspend the screensaver and to re-display the current screen. This event is usually some type of input by the user such as moving the mouse or hitting a key on the keyboard. In a preferred embodiment, these events are sensed by trackball interpretive module  and keyboard interpretive module  and are communicated to WMM , which then cancels the screensaver display being generated by display device driver  and reinstitutes the current screen as dictated by the table . In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, another type of event communicated to WMM  is an interrupt driven from an application or process executing within the computer system. If an application interrupt is received by WMM  while the screensaver is activated, WMM  first determines if a screensaver breakthrough is permitted for the particular application interrupt under the currently configured screensaver breakthrough policies, and, if so, WMM  proceeds to notify the user of the event by displaying a specified alert notification window on top of the screensaver in the z-ordering without suspending the screensaver display behind the alert window. In other words, the screensaver continues to be displayed and operate normally on the monitor to block the current screen display, but the priority message is displayed over the screensaver.","With reference now to , there is shown an individual window option screen provided to the user, called \u201cCreate Screensaver Breakthrough Settings,\u201d in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. This option screen allows the user to select the configuration parameters for certain specified windows when a specified alert event occurs while the screensaver is engaged. Settings for specific applications or processes are identified by a nickname. When initially selected, the \u201cCreate Screensaver Breakthrough Settings\u201d option menu automatically populates nickname entries for each process or application currently executing in the data processing system. The user indicates those applications that are permitted to \u201cpunch\u201d or pop through the screensaver as a \u201cBreakthrough Application.\u201d For each breakthrough application, the user identifies the type of alerts that are permitted to breakthrough, and for each such alert, the user can specify a \u201cNotification Window Style,\u201d which identifies how such an alert or event is displayed to the user at a layer above the screensaver in the display.","Other options could also be specified by the user in the screensaver breakthrough settings to more particularly control alerts and events allowed or denied to breakthrough the screensaver with a priority message. For example, the \u201cCreate Screensaver Breakthrough Settings\u201d might explicitly allow or deny entry of particular applications or applications running under particular users or groups. Further, the settings could specify breakthrough authorization of alerts above a predefined security level, without regard for which application generated the alert. Moreover, a notification window's style or behavior of the notification window could also be configured. For example, the notification window might periodically move around the screen or have some other dynamic feature for noticeability. The settings might also include a security feature that generates a special alert to break through the screensaver to notify the user that an alert was pending but without disclosing the content of the alert. In this embodiment, the alert might require the user to input a password or provide some other mechanism to authenticate the user as being authorized to receive the alert before the actual alert is displayed above the screensaver. These various alternative embodiments would be included as additional settings within the \u201cCreate Screensaver Breakthrough Settings\u201d screen, however not all such settings are shown in the figures.","After being set in the screen of , the user options are saved as screensaver breakthrough settings in table , as seen in . Table  need only be created once by the user, but may be updated whenever the user sees fit. When creating table  from the setting screen in , the user may also specify application \u201cnicknames\u201d in column  for applications not currently being displayed on the screen or executing in the system. Later activation of those applications within the operating system will load the application's window data into table  and activate screensaver breakthrough processing of the application's alerts in accordance with the settings for the application in table .","The operation of WMM  is now described in conjunction with , in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. After a period of inactivity or upon user activation, WMM  overrides the display of the current screen on the computer system and activates its screensaver functionality. Depending upon user settings, the screensaver blanks the screen or displays some other type of static or dynamic image on the screen in place of the windows and other graphical user interfaces being displayed on the screen. Following activation of the screensaver, WMM  continuously monitors the executing processes in the system for generated alerts or notifications. On receipt of such a notification, WMM  accesses table  at the entry  matching the nickname of the application or process issuing the notification. If the application is designated as a breakthrough application (), WMM  compares the received notification event with the specified priority alerts  in table . If the notification event matches a priority alert therein, such alert is permitted to punch through the screensaver. The notification window style  specifies the format and type of notification window displayed on top of the screensaver. WMM  interpolates the information presented by the received notification and generates a notification window therefrom, in accordance with the notification window style . WMM  then instructs displayed device driver  to display the generated notification window in a z-order on top of the screensaver display. This notification window is then displayed to the user on top of the screensaver, which continues to be displayed uninterrupted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 7"],"b":["501","801","501","503","509","511","503","511","801","702","704","700","706"]},"As seen in , a notification window  has broken through the screensaver. In accordance with the notification windows style , this email notification only displays the subject line of the email and not the entire email. Notification window  is a password protected dialog box issued by the word processor. In this example, a \u201csave query\u201d alert  generated the notification, but the notification window style  specifies a \u201cSecure Dialog Box\u201d style. Accordingly, the content of the notification issued by the word processor is not disclosed, and instead, WMM  generates the window  indicating to the user that the word processor requires the user's attention. Additionally, this notification window style also requires the user to enter a password in order to retrieve the actual content of the notification event from the word processor. Last, a notification window  has been generated in response to a stock alert from the web browser. In this example, WMM  generates a text message within the window conveying the stock alert generated by the web browser, in accordance with notification window style .","In an alternative preferred embodiment of the present invention, an application  ) implements the screensaver breakthrough for prioritized messages functionality, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. An application such as an email client takes advantage of this feature through a window manager API to request that particular messages specified by the application  supersede the screensaver in the z-ordering of the display generated by WMM . Within the application, an option setting table similar to table  would specify priority alerts  that are permitted to punch through the screensaver upon activation. Further, such a table would include the notification window style  to be used for the punch through window for such an alert.","With reference now to , there shown a flow diagram for an exemplary process used to initiate and set-up the screensaver breakthrough functionality of a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Process  starts at step  and proceeds to activate the screensaver breakthrough settings interface at step . At step , WMM  automatically populates the interface () with nicknames of all applications currently running in the computer system. Thereafter, process  queries the user to determine if an application nickname will be entered at decision block . If so, the user desires to set screensaver breakthrough settings for additional nickname(s) of applications that may execute in the future, and enters the application nickname into the interface as shown in step . Following either step  or , the user specifies applications having screensaver breakthrough functionality within the screensaver breakthrough setting interface at step . Thereafter at step , the user specifies within the screensaver breakthrough setting interface the alerts permitted to breakthrough a screensaver. At step , the user identifies a notification styles in the settings interface. Thereafter, process  ends at step .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1002","1004","1000","1000","1006","311","311","1008","1006","1008","704","700","1010","311","700","706","702","1006","706","1012","311","708","700","706","708","1014","311","311"]},"While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
