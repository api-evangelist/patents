title: Dynamic traffic routing and service management controls for on-demand application services
abstract: A network routing and service control design enables an internet protocol (“IP”) network to effectively divert, on-demand, a given set of IP traffic flow from its normally followed network path to a network-attached application service processing complex and then enable the IP network to re-inject post-processed (e.g., Distributed Denial of Service scrubbed) traffic back into the network for routing to an originally-intended destination. This design also provides a sophisticated control mechanism for application service providers and/or customers/users for service management purposes. For example, application service providers can manage network and service processing resources and customers/users can manage their service requests.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application relates generally to network routing and service control and, more particularly, to dynamic traffic routing and service management controls for on-demand application services.","An increasingly important class of internet protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) network application services includes services that, by nature, are dynamically invoked on-demand and selectively applied to a specified set of IP traffic flow. Examples of such services include, but are not limited to, scrubbing of Distributed Denial of Service (\u201cDDoS\u201d) attack traffic, blocking of deemed offensive Web uniform resource locators (\u201cURLs\u201d), and remote monitoring and diagnosis of application protocol problems.","Current designs to support application services do not adapt well to the on-demand nature of these services and the dynamically shifting nature of targeted IP traffic flow. Moreover, these designs do not lend themselves to service control automation for operational scalability and cost-effectiveness.","It is with respect to these and other considerations that the disclosure made herein is presented.","According to one aspect disclosed herein, a network routing and service control design enables an IP network to effectively divert, on-demand, a given set of IP traffic flow from its normally followed network path to a network-attached application service processing complex, such as a server complex including one or more servers configured to scrub DDoS attack traffic, enable the IP network to re-inject the post-processed flow back into the network, and route the post-processed flow to its originally-intended destination. This design also provides a sophisticated control mechanism for application service providers and\/or customers\/users for service management purposes. For example, application service providers can manage network and service processing resources and customers\/users can manage their service requests.","According to another aspect disclosed herein, traffic flow redirection is separated into two distinct layers: a packet transport layer and a flow routing control layer. The packet transport layer a priori establishes and maintains logical network paths between appropriate ingress\/egress network edges and one or more application service servers (e.g., residing at an application service processing complex) in the form of \u201ctunnels\u201d utilizing tunneling protocols such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (\u201cMPLS\u201d) or Generic Routing Encapsulation (\u201cGRE\u201d). The flow routing layer provides a signaling mechanism to cause one or more network edge routers to redirect, on-demand, a given set of IP traffic flow onto a designated tunnel to\/from selected application service servers.","According to yet another aspect, an intelligent application service controller processes on-demand application service requests and orchestrates traffic flow routing to optimize network and application service processing resources to distribute the targeted traffic volume evenly amongst the available processing complexes as service demand level and distribution vary, or to direct the targeted traffic at a particular subset of application processing nodes that are equipped with processing capabilities most suitable to the given targeted traffic.","The layered network design disclosed herein enables very fine grain selection of targeted traffic flow. For example, traffic flows that match a given tuple of {source\/destination IP addresses, source\/destination Transfer Control Protocol (\u201cTCP\u201d)\/Uniform Data Protocol (\u201cUDP\u201d) ports, protocol ID} may be selected rather than merely {destination IP addresses} as in current designs. This greatly enhances an application service's effectiveness. Moreover, this design enables an application service to make cost-effective use of the network and application processing resources, and to operationally and profitably scale as demand for the application service increases.","It should be appreciated that the above-described subject matter may be implemented as a computer-controlled apparatus, a computer process, a computing system, or as an article of manufacture such as a computer-readable storage medium. These and various other features will be apparent from a reading of the following Detailed Description and a review of the associated drawings.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended that this Summary be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Furthermore, the claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in any part of this disclosure.","The following detailed description is generally directed to a network routing and service control design that enables an IP network to effectively divert, on-demand, a given set of IP traffic flow from its normally followed network path to a network-attached application service processing complex, such as a server complex including one or more servers configured to scrub DDoS attack traffic or perform some other application service, enable the IP network to re-inject the post-processed flow back into the network, and route the post-processed flow to its originally-intended destination. The disclosed design also provides a sophisticated control mechanism for application service providers and\/or customers\/users for service management purposes. For example, application service providers can manage network and service processing resources and customers\/users can manage their service requests.","While the subject matter described herein may be presented, at times, in the general context of program modules that execute in conjunction with the execution of an operating system and application programs on a computer system, those skilled in the art will recognize that other implementations may be performed in combination with other types of program modules. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, components, data structures, and other types of structures that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the subject matter described herein may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held devices, mobile devices, wireless devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, minicomputers, mainframe computers, routers, switches, and the like.","Referring now to , a network  for providing on-demand application services and a routing overview for routing normal traffic flow within the network  will be described. On-demand application services include, but are not limited to, DDoS mitigation services such as black-holing attack traffic and scrubbing attack traffic, content filtering such as URL blocking, and remote application\/network protocol monitoring and diagnosis. Those skilled in the art will appreciate the applicability of various aspects disclosed herein to other application services.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","100","108","110","100","112","114","116","102","104","106","100"],"sub":["C","I","S","C ","I ","S "]},"Generally, the PE routers , ,  are routers located at an NSP's network edge and are connected to other routers or switches within the network . When a customer has not requested an application service from the application server , the PErouter  is configured to receive ingress IP traffic  and route the ingress IP traffic  to the PErouter . This is referred to herein as a normal traffic flow. It should be understood that normal traffic flow may be more broadly defined as traffic flow that is not diverted to the application server  for processing (e.g., DDoS scrubbing or processing in accordance with another application service). The PErouter  is configured to receive the ingress IP traffic  from the PErouter  and route the ingress IP traffic  to the CE  for delivery to the intended destination .","The CE router  is a router located at a customer premises and provides an interface (e.g., an Ethernet interface or the like) between the intended destination  and a NSPs network, particularly, via the PE. For normal traffic flow, the CE router  is configured to receive the ingress IP traffic  from the PErouter  and provide the ingress IP traffic  to the intended destination . The intended destination  may be, for example, a customer's local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d) or any device connected thereto including, but not limited to, one or more LAN routers, wireless LAN routers, or other IP devices such as computers, servers, video game consoles, or mobile devices (e.g., a smartphone, personal digital assistant, tablet computer, camera, or e-reader).","Turning now to , the network  for providing on-demand application services and a routing overview for routing redirected traffic flow within the network  will be described. The PErouter  is configured to redirect ingress IP traffic  (hereinafter \u201credirected ingress IP traffic \u201d) to the PErouter  in response to a customer requesting an application service from the application server . The PErouter  is configured to receive the redirected ingress IP traffic  from the PErouter  and route the redirected ingress IP traffic  to the L2SW . The L2SW  is configured to receive redirected ingress IP traffic  from the PErouter  and provide the redirected ingress IP traffic  to the application server  for processing (e.g., via DDoS scrubbing or another application service). The application server  processes the redirected ingress IP traffic  and sends post-processed traffic  to the L2SW , which provides the post-processed traffic  to the PErouter  for routing to the PErouter . The PErouter  receives the post-processed traffic  and then routes the post-processed traffic  to the CE router  for delivery to the intended destination .","In , the network  redirects traffic flow in response to the OAS SC  receiving an on-demand service request . In some embodiments, the on-demand service request  includes a request to initiate an instance of an on-demand service to which a user\/customer is subscribed. For example, a customer may subscribe to a DDoS scrubbing service and may be permitted to initiate an instance of the DDoS scrubbing service as a feature of their subscription. It is contemplated that the actual subscription may include provisioning of an application service for future on-demand service requests and may or may not be accompanied by a subscription fee. It is also contemplated that a customer may or may not be charged for each instance of the application service. In some embodiments, the on-demand service request  is not associated with a subscription and may be provided in accordance with a pay-as-you-go service model.","In response to receiving the on-demand service request , the OAS SC  generates a re-injection routing control message  and sends the re-injection routing control message  to the PErouter . The re-injection routing control message  instructs the PErouter  to deliver the post-processed traffic  back to the intended destination  after the application server  processes the redirected ingress IP traffic  in accordance with the on-demand application service requested by the customer. In some embodiments, the OAS SC  is configured to monitor traffic flow towards the intended destination , detect attack traffic, and, in response thereto, generate the re-injection routing control message .","Further in response to receiving the on-demand service request , the OAS SC  generates a diversion routing control message  and sends the diversion routing control message  to the PErouter . The diversion routing control message  instructs the PErouter  to divert ingress traffic from the normal traffic flow to the PErouter , as described above with reference to , to the redirected traffic flow to the PErouter , as described above.","Combined diversion and re-injection is particularly useful for DDoS attacks. For such attacks, and at the instruction of the OAS SC  as received in the diversion routing control message , the PErouter  routes the redirected ingress IP traffic  to a DDoS scrubber (e.g., implemented by the application server ). The DDoS scrubber then determines which packets in the redirected ingress IP traffic  are attack packets and which packets are legit packets (i.e., non-attack or normal packets). Although all traffic is diverted to the DDoS scrubber, only legit packets are then re-injected into the traffic flow of the network  by the PE as the post-processed traffic .","It should be understood that not all application services benefit from or require re-injection. As such, in some embodiments, such as for URL blocking, the OAS SC  forgoes generating a re-injection routing control message  and only generates a diversion routing control message . URL blocking may be utilized for situations wherein safe content and forbidden (blocked) content are hosted on the same server. In these situations, the IP address of the host server is determined and all traffic is diverted to a URL scrubber (e.g., implemented by the application server ). The URL scrubber then examines the payload of each packet to determine if the packet includes forbidden content or safe content. Packets containing forbidden content are discarded and packets containing safe content are placed back into the traffic flow with normal routing treatment.","It should be understood that some implementations of the network  include multiple PErouters , multiple PErouters , multiple PErouters , multiple CE routers , multiple intended destinations , multiple L2SWs , multiple application servers , and\/or multiple OAS SCs . Thus, the illustrated embodiments of the network  should be understood as being exemplary, and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.","Traffic flow redirection is separated into two distinct layers: a packet transport layer and a flow routing control layer. The packet transport layer a priori establishes and maintains logical network paths between appropriate ingress\/egress network edges and one or more application service servers (e.g., residing at an application service processing complex) in the form of \u201ctunnels\u201d utilizing tunneling protocols such as MPLS (e.g., for \u201con-net\u201d scenarios) or GRE (e.g., for \u201coff-net\u201d scenarios). Other encapsulation\/tunneling methods are contemplated. The paths established by the packet transport layer are relatively invariant, although the effected prefix of a particular network node may vary. The packet transport layer is independently maintainable thereby facilitating service preparedness testing. The flow routing control layer is configured to manage changing traffic flow of targeted ingress traffic. The flow routing layer provides a signaling mechanism to cause one or more network edge routers to redirect, on-demand, a given set of IP traffic flow onto a designated tunnel to\/from selected application service servers.","Turning now to , a network  for providing a DDoS mitigation service and scrubber provisioning within the network  will be described. The network  includes the PErouter , the PErouter , the PErouter , and the L2SW , as described in detail above with reference to . The network  also includes a DDoS mitigation service controller (\u201cDMS SC\u201d) , which is the similar to the OAS SC  described above, but is configured particularly for implementing a DDOS mitigation service provided by one or more scrubbers . A global managed internet service (\u201cGMIS\u201d) route reflector (\u201cRR\u201d)  is also illustrated and is configured to reflect (forward) routing instructions received by an edge router to one or more other edge routers, as will be described in detail below.","In the illustrated embodiment, the PErouter  is configured with a routing announcement NH(S)={W, L}. This routing announcement indicates that if the next hop \u201cNH\u201d for a given IP packet is the scrubber  (further abbreviated for convenience as \u201cS\u201d), the PErouter  directs the IP packet to the IP address W(representing the IP address of the WAN link via which the Scrubber is attached to the PErouter ) utilizing the MPLS label L. As a result of this routing entry, the PErouter  now knows how to direct packets to the scrubber  and, in turn, instructs the GMIS RR  to announce the PErouter  as the next-hop and the MPLS binding label Lfor packets directed to the scrubber  utilizing the routing announcement NH(S)={PE, L}. The GMIS RR  receives the routing announcement NH(S)={PE, L} from the PEs  and reflects it to other edge routers. In the illustrated embodiment, the GMIS RR  reflects it to the PE. The PE now knows to redirect ingress IP traffic to the scrubber  toward the PE utilizing the routing announcement NH(S)={PE, L} via a tunnel , if the PE is instructed to redirect traffic by the DMS SC  in response to the DMS SC  receiving an on-demand service request (e.g., the on-demand service request ) from a customer for a DDoS mitigation service or the DMS SC  otherwise detecting or receiving notification of detected DDoS attack traffic.","Turning now to , a network  providing a DDoS mitigation service and customer provisioning for an on-net site will be described. Customer provisioning is a packet control layer function. The network  includes the PErouter , the PErouter , the PErouter , the CE router , and the L2SW , as described in detail above with reference to . The network  also includes the DMS SC , the scrubber , and the GMIS RR , as described above with reference to . An intended destination of targeted hosts  is also illustrated.","As described above, a customer may subscribe to an on-demand DDoS mitigation service so that the customer can invoke an instance of DDoS scrubbing in response, for example, to a suspected DDoS attack. To effectively route processed traffic to a customer premises in which the targeted hosts  reside, a tunnel  needs to be created to support traffic flow from the scrubber  to the customer premises by way of the PE. In the illustrated embodiment, the PErouter  is configured with a routing announcement NH(C)={W, L}. This routing announcement indicates that if the NH for a given IP packet is the CE router  (further abbreviated here as \u201cC\u201d), the PErouter  directs the IP packet to the IP address W(the IP address of the WAN link to Customer Equipment) utilizing the MPLS label L. The PErouter  now knows how to direct packets to the CE router  and, in turn, instructs the GMIS RR  to announce itself as the next-hop and the MPLS label binding Lfor packets directed to the CE router  utilizing the routing announcement NH(C)={PE, L}. The GMIS RR  receives the routing announcement NH(C)={PE, L} from the PE and reflects it to the PE. As a result, the PE includes the routing announcement NH(C)={PE, L} in its routing table and now knows to direct processed traffic that is directed to the targeted hosts  toward the PE utilizing the routing announcement NH(C)={PE, L} via the tunnel .","The aforementioned customer provisioning scenario is for customers that are directed attached to the serving NSP's network and utilizes MPLS tunneling. This is also referred to herein as \u201con-net\u201d. In some scenarios, the customer may instead be attached to a competing NSP's network or another network with which MPLS tunneling is not shared between the networks. As a result, MPLS tunneling cannot be used to create the tunnel  from the scrubber  to the PE to provision the customer. For these scenarios, GRE-based tunneling is utilized, as will now be described in detail with reference to .","Turning now to , a network  for providing a DDoS mitigation service and customer provisioning for an off-net site will be described. The network  includes a customer premises network  and a serving NSP network . The customer premises network  is not directly attached to the serving NSP network  and thus the targeted hosts  are referred to herein as being \u201coff-net.\u201d In the illustrated embodiment, it is assumed that the serving NSP network  and the network to which the customer premises network  is attached do not share MPLS tunneling. In some embodiments, however, MPLS tunneling may be shared and customer provisioning is performed in accordance with the procedure described above with respect to .","In the illustrated embodiment, a GRE tunnel  with a label GREis created between the PErouter  and the CE router . The PErouter  is configured with a routing announcement NH(C)={GRE}. This routing announcement indicates that if the next hop for a given IP packet is the GRE tunnel , the PErouter  directs the IP packet to the GRE tunnel  utilizing the address G, which is defined in the PErouter's  routing table as DEST(GRE)=G. The PErouter  now knows to direct packets to the GRE tunnel  via the address Gfor delivery to the CE router .","Turning now to , a network  for providing a DDoS mitigation service and flow routing control for an on-net site will be described. The network  includes the PErouter , the PErouter , the PErouter , the CE router , and the L2SW , as described in detail above with reference to . The network  also includes the DMS SC , the scrubber , and the GMIS RR , as described above with reference to . An intended destination of the targeted hosts  is also illustrated.","In the illustrated embodiment, the targeted hosts  have suffered a DDoS attack and, in response, the CE router  generates an on-demand service request identified as NH(X\/Y)=C and sends the request to the DMS SC . In response to receiving the request, the DMS SC  translates the request into two primitives, a first of which, NH(X\/Y)=S, is directed to the PE to indicate that the next hop for incoming traffic directed to the targeted hosts  should be diverted to the scrubber  for DDoS scrubbing; and, a second of which, NH(X\/Y)=C, is directed to the PErouter  to instruct the PErouter  that any traffic directed to the targeted hosts  needs to go to the CE router . The first primitive is akin to the diversion routing control message  and the second primitive is akin to the re-injection routing control message , both of which are described above with reference to . The other routing entries and messages associated therewith, as described above, are shown for completeness and are not described again here.","Turning now to , a network  for providing a DDoS mitigation service and flow routing control for an off-net site will be described. The network  includes the PErouter , the PErouter , the PErouter , the CE router , and the L2SW , as described in detail above with reference to . The network  also includes the DMS SC , the scrubber , and the GMIS RR , as described above with reference to . Also illustrated are an intended destination of the targeted hosts  and a PE, which is a border PE in the other ISP network with which the PErouter  peers.","In the illustrated embodiment, the GRE tunnel  with a label GREhas been created (e.g., via provisioning in ) between the PErouter  and the CE router . The PErouter  is configured with a routing announcement NH(C)={GRE}. This routing announcement indicates that if the next hop for a given IP packet destined to CE  is the GRE tunnel , the PErouter  directs the IP packet to the GRE tunnel  utilizing the address G, which is defined in the PErouter's  routing table as DEST(GRE)=G. The PEs router  now knows to direct packets to the GRE tunnel  via the address Gfor delivery to the CE router .","Moreover, in the illustrated embodiment, the targeted hosts  have suffered a DDoS attack and, in response, the CE router  generates an on-demand service request identified as NH(X\/Y)=C and sends the request to the DMS SC . In response to receiving the request, the DMS SC  translates the request into two primitives, a first of which, NH(X\/Y)=S, is directed to the PE to indicate that the next hop for incoming traffic directed to the targeted hosts  should be diverted to the scrubber  for DDoS scrubbing; and, a second of which, NH(X\/Y)=C, is directed to the PErouter  to instruct the PErouter  that any traffic directed to the targeted hosts  needs to go to the CE router . The first primitive is akin to the diversion routing control message  and the second primitive is akin to the re-injection routing control message , both of which are described above with reference to . In addition to installing the routing announcement NH(X\/Y)=S, the PE also announces to the PE itself as the next hop for the prefix under attack X\/Y.","Turning now to , an exemplary DMS SC  and components thereof will be described. The DMS SC  is capable of executing software components described herein with regard to receiving and responding to on-demand service requests for DDoS mitigation services. The software components may be stored in a computer storage media including, but not limited to, volatile and non-volatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data. For example, computer media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other solid state memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (\u201cDVD\u201d), HD-DVD, BLU-RAY, or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by the DMS SC . For purposes of the claims, the phrase \u201ccomputer storage medium\u201d and variations thereof, does not include waves, signals, and\/or other transitory and\/or intangible communication media, per se.","It should be appreciated that the software components described herein may, when loaded into a processor of the DMS SC  and executed, transform the processor and the overall DMS SC  into a special-purpose computing system customized to facilitate the functionality presented herein. Such a processor may be constructed from any number of transistors or other discrete circuit elements, which may individually or collectively assume any number of states. More specifically, the processor may operate as a finite-state machine, in response to executable instructions contained within the software modules disclosed herein. These computer-executable instructions may transform the processor by specifying how the processor transitions between states, thereby transforming the transistors or other discrete hardware elements constituting the processor.","Encoding the software modules presented herein also may transform the physical structure of the computer-readable media presented herein. The specific transformation of physical structure may depend on various factors, in different implementations of this description. Examples of such factors may include, but are not limited to, the technology used to implement the computer-readable media, whether the computer-readable media is characterized as primary or secondary storage, and the like. For example, if the computer-readable media is implemented as semiconductor-based memory, the software disclosed herein may be encoded on the computer-readable media by transforming the physical state of the semiconductor memory. For example, the software may transform the state of transistors, capacitors, or other discrete circuit elements constituting the semiconductor memory. The software also may transform the physical state of such components in order to store data thereupon.","As another example, the computer-readable media disclosed herein may be implemented using magnetic or optical technology. In such implementations, the software presented herein may transform the physical state of magnetic or optical media, when the software is encoded therein. These transformations may include altering the magnetic characteristics of particular locations within given magnetic media. These transformations also may include altering the physical features or characteristics of particular locations within given optical media, to change the optical characteristics of those locations. Other transformations of physical media are possible without departing from the scope and spirit of the present description, with the foregoing examples provided only to facilitate this discussion.","The DMS SC  includes a DMS customer service (\u201cCS\u201d) portal function , a DMS service and network orchestration function , and a DMS routing control distribution engine (\u201cRCDE\u201d) function . These functions may be included in one or more software modules that are executable by a processor of the DMS SC . The DMS CS portal function  is now described.","The DMS CS portal function  is configured to provide an interface through which customers can interact with the DMS SC  to, for example, subscribe to a DDoS mitigation service, modify subscription settings, and submit service requests. The DMS CS portal function  is also configured to provide specifications and updates for traffic routing policies for purposes of injection routing control. Moreover, the DMS CS portal function  is configured to start and stop DDoS mitigation service and\/or tune the DDoS mitigation service at the direction of a customer or based upon predefined settings.","The DMS CS portal function  is responsive to a service control primitive defined as {prefix\/flow-spec, point-of-delivery, control action}, in which \u201cprefix\/flow-spec\u201d specifies the targeted flow, \u201cpoint-of-delivery\u201d specifies the intended destination, and the \u201ccontrol-action\u201d specifies the desired service action (e.g., scrubbed, dropped, etc.)) provided by a DMS CS management client  or the CE router . The DMS CS management client  or the CE router  may provide a service control primitive to the DMS CS portal function  using, for example, multi-hop external border gateway protocol (\u201ceBGP\u201d), a web-based graphical user interface (\u201cGUI\u201d), or a client\/server networked application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d). It is contemplated that authentication mechanisms may be used to authenticate a customer for secure interactions with the DMS CS portal function . It is also contemplated that the DMS CS portal function  may provide feedback to the DMS CS management client  and\/or the CE router  in response to service requests or other interactions.","The DMS CS management client  is also configured to facilitate customer sign-up for DDoS mitigation service. The DMS CS portal function , in some embodiments, prompts a customer to provide site information, which is then used by the DMS CS portal function  to check the site prefix against an address and routing registry  to validate the customer owns or is an administrator of the site. If the customer is validated, the DDoS mitigation service subscription can be initiated. Otherwise, the DDoS CS portal function  may inform the customer that no further action can be taken.","A subscription can be configured for manual or automatic detection of DDoS attack activity. For example, a basic subscription may rely upon customer notification of DDoS attack activity via service requests (service control primitives) to the DMS CS portal function . Alternatively, for example, a premium subscription may provide for DDoS attack traffic monitoring and detection via a DDoS monitor and detector . The DMS service and network orchestration function  is configured to receive input from the DDoS monitor and detector  and instruct the DMS RCDE function  to generate and send routing control primitives to the PE and the PE (e.g., a re-injection routing control message and a diversion routing control message, respectively).","The DMS service and network orchestration function  is also configured to communicate with a routing monitoring and traffic monitoring function  to receive network routing status and traffic distribution information. The DMS service and network orchestration function  also communicates with the scrubber  (or multiple scrubbers, not shown) to monitor load and provide tuning control when needed, for example, to off-load DDoS scrubbing activity to other scrubbers for load-balancing.","The DMS RCDE function  is configured to receive instructions to initiate DDoS mitigation service from the DMS service and network orchestration function , translate these instructions into the routing protocol primitives, and direct the routing protocol primitives to the PE and the PE.","Based on the foregoing, it should be appreciated that technologies for dynamic traffic routing and service management controls for on-demand application services have been disclosed herein. Although the subject matter presented herein has been described in language specific to computer structural features, methodological and transformative acts, specific computing machinery, and computer readable media, it is to be understood that the invention defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features, acts, or media described herein.
