In order to satisfy both the contradictory properties, there have been proposed toners having a core-shell structure including a core portion and a shell portion covering the core portion.","For example, Patent Document 1 discloses a resin binder for toners in the form of core-shell particles each including a core portion containing an amorphous resin obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component containing at least one of an alkyl succinic acid and an alkenyl succinic acid with an alcohol component, and a crystalline polyester, and a shell portion containing an amorphous resin obtained by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an aliphatic dialcohol with a carboxylic acid component. In Patent Document 1, it is described that the reason why the alkyl succinic acid or the like is used as the carboxylic acid component of the amorphous resin constituting the core portion is that the crystalline polyester contained in the core portion can be finely dispersed in the amorphous resin constituting the core portion and enclosed in the core-shell structure so that the resulting toner can be enhanced in high anti-staining property for carriers and charging rate.","Also, in Patent Document 2, it is described that when using an alkyl succinic acid or an alkenyl succinic acid as a carboxylic acid component of an amorphous resin of a core portion, it is possible to enhance a compatibility between the amorphous resin and a crystalline polyester contained in the core portion.","Patent Document 3 discloses a process for producing a toner which includes a first aggregation step of aggregating resin fine particles containing an amorphous polyester resin to produce a dispersion of a first precursor of toner particles, a mixing step of mixing the dispersion of the first precursor of toner particles with a dispersion of carboxyl group-containing polyester resin fine particles to produce a dispersion of a second precursor of toner particles, and a second aggregation step of aggregating the second precursor of toner particles to form toner particles for the purpose of enhancing a low-temperature fusing property, a heat-resistant storage property, an anti-breaking property and an anti-filming property of the resulting toner and suppressing occurrence of dusts and scattering of the toner.","Patent Document 1: JP 2011-197193A","Patent Document 2: JP 2011-197192A","Patent Document 3: JP 2010-145611A","The present invention relates to the following aspects [1] and [2]. [1] A toner for electrophotography including core-shell particles as a resin binder each including a core portion containing an amorphous resin (A) having a softening point of 105\u00b0 C. or lower which is obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component containing an alkenyl succinic acid with an alcohol component; and a shell portion containing an amorphous resin (B) obtained by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an aliphatic diol having 2 to 6 carbon atoms with a carboxylic acid component containing a trivalent or higher-valent polycarboxylic acid compound in an amount of 20 mol % or less. [2] A process for producing a toner for electrophotography, including the following steps 1 to 4:","Step 1: subjecting a resin aqueous dispersion containing an amorphous resin (A) having a softening point of 105\u00b0 C. or lower which is obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component containing an alkenyl succinic acid with an alcohol component to aggregation of the resin to prepare an aqueous dispersion of resin particles I;","Step 2: preparing a resin aqueous dispersion containing an amorphous resin (B) obtained by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an aliphatic diol having 2 to 6 carbon atoms with a carboxylic acid component containing a trivalent or higher-valent polycarboxylic acid compound in an amount of 20 mol % or less;","Step 3: mixing the aqueous dispersion of the resin particles I obtained in the step 1 with the resin aqueous dispersion containing the amorphous resin (B) obtained in the step 2 to aggregate the resin particles I and the amorphous resin (B), thereby preparing an aqueous dispersion of resin particles II; and","Step 4: coalescing the resin particles II obtained in the step 3.","As described in Patent Documents 1 and 2, there have been made studies on toners having a core-shell structure in which by using a crystalline polyester in a core portion of the core-shell structure, a softening point of the core portion is reduced to improve a low-temperature fusing property of the toner. However, when such a crystalline polyester serving as a plasticizable portion is contained in the toners, the resulting toners tend to be deteriorated in durability. For this reason, it has been required to develop toners capable of exhibiting excellent heat-resistant storage property, low-temperature fusing property and durability regardless of the presence or absence of the crystalline polyester.","The present invention relates to a toner for electrophotography which is excellent in heat resistant storage property, low-temperature fusing property and durability, as well as a process for producing the toner for electrophotography.","The present inventors have found that in a toner having a core-shell structure including a core portion and a shell portion, when an alkenyl succinic acid is used as a carboxylic acid component of an amorphous resin constituting the core portion and an aliphatic diol having 2 to 6 carbon atoms is used as an alcohol component of an amorphous resin constituting the shell portion, it is possible to obtain a toner for electrophotography which is excellent in heat resistant storage property, low-temperature fusing property and durability.","The toner for electrophotography according to the present invention includes core-shell particles as a resin binder each including a core portion containing an amorphous resin (A) having a softening point of 105\u00b0 C. or lower which is obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component containing an alkenyl succinic acid with an alcohol component; and a shell portion containing an amorphous resin (B) obtained by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an aliphatic diol having 2 to 6 carbon atoms with a carboxylic acid component containing a trivalent or higher-valent polycarboxylic acid compound in an amount of 20 mol % or less.","The reason why the toner for electrophotography according to the present invention is excellent in heat-resistant storage property, low-temperature fusing property and durability, is considered as follows.","That is, since the alkenyl succinic acid is used as the carboxylic acid component of the amorphous resin (A) constituting the core portion, in the case where a softening point of the amorphous resin (A) is adjusted to 105\u00b0 C. or lower, a glass transition point of the resin becomes lower than that of a resin obtained using no alkenyl succinic acid even if the softening points of both the resins are the same. As a result, it is considered that the resulting toner can be enhanced in low-temperature fusing property. Further, in addition to the use of the alkenyl succinic acid in the amorphous resin (A), since the aliphatic diol especially having 2 to 6 carbon atoms is used as the alcohol component of the amorphous resin (B) constituting the shell portion, a compatibility between the core portion and the shell portion can be reduced to an appropriate extent so that the core-shell structure of the toner can be well maintained to allow the core portion and the shell portion to suitably exhibit their respective functions. As a result, it is considered to enable production of a toner for electrophotography which is excellent in heat-resistant storage property, low-temperature fusing property and durability.","In addition, when the trivalent or higher-valent carboxylic acid compound is contained merely in a small amount, the resulting resin forms a good cross-linked structure so that a molecular weight thereof can be increased or maintained. However, if a large mount of the trivalent or higher-valent carboxylic acid compound is contained, it is considered that the resulting resin has a wide molecular weight distribution and therefore a large amount of low-molecular weight components are produced. On the other hand, since the low-molecular weight components tend to be miscible with various resins, the presence of the low-molecular weight components may increase the above compatibility between the core portion and the shell portion. In the present invention, since the content of the trivalent or higher-valent carboxylic acid compound in the amorphous resin (B) used in the shell portion is limited to a predetermined amount or less, the resulting resin can be prevented from exhibiting a wide molecular weight distribution, in particular, can be prevented from suffering from production of the low-molecular weight components. As a result, it is considered that the above core-shell structure can be maintained, so that a toner for electrophotography which is excellent in heat-resistant storage property, low-temperature fusing property and durability can be obtained.","[Resin Binder]","The resin binder for toners according to the present invention includes core-shell particles which each includes a core portion containing the amorphous resin (A) and a shell portion containing the amorphous resin (B).","<Core Portion>","(Amorphous Resin (A))","The amorphous resin (A) is obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component containing an alkenyl succinic acid with an alcohol component, and has a softening point of 105\u00b0 C. or lower. Thus, by reducing a softening point of the amorphous resin (A) to 105\u00b0 C. or lower, it is possible to enhance a low-temperature fusing property of the resulting toner.","[Carboxylic Acid Component]","The carboxylic acid component as a raw material monomer of the amorphous resin (A) contains an alkenyl succinic acid. By using the alkenyl succinic acid in the amorphous resin (A), in the case where the softening point of the amorphous resin (A) is adjusted to 105\u00b0 C. or lower, the glass transition point of the resulting resin becomes lower than that of a polyester resin used in the conventional toners, so that the obtained toner can be enhanced in low-temperature fusing property. Meanwhile, the alkenyl succinic acid used in the present invention may also include an alkenyl succinic anhydride.","<<Alkenyl Succinic Acid>>","The number of carbon atoms contained in an alkenyl group of the alkenyl succinic acid is preferably from 9 to 18, more preferably from 9 to 14 and still more preferably from 10 to 12 from the viewpoints of good heat-resistant storage property, low-temperature fusing property and durability of the resulting toner.","The alkenyl group may have either a straight-chain structure or a branched-chain structure, and preferably has a branched-chain structure from the viewpoints of good heat-resistant storage property, low-temperature fusing property and durability of the resulting toner.","In addition, from the viewpoints of good heat-resistant storage property, low-temperature fusing property and durability of the resulting toner, the alkenyl succinic acid is preferably in the form of a mixture of two or more kinds of alkenyl succinic acids. The term \u201ckinds\u201d used herein is intended to mean those derived from an alkenyl group, and those compounds that are different in carbon chain length of the alkenyl group or structural isomers thereof may be dealt with herein as different kinds of alkenyl succinic acids.","Therefore, the alkenyl succinic acid is preferably in the form of a mixture of two or more kinds of alkenyl succinic acids containing a branched alkenyl group having preferably 9 to 18 carbon atoms, more preferably 9 to 14 carbon atoms and still more preferably 10 to 12 carbon atoms from the viewpoints of good heat-resistant storage property, low-temperature fusing property and durability of the resulting toner. By using combination of two or more kinds of alkenyl succinic acids containing branched alkenyl groups which are different in number of carbon atoms from each other, the resulting resin exhibits a broad endothermic peak observed in the vicinity of a glass transition point thereof as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and therefore can provide a resin binder for toners which can exhibit a very extensive fusing temperature range.","Specific examples of the branched alkenyl group having 9 to 18 carbon atoms include an isododecenyl group or the like.","From the viewpoints of good heat-resistant storage property, low-temperature fusing property and durability of the resulting toner, the alkenyl succinic acid is preferably produced by reacting an alkylene group-containing compound (alkylene compound) and at least one compound selected from the group consisting of maleic acid, fumaric acid and anhydrides of these acids.","Examples of the alkylene compound include those alkylene compounds having 9 to 18 carbon atoms, preferably 9 to 14 carbon atoms and more preferably 10 to 12 carbon atoms from the viewpoints of good heat-resistant storage property, low-temperature fusing property and durability of the resulting toner.

invention, the alkylene compounds having 9 to 14 carbon atoms mean those compounds having peaks corresponding to respective molecular ions as measured by gas chromatography\/mass spectrometry.","A 1 L autoclave available from Nitto Koatsu Co., Ltd., was charged with 542.4 g of the alkylene compound A, 157.2 g of maleic anhydride, 0.4 g of an antioxidant \u201cChelex-0\u201d (triisooctyl phosphite; available from SC Organic Chemical Co., Ltd.) and 0.1 g of butyl hydroquinone as a polymerization inhibitor, and an interior of the autoclave was replaced with pressurized nitrogen (0.2 MPaG) three times. After stirring was initiated at 60\u00b0 C., the contents of the autoclave were heated up to 230\u00b0 C. over 1 h, and then reacted with each other at 230\u00b0 C. for 6 h. The pressure upon reaching the reaction temperature was 0.3 MPaG. After completion of the reaction, the resulting reaction solution was cooled to 80\u00b0 C., and after the pressure of the reaction system was returned to normal pressures (101.3 kPa), the reaction solution was transferred into a 1 L four-necked flask. The reaction solution in the flask was heated to 180\u00b0 C. while stirring, and the residual alkylene compound was distilled off therefrom under a pressure of 1.3 kPa over 1 h. Successively, the reaction solution was cooled to room temperature (25\u00b0 C.), and then the pressure within the flask was returned to normal pressures (101.3 kPa), thereby obtaining 406.1 g of an alkenyl succinic anhydride A as the aimed product. The average molecular weight of the alkenyl succinic anhydride A as calculated from an acid value thereof was 268.","The polyester raw material monomers except for trimellitic anhydride, tin (II) dioctylate and gallic acid as shown in Tables 6 and 7 were charged into a 5 L four-necked flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet tube, a dehydration tube having a fractional distillation tube through which a hot water at 100\u00b0 C. was flowed, a stirrer and a thermocouple. In a nitrogen atmosphere, the contents of the flask were held at 180\u00b0 C. for 1 h and then heated from 180\u00b0 C. to 230\u00b0 C. at a temperature rise rate of 10\u00b0 C.\/h, and thereafter subjected to polycondensation reaction at 230\u00b0 C. for 10 h, followed by further conducting the reaction at 230\u00b0 C. under a pressure of 8.0 kPa for 1 h. Further, the resulting reaction mixture was reacted with trimellitic anhydride at 210\u00b0 C., and the reaction was continued under a pressure of 10 kPa until reaching the softening point shown in Tables, thereby obtaining amorphous resins A1, A2, A4, A5, A9, B2 to B6, B8 and B10.","The polyester raw material monomers and tert-butyl catechol as a polymerization inhibitor as shown in Table 6 were charged into a 5 L four-necked flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet tube, a dehydration tube, a stirrer and a thermocouple.

The reaction was continued at 200\u00b0 C. until reaching a reaction rate of 80%. Thereafter, tin (II) dioctylate as shown in Table 6 was added to the obtained reaction solution, and the resulting mixture was reacted at 200\u00b0 C. for 2 h and further reacted under a pressure of 8 kPa for 2 h, thereby obtaining a resin c1 (crystalline polyester).","The polyester raw material monomers except for trimellitic anhydride, tin (II) dioctylate and gallic acid as shown in Tables 6 and 7 were charged into a 5 L four-necked flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet tube, a dehydration tube, a stirrer and a thermocouple.

thermometer and a nitrogen inlet tube was charged with 600 g of methyl ethyl ketone, and then 200 g of each of the amorphous resins A1 to A9, the crystalline polyester c1 and the amorphous resins B1 to B10 obtained in Production Examples 3 to 22 were added thereinto at 60\u00b0 C. to dissolve the respective resins in methyl ethyl ketone. The thus obtained respective solutions were neutralized by adding 4 g of sodium hydroxide thereto. Successively, 2000 g of ion-exchanged water were added to the respective solutions, and then methyl ethyl ketone was distilled off therefrom while stirring at a rate of 250 r\/min under reduced pressure at a temperature of 50\u00b0 C. or lower, thereby obtaining aqueous dispersions of self-dispersible resin particles (resin content: 9.6% by mass (in terms of a solid content)). The volume median particle size of the resin particles dispersed in each of the thus obtained aqueous dispersions was about 0.3 \u03bcm.","Fifty grams of copper phthalocyanine (Model No.: \u201cECB-301\u201d available from Dainichiseika Color & Chemicals Mfg. Co., Ltd.), 5 g of a nonionic surfactant (tradename: \u201cEMULGEN 150\u201d available from Kao Corp.) and 200 g of ion-exchanged water were mixed with each other. The resulting mixture was dispersed at 25\u00b0 C. for 10 min using a homogenizer, thereby obtaining a colorant dispersion. The colorant particles contained in the thus obtained colorant dispersion had a volume median particle size of 120 nm.","Fifty grams of a paraffin wax (tradename: \u201cHNP 0190\u201d available from NIPPON SEIRO Co., Ltd.; melting point: 85\u00b0 C.), 5 g of a cationic surfactant (tradename: \u201cSUNISOLE B50\u201d available from Kao Corp.) and 200 g of ion-exchanged water were mixed and heated to 95\u00b0 C., and then a paraffin wax was dispersed in the obtained mixture using a homogenizer. The resulting dispersion was subjected to dispersing treatment using a pressure injection type homogenizer, thereby obtaining a releasing agent dispersion. The releasing agent particles contained in the thus obtained releasing agent dispersion had a volume median particle size of 550 nm.","Fifty grams of a charge controlling agent (salicylic acid-based compound; tradename: \u201cBONTRONE E-84\u201d available from Orient Chemical Industries Co., Ltd.), 5 g of a nonionic surfactant (tradename: \u201cEMULGEN 150\u201d available from Kao Corp.) and 200 g of ion-exchanged water were mixed with each other. The resulting mixture was dispersed with glass beads using a sand grinder at 25\u00b0 C. for 10 min to obtain a charge controlling agent dispersion. The charge controlling agent particles contained in the thus obtained charge controlling agent dispersion had a volume median particle size of 500 nm.","A round stainless steel flask was charged with 500 g of the core resin dispersion which was formulated with combination of resins as shown in Table 8, 20 g of the colorant dispersion, 5 g of the releasing agent dispersion, 4 g of the charge controlling agent dispersion and 1.5 g of a cationic surfactant (tradename: \u201cSUNISOLE B50\u201d available from Kao Corp.). The contents of the flask were mixed and dispersed using a homogenizer, and then heated to 48\u00b0 C. in a heating oil bath while stirring, and further held at 48\u00b0 C. for about 1 h until a volume median particle size of the particles aggregated reached 5.1 \u03bcm, thereby forming aggregated particles. Thereafter, 150 g (Examples 1 to 7 and 9 to 17 and Comparative Examples 1 to 4) or 300 g (Example 8) of the shell resin dispersion as shown in Table 8 were added to the resulting reaction mixture, and the obtained dispersion was dispersed while stirring, thereby obtaining aggregated particles in the form of capsulated core-shell particles.","After adding 3 g of an anionic surfactant (tradename: \u201cPlex SS-L\u201d available from Kao Corp.) to the dispersion of the aggregated particles in the form of core-shell aggregated particles, a reflux tube was mounted to the stainless steel flask, and the dispersion was heated to 75\u00b0 C. at a temperature rise rate of 0.1\u00b0 C.\/min while continuously stirring and held at 75\u00b0 C. for 2 h to coalesce and fuse the aggregated particles. Thereafter, the resulting dispersion was cooled and then filtered to separate the fused particles therefrom. The thus separated particles were sufficiently washed with ion-exchanged water and then dried, thereby obtaining colored resin fine particles. All of the thus obtained colored resin fine particles had a volume median particle size (D) of 5.0 \u03bcm.","Next, 100 parts by mass of the colored resin fine particles were mixed and externally added with 0.5 part by mass of an external additive (hydrophobic silica; tradename: \u201cAEROSIL R-972\u201d available from Nippon Aerosil Co., Ltd.; number-average particle size: 16 nm) using a Henschel mixer (available from Nippon Coke & Engineering Co., Ltd.) at 3600 r\/min (peripheral speed: 31.7 m\/s) for 5 min, thereby obtaining a toner composed of toner particles (volume median particle size DO: 5.0 \u03bcm).","[Evaluation]","<Low-Temperature Fusing Property>","The toner was loaded to a copying machine (tradename: \u201cAR-505\u201d available from Sharp Corp.) to print a toner image on an image fixing paper for evaluation of the toner. More specifically, a solid image printed on the paper was taken out before allowing the paper to pass through a fuser to thereby obtain an unfused image (printed area: 2 cm\u00d712 cm; amount of the toner deposited: 0.5 mg\/cm). The paper with the thus obtained unfused image was loaded again to a copying machine (tradename: \u201cAR-505\u201d available from Sharp Corp.) and then subjected to printing of a solid image two more times such that each solid image printed was taken out before allowing the paper to pass through the fuser, thereby obtaining a layered unfused image (three layers) having a layer thickness of 1.5 mg\/cm.","With the fuser of the copying machine being held in an off-line condition, the three-layered unfused image was fused and fixed on the paper at a rate of 300 mm\/s while increasing the fusing temperature from 90\u00b0 C. to 240\u00b0 C. at intervals of 5\u00b0 C. Meanwhile, an image fixing standard paper (tradename: \u201cCopy Bond SF-70NA\u201d available from Sharp Corp.; 75 g\/m) was used as the image fixing paper for evaluation of the toner.","The thus fused image obtained by passing the paper through the fuser was rubbed with a sand eraser having a bottom surface area of 15 mm\u00d77.5 mm by reciprocating the eraser over the fused image 5 times while applying a load of 500 g thereto. Then, optical reflection density values of the fused image before and after the rubbing were measured using a reflection-type densitometer (tradename: \u201cRD-915\u201d available from Gretag Macbeth GmbH). From the thus measured values, a minimum fusing temperature of the toner was determined as the temperature of a fusing roll at which a ratio between the optical reflection density values of the fused image before and after the rubbing (optical density after rubbing\/optical density before rubbing) first exceeded 80%. The lower the minimum fusing temperature, the more excellent the low-temperature fusing property of the toner became. The results are shown in Table 8.","(Heat-Resistant Storage Property)","Ten grams of the toner were charged into a 50 mL polymeric cup and stored under environmental conditions of 55\u00b0 C. and 60% RH for 24 h. Thereafter, three sieves including a sieve A (mesh size: 250 \u03bcm), a sieve B (mesh size: 150 \u03bcm) and a sieve C (mesh size: 75 \u03bcm) were disposed on a powder tester (available from Hosokawa Micron Corp.) in an overlapped manner in the order of the sieve A, the sieve B and the sieve C from above, and 10 g of the toner were placed on the sieve A and vibrated for 60 s. The larger value (\u03b1) calculated according to the following formula indicates a more excellent fluidity and a more excellent heat-resistant storage property of the toner.\n\n\u03b1=100\u2212(0.60.2)\/10\u00d7100\n","The term \u201cWA\u201d as used herein means the weight of the toner placed on the sieve A, the term \u201cWB\u201d as used herein means the weight of the toner placed on the sieve B, and the term \u201cWC\u201d as used herein means the weight of the toner placed on the sieve C.","(Durability)","The toner was loaded to a development device (tradename: \u201cPAGEPRESTO N-4\u201d available from Casio Computer Co., Ltd.; fusing: contact fusing method; development: non-magnetic one component development method; developing roll diameter: 2.3 cm), and a slanted stripe pattern having a print coverage of 5.5% was continuously printed on sheets of paper at a temperature of 32\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 85%. The \u201ca print coverage\u201d as used herein means the area of the printing portion on the basis of the total area of the paper. In the course of continuously printing the stripe pattern, a black solid image was printed on the paper every 500 sheets to confirm whether or not any white streaks (or lines) occurred on the printed image. The printing was interrupted at the time at which the white streaks occurred on the image, although it was continued until reaching 9000 sheets in maximum unless any defects occurred. The number of sheets of paper printed up to the time at which the white streaks were first observed on the image by naked eyes was regarded as the number of sheets of paper printed which was capable of withstanding occurrence of white streaks owing to the toner fused and fixed on a developing roll, and was used to evaluate a durability of the toner. The larger the number of sheets of paper printed, the more excellent the durability of the toner became.
