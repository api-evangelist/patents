{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","EXAMPLE 1","EXAMPLE 2"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under Contract No. DE-AC52-06NA25396 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to a process to make particles, in particular a process to make structured particles.","The development and production of nanoparticles has been the focus of research efforts for at least the last ten years with the properties of nanoparticles often exhibiting behavior that bridges the gap between bulk materials and atomic or molecular structures. For example, nanoparticles can exhibit properties that are dependent on the size of particles and properties such as melting temperatures, thermal and\/or electrical conductivity, physical hardness and the like can be vastly different when compared to bulk materials having the same chemical composition.","Methods used to produce metal nanoparticles include mechanical attrition, sputtering, pyrolysis of organometallic compounds, microwave plasma decomposition of organometallic compounds and the like. Plasma decomposition of dry precursor powders has proven to be an effective method for producing nanoparticles since dry precursor powders can simplify material handling concerns, a relatively tight range of particle size can be obtained and acceptable production rates are available. However, previous methods to produce core-shell structured nanoparticles have been limited to methods that suffer from large particle size distribution and low production rates. As such, a process for making structured particles, and in some instances structured nanoparticles, that does not suffer from prior art disadvantages would be desirable.","Disclosed is a process for making a composite material that contains structured particles. The process includes providing a first precursor that includes a first material and a plasma torch, the plasma torch operable to generate a plasma region. The first precursor, which can be in the form of a dry precursor powder, a precursor liquid, a precursor vapor of a liquid and\/or a precursor gas is passed through a high field zone of a plasma generated by the plasma torch with at least part of the first precursor undergoing decomposition. If the first precursor includes a dry precursor powder, a precursor liquid and\/or a precursor vapor of a liquid, it can be suspended in a first gas to produce a first aerosol before passing through the high field zone of the plasma. If the first precursor includes a precursor gas, then the precursor gas may or may not be mixed with a first gas before passing through the high field zone of the plasma.","A second aerosol having a second precursor in the form of a dry precursor powder can be suspended in a second aerosol gas and introduced after or downstream of the plasma generating zone. This arrangement ensures that the second aerosol does not travel through the high electric and\/or magnetic field region (RF, microwave, DC, etc.) that generates the plasma. However, the second aerosol can be injected into an \u2018afterglow\u2019 region of the plasma. In some instances, the dry precursor powder of the second precursor contains particles to be at least partially coated by the first precursor after it has decomposed, and sometimes by atoms from the first aerosol gas and\/or a plasma gas as well. In addition, the first precursor material can include a shell material and the second precursor can include a core material and the structured particles can be structured nanoparticles.","The present invention includes a process for making a composite material that contains structured particles. The structured particles can be used as an electroactive material, a catalyst material, a hydrogen storage material and the like. As such, the present invention has utility as a process for making a material.","The process includes providing a first precursor in the form of a dry precursor powder, a precursor liquid, a precursor vapor of a liquid and\/or a precursor gas that includes a first material. It is appreciated that the first material can be a precursor for a shell or coating material for the structured particles. The dry precursor powder and\/or precursor liquid can be suspended in a first gas to produce a first aerosol containing the first precursor. If the first precursor includes a precursor vapor of a liquid and\/or a precursor gas, then the precursor vapor and\/or precursor gas may or may not be mixed with the first gas prior to entering the plasma torch. For the purposes of the present invention, an aerosol is defined as a gaseous suspension of fine solid particles and\/or liquid drops.","The process also includes providing a plasma having a high field (electric and\/or magnetic) zone that generates a plasma from gas or liquid inflows. The high field zone is a region of high electromagnetic energy that can be generated using radio frequency, microwave energy or direct current discharge. The first precursor can be passed through the high field zone of the plasma, with decomposition of at least part of the first material occurring. If the first precursor includes dry precursor powder and\/or liquid, the decomposition can include vaporization of the first material. However, if the first precursor includes the precursor vapor of a liquid and\/or the precursor gas, then the decomposition can include the decomposition of molecules of the precursor vapor and\/or precursor gas into smaller molecules and\/or atoms.","Downstream from the high field zone a second aerosol having a second precursor suspended in a second aerosol gas is introduced. This arrangement insures that the second aerosol does not travel through the high electric and\/or magnetic field region (RF, microwave, DC, etc.) that generates the plasma. However, the second aerosol can be injected into an \u2018afterglow\u2019 region of the plasma, a region of the plasma torch immediately adjacent to the high field zone, i.e. there is no other region between the high field zone and the afterglow region. The afterglow region, although absent a field high enough to generate a plasma from a gas or liquid, can have an elevated temperature (>100\u00b0 C.) and can contain, in addition to gas, high energy charged species, chemical radicals, liquids and solids. It is appreciated that the afterglow region can in fact be best classified as a plasma region by virtue of containing free electrons and ions, as well as chemical radical species. These plasma species (e.g. high energy charged species) primarily enter the afterglow region from the high field region via flow or diffusion, however, some radicals, ions and electrons can still be generated in the afterglow region from the high energy charged species.","The second precursor can be in the form of a dry precursor powder that includes a second material. In some instances, the second material includes particles to be at least partially coated by the first material from the first precursor after it has been decomposed, and sometimes by atoms from the first aerosol gas and\/or plasma gas as well. In this manner, the second material in the form of particles that have been prepared previously with desired structure, shape, size and\/or properties can be at least partially coated by a variety of materials to make novel structured particles. For the purposes of the present invention, the term \u201cstructured particles\u201d is defined as particles that have a desired manufactured shape, size, mixture of materials, size and\/or configuration of mixture of materials.","For example and for illustrative purposes only, a core-shell particle having an inner core encapsulated by an outer shell is an example of a structured particle, as is a core-shell particle having one or more additional outer shells\/coatings. In the alternative, a particle having a first material core with a second material attached to the core at discrete locations on the surface of the core\u2014such that a desired first material\/second material physical configuration is obtained\u2014is an example of a structured particle.","As noted above, the structured particles can have an inner core of the second material enclosed within an outer shell of the first material or a core of the second material partially coated with the first material. In addition, a structured particle produced using the process disclosed herein can be used as a precursor in a subsequent particle making process. For example, a core-shell particle produced as disclosed herein can be used as a second precursor with an additional one or more layers of coating applied thereto. The additional one or more layers can consist of the original second material, a mixture of the original second material with a new third material, a new third material, fourth material, combinations thereof and the like.","It is appreciated that the same is true for structured particles that are not core-shell particles, i.e. a variety of structured particles can be \u201cdesigned\u201d and manufactured by depositing a precursor material that has passed through the high field zone of the plasma onto a different precursor material\u2014which may or may not already be a structured particle\u2014that has been entered into the plasma downstream of the high field zone. Such structured particles can be catalytic particles where the first and\/or second material is a support for the second and\/or first material, respectively, which is a catalyst. As such, the process disclosed herein can provide particles with a generally limitless array of material and physical configuration choices so long as the first precursor passes through the high field zone and the second precursor bypasses the high field zone in order to produce the structured particles.","The particles can be micron-sized particles, submicron-sized particles and\/or nanometer sized particles. For the purposes of the present invention, micron-sized particles are particles having a mean diameter of between one and one thousand microns, submicron-sized particles are particles having a mean diameter of between two hundred and one thousand nanometers, and nanometer sized particles, also known as nanoparticles, having a mean diameter of between one and two hundred nanometers.","In some instances, new particles can be created in the high field zone by the reorganization of atoms from the first precursor, and sometimes atoms from the first gas and\/or plasma gas as well. Thereafter, the first gas can carry any new particles out of the high field zone and into a plasma afterglow region. The afterglow region is a volume of space downstream from the high field zone. This region, although absent a field high enough to generate a plasma from a gas or liquid, can have an elevated temperature (>100\u00b0 C.), and the state of matter still classified as a plasma (i.e. contains free electrons and ions). It must be noted that in the absence of a high field, all species rapidly cool in the afterglow region. In addition, the rapid cooling leads to the transformation of the plasma to a non-plasma, that is a mixture of gas, liquid and\/or solid, and can impact the new particle structure. Upon exiting the afterglow region, the particles are received into a zone having near ambient temperature where the highly transformed particles created in the high field zone and afterglow region from the atomic constituents of the first precursor, and in some gases the plasma carrier gas and\/or the first gas, can be removed from the system, typically with a filter.","In other instances, new particles can be created downstream of the high field zone by material from the second precursor being coated by material from the first precursor. For example, the material from the second precursor can optionally include particles that are desired to be at least partially coated by the first material, with the second precursor particles at least partially coated by the deposition of atoms from the decomposed first precursor.","The plasma can be a non-oxidizing plasma and in some instances is a low power atmospheric or near-atmospheric pressure plasma with the plasma generated by focusing microwave energy within a coupler. The first gas and the second gas can be an inert gas, illustratively including helium, argon and combinations thereof. In addition, the first gas can be an active gas, i.e. a gas that contains at least part of the first precursor, for example Ar+ethylene and the like.","The process can further include passing a plasma gas in addition to the first gas through the high field zone of the plasma, the plasma gas also being an inert gas. In some instances, the second material is a lithium alloying material, i.e. a material that can alloy with lithium, and can contain an element such as tin, silicon, aluminum, titanium, germanium, combinations thereof and the like. In other instances, the second material is a lithium compound. The first material can contain an element selected from carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, combinations thereof and the like, illustratively including carbon, carbides, nitrides, oxides, etc. It is appreciated that the process also affords for the forming of structured particles that have a multilayered core and\/or a multilayered coating with the core and\/or coating being made from first precursor and\/or second precursor material.","At least one embodiment of the present invention provides a process for producing structured particles that have an outer mean diameter of less than one thousand microns. In some instances, the structured particles with an outer mean diameter less than one thousand nanometers can be produced, while in other instances structured particles with an outer mean diameter of less than 500 nanometers can be produced. In still other instances, structured particles with an outer mean diameter less than 200 nanometers can be produced, while in still yet other instances particles with an outer mean diameter less than 100 nanometers can be produced. In even still other instances, structured particles with an outer mean diameter less than 50 nanometers are produced. The average wall thickness of an outer shell for core-shell structured nanoparticles can be less than 1 micron, can be less than 500 nanometers, can be less than 100 nanometers, can be less than 50 nanometers, and in some instances can be less than 20 nanometers.","Turning now to the figures wherein like numerals correspond to like elements throughout,  illustrates an embodiment for producing a composite material containing structured particles at reference numeral . The process  includes providing a first precursor in the form of a powder, a liquid, a vapor of a liquid and\/or a gas at step  and passing the first precursor through a plasma torch at step . Upon passing the first precursor through the plasma torch at step , decomposition of at least part of a first material included as part of the first precursor occurs. In some instances, the first precursor can include a plurality of materials, e.g. the first material plus one or more additional materials. In addition, a second precursor containing a second material in the form of a dry precursor powder can be provided at step . Vapor containing material from the first precursor that has been decomposed is then allowed to deposit onto the second material from the second precursor to form structured particles at step .","Turning now to , a schematic representation of an apparatus for producing structured particles using a dry precursor powder is shown generally at reference numeral . As shown in this figure, a first gas  passes through an inlet tube  into a first precursor container  that contains a first precursor . The first precursor  can contain one or more materials, for example, a dry precursor powder. The first precursor  can also contain elements that are not incorporated within the structured particles that are produced, but may be present to assist in the overall process in some manner.","Flow of the first gas  into the first precursor container  at a sufficient flow rate can result in the suspension of the first precursor  to produce a first aerosol, with the first precursor passing or flowing through the exit tube  with at least part of the exit tube  passing into a quartz plasma torch . In some instances, the exit tube  has a ceramic portion  that terminates generally in the middle of a waveguide . The waveguide  is used to couple microwave energy to the plasma torch . Also included can be a plasma gas  which passes within the plasma torch , but exterior to the ceramic portion  of the exit tube  which has the first aerosol passing therethrough.","Upon focusing microwave energy with the waveguide  onto the plasma torch , a plasma can be generated with a high field zone  located within the plasma torch . As the first aerosol passes through the high field zone  of the plasma torch , the temperature of the high field zone  is such that decomposition of at least part of the first precursor  occurs. The decomposed first precursor  exits the high field zone  of the plasma torch  and enters into a chimney region . Upon exiting the high field zone , the atoms of the decomposed first precursor  can condense into solid form.","A second gas  can be provided and pass through an inlet tube  into a second precursor container  that contains a second precursor . Flow of the second gas  into the second precursor container  at a sufficient flow rate results in the suspension of the second precursor  within the second gas  to produce a second aerosol. The second precursor  can contain one or more materials in the form of particles. Similar to the first precursor , the second precursor  can also contain elements that are not incorporated within the core and\/or shell of any structure nanoparticles that are produced, but may be present to assist in the overall process in some manner.","After the second aerosol has been produced, it can pass or flow through an exit tube  and enter the apparatus  downstream from the high field zone  at location . In some instances, the second aerosol enters the apparatus  in an afterglow region . After entering the apparatus  at location , the second precursor can be coated when atoms of the decomposed first precursor condense into solid form thereon and thereby form structured particles. The structured particles can be collected from a particle filter , from the interior sidewalls of the chimney region  and\/or from a particle trap (not shown).","A schematic illustration of an apparatus for producing structured particles using a precursor liquid is shown in  where like numerals refer to like components discussed above. In this embodiment, the first gas  can pass or bubble through a precursor liquid  held in a precursor liquid container  at a sufficient rate such that droplets of the liquid  are incorporated in the first gas to provide an aerosol. It is appreciated that vapor of the liquid  can also be present in the first gas  after it passes through the . In addition, the first gas  can optionally pass through a container  which can be used to prevent back diffusion of vapor from the liquid  to a source of the first gas .","After passing through the container , the first gas  with droplets and\/or vapor of the liquid  can pass through the container  and into the plasma torch . It is appreciated that the container  may or may not contain the dry precursor powder  and the first gas  with droplets and\/or vapor of the liquid  can pass or enter directly into the plasma torch  (not shown in ) without the use of the container .","Referring now to , the first precursor can be provided as an active gas  that passes into the plasma torch . In some instances, the active gas  can be mixed with the first gas , however this is not required. In addition, the active gas  can pass through the container , which in some instances may or may not be void of a precursor material, or in the alternative pass directly into the plasma torch without the use of the container .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3F","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3C","FIG. 3D","FIG. 3E","FIG. 3F","FIG. 3D"],"b":["30","210","212","214","220","222","224","226","230","232","234","232","230","236","240","242","244","246","242","244","246","246","244","236"]},"Not being bound by theory, the mechanism for the formation of the structured particles is hypothesized to result from the condensation of atoms from decomposed first precursor material to form at least part of a core and\/or coating via a nucleation process. The condensed first precursor material atoms collect on similar nuclei and at least partially coat and\/or attach to the second precursor material. In the afterglow region  the structured particles are \u201cfrozen\u201d into their final configuration, with the first material and the second material having their final configuration with respect to each other, size and the like. It is appreciated that the structured particles can be used as the second precursor material and at least partially coated again using the same process and thereby produce multilayered and\/or gradient layered structured particles.","Various precursor powder materials can be used to produce structured particles. For example, a material capable of alloying with lithium can be used as the second material and compounds containing carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur and the like can be used as the first material. In the alternative, lithium compounds can be used as the second material. In some instances, second material particles that are in the second aerosol do not melt or vaporize after entering the apparatus  and are coated by condensing atoms of the first material exiting the high field zone .","In order to provide additional teachings on the process disclosed herein, two examples are provided below.","Core-shell nanoparticles having a core of lithium-titanium oxide (LiTiO) and a shell of carbon were produced using an apparatus as illustrated in  and the process described above. In particular, a first precursor of anthracene and\/or ethylene was provided and passed through the plasma torch using a first gas of argon with a flow rate of 1.47 standard liters per minute (SLPM). In addition, a plasma gas of argon with a flow rate of 2.89 SLPM was also provided. For a second precursor, particles of LiTiOhaving a mean diameter of less than 38 microns were provided to a location between the high field zone and the afterglow region of the plasma apparatus using a second gas of argon with a flow rate of 1.83 SLPM. A microwave energy source of 900 watts and an overall pressure of +10 torr were used to generate the plasma within the plasma torch, and in some instances, one or both of the beakers containing the anthracene and\/or ethylene and the LiTiOwere subjected to ultrasonic vibration during the plasma process.","As discussed above, it is postulated that the anthracene and\/or ethylene was at least partially decomposed and allowed to condense on the particles of the LiTiO. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of a LiTiO\/carbon core-shell nanoparticle is shown in  and a high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) image illustrating that the carbon shell is continuous about the LiTiOcore is shown in .","A plurality of tin-oxide (SnO)\/carbon core-shell nanoparticles were produced using an apparatus as illustrated in . In particular, a first precursor of anthracene was provided to the high field zone of the plasma using a first gas of argon with a flow rate of 1.47 SLPM. In addition, a plasma gas of argon was provided using a flow rate of 2.89 SLPM. A second precursor of SnOwas provided at the bottom edge of the afterglow\/top of the high field zone region using a second gas of argon with a flow rate of 1.83 SLPM. A microwave energy source of 900 watts and an overall pressure of +10 torr were used to generate the plasma within the plasma torch, and in some instances, one or both of the beakers with the anthracene and the SnOwere subjected to ultrasonic vibration during the plasma process. A TEM image of SnO\/carbon core-shell nanoparticles is shown in  and a HR-TEM image illustrating the outer carbon shell on the inner SnOcore is shown in .","The present invention is not bound by or to specific flow stream rates, compositions or configurations. In addition, even though the above examples disclose a method having a dual gas flow system with each gas flow having a different overall composition and only joining and mixing at the plasma high field zone, other gases, gas flow rates and\/or plasma systems are included within the scope of the present invention. For example and for illustrative purposes only, a process using a direct current (DC) discharge plasma having a one flow gas system wherein a first gas and a plasma gas are one in the same is within the scope of the disclosed inventive method. This method would result in all of the gas that flows through the plasma and the first precursor being well-mixed before reaching the high field zone, as opposed to the two gas flow system wherein the first gas and the plasma gas mix with each other in the center of the high field zone as described in the examples above. In addition, an intermittent plasma provided by a pulsed power source and having an intermittent high field zone is included within the scope of the present invention. As such, the term high field zone includes intermittent high field zones and\/or plasma generation zones.","The foregoing drawings, discussion and description are illustrative of specific embodiments of the present invention, but they are not meant to be limitations upon the practice thereof.
