It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended. Alterations and further modifications of the inventive features illustrated herein, and additional applications of the principles of the inventions as illustrated herein, which would occur to one skilled in the relevant art and having possession of this disclosure, are to be considered within the scope of the invention.","Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words \u2018comprise\u2019, \u2018comprising\u2019, and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of \u201cincluding, but not limited to\u201d.","Disclosed is a motorized roller shade system that automatically adjusts the position of the shade to minimize UV penetration into a room and prevent glare on items, such as television screens, by specifying the maximum distance into a room from a window that direct sunlight may penetrate.","Referring to , in one embodiment, the shade system, which is designed to be mounted in a window frame  and cover window , includes a roller shade , a roller shade motor , and a sun angle sensor (generally ). The roller shade  includes a roller tube , flexible shade material , and a hembar . The motor  is in wired communication with, and controlled by, a motor controller  (). The sensor  is in wired or wireless communication with the motor controller . In one embodiment, the sensor  is an integrated solar angle sensor E910.86 from Elmos, Inc. The sensor  is capable of determining the angle of light incidence in both xz- and yz-planes, with the z axis being perpendicular to the surface of the sensor , the x axis being parallel to the surface sensor and parallel to the surface of a window sill , and the y axis being parallel to the surface sensor and perpendicular to the surface of the window sill . In one embodiment, the sensor is disposed on a surface of the window . In another embodiment, the sensor is disposed on the window sill .","The motor controller  controls\/drives the motor  and includes a microcontroller\/microprocessor , a controller interface , a memory , and a motor driver circuit , which is in communication with the motor . The controller interface  is in wired or wireless communication with a master controller , which is capable of controlling one or more motor controllers . During installation of the roller shade system, the height (h) of the top of the window above the floor and the height (s) of the window sill are stored in the memory . In the case of a window that extends to the floor (i.e., no window sill), height s=0.","In various embodiments, the sensor , which is in wired or wireless communication with the microcontroller , includes at least one photovoltaic cell , a microcontroller\/microprocessor , and a wired or wireless communication interface . The sensor  is removeably coupled to the window  or disposed on a window sill  in order to have an unobstructed view of the sun. If the sensor  is in wired communication with the microcontroller , the sensor  receives power through\/from the motorized roller shade. If the sensor  is in wireless communication with the microcontroller , the sensor  is battery powered and\/or solar powered.","The sensor  determines the angle of the sun based on sunlight incident thereon, and reports\/transmits the sun angle to the microcontroller . The microcontroller  also retrieves height (h) and height (s) from memory . In response to receiving the sun angle and retrieving height (h) and height (s), the microcontroller  instructs the motor  (via the motor driver circuit ) to move the roller shade  up or down to allow sunlight to enter a predetermined (user defined) distance (a) into a room. Because the sensor  detects actual light conditions, there is no need to specify the location (i.e., latitude and longitude) of the building or whether there are any obstructions between the window and the sun. Furthermore, the sensor  also determines the intensity of the sun and thus eliminates the need for additional sensors to detect clouds and\/or shadows.","The disclosed roller shade system prevents furnishings, artwork, or other materials from being damaged by the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. For example, if a user knows that all the items in a particular room that could be damaged by Ultraviolet rays are a minimum of five feet away from the windows, the disclosed roller shade system can be easily configured to allow direct sunlight to penetrate no more than five feet into the room.","Referring to , in one embodiment, in operation with a floor to ceiling window , assume a user wants to position a shade  so that sunlight penetrates into a room a maximum distance (a) of five feet. Next assume that the distance (h) from the top of a window  employing the disclosed roller shade system to the floor is ten feet (i.e., shade length). Further assume that the sensor  determines that the angle (theta) of incidence of the sun rays  is 50 degrees, in the yz-plane relative to the z-axis. The distance b is the distance from the floor that the shade  needs to be raised to allow sunlight to penetrate into the room a maximum of five feet","The distance b is determined using the equation: Tan (theta)=b\/a. For the current example, b=Tan(50)*5=5.958\u22486 feet, or 60 percent of the total shade length (i.e., 10 feet). In other words, the shade  must be 60 percent open to allow the incident light rays  to penetrate a distance of 5 feet into the room.","Referring to , in another embodiment, in operation with a standard sized window , assume a user wants to position a shade  so that sunlight penetrates into a room a maximum distance (a) of five feet. Next assume that the distance (h) from the top of a window  employing the disclosed roller shade system to the floor is ten feet and that the height (s) of the window sill is two feet. Further assume that the sensor  determines that the angle (theta) of incidence of the sun rays  is 50 degrees, in the yz-plane relative to the z-axis. In this example, the relative position (RP) that the shade  needs to be raised to allow sunlight to penetrate into the room a maximum of five feet is determined by the equation RP=(b\/(h\u2212s))*100.","The distance b is determined using the equation: Tan (theta)=b\/a. For the current example, b=Tan(50)*5=5.958\u22486 feet. Using the above described equation, RP=(6\/(10\u22122))*100=75% open. In other words, the shade  must be 75 percent open to allow the incident light rays  to penetrate a distance of 5 feet into the room.","As mentioned above, the sensor  is capable of determining the angle of light incidence in both xz- and yz-planes, with the z axis being perpendicular to the surface of the sensor , the x axis being parallel to the surface sensor and parallel to the surface of the window sill , and the y axis being parallel to the surface sensor and perpendicular to the surface of the window sill . Consequently, the sensor can be used with drapery tracks, vertical blinds, venetian blinds, or any other type of motorized window treatment. In the case of the sensor  being used with drapes or vertical blinds, a user can set a maximum horizontal width that direct sunlight covers, rather than the maximum distance that direct sunlight may penetrate.","In another embodiment, the sensor additionally includes a memory configured for storing the height (h), the height (s), and the maximum distance sunlight is allowed to penetrate into the room. After the sensor determines the angle of the sun, the microcontroller\/microprocessor performs the calculations described above to determine the percentage open (e.g., 0=closed, 100=fully open, 50=50% open) the shade needs to be to limit the sunlight penetration into the room to the predetermined maximum distance. The sensor then transmits the percentage open to the shade motor, which moves the flexible shade material to the appropriate position.","Variations, modifications, and other implementations of what is described herein may occur to those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be defined exclusively by the preceding illustrative description."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying figures further illustrate the present invention.
