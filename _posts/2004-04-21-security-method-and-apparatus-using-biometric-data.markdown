title: Security method and apparatus using biometric data
abstract: A security method and apparatus is provided in which a trusted authority is arranged to read in identity data from a memory device presented by an individual. This identity data comprises both biometric data of a specific individual ,and additional identity data concerning the same individual. The trusted authority uses the biometric data as a biometric reference for comparison with biometric characteristics of the individual presenting the memory card in order to determine whether the latter is the individual represented by the biometric data. The trusted authority uses the additional identity data or matching data, together with private data of the trusted authority, to generate a decryption key. This decryption key is apt to decrypt data encrypted using both an encryption key string comprising the additional identity data of the specific individual and public data of the trusted authority.

No. 10\/110279 filed Jul. 12, 2002 and Ser. No. 10\/829,931 filed Apr. 21, 2004.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to security methods and apparatuses using biometric data; in particular, the present invention relates to such methods and apparatuses that utilise identifier-based encryption\/decryption and analogous techniques.","As used herein, the term \u201cbiometric data\u201d means any digital data, however measured or recorded, that represents characteristics of a biological individual intended to be unique to that individual. Thus, both digital image data of a human face and digital fingerprint data are examples of biometric data.","2. Background of the Invention","The use of biometric data for authenticating individuals is well known. It is also known to use biometric authentication techniques in relation to memory-based identity cards\u2014for example, such a card can carry fingerprint data concerning the card owner, this data being used to check whether a person presenting the card is the card owner by comparing the data from the card with that generated by a local fingerprint reader. Of course, the biometric data on such a card has to be trustable; more particularly, the card should have the properties of trustworthiness and unforgeability. Trustworthiness means that any information stored in the card must be issued by a trusted authority (that is, an authority trusted by the party relying on the authenticity of the stored biometric data). Unforgeability means that any information stored in the card cannot be modified by an unauthorized entity without being detected (a typical, but not the only, example of a suitable form of card would be one using a write-once memory chip).","As well as biometric data, memory-based identity cards usually include other, non-biometric, identity data such as a unique serial number allocated by the card issuer and personal profile data that may include date birth, home address, nationality, etc. For cards with the properties of trustworthiness and unforgeability, this additional data is effectively intimately linked with the biometric data in the sense that neither the biometric or non-biometric data can be changed by an unauthorised entity without being detected and neither changes often, if at all.","It is an object of the present invention to provide improved security methods based on identity data, such methods being usable in relation to memory-based cards such as identity or entitlement cards.","The present invention is in part based on the appreciation that Identifier-Based Encryption (IBE) has certain properties than can be adapted for use in memory-card based security systems and other applications.","Identifier-Based Encryption (IBE) is an emerging cryptographic schema. In this schema (see  of the accompanying drawings), a data provider  encrypts payload data  using both an encryption key string , and public data  provided by a trusted authority . This public data  is derived by the trusted authority  using private data  and a one-way function . The data provider  then provides the encrypted payload data <> to a recipient  who decrypts it, or has it decrypted, using a decryption key computed by the trusted authority  based on the encryption key string and its own private data.","A feature of identifier-based encryption is that because the decryption key is generated from the encryption key string, its generation can be postponed until needed for decryption.","Another feature of identifier-based encryption is that the encryption key string is cryptographically unconstrained and can be any kind of string, that is, any ordered series of bits whether derived from a character string, a serialized image bit map, a digitized sound signal, or any other data source. The string may be made up of more than one component and may be formed by data already subject to upstream processing. In order to avoid cryptographic attacks based on judicious selection of a key string to reveal information about the encryption process, as part of the encryption process the encryption key string is passed through a one-way function (typically some sort of hash function) thereby making it impossible to choose a cryptographhically-prejudicial encryption key string. In applications where defence against such attacks is not important, it would be possible to omit this processing of the string.","Frequently, the encryption key string serves to \u201cidentify\u201d the intended message recipient and this has given rise to the use of the label \u201cidentifier-based\u201d or \u201cidentity-based\u201d generally for cryptographic methods of the type under discussion. However, depending on the application to which such a cryptographic method is put, the string may serve a different purpose to that of identifying the intended recipient and, indeed, may be an arbitrary string having no other purpose than to form the basis of the cryptographic processes. Accordingly, the use of the term \u201cidentifier-based\u201d or \u201cIBE\u201d herein in relation to cryptographic methods and systems is to be understood simply as implying that the methods and systems are based on the use of a cryptographically unconstrained string whether or not the string serves to identify the intended recipient. Generally, in the present specification, the term \u201cencryption key string\u201d or \u201cEKS\u201d is used rather than \u201cidentity string\u201d or \u201cidentifier string\u201d.","A number of IBE algorithms are known and  indicates, for three such algorithms, the following features, namely:\n\n","The three prior art IBE algorithms to which  relates are:\n\n","A more detailed description of the QR method is given below with reference to the entities depicted in  and using the same notation as given for this method in . In the QR method, the trust authority's public data  comprises a value N that is a product of two random prime numbers p and q, where the values of p and q are the private data  of the trust authority . The values of p and q should ideally be in the range of and and should both satisfy the equation: p, q\u22613mod 4. However, p and q must not have the same value. Also provided is a hash function # which when applied to a string returns a value in the range 0 to N\u22121.","Each bit of the user's payload data  is then encrypted as follows:\n\n","The encrypted values s and s for each bit m\u2032 of the user's data are then made available to the intended recipient , for example via e-mail or by being placed in a electronic public area; the identity of the trust authority  and the encryption key string  will generally also be made available in the same way.","The encryption key string  is passed to the trust authority  by any suitable means; for example, the recipient  may pass it to the trust authority or some other route is used\u2014indeed, the trust authority may have initially provided the encryption key string. The trust authority  determines the associated private key B by solving the equation:\n\nB\u2261KmodN\u2003\u2003(\u201cpositive\u201d solution)\n","If a value of B does not exist, then there is a value of B that is satisfied by the equation:\n\nmod\u2003\u2003(\u201cnegative\u201d solution)\n","As N is a product of two prime numbers p, q it would be extremely difficult for any one to calculate the decryption key B with only knowledge of the encryption key string and N.","However, as the trust authority  has knowledge of p and q (i.e. two prime numbers) it is relatively straightforward for the trust authority.  to calculate B.","Any change to the encryption key string  will result in a decryption key  that will not decrypt the payload data  correctly. Therefore, the intended recipient  cannot alter the encryption key string before supplying it to the trust authority .","The trust authority  sends the decryption key to the data recipient  along with an indication of whether this is the \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d solution for B.","If the \u201cpositive\u201d solution for the decryption key has been provided, the recipient  can now recover each bit m\u2032 of the payload data  using:\n\n\u2032=jacobi(+2)\n","If the \u201cnegative\u201d solution for the decryption key B has been provided, the recipient  recovers each bit m\u2032 using:\n\n\u2032=jacobi(+2)\n","According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a security method, carried out by a trusted authority, comprising\n\n","The present invention also envisages apparatus and a computer program product for implementing the foregoing security method of the invention.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there provided a data access control method comprising:\n\n","The present invention also envisages a system for implementing the foregoing data access control method of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A and 2B","b":["20","40","40","30","20","30","40","20","30","40","30","40","20","30"],"sub":["ENC ","DEC ","ENC ","DEC "]},"The system employs Identifier-Based Encryption with the entities ,  and  having, in respect of IBE encryption\/decryption processes, the roles of the data provider , data recipient  and trusted authority  of the  IBE arrangement. The IBE algorithm used is, for example, the QR algorithm described above with respect to  with the private data of the trusted authority being random prime numbers p,q and the corresponding public data being number N.","The system is arranged to operate on the basis of identity data of individuals. More particularly, individuals are provided with memory cards for holding their identity data,  showing one such card  belonging to an individual . The memory card  preferably has the aforesaid properties of trustworthiness and unforgeability and may be implemented, for example, as a memory chip  incorporated into a base card medium.","The identity data stored on the memory card comprises both biometric data  and non-biometric data . The biometric data  is represented in  by a face icon but can be any type of biometric data and is not limited to a facial image; possible types of biometric data include image data, fingerprint data, retina scan data etc. Similarly, the non-biometric data is represented in  by a Universal Identity UID (such as a reference number unique to the individual) but may be any other suitable non-biometric identity data. The biometric and non-biometric identity data stored on a card  is specific to the individual to whom the card has been issued (the card \u201cowner\u201d regardless who may currently have possession of the card).","Considering first the operation of the encryptor entity , the non-biometric data  of an individual (the specific individual  in ) is provided in digital form to the encryptor entity  by being read from the card  owned by the individual  using a card reader .","The non-biometric data  is used by the entity  to form the encryption key string K, the non-biometric data  either being used directly as the key or after processing (see dashed operation oval ) such as by concatenation with other data The encryption key string Kis then used to encrypt data D to form encrypted data E(K,N;D) where E() indicates that the elements appearing before the semi-colon inside the brackets are used to IBE encrypt the element appearing after the semi-colon. The encrypted data is then either stored to a storage medium (which could be the card  itself) for eventual transfer to the decryptor entity , or sent over a communications link directly or indirectly to the decryptor entity .","When an individual A (see ) who may or may not be the same as the individual , wishes to access the encrypted data E(K,N;D) this individual presents themselves to the trusted authority entity  together with a memory card from which the trusted authority reads off the biometric and non-biometric identity data , . The presented memory card may or may not be the same one as presented to the encryptor entity  so that the non-biometric data received by the trusted authority may or may not be that used in the encryption key string K.","Consider first the situation (illustrated in ) in which the memory card  presented to the trusted authority  is the same as that presented to the encryptor entity . The trusted authority entity first uses the biometric data  as a biometric reference for comparison with biometric characteristics of the individual A to determine whether the latter is the individual  who owns the card  (see operation oval ). As is well known to persons skilled in the art, this comparison and determination may be carried out automatically by comparing features represented in the reference biometric data  with features in measurement data produced by measurement of the subject individual A using suitable sensors (not illustrated). However, particularly where the biometric data comprises facial image data, a human operator can be presented with the biometric reference data (for example, as an image of a face where the biometric data is facial image data) and judge whether the present individual A is the same as that represented by the biometric data.","If no match is found between the individual A and that represented by the biometric data , the trusted authority  refuses to proceed with the generation of the decryption key Kneeded to access the encrypted data. However, if a match is found in operation , the trusted authority proceeds. Where the non-biometric data  does not constitute the encryption key string Kin its entirety, the next operation is to re-form the encryption key string (see dashed operation oval )\u2014this may involve the concatenation of the non-biometric identity data  with other data known to both the entities  and . For example, this other data may simply be an item of non-confidential data or it may be a shared secret; this other data may vary between encryption operations of the entity .","Once the encryption key string has been obtained, the trusted authority uses it, along with its private data p,q, to generate the decryption key K(see operation oval ).","The decryption key Kis then transferred to the data decryptor entity  to which the encrypted data E(K,N;D) is also supplied. The transfer of the decryption key to the entity  from the entity  may be effected over a communications link or via a data storage device; as already indicated, in certain embodiments, the decryption entity  is actually part of the trusted authority so no transfer is required. The decryption key Kis thereafter used to decrypt the encrypted data to recover the data D in clear (operation ). Where the decryption is effected by the trusted party entity , the recovered data D is typically then provided to the individual A (now known to be the individual ) either by displaying it or by the transfer of an electronic or paper copy to the individual; however, the trusted authority may decide not to disclose the data D.","It will be appreciated that the trusted authority can carry out the key generation operation  in parallel with, or even before, having determined that the individual A is the individual \u2014what is important is that the entity  does not provide the decryption key (or where it also effects the decryption operation , the recovered data D) to the individual A until the latter is determined to be the individual .","The foregoing description of the operation of the trusted authority entity  was for the situation of the memory card presented to the entity  was the same as the one presented to the encryptor entity  so that the trusted authority received the same non-biometric data  as was used in the encryption key string K. If the memory card presented to the entity is different from that presented to the encryptor entity  (for example, it is the card owned by individual A who is different to the individual ), then even though the trusted authority may generate a decryption key, this key will not serve to decrypt the encrypted data E(K,N;D). This is because whilst the biometric data read from the presented card may validate the presenter, the associated non-biometric data that is used to generate the decryption key is not that used by the encryptor entity in the encryption key string K.","The system of  can be used to support a variety of applications. For example, the card  of the individual  can be used to securely store all the many passwords that the individual uses. In this case, the card's memory  comprises both a write-once first portion holding the biometric and non-biometric data , , and a re-writable second portion. The individual  presents their memory card  to the encryptor entity  and inputs his\/her passwords as the data D. The entity  reads the non-biometric data  from the card , forms the encryption key string K, encrypts the passwords and writes the encrypted data to the rewritable portion of the memory card . The individual  now has their passwords safely stored in their memory card . The entity  can be provided by a computer or other device under the control of the individual or can be provided by the trusted authority.","Should the individual  forget any of their passwords, he\/she goes to the trusted authority and presents their memory card . The biometric and non-biometric data ,  are read off this card by the trusted authority entity and the biometric data is used in operation  to check that the individual presenting the memory card  is the owner of the card. Assuming that the check  is passed, the decryptions key Kis generated and used by the trusted authority entity to decrypt the password data D held on the card; this password data is then displayed or otherwise output to the individual .","The individual can choose any party as a trusted authority provided the latter can be tested to keep the private data (p,q) confidential and not to retain copies of the decrypted passwords. Another possible trusted authority would be a trusted computing platform having functionality such as specified, for example, in \u201cTCPA\u2014Trusted Computing Platform Alliance Main Specification v1.1, 2001 and described in the book \u201ctrusted computing platforms\u2014tcpa technology in context\u201d; Pearson (editor); Prentice Hall; ISBN 0-13-009220-7\u201d.","In another application of the  system, an individual wishing to store sensitive data D (such as their medical records) from a data provider presents his\/her memory card to the data provider. The data provider first reads off the biometric data  to confirm that this data corresponds to the individual present. Assuming this is the case, the data provider uses the non-biometric data  from the memory card to form an encryption key string which it then uses to encrypt the data D. The encrypted data-is then stored on the card . If at any time in the future, access is required to the sensitive data, the trusted authority reads off the biometric and non-biometric data from the memory card  and confirms that the card belongs to the individual concerned before generating the decryption key (and possibly decrypting the encrypted data D). In this application, one would normally require some consensual act by the card owner (such as presentation of the card to the trusted authority); however, in an emergency situation the trusted authority maybe allowed to access the data D\u2014as might be needed where the individual has had a road traffic accident and the attending medical staff need urgently to access the medical record data D recorded on the card (in this case, the trusted authority would be the emergency services).","Many variants are possible to the above-described embodiment. For example, the non-biometric data provided to the encryptor entity  need not necessarily be read off directly the memory card  and could be provided from a common source or indirectly from the card (for example, by being read out aloud over the telephone where the non-biometric data is a reference number printed on the card as well as stored in memory).","The non-biometric data  can be provided by the encryptor entity along with the encrypted data and then stripped off and provided to the trusted authority. However, in this, case, the non-biometric data received in this way must be matched with that stored on the memory card presented to the trusted authority in order to ensure that there is a link between the biometric data  read from the card and used in operation  and the non-biometric data  used in the operation . In this case, the non-biometric data used for key generation can be considered to be the non-biometric data read from the memory card . It may be noted that where the encryption key string Kincludes data additional to the non-biometric data , there may be some benefit in providing the encryption key string along with the encrypted data and then providing this key to the trusted authority since in this case the encryption key string does not have to be reformed in operation .","The further data included n the encryption key string Kmay, for example, be conditions placed by the data provider on the release of the data D, these conditions being checked by the trusted authority before generation of the decryption key and\/or release of the decryption key\/the decrypted data.","It will be appreciated that instead of the QR IBE method, the above-described embodiments can be implemented using any other suitable IBE algorithm, such as those mentioned above that use of Weil or Tate pairings, or are RSA based; analogous cryptographic algorithms can also be used.","The storage device used to hold the identity data  and  need not be a memory card and can be any other suitable form of memory device, preferably with the aforesaid properties of trustworthiness and unforgeability.","Although not preferred, rather than using non-biometric identity data  in forming the encryption key string K, a further item of biometric data (additional to the data  used for authentication in operation ) could, instead, be used in forming the encryption key string K.","Whilst in the foregoing example the identity data has concerned human individuals, the biometric data can alternatively be that of another type of biological organism such as a dog or horse.","Furthermore, although in the described examples the individuals have presented themselves to the trusted authority, the trusted authority or a party associated with it may be more pro-active and approach or otherwise select an individual (for example, a customs officer may select a traveller at an airport and ask to see their identity card which is a memory card with identity data).","The trusted authority may be distributed in nature having, for example, a remote station at which an individual presents themselves for biometric measurement and for their memory card to be read, and a central station where biometric data is compared and decryption key generation is carried out.","It is possible to require the involvement of multiple trust-authority entities effectively forming a compound trust authority. This may be desirable where a single authority is not trusted to be entirely reliable. One way of achieving this would be for the data encryptor to recursively encrypt the data D, with each iteration being done using the same encryption key string but the public data of a different trusted authority\u2014the individual must then go to several trust authorities in turn to successively roll back each encryption iteration. An alternative approach is for the data provider to encrypt the data D using a public base key associated with each of the trusted authorities, decryption of the encrypted item only being possible by obtaining a decryption sub-key from the trusted delegate entity acting for each trusted authority in turn. This can be expressed as:\n\nEncryption: ciphertext=(_all, data)\n\nDecryption: data =(_all, ciphertext)\n\nwhere K_all is encryption key related to all trusted authorities, K\u2032_all is the corresponding decryption; key K\u2032_all is retrieved from all decryption sub-keys. Further information about how multiple trusted authorities can be used is given in:\n\n"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of non-limiting example, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
