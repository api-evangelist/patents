{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATED IN COMPUTER CODE"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/702,889, filed Jul. 26, 2005, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.","Method and computer readable medium for transforming information and information converters and especially methods for defining information transformations using structured and non-structured information translation specifications.","Specification based transformation allows business analysts, information analysts or system analysts to create an executable specification of the transformation needed for EAI (Enterprise Application Integration). The specification needs to be simple enough for analysts to use, while still being rigorous enough to allow execution","The current state of the art is that analysts create non-structured information transformation specifications using various software tools such as but not limited to Microsoft\u2122 Word\u2122 and Microsoft Excel\u2122.","These non-structured information transformation specifications are then passed to programmers which develop code that performs the information transformation that is defined in the non-structured information specification.","The code can be developed by using a unique mapping tool provided by their EAI server vendor (e.g. IBM\u2122 or Webmethods\u2122), or by programming the code. In many cases the programmers use a mixture of mapping tools and programming.","This dual stage process usually results in inconsistencies. Typically changes to the implementation code are not reflected back to the specification s and eventually the code does not accurately represent the initial non-structured specification.","There is a need to perform information transformation while maintaining a correlations between the transformation code and the non-structured information transformation specification. Especially, there is a need to allow both programmer and analyst to use the tools they are used to without introducing inconsistencies between the information transformation code and the non-structured information transformation specification.","An information converter that includes: an input for receiving non-structured information transformation specification and a processor. The processor is adapted to (i) convert the non-structured information transformation specification to a structured information transformation specification; (ii) generate information transformation code responsive to the structured information transformation specification; and (iii) associate a code alteration indication to the non-structured information transformation specification, in response to an alteration of the information transformation code.","A computer readable medium that stored code that when executed by a processor causes the computer to: (i) convert the non-structured information transformation specification to a structured information transformation specification; (ii) generate information transformation code responsive to the structured information transformation specification, and (iii) associate a code alteration indication in response to an alteration of the information transformation code.","A method for converting information, the method includes: converting a non-structured information transformation specification to a structured information transformation specification; generating information transformation code responsive to the structured information transformation specification; and associating a code alteration indication to the non-structured information transformation specification in response to an alteration of the information transformation code.","The invention allows to convert non-structured information transformation specifications to information transformation code and vice verse, while tracking information transformation specifications alterations and tracking information transformation code alterations.","The non-structured information transformation specification can have various formats. It is typically a spreadsheet format. It can also include semi-structured format. For example, it can be generated using a table GUI, excel software, or another tool. The information transformation code can have various formats such as but not limited to ContentMaster, XSLT, Java, C and the like.","The invention provides methods, information converters and computer readable medium. According to an embodiment of the invention they can be adapted to ease the creation of the non-structured information transformation specification. For example, the method can include a stage of providing indications of recommended non-structured information transformation specification rules. Conveniently, the method can include a stage of generating non-structured information transformation specification shortcuts.","Yet for another example, the method can help with the selection of source and\\or target through various UI metaphors such as name auto-completion based on the source or target schemas, facilitate viewing and selecting of the source and\\or target as a graphical structure, allow to drag and between the source and target graphical structures or between the source\\target and the mapping specification. The method can also ensure that simple mistakes in mapping are eliminated, for example they can ensure that the source contains only legal elements from the source structure and that the target contains only legal elements from the structure","According to one embodiment of the invention the non-structured information transformation specifications includes a map which describes how a value (constant, computed or structure) is inserted into a location in the target structure. An element in a structure is described by its xpath in the source or target structure. For example, an xpath can be defined as a single column in the spreadsheet that defines its location in the spreadsheet, or may be divided into multiple columns which when concatenated by a defined rule may describe the location in the structure. It may also be described as the source xpath in a word document or PDF. A specification can also use a syntax natural to the specification to access information (e.g. reference to a cell in a spreadsheet, reference to a figure in a document).","Conveniently, the structure of a map includes the following components: source, default value, target location, condition, translation\/lookup, grouping mechanism, dynamic lookup table and cardinality.","The source is described by an element in the source structure or a value (either static or computed). The default value can be used as the value to be placed in the target structure if the source element is null. The target location is described by an element in the source structure. A condition can include a precondition and a post-condition. A precondition is evaluated on original value, a post-condition is evaluated on the value after translation.","The translation\\lookup is an expression that modifies the value (either through computation, or static lookup in another spreadsheet). The grouping mechanism allows mappings to be aggregate together in a group. The dynamic lookup table is based on source mechanism. It allows lookup tables to be created from value in the specifications (e.g. an appendix in a document, another spreadsheet).","The cardinality enables mapping a complex element to another complex element, where the cardinality of the target element is different from the cardinality of the source element. The change in cardinality is indicated by this column. If the cardinality column is empty, the default is \u201cFirst\u201d. Conveniently, the possible values of a cardinality column include: each, first, last, Nth, any, By_Key, and By_Function.","If the cardinality value is \u201ceach\u201d then for each source element create a target element in the information. If the cardinality value is \u201cfirst\u201d then the process creates only a target element appropriate for the first source element in the source information. If the cardinality value is \u201clast\u201d then the process creates a target element appropriate for the last source element in the source information. If the cardinality value is \u201cNth\u201d then the process creates a target element appropriate for the nth source element in the source information. If the cardinality value is \u201cany\u201d then the process selects a random source element and use it to create a target element.","If the cardinality value is \u201cBy_Key\u201d then the process maps a complex element to another complex element, by a key in the input element. The number of relevant elements in the target may be equal to the number of unique input elements. For example, everyone with the same department in a source element gets mapped into the same target element. The atomic unit should also contain a simple mapping row defining an element as a key.","If the cardinality value is \u201cBy_Function\u201d then the process Maps a complex element to another complex element, as a function of the input element. The number of relevant elements in the target may be equal to the number of unique input elements as computed by the function. For example, \u201cAverage\u201d could be a function that returns only one new source element, the one which denotes the average value. The actual function is named in the \u201ctranslation\u201d column.","According to various embodiments of the invention: (i) a source value can be modified by an expression (e.g. lookup table) before being mapped to the target, (ii) a basic map may be conditional on the value, either the original value or after modification, (ii) the ordering of the basic maps has no significance, (iii) the specification allows for the description of transactional group where a failure of any map causes all of the maps in a group to fail, (iv) the specification allows for the description of conditional groups where when a map fails the next map is executed until one mapping is successful within the group, then processing of that group is complete, (v) the specification allows for the description of iteration groups. An iteration group describes how to map a source structure with cardinality greater than one to a target structure. It allows the mapping to specify different grouping and plurality (cardinality) of source elements then that described by the source structure. If the map does not contain an iteration group for mapping a target structure with a target structure greater than one, an algorithm is used to find the legal mapping based on source and target cardinality, or a heuristic is used to find the best mapping which is validated with the user.","According to other various embodiments of the invention: (i) the target location van include one or more columns, (ii) the condition once evaluated may be true or fault, (iii) a spreadsheet or structure syntax can be used to access information, (iv) single maps or group can be named for a designation, error reporting or reuse purposes, (v) a specification may contain only a subset of a map constituent component, in which case the map may be executable with only specific information instances or must be augmented by a programmer, (vi) a simple specification should include source and target columns.","Conveniently, a non-structured information transformation specification that is provided as a spreadsheet typically also includes: (i) metadata sheet describing the source XSD, target XSD, authors etc.; (ii) which cleansing and enrichment algorithms are applicable to the input; (iii) parsing sheet source description sheet; (iv) mapping sheet, and (v) reverse mapping sheet. Additional spreadsheets can include a serializing sheet, a sequencing sheet, an \u201cinput examples\u201d sheet and a result sheet for testing the specified transformation, and the like.","According to the various embodiments of the invention there may be provided a set of tools that ease the creation of the mapping. These tools help with the selection of source and\\or target through various UI metaphors such as name auto-completion based on the source or target schemas, allowing viewing and selection of the source and\\or target as a graphical structure, allowing drag and between the source and target graphical structures or between the source\\target and the mapping specification in order to create a new map, or modify an existing map. The tools can also ensure that simple mistakes in mapping are eliminated, for example they can ensure that the source contains only legal elements from the source structure and that the target contains only legal elements from the structure.","According to an embodiment of the invention the structured information transformation specification has an XML format of a derivative of the XML formal, such as mXML, or other formats such as CAM by Oasis. Conveniently, the structured information transformation specification is also referred to as scheme.","The information transformation code can be generated in various manners known in the art, as well as according to various embodiments of the invention.  illustrates an exemplary method while  illustrates examples of a structured information transformation specification.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["8","10","70"]},"Conveniently, the WORKSPACE element  is a root element and can have the following child elements: SCHEMAS, FUNCTIONS, RESTRICTIONS, RELATIONSHIPS, LOOKUPS, OVERRIDES and MAPPERS.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["8","10","20","30","40","50","60","70"]},"TABLE 1 describes the attributes of the WORKSPACE  element:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"WORKSPACE Attributes"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Attribute","Type","Use","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["name","NCName","required","Descriptive name of the"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"workspace.

If, for example the alteration is valid and can be transferred to the spreadsheet format (these conditions can be checked by box  than represents the ContentMaster engine that performs code verification, compilations and the like) and the sequence continues to box  (denoted \u201creverse translation (ContentMaster to mXML)\u201d) of performing a reverse translation from the information transformation code to a structured information transformation specification. Box  is followed by box  of converting the XML specification to a spreadsheet type specification. This conversion provides an altered non-structured information transformation specification that represents the information transformation code alteration. The alterations can be marked in various manners.","If, for example the alteration is not-valid and\/or can not be transferred to the spreadsheet format then the sequence follows to generating an error indication, translating the error to a structured information transformation specification error format (box ) and providing error indications to the user of the spreadsheet .","Conveniently, stage  includes stage  of performing a information transformation code to structured information transformation specification conversion to generate the code alteration indication. Referring to , this is represented by stages -.","Conveniently, stage  includes stage  of performing a structured information transformation specification to a non-structured information transformation specification code conversion to generate the code alteration indication.","Conveniently, stage  includes stage  of determining if the alteration of the information transformation code can be converted to a non-structured information specification conversion format. Referring to , this is represented by box .","Conveniently, the code alteration indication affects the non-structured information transformation specification.","Conveniently, the non-structured information transformation specification is a spreadsheet format information transformation specification.","Conveniently, method  includes stage  of storing versions of the information transformation code.

Conveniently, The constructs in mXML schema are linked back to the spreadsheet rows that generated them. The mXML schema is transformed to code by a compiler such as a MapperBuilder. The code constructs are linked back to the mXML which generated them.","It is assumed that an analyst alters the spreadsheet and a programmer alters the code then. When the programmer changes the code the new resulting code is compared to the previous code. Changes are translated back into mXML and can show up to the analyst as a modification to spreadsheet. Conveniently, the programmer can to modify the spreadsheet directly using tools such as but not limited to the ContentMaster studio development environment.","Conveniently, if the code alterations cannot be translated back to mXML schema they can be added to an override object linked to the related mXML schema. The affected mXML construct is marked so that the analyst will know that there is new semantics attached to the relevant portion of the specification.","Conveniently, if the analyst changes the spreadsheet the programmer modified parts of the executable not affected by those changes will not changed. This relationship between the analyst changes and previously altered code can be determined by comparing new versions and prior versions on both before and after versions of the mXML schemas and the ContentMaster code. If the changes become too difficult to track, the effected part of the specification can be marked for the analyst, and any changes to that portion of the specification will be marked for the requires the intervention of a programmer.","Conveniently, every object in the override set is actually a new template describing how to create a more specific mapping model (appropriate for this specific customer) from the generic mXML schema.","Conveniently, if there is a runtime (or other error) the error is linked to the appropriate construct in the ContentMaster code, which is translated to the appropriate construct in the mXML intermediate model, it can be displayed to the analyst by translating the mXML construct back to the spreadsheet construct which defined it.","The following example will further illustrates the translation from code alteration to specification alteration. It is assumed that an analyst creates the specifications of the transformations needed for two applications to interchange real-time data. Method  or at least some of its stages convert the specification to code. The analyst can be responsible to this transformation. It is further assumed that a scripter can augment the executable script created by the analyst if needed. Usually the scripter (or programmer) handles the \u201chard\u201d problems or extreme cases. The scripter needs to make sure that any changes do not conflict with the correctness as defined by the analyst.","Methods  and  try to ensure that the specification created by analyst and the script reflect each other. The Analysts needs to be able to vet the changes made to a specification's implementation by the Scripter.","It is further assumed that that there is a \u201cScript Generator\u201d (or some equivalent stages of either one of methods  or ) that can take a specification and create an equivalent script. There also exists a \u201cSpecification Generator\u201d (or some equivalent stages of either one of methods  or ) that can take a script and in most case generate a specification. If the \u201cspecification generator\u201d cannot create an equivalent spec\u2014then there is a mechanism (such as via a remark) that can be used to notify the analyst of the information missing from the formal part of the specification. If the script created is relevant to a specific part of the specification created by the analyst\u2014that part of the spec is made \u201cread only\u201d so that the analyst understands that changing that part of the spec requires the intervention of a scripter. The goal is to keep such \u201cdead specs\u201d to a minimum.","For a mapping specification created in Excel it is assumed that for the most part there is no meaning to the order of the rows unless specifically required by the analyst.","The first example assumes that the analyst modified the specification (for example Excel specification) and that the script was correct before this modification.","The alteration is followed by a stage of using the script generator to create SCRIPTfrom the specification (referred to as SPEC). SCRIPTalso includes the appropriate back references from the SPEC that caused the script objects to be generated.","The next stage includes using the specification generator on SCRIPTto create SPEC. SPECincludes the appropriate back references to SCRIPTobjects that generated the SPECobjects.","Then, the specification generator generates SPECfrom SCRIPT with the appropriate back references to the SCRIPT objects which generated the SPECobjects.","The following stage includes useing the script generator to generate SCRIPTfrom SPEC(again with the appropriate back references to the objects which generated the SPECobjects). It is noted that SCRIPTis used for as a control, comparison and filtering.","The next stage includes finding the most closely related rows in SPECand SPEC. This stage is followed by linking SCRIPTobjects to their related SCRIPT objects\u2014this is based on the simple linkages of the basic relationships between simple script objects and heuristics that take into account how the script is used to group objects. This gives the basis to understand the changes in specification and how they should effect the script.","Accordingly- there are 3 main entities that used to synchronize the changes: (i) SCRIPT\u2014the source for user changes, (ii) SCRIPT\u2014the basis for filtering and finding changes that need to propagated, and (iii) SCRIPT\u2014the target for the changes. The changes are merged into SCRIPT in order to provide the new modified script.","It is noted that if SCRIPTobject property equals SCRIPTobject property then there is no change to SCRIPT. If SCRIPTobject property equals SCRIPTobject property then the SCRIPT should be updated with the change. If SCRIPTobject property doesn't exist as an SCRIPTobject property in then the SCRIPT should be updated with the new script object.
