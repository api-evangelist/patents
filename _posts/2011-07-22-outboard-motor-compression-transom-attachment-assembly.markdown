title: Outboard motor compression transom attachment assembly
abstract: An attachment assembly quickly and securely mounts an outboard motor on a boat transom. Side frame members are disposed in a laterally spaced-apart relationship by two interconnected lateral frame members. A laterally extending cam member is rotatably connected to the side frame members and laterally extends the length between the side frame members. A cam rotating mechanism is connected to the cam member to selectively impart its rotational displacement and a lateral inverted-U-shaped transom channel is formed in the side frame members and is disposed adjacent to the cam member. The rotational displacement of the cam member effects an outward displacement of an outer surface of the cam member into the inverted-U-shaped transom channel to compressively engage and secure a transom by the cam member across the entire width of the motor.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","This invention relates to an assembly for mounting an outboard motor on the transom of a boat. More particularly, the invention is for an attachment assembly for quickly and securely attaching an outboard motor on an inflatable or standard boat transom by a single operator without requiring additional personnel to vertically position and lower the motor during its attachment procedure.","Currently, smaller commercial outboard motors are attached to the transom of a boat by tightening two large threaded rods located on the swivel bracket of the outboard motor. These rods are screwed in to serve as clamps that engage the transom. In order for this interconnection to occur, the motor must first be held in a vertical position directly above the boat transom, and then the motor is lowered onto the transom. Depending on the size of the motor, this procedure requires at least two or three very physically capable assistants. Next, the threaded rods are rotated or screwed inwardly to tighten the end plates located on the ends of the rods against the boat transom. However, since these end plates usually are not designed to be tightened and loosened repeatedly, they often separate or otherwise fail and, consequently, the motor cannot be securely attached to the transom.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for an attachment assembly for quickly and securely attaching an outboard motor on a boat transom.","The present invention provides an attachment assembly for mounting an outboard motor on a boat transom. Side frame members are disposed in a laterally spaced-apart relationship and at least one lateral frame member is each connected to both of the side frame members to create the dimensions of the laterally spaced-apart relationship. A laterally extending cam member extends between the side frame members and is rotatably connected at opposite ends to the side frame members. An aligned bore is formed in each of the laterally spaced-apart side frame members. Cylindrically-shaped protrusions located on opposite ends of the laterally extending cam member are aligned with each other and are sized to each fit within a separate aligned bore of the side frame members for rotation, and a cam rotating mechanism is connected to the cam member to selectively impart rotational displacement of the protrusions in the aligned bores. A lateral inverted-U-shaped transom channel is formed in and between the side frame members and is disposed adjacent to the cam member. The cam member is integrally connected to receive the selectively imparted rotational displacement of the protrusions by the cam rotating mechanism to effect rotation of the cam member. This rotation of the cam member effects an extension of a laterally extending outer surface of the cam member into the inverted-U-shaped transom channel to compressively engage a transom by the cam member.","An object of the invention is to provide an attachment assembly to securely attach an outboard motor onto a boat transom.","An object of the invention is to provide an attachment assembly that quickly and securely attaches an outboard motor onto a boat transom by a single operator.","Another object of the invention is to provide an attachment assembly having a single laterally extending cam member to mount and secure an outboard motor on a boat transom.","Another object of the invention is to provide an attachment assembly having a single rotatable laterally extending cam member to laterally compressively engage a boat transom and secure an outboard motor thereon.","Another object of the invention is to provide an attachment assembly having a single rotatable cam disposed to extend laterally across the front of an outboard motor for quickly and reliably engaging a boat transom.","Another object of the invention is to provide an apparatus having a single rotatable cam extending laterally across the front of an outboard motor and being actuated by a single operator to quickly and reliably engage a boat transom.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Referring to , an outboard motor attachment assembly  of the invention allows a single operator to securely attach an outboard motor onto a transom of a small conventional or inflatable boat. Attachment assembly  is specifically designed as herein described to also assure a greater degree of reliability as compared to conventional screw-type mounting mechanisms found on most outboard motors.","Referring also to , attachment assembly  has a pair of spaced-apart side frame members  and  that are shaped to define a laterally-extending inverted-U-shaped channel  sized to receive transom  of a small conventional or inflatable boat. This inverted-U-shaped channel should be visualized to be formed in the side frame members  and , and laterally extend across the space between the side frame members. Side frame members  and  are secured to and held in a laterally spaced-apart relationship by two lateral frame members  and . The use of two lateral frame members is shown as the preferred embodiment; however, a single lateral frame member or more than two may be used in alternate embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention. The side and lateral frame members and other parts of attachment assembly  to be described are preferably made from suitably dimensioned rugged metal stock such as steel, stainless steel, etc. and are welded, bolted, and\/or otherwise suitably secured together. However, the materials selected and manner of assembly are not limitations of the invention.","Side frame members  and  of attachment assembly  each have a separate bore  and , respectively. Bores  and  are laterally aligned with each other and are sized to each respectively receive a slightly smaller cylindrically-shaped protrusion  and  located on opposite ends  and  of a laterally extending cylindrically-shaped cam member  adjacent to transom channel . Cylindrically-shaped protrusions  and  are axially aligned with each other and can be machined from the stock on opposite ends  and  of cam member . Optionally, machinists can provide cam member  with a bore (not shown) extending its length that contains an elongate shaft (not shown) that projects the axially aligned protrusions  and  outwardly at opposite ends  and  of cam member . In addition, cam member  could have other cross-sectional shapes other than the disclosed round shape. For example, elliptical, tear-drop or a wide variety of other shapes might be used.","The protrusions  and  are slightly smaller than bores  and , and are thus free to rotate in bores  and . The protrusions  and  are not coaxially located with respect to the central axis of cam member . Instead, they are located radially outwardly toward the circumference of cam member . Thus, rotational displacement of cam member  about the axis defined by protrusions  and  imparts a selective outward or inward rotational motion, or displacement of the level of outer surface  of cam member  in and out of transom channel . This displacement of outer surface  of cam member  in transom channel  can be selectively imparted by an operator rotating cam member  by a cam rotating mechanism . The cam rotating mechanism  can be, for example, a metal rod  inserted into a bore  in cam member .","Referring also to , attachment assembly  has a lateral shaft  that extends through a pair of aligned bores  and  in side frame members  and . Lateral shaft  extends through a tilt tube  extending across the front of outboard motor  between a pair of apertured fittings  and  of a swivel bracket  of outboard motor . Lateral shaft  has threaded portions  and  on opposite ends where it reaches through bores  and  of side frame members  and . Correspondingly threaded nuts  and  are tightened onto threaded portions  and  to securely connect lateral shaft  on side frame members  and . This interconnection assures the secure connection and holding of outboard motor  on attachment assembly  and onto transom  via attachment assembly . With outboard motor  thusly mounted on attachment assembly , lateral shaft  allows outboard motor  to rotate about it and rotate the propeller assembly (not shown) of motor  into and out of the water as needed.","Referring once again to , to receive a transom  in laterally extending inverted U-shaped transom channel , an operator merely rotates cam member  out of transom channel  via rod  of cam rotating mechanism  that has been inserted in transverse bore . Attachment assembly  is brought adjacent boat transom  and transom  is guided into transom channel  in the direction shown by the arrow. When transom  is fully taken into transom channel  and it rests against surfaces A and A of side frame members  and  as shown in , the operator forcefully rotates cam member  with rod  until outer surface  of cam member  forcefully bears against the side of transom . This forceful, compressive engagement of transom  along the entire length of outer surface  of cam member  extends laterally across the entire width of outboard motor  to positively secure transom  to outboard motor  via attachment assembly . A retaining latch, anchored length of line or cable or some other suitable securing device  can be suitably mounted on transom  or on either of side frame members  and  to engage and secure rod  in place after it has been rotated to create the compressive engagement of transom  (see ).","Rotating and securing cam member  against transom  can be accomplished by other means than described above regarding rod  of cam rotational mechanism . A ratcheting gear and socket arrangement much like that used in a well known ratcheting socket wrench can engage a mating recess or appropriately shaped nut structure on protrusions  and\/or  of cam member . Tightening by this arrangement can be performed by repeatedly displacing the pivot bar back and forth to rotate cam member  and displace outer surface  of cam member  in a compressive engagement of transom . Release of transom  is done by merely moving a small lever of the ratchet mechanism to relieve the compressive force that had been earlier created. Other mechanisms including Allen-wrench or open-ended wrenches for selectively creating enough compressive force by cam member  and securing it in place will readily suggest themselves to one skilled in the art to which this invention pertains. Irrespective of what mechanism is selected, the positive compressive engagement of transom  by cam member  can be so strong as to possibly damage the material of transom , which is often made of wood on typical small boats. Referring to , a protective metal bearing-plate structure  may be mounted on transom  to protect the transom and avoid this possibility.","When attachment assembly  of the invention is rotatably mounted to swivel bracket  of an outboard motor  as described above, a single operator can attach an outboard motor to the transom  of a conventional or inflatable boat. The engine can be placed in the bottom of the boat with the lower portion including the propeller assembly lying near the stern. The lower part of the engine can be lifted up on the top of the transom with the propeller shaft extending outboard so that the rest of the engine can be pushed along over the transom in the outboard direction. The attachment assembly  is slid in the outboard direction until it is placed adjacent transom . Since attachment assembly  is rotatably mounted onto outboard motor  via lateral shaft  extending through swivel bracket , it is simply pushed or slid over transom  until transom channel  of attachment assembly  is placed adjacent transom . At this point, attachment assembly  starts to receive transom  in channel  by rotating sufficiently about its lateral shaft  to fit side frame members  and  bordering U-shaped channel  down and about transom  as it continues to fall onto transom . When the top of transom  abuts surfaces A and A of side frame members  and , see , an operator need only forcefully rotate rod  (as shown by arrow ) to compressively engage transom  by cam member . Then, the operator secures rod  in place by appropriate actuation of suitable securing device .","One skilled in the art to which this invention pertains can modify the teachings of attachment assembly  within the purview of ordinary skill. Having these teachings, one can modify and reorient the side and lateral frame members to locate the cam member to vertically extend and compressively engage the transom to secure the motor on the transom. In this case the cam rotation mechanism would also be differently oriented to be horizontally rotated to effect this engagement. In addition this modified arrangement might be further modified to effect positive, extended compressive engagement of the transom by using two of the vertically extending cam members as herein described in place of the thumb screws of the conventional prior art thumb-screw designs described above.","It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
