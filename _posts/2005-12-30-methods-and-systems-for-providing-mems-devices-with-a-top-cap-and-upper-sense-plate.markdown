No. 10\/689,801, filed Oct. 21, 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,005,732, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The invention described herein was made in the performance of work under U.S. Government Contract No. DAAE30-01-9-0100. The Government may have rights to portions of this invention.","This invention relates generally to micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) devices and processes, and more specifically to processes for providing MEMS devices which incorporate top caps or covers with upper sense plates.","One method of producing micro-electromechanical structures (MEMS) is by bonding a patterned silicon wafer to a glass (usually pyrex) substrate. Portions of the silicon wafer are etched away, leaving a mechanical silicon structure anchored to the glass substrate. The process is initiated with a glass wafer. A cavity is formed in the wafer using a wet or dry etching process. A depth of the etch determines a separation between the structure's capacitive elements. Metal layers are deposited and patterned on the glass, forming conductive electrodes and interconnects. A heavily boron doped (p++) epitaxial layer is grown on a separate, lightly doped silicon substrate. A pattern is etched into the silicon wafer to a depth greater than the thickness of the epitaxial layer. The glass and silicon wafers are bonded together using anodic bonding. Using an etchant that etches lightly doped silicon but not p++ silicon, the undoped portion of the silicon substrate is etched away, leaving the freestanding microstructures. Such a process is generally referred to herein as a silicon-glass MEMS process.","In most known MEMS devices, the microstructure is exposed to the ambient environment during operation. At least some of the known problems associated with exposed microstructures are described below. Furthermore, if it is desired to provide a special operating environment, or simply protect the microstructure from the ambient environment, the protection must be done at a packaging step.","One known packaging step is to bond a glass wafer containing recesses, sometimes referred to as an upper wafer or top cap, on top of the previously fabricated glass\/silicon wafer, which is then sometimes referred to as a device wafer. At least part of the silicon structure on the device is a continuous support ring that completely surrounds, but may or may not be connected to, the microstructure. The second glass wafer is bonded to the seal ring, forming the cavity. In addition, it is desirable to have electrical leads extending from outside the cavities into the cavities. While such methods and devices have been contemplated, they have not yet been successfully integrated into a manufacturing environment.","In one aspect, a method for constructing a micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) device having a top cap and an upper sense plate is provided. The method comprises producing a device wafer including an etched substrate, etched silicon device components, and interconnect metal, a portion of the interconnect metal being bond pads, and adding a metal wraparound layer to a back side, edges, and a portion of a front side of the device wafer. The method further comprises producing an upper wafer including an etched substrate and interconnect metal, bonding the device wafer and the upper wafer, and dicing the bonded upper wafer and device wafer into individual MEMS devices.","In another aspect, a top cap for a micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) device is provided which comprises a substrate comprising a surface and recesses formed in the surface and interconnecting metal deposited into and extending out of the recesses and onto the surface. The top cap further comprises at least one deep recess comprising a recess formed in the surface of the substrate, and configured to be above a bond pad of a device wafer onto which the top cap is to be bonded.","In still another aspect, a micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) device wafer is provided which comprises a substrate comprising a front side including a surface, a back side, edges extending between the front side and the back side, and recesses formed in the surface. The device wafer also comprises interconnecting metal deposited into and extending out of the recesses and onto the surface, a MEMS device formed from silicon and bonded to the substrate, and a wrap around metal layer deposited on the back side and the edges of the device wafer. The wrap around metal layer is also extending onto a portion of the front side of the device wafer.","In yet another aspect, a micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) device comprising a device wafer and an upper wafer is provided. The device wafer comprises a substrate comprising a front side including a device wafer surface, a back side, edges extending between the front side and the back side, and recessed trenches formed in the device wafer surface. The device wafer also comprises interconnecting metal deposited into and extending out of the recessed trenches and onto the device wafer surface and forming at least one bond pad. A MEMS structure formed from silicon and bonded to the substrate and a wrap around metal layer deposited on the back side, the edges of the device wafer, and onto a portion of the front side are also part of the device wafer. The upper wafer is, bonded to the device wafer and comprises a top cap substrate comprising an upper wafer surface and recesses formed in the upper wafer surface. The upper wafer also comprises interconnecting metal deposited into and extending out of the recesses and onto the upper wafer surface and at least one deep recess. The deep recess comprises a recess formed in the upper wafer surface which is positioned above the bond pad.","In another aspect, a method for preventing electrical shorts in a MEMS device including at least one electrical interconnection passing under a support ring is provided. The electrical interconnection is in a recessed trench and a material filling the trench onto which the support ring is mounted is also provided. The method comprises forming a protective shield near the support ring which reduces incidents of particles shorting the support ring to the electrical interconnection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","14","14","12","14","16","18","20","26","22","30","12","24","26","20","12","28","30","22","10","10","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","12","14","24","12","20","26","28","12","22","30","40","20","22","14","26","28"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["10","10","52","22","10","54","12","12","56","12","40","12","10","52","54","56"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","28","12","30","22","10","28","30","60","28","30","60","28","30","60","28","30","60","14","28","30","28","30"]},"Another problem with exposure known to affect MEMS device  is temperature changes, effects of which are illustrated in . Stress can be induced by various environmental factors. For example, if the temperature in which a MEMS device  operates changes, a differential thermal expansion between a glass portion  and a silicon portion  causes stress gradients and deformation as illustrated. Substrate  is constructed from glass portion  and proof mass , motor drive comb  and motor pickoff comb  (all shown in ) are constructed from silicon portion .","The particulate problems illustrated in  and above described are solved as illustrated in  in the cross sectional view of MEMS device . Components of MEMS device , identical to components of MEMS device  (shown in ), are identified in  and subsequent Figures using the same reference numerals used in . MEMS device  includes a top cap  which provides a top for MEMS device  and covers proof mass , motor drive comb  and motor pickoff comb . In one embodiment, top cap  is attached to substrate  via a ring  which is formed on substrate  and encompasses the components of MEMS device , and patterned into the same layer of material as proof mass , sense plate , motor drive comb  and motor pickoff comb  and their respective fingers , , , and . In addition, top cap  includes an upper sense plate , which in one embodiment, is placed within a recess  formed into top cap . In a specific embodiment, ring  provides support for and is anodically bonded to top cap  to provide a hermetically sealed area , sometimes referred to as cavity , for operation of the components of MEMS device . However, cavity  does not need to be hermetically sealed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 5"],"b":["100","102","102","110","110","102","104","100","110","52","54","56","102","106","120","24","26","14","120","24","26","106","106","120","24","26","28","30","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 6","FIG. 7","FIG. 8","FIGS. 6 and 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["100","102","106","100","100","104","100","130","131","104","100","132","100","102","106","102","106","100","132","130","104","102","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["134","130","131","104","104","134","131","104","134","130","104","130","136","130","136","138","104","136","104","130","136"]},"Another known problem with utilization of top cap  is the generation of sodium residue when bonding top cap  to ring . Current bonding methods, while very simple, produce a large quantity of sodium residue. One known solution includes rinsing the wafer on which MEMS devices  are fabricated with water during a dicing process. However, that process does not guarantee that all residue gets removed. As described above, water in cavity  is undesirable. Debris, residue, and components of MEMS device  sticking to one another are some of the problems associated with allowing water into the cavity , although water has been utilized to remove sodium during a dicing process, as described above.","Access to bond pads  has also been an issue in known MEMS devices  which incorporate top caps  and upper sense plates . For example, one known method of accessing bond pads  for connecting to external devices utilizes an ultrasonic drilling process to form holes (not shown) in top cap  prior to bonding to ring . These holes have chipped and cracked edges, and the drilling may have leaves residual stress in top cap .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["150","150","152","154"]},"An upper wafer is then processed  (processes for the device wafer and upper wafer could be performed in parallel). Processing  includes etching the surface of the upper wafer and adding interconnect metal and anti-stick metal to the etched surface. Deep recesses are added  to the upper wafer for eventual access to the bond pads on the device wafer. The upper wafer and device wafer are then aligned and bonded . Channels or \u201cstreets\u201d, which are deep recesses, are cut  into the upper wafer at locations that will align over the bond pads of the lower wafer to which external connections are to be made (further illustrated in ). The upper and device wafers are diced  into individual dies.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIGS. 1-8","FIGS. 10-17"],"b":["180","102","180","182","184","186","188","190","192","194","196","186","198","200","202","198","200","202","202"]},"In one embodiment, recess , and the portion of metal feature  therein, are covered with a glass material , which provides a smooth surface  at the same level as raised surfaces  and . Part of metal  provides an electrical lead  to be utilized for an external connection. It is understood that device wafer  may include multiple recessed trenches , each having metal therein, and filled with glass material  to provide multiple electrical leads , each providing a connection to a different component of device wafer .","At the same time, a structure (e.g. components of a MEMS device) is patterned in a silicon wafer (not shown). The silicon wafer is bonded to substrate . The combined glass wafer and silicon wafer are etched, resulting in most of the silicon wafer being etched away, leaving only the patterned portion of the silicon wafer, firmly attached to substrate . Referring to , the patterned portion of the silicon wafer, attached to substrate , includes MEMS device components, for example, proof masses , , motor drive combs , , motor pickoff combs , , support ring , and protective shield . Support ring  encircles a perimeter of the components on device wafer . Support ring  is part of the support to which a top cap is bonded. Protective shield  operates to prevent conductive particulates (not shown) from contacting support ring , as described above with respect to protective shield  (shown in ).","While it may be desirable, it is not necessary, to create recessed trenches  in substrate  wafer that pass underneath support ring . However, metal  in recessed trenches  carry electrical signals from components of a MEMS device to the bond pads (electrical lead ). The bond pads are outside the cavity formed by support ring . Recessed trench  and metal  allow an electrical signal to pass into or out of the cavity without contacting support ring . If metal  contacted support ring , it would short various metal lines together and affect operation of the MEMS device. Also, if a particle, for example, debris from sawing device wafer  were to get lodged in the opening of the trench, it could short metal  to support ring .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["230","180","232","230","180","230","180","230","232","230"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIGS. 12-15","FIG. 11","FIG. 12","FIG. 13","FIG. 14"],"b":["250","230","230","250","252","254","252","256","258","250","256","254","257","252","256","258","260","256","258","256","258"]},"In , top cap  is further configured with a deep recess  etched in a portion of surface . As further described below, deep recess  in substrate  is part of a process for providing access to bond pads of device wafer  (shown in ). While shown as having a single recess  and single deep recess , it is understood that an exemplary top cap  is configured with multiple recesses  and deep recesses  depending on the number of individual MEMS components and electrical connections to be made to those components. In addition it is also understood that top cap  is a portion of an upper wafer which is bonded to device wafer , and diced into individual dies, as described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":["300","230","250","250","222","222","250","186","230","302","210","198","304","210","258","202","260","302","304","254","250","230","205","302","304"]},"Anodic bonding of device wafer  to top cap  can be done by applying a high voltage between a back side  of wraparound metal layer  and a back side  of top cap . In the absence of wraparound metal layer , the voltage would be applied between device wafer  and top cap . The voltage required to make such a bond is twice the voltage needed when utilizing wraparound metal layer  and is higher than can be supplied by some commercial bonding systems without installation of a special power supply. More importantly, however, bonding processes which do not utilize wraparound metal layer  cause sodium to migrate out of device wafer  and deposit as a residue on the surface between device wafer  and top cap .","For proper operation of the subsequent MEMS devices , the residue must be removed, so a water rinse is required at some point after the bonding process. Unfortunately, it is very undesirable to get water into cavity  between the wafers, and it is not certain that the water rinse will remove all of the sodium residue. Therefore, in one embodiment, the bonding process which results in MEMS devices  is adjusted from bonding methods which do not utilize wraparound metal layer  and the sodium migration problem is alleviated as a result. Specifically, an electrical contact from back side  of device wafer , where it contacts a wafer bonder chuck and a power supply to the silicon layer on front side  of device wafer  is utilized (e.g. wrap around metal layer ). Wrap around metal layer  is deposited on back side  of device wafer , but deposited such that metal layer  wraps around edges  and a small distance onto front side  as well. In one embodiment, wrap around layer  is applied by sputtering, as long as appropriate fixtures and control of a bias voltage for substrate  is supplied. Silicon and metal on device wafer  are arranged such that the bias voltage is distributed to all parts of device wafer , which lessens the incidence of sodium migration.","Deep recess , which is typically 100 micrometers deep or more, has been formed in top cap  as described above with respect to . When top cap  is aligned and bonded to device wafer , these deep recesses  will be directly above respective bond pads (electrical leads ) of device wafer . After fabrication and bonding is complete, and referring to , access to electrical leads  is provided by sawing. Deep recess  allows top cap  to be sawed without the risk of getting the saw blade too close to device wafer . This process is sometimes referred to as cutting a \u201cwide street\u201d into top cap . Deep recesses can be made by ultrasonic drilling, as is known, but ultrasonic drilling can leave very rough edges. Other methods of providing an access area  to electrical leads  include chemical etching or laser drilling. Finally, the combination of top cap  and device wafer  are diced into individual dies, which is symbolized in  by showing that wrap around metal  stops at edges  of substrate .","In one embodiment, after top cap  and device wafer  are bonded together, there are two sawing operations. The first sawing operation includes sawing part way through top cap  to expose bond pads on device wafer . If the saw blade is lowered too much, there is a high risk that the saw blade will cut into device wafer . Deep recesses  are at a depth such that the saw blade can be easily set well above bond pads. Wider cuts that are needed for complete access to individual bond pads can be performed utilizing two parallel passes of a standard, narrow-kerf saw blade, or by a single pass of a wide-kerf blade.","The second sawing operation is to cut bonded top cap  and device wafer  into the individual dies. Preferably, any trenches below the support ring, for example, recess trench , or gaps in support ring  itself, are designed to prevent water and debris from entering cavity  during either of the sawing operations. In one embodiment, glass material  in recess  prevents water from getting past support ring  and into cavity .","The above described embodiments provide the known benefits of a top cap and an upper sense plate to a MEMS device in a format that is easily manufactured and which allows easy access to bond pads for electrically connecting to external devices. However, it is contemplated that the methods and structures described herein extend to applications other than those which involve application of top caps and upper sense plates to MEMS devices. For example, the wrap around metal layer and\/or protective shields may also be utilized on MEMS device which do not utilize a top cap to provide other manufacturing or performance benefits.","The herein described methods also involve utilization of a support ring for supporting the top cap which helps to provide a better controlled environment for operation of the MEMS device therein, resulting in a more reliable operation. Therefore, while the invention has been described in terms of various specific embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 11","FIG. 15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 16","FIG. 15"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
