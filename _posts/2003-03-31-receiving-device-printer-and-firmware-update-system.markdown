Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a firmware updating system for updating a firmware of a printer.","2. Description of the Related Art","Recently, along with digitization of TV broadcasts, various services became available to the users who watch TV. Among these services, for example, in case of home shopping, e-mail delivery or timetable guide where there is a necessity to reconfirm the services and the information they received, there are many cases where it is convenient for the users to keep at hand a list of names of the products or the e-mails they received, after checking beforehand the details of desired information on the TV screen. Therefore, a system to receive information from a receiving apparatus such as a Set Top Box (STB) and a Digital TV (DTV) so as to print the received information with the printer which is directly connected to the receiving apparatus is useful. Under this system, the STB or the DTV is connected to the printer via an I\/F such as an IEEE1394 bus or the like. The following is an explanation of a case where a receiving apparatus is an STB, but the same applies to the case of using a DTV.","The broadcast content delivered through the TV broadcast as mentioned above is described with Broadcast Markup Language (BML) so as to start the broadcasting. It is, however, possible to use other markup language, for instance, Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). Each file in the broadcast content described with these languages is objectified by a Document Object Model (DOM), a general-purpose Application Programming Interface (API), in the STB, and is transferred to an application. Consequently, the content on the website can be distributed through the TV broadcast without needing any special processing. It is therefore natural to use the markup language, as in these cases, in order to have the printer print when content for printing which is necessary for the printer to print is described in such broadcast content.","In the aforementioned system, it is necessary for a receiving apparatus or a printing apparatus to analyze the print content described in the markup languages and perform rasterizing to it so as to create picture data. There exists a system consisting of a personal computer and an ink jet printer connected to it as an example of such a system in which a host apparatus creates picture data.","Here, it is undesirable to have the receiving apparatus perform the aforementioned picture data generating processing as it causes a decline in performance of original functions of the receiving apparatus such as a display of broadcast data while printing processing is under way. Also, not all the receiving apparatuses are connected to the printing apparatus, which necessitates installing of a picture data generating processing module to the receiving apparatus that is not connected to the printing apparatus, which is a disadvantage in terms of cost.","Provided that a system in which a printing apparatus performs the picture data generating processing is introduced, the above problem can be solved.","Meanwhile, these markup languages, however, have been developed rapidly and there is a high possibility that the version-upgrades take place in the future. In this case, there comes in a necessity to update functions and processing procedures of a printing apparatus according to the extended functions of the markup languages. Also, it will be necessary to update a firmware of a printer along with the extended functions of printers.","However, an STB is by nature an apparatus to display the received broadcasting content on a TV monitor, therefore, it does not include a mechanism to update firmware of various peripheral apparatuses such as a printer. There arises a problem of needing a significant system change in the STB in order to implement the system to update firmware of various peripheral apparatuses.","The present invention has been devised in view of these circumstances and it is an object of the present invention to provide a firmware updating system, which realizes an updating of a firmware of a printer without adding any special components in the STB, together with a receiving apparatus and a printing apparatus.","In order to achieve the above object, the receiving apparatus according to the present invention is a receiving apparatus to be used in a printing system including a printing apparatus and a receiving apparatus. The receiving apparatus comprises a reception unit operable to receive externally: (i) update data for updating a firmware of the printing apparatus; and (ii) a display content which includes a description indicating that the update data is to be printed; a display unit operable to display the display content; a command obtainment unit operable to obtain a print command for the display content; and an output unit operable to output the update data as data to be printed, according to the description, when the command obtainment unit obtains the print command.","Thus, according to the receiving apparatus of the present invention, it is possible to display for guiding the user to update a firmware based on the display content, and also, the update data can be outputted to a printing apparatus in the same manner as in the case of normal print processing in accordance with the print command for the display content.","As a result, a firmware of the printer can be updated without adding, to the receiving apparatus, a new component for updating the firmware of the printing apparatus. Furthermore, the display errors occurred in the receiving apparatus can be prevented by allowing the receiving apparatus to print, but not to display, the firmware update data. The present invention is therefore of great significance.","Also, a printing apparatus according to the present invention is a printing apparatus used in a system including a receiving apparatus which receives from a server update data to update a firmware of the printing apparatus and outputs the received update data to the printing apparatus and the printing apparatus, said printing apparatus comprising: an obtainment unit operable to obtain the update data from the receiving apparatus in the case where the receiving apparatus receives a display content containing a description indicating that the update data is to be printed, and outputs to the printing apparatus the update data as data to be printed according to the print command for the display content; and an updating unit operable to update the firmware using the obtained update data.","Moreover, the server according to the present invention is a server to be used under a firmware updating system including a server that distributes a content, a receiving apparatus that receives the content from the server, and a printing apparatus that operates according to a firmware stored in a ROM, and prints a print content inputted from the receiving apparatus, the server comprising: a content generation unit operable to generate a content that includes a firmware update file, as a print content which is not to be displayed, said file being a file in which data for updating a firmware of the printing apparatus is described; and a content sending unit operable to send the generated content to the receiving apparatus.","It should be noted that the present invention can be realized not only as the server, the receiving apparatus and the printing apparatus as described above, but also as a system configured by these apparatuses or as a method which includes the above-mentioned characteristic units included in each of the apparatuses as steps, and even as a program which causes a computer to execute these steps. The characteristic broadcast content composed of the update data and the display content can surely be distributed by delivering it not only through a broadcasting network but also through a communication network like the Internet, or by storing it in a storage medium like a CD-ROM.","The following describes in detail the embodiments of the present invention with reference to the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","130","123"]},"The delivery server , a server placed in the broadcasting station for TV broadcast, generates the broadcast content which allows the firmware update data to be a print-only content and sends the created broadcast content to each household through data broadcasting, for instance. Broadly speaking, the delivery server  includes three Data Bases (a firmware DB, a display content DB and a print-only content DB) made up of a hard disk or the like as well as three processing units (a content generation unit , an input unit  and a send unit ) made up of a CPU or the like. The firmware DB stores firmware update data of various types of printers generated in advance. The print-only content DB stores print-only content generated beforehand. The content generation unit  combines the firmware, the display content and the print-only content stored in each of the DBs according to an input from an operator so as to generate a broadcast content. The input unit , equipped with an operation unit such as a keyboard, a mouse and a remote controller which are not shown in the diagram, inputs the signals gained from the operator who operates the operation unit. The send unit  broadcasts the generated broadcast content on the TV complying with a communication protocol defined by Standards after having converted it into a format for transmission use. A bus  is a parallel data transmission line that is set in the delivery server .","The STB  is a receiving terminal which includes functions such as a picture processing function, a data processing function, a user interface function and the like, for outputting the print-only content contained in the received broadcast content to the printer  without performing processing related to display and includes four units (a reception unit , a display data generation unit , a remote control reception unit  and a print output unit ), a bus  which facilitates transmission of data among them, as well as a TV (Television)  and a remote controller  which are external apparatuses.","The reception unit  receives electric waves for TV broadcast so as to extract the broadcast content and stores each file contained in the extracted broadcast content in each directory of the hard disk , which is specified in compliance with the communication protocol for data broadcasting. The display data generation unit  includes a browser which can analyze BML and execute the print command indicated in the print-only content. It should be noted that it may be a browser which can analyze the XHTML1.0 which is defined by eXtensible Markup Language (XML) instead of Broadcast Mark-up Language (BML). The XHTML1.0 is a reworked HTML4.0 acknowledged by The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) according to an XML system. Furthermore, the display data generation unit  reads out, from the hard disk , the files of the display content, according to the input received by the remote control reception unit , and generates display data in order to activate the TV . The TV  is a TV equipped only with a display function realized with CRT, PDP, LCD or the like and displays the display data generated by the display data generation unit . The remote controller  inputs what is contained in the input such as the print instruction operated by the user to the remote control reception unit  by means of infra-red radiation. Then, the remote control reception unit  receives the input from the remote controller . The hard disk  is a storage device for storing the broadcast content received from the delivery server . The print output unit  reads out the print-only content from the hard disk  according to the print output instructions sent from the browser responding to the input from the remote control reception unit , and outputs it to the printer . The bus  is a parallel data transmission line for exchanging data between each of the units in the STB .","The printer  that is a printer which is connected to the STB  via the IEEE1394 interface or the like, determines whether or not the print-only content received from the STB  is a print-only content for firmware updating use, obtains a data file necessary for updating from the hard disk  in the STB , in the case where the received print-only content is identified as a print-only content for firmware updating use, and then writes it into a ROM so as to update a firmware. The printer  includes a judgment unit , a print processing unit , a printer engine , a firmware updating unit  and a control unit .","The interface unit  is internally equipped with a buffer  and exchanges data between the printer  and the STB . The buffer  is a memory realized with a RAM and can be used with a view to reduce a speed differential between a processing speed of the printer  and a speed of inputting data from the STB  and also can be used for temporarily storing a firmware update file. The judgment unit  analyzes the data described in XHTMLP which is for printer-use, examines each file of the print-only content inputted from the STB  so as to determine whether or not the file is for firmware updating use. As a result of the determination, in the case where it is a firmware update file, the judgment unit  outputs it to the firmware updating unit , otherwise, to the print processing unit . The XHTML-P used for printers is a specification for print use which defines that the elements regarded as unnecessary for printing are deleted from the XHTML 1.0 specification and furthermore defines that a style sheet regarding printing such as a page break, a printing margin or others should be made reference. The print processing unit  analyzes the file inputted from the judgment unit , generates printing data in order to activate a printer head by rasterizing it or the like so as to output the generated printing data to the printer engine . The printer engine  prints the inputted print data. The firmware updating unit  updates a firmware by writing the firmware update data file inputted from the judgment unit  into an unused ROM of the two ROMs which compose a firmware storage unit  in the control unit . To be more concrete, the firmware updating unit  writes in a new firmware into a ROM which is not presently used for booting. Once the writing is completed, the firmware updating unit  switches the ROM where the new firmware is written with the ROM for booting use. Moreover, if the writing fails because of power failure during the writing, the original ROM for booting use remains to be used. Also, during the writing of the new firmware, the firmware updating unit  shall not respond to a print request from the STB  or shall only send back a notice telling that it is busy.","The control unit  is internally equipped with the firmware storage unit  and controls operations at each unit in the printer  in accordance with the firmware stored in the firmware storage unit . The firmware storage unit  is made up of two ROMs, including one ROM where a firmware is already written before the shipping of the printer , and the printer  operates by reading this firmware written in the ROM. The other ROM is a free space for writing an updated firmware and can prevent problems at the printer  caused by writing errors to the ROM by keeping in the booting ROM the older version of the firmware which is presently in use. The two ROMs are used in turn: one for storing a running program and the other for storing a firmware for updating use.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["130","130","201","202","203","204","205","131","135","131","135","201","202","201","202","130","203","133","134","136","137","201","204","203","132","205","130"]},"Next, an operation of the firmware updating system  constructed as above is explained.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 1","FIG. 3A","FIG. 1","FIG. 3B"],"b":["100","100","130","100","130"]},"In the case where the printer  prints the normal print-only content under the firmware updating system , (1) the delivery server  firstly sends, through data broadcasting, a broadcast content consisting of a display content and a print-only content as shown in . The STB , on the receipt of it, once stores the files included in the received broadcast content respectively to a specified directory in the hard disk , (2) reads out the display content so as to generate display data and outputs the generated display data to the TV . On the screen, a print button written \u201cPrint\u201d as in the diagram, for example, is displayed together with a guiding phrase like \u201cPlease press the print button for printing print content\u201d. (3) When a user presses the print button following the displayed guiding phrase, the file constituting the print-only content is read out from the hard disk  and (4) the read-out print-only content is sent to the printer . The printer  (5) searches a tag indicating update of firmware in the print-only content inputted from the STB . Unless the tag is identified, the printer  generates print data analyzing the print-only content and (6) outputs sequentially the generated print data to the printer engine  so as to execute printing.","To update the firmware of the printer  under the firmware updating system , the delivery server , as a start, (1) sends the broadcast content consisting of the display content for firmware updating and the print-only content, that is, files for firmware updating use. The STB , on the receipt of it, stores the files included in the broadcast content to a specified directory as in the case of normal printing, (2) generates display data based on the display content and displays the generated display data on the screen of the TV . On the screen, an updating button \u201cUpdate\u201d, for example, is displayed together with a guiding phrase like \u201cPlease press the updating button for updating the firmware.\u201d","(3) When the user presses the updating button following the displayed guiding phrase, the files constituting the print-only content is read out from the hard disk  and (4) the readout print-only content is sent to the printer . Namely, the STB  handles files in the same way regardless of what is written inside, namely, whether it is files for firmware updating use or a print-only content. The printer  searches for a tag indicating update of firmware in the print-only content. Since the tag indicating update of firmware is written at the head of the text in the file, the printer  determines the print-only content as files for firmware updating use, and (6) starts updating the firmware. Note that, in the case where the description in the content is identified as an instruction for printing, the printer  generates print data analyzing the detail of the content and outputs the generated print data to the printer engine  so as to execute printing.","Thus, since the STB  under the firmware updating system  can perform the printing of the print-only content as well as the update of the firmware of the printer , using the same processing, both of the operations can be performed without installing a new component for firmware updating in the STB .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIG. 1","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B"],"b":["110","130","130","126","122"]},"On one hand, the broadcast content for normal printing consists of a display content made up of files such as \u201cshopping.bml,\u201d \u201ca_btn.png,\u201d \u201cb_btn.png,\u201d \u201cprint_btn.png\u201d and \u201c\/50\u201d as well as a print-only content which made up of files such as \u201ctop_print.xhtmlp\u201d and \u201cimage.jpg\u201d.

If the printer  corresponds to the target model for firmware updating of the target vendor, has the specified options, and, its own firmware version is older than the version information in the tag, the judgment unit  obtains from the hard disk  a firmware update data file \u201cupdate.data\u201d (L ) specified by version-upgrade data source attribute described in the L so as to output it to the firmware updating unit . The firmware updating unit  writes this file into the ROM which is not for booting included in the firmware storage unit  and updates the firmware. In the firmware update data file \u201cupdate.data\u201d, the firmware of the latest version, for example, is described in a machine language.","Then, information which notifies the user of a completion of the update of the firmware is described in a character string that goes \u201cThe version of the firmware is updated. The present version is 5.0.1.\u201d in the area between the tag \u201c<P>\u201d and the tag \u201c<\/P>\u201d (L). The judgment unit  outputs this character string to the print processing unit , and the printer engine  prints the character string so that the printer  can inform the user of the information corresponding to the contents of the version-upgrade. Meanwhile, the judgment unit  will not perform updating if the attribute information of its own does not correspond to the conditions described in the attribute information of the tag and process the next line following the tag \u201c<\/update>\u201d. It should be noted that in the case where firmware update fails, information for notifying the user of it may be described in the area between the tag \u201c<P>\u201d and the tag \u201c<\/P>\u201d in advance so as to inform the user of the failure.","Thus, in the case of updating the firmware, the judgment unit  can determine promptly whether the processing to be carried out, indicated in the print-only content, is printing or updating of firmware by describing the tag \u201c<update>\u201d at an early stage in the analysis of the top page of the print-only content \u201ctop_update.xhtmlp\u201d, which means at the head of the text here, and can start promptly respective processing.","It should be noted that in the first embodiment, the STB  displays the display screen indicating update of firmware, waits for the update button to be pressed, and has the browser execute the print instruction indicated in the file \u201ctop_update.xhtmlp\u201d. The present invention, however, is not restricted to this and the print instruction directed to the browser \u201cbrowser.print(\u201c.top_update.xhtmlp\u201d)\u201d may be described at the head of the file \u201cupdate.bml\u201d of the display content. In this way, the browser of the STB  executes the print instruction without receiving an input for instructing printing from the user. Namely, the STB  receives the print instruction directly from the delivery server . As a result, the printer  can start promptly the updating processing of the firmware without waiting for the display processing performed by the STB  as well as the user's input to the display screen. Since the STB  can display other display content instead of inquiring the user of the update of the firmware, the firmware of the printer  can be updated in the background.","It should be noted that in the first embodiment mentioned above, the judgment unit  judges whether the processing of the print-only content is for printing or for updating firmware based on a presence of the tag \u201c<update>\u201d. The present invention, however, is not restricted to this and another method may be used, for example, the names of the files of print-only content. To be more concrete, the STB  may output files by notifying the file names of all the files outputted to the printer  so that the judgment unit  may determine to update the firmware in the case where the name of the file inputted from the STB  is the one specified beforehand, for instance, \u201cupdate.xhtmlp,\u201d and may determine to perform print processing if it is other file name. In this case, it does not matter whether the file name of the file for updating firmware use is \u201cupdate.xhtmlp\u201d or not, however, an absolute file name whose application is already defined in a markup language as well as in a communication protocol shall not be used.","In this case, the judgment unit  may once open only the file whose file name corresponds to the specified file name, search the tag \u201c<update>\u201d so as to perform the updating processing of the firmware only when the tag \u201c<update>\u201d is found, after the determination of the processing by comparing the file names in order to prevent malfunctions due to the errors in the file names.  is a flowchart showing the procedure operated by the judgment unit  for judging whether to update the firmware or not by comparing the file names. The judgment unit  compares a file name of the inputted print-only content with a file name which is specified in advance as a file name of a file for updating firmware use (S), and once opens the file in question in the case where they correspond (S).","Moreover, the judgment unit  searches for the tag \u201c<update>\u201d in the unfolded file (S) and begins updating processing of the firmware when it is found (S). If not, a normal printing processing (S) starts. In the case where the file name of the inputted print-only content does not correspond to the specified file name, the normal printing processing begins. As mentioned above, the judgment unit  opens only the files estimated as those for firmware updating use when the file names match and then searches for the tag \u201c<update>\u201d. This realizes a prompt detection of the tag \u201c<update>\u201d in the case where the file name of the inputted print-only content is correct.

The description language, however, is not necessarily limited to the BML and the HTML, or even another language may be used as long as the browser in the STB can analyze them. The same applies to a description language used for a print-only content. It is not always necessary to use HTML-P, and another language may be used.","Furthermore, the case where the firmware update data is a dynamic link file is explained above, however, the present invention is not limited to this and the firmware update data may be constructed in a format different from the former firmware update data. Namely, the STB does not output the firmware update data to the printer  while downloading it at the same time, but outputs it to the printer after having stored it once in the hard disk . Therefore, the firmware update data to be downloaded can be kept as a difference file with respect to the firmware update data of the former version. This means that the information for specifying the changes made in the firmware update data of the former version and the detail of the changes are stored as a difference file so that the STB can conflate the difference file that is just downloaded and the file of the former version that is already stored in the hard disk  so as to output a complete set of data thus gained to the printer .","Also, a difference file obtained based on the difference between the firmware of the new version and that of the older version may be included in the firmware update data. This does not mean to straightly replace the firmware of the older version with that of the new version, but to store the information for specifying the modified part within the firmware of the older version, as a difference file, in the firmware update data. In this case, it is not the STB but the printer  who conflates the difference file. The conflation method, for example, is to copy the firmware of the older version to the ROM which is not for booting use and specify the changes made within the firmware based on the information in the difference file so as to rewrite the specified part accordingly. Thus, by keeping the firmware update data formatted as a difference file, the size of the files to be downloaded becomes smaller and little time is required for the transfer.","Also, a receiving apparatus, which receives the display content and print content sent from the delivery server (or firmware update data), and provides a printer with the print content, is not restricted to an STB and may be a communication apparatus such as a personal computer, a personal digital assistant, a cell phone and the like. For example, it is conceivable to print outdoor the pictures downloaded to a cellular phone via the Internet by connecting the phone to a printer for public use which is placed at the station. Therefore, under the firmware updating system according to the present embodiment, the receiving apparatus which receives the firmware update data is not restricted to an STB, and it may be a cell phone, a personal digital assistant, or the like, each being equipped with a function to output to the printer.","Also, in the aforementioned embodiments, the printer obtains a print content (or firmware update data) via the STB or the bridge media. However, in the case where a printer is a PULL type directly connected to the Internet, as in the direct method shown in , the printer may PULL a print content (firmware update data in the present embodiment) from a web server on the Internet so as to execute update of the firmware. For example, when a request to print the print content placed at a specified Web server is issued from the STB, the printer  may download the print content (or firmware update data) from the web server and print it out (or update the firmware). There is, therefore, no need for the STB to either relay firmware update data to the printer or perform buffering.","Also, the firmware update data files in the above embodiments such as \u201cupdate.data\u201d and \u201cupdate.dll\u201d may be compressed files. It is efficient to have firmware update data as a compression file especially for transferring firmware update data from the STB to the printer through the bridge media with low cost and small storage capacity. Then, these files may be kept as files in a self-unpacking format.","Furthermore, a link of the difference DLL file is not restricted to be operated by the STB and it may be the printer which performs the linking operation. Namely, the printer, having obtained firmware update data as a difference DLL file via the STB, the bridge media, the Internet or the like, may generate a firmware of the latest version by linking to the firmware of the existing version stored in the firmware storage unit  and write the generated firmware into the firmware storage unit  so as to update the existing version.","It should be noted that in the above-mentioned embodiments, the case where a firmware is mainly a program for controlling the printer is explained. The firmware, however, may include not only a program but also data such as a font for printing, external character data and others. The firmware update data for updating such firmware may be just the font and external character data themselves or just difference data for updating data by adding them to the existing set of font data.","The rules may be defined beforehand in order to identify firmware update data as either a program only, a program that includes data or data only, using a file name, an extension or a tag of the firmware update data.","Also, the program included in the firmware update data is not limited to OS such as a control program or the like, and may be an application program or an in-between program of the OS and the application.","Furthermore, the firmware update data may include an off-set address for updating an address of the control program within a ROM as well as data for updating the control program.","Also, a firmware or firmware update data may include a plurality of different programs or plural pieces of different data. In this case, the firmware update data shall include an address indicating each location within the ROM for each data to be written.","It should be noted that in the above-mentioned embodiments, it is explained that only a control unit includes a firmware storage unit in a printer and controls operations at each unit in the printer by executing the firmware stored in it. The present invention, however, is not limited to this, and furthermore, a printer engine may include two ROMs for firmware storage use which are independent of the control unit, and may have a configuration in which the printer engine operates independently of the control unit by executing a firmware for printer engine use. The printer engine in this case includes not a configuration consisting of mechanical parts only but a control unit exclusively for printer engine use which analyzes the firmware for printer engine use so as to execute it. What is more, in this case, a firmware for control unit use and a firmware for printer engine use shall be identified using file names which are defined in advance based on the specific rules.","On the other hand, when the firmware update data inputted from the judgment unit is a firmware for printer engine, the firmware updating unit writes it in the ROM which is not for booting included in the printer engine. The case where the firmware update data inputted from the judgment unit is a firmware for control unit use is as already explained. Thus, the printer according to the present invention can update the firmware for control unit use as well as the firmware for printer engine use without any problems even in the case where the printer engine includes two ROMs for storing the firmware which are set independently from the control unit. In this case, the firmware update data explained as one data in the above-mentioned embodiments can be divided into two types: one for control unit use; and the other for printer engine use. This therefore reduces the amount of firmware update data received or downloaded at one time by updating them respectively in different timings.","Furthermore, in the third embodiment, the case where the STB obtains, from the printer, the firmware specification information including the version ID of the firmware so as to download the latest firmware update data is explained. The present invention, however, is not limited to this. When the STB can not obtain the version ID of the firmware from the printer, the STB may gain an access to the server based on the maker ID and the model ID obtained from the printer so as to download the firmware update data presented as \u201clatest\u201d on the server.","Also, in the above-mentioned embodiments, the STB includes the hard disk  as a storage medium for storing the received display content and print-only content. However, the STB may include instead a semiconductor memory like RAM or a storage medium like a removable memory card or the like.","In the above-mentioned embodiments, only firmware data for one model is described in the firmware update file, written in the markup language and outputted as print data to the printer. However, the firmware data for a plurality of models may be described in advance so that the printer may identify and select a firmware for itself based on the firmware specification information or the like so as to update the firmware.","The server of the present invention is useful as a content delivery server at the broadcasting station where data including a print content is broadcasted or as a delivery server for distributing a print content to a portable terminal such as a mobile phone via mobile phone lines or the like. The receiving apparatus of the present invention is useful as a mobile phone and a portable terminal which receives contents including a print content or the like. The printing apparatus of the present invention is useful as a printer exclusively connected to a receiving apparatus such as an STB and a DTV as well as to a portable terminal or the like."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 4A","FIG. 5B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIGS. 11A and 11B","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIGS. 12A and 12B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIGS. 13A and 13B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 23"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 26"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
