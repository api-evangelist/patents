{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a Continuation-in-Part of PCT\/IB00\/00358, filed Mar. 16, 2000, designating the U.S., published Sep. 28, 2000 as WO 00\/56838 and claiming priority from GB 9906457.8 filed Mar. 19, 1999. All of the above-mentioned applications, as well as all documents cited herein and documents referenced or cited in documents cited herein, are hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to an anti-oxidant composition.","Anti-oxidants are required in many applications, for example, food preservation.","Food degradation from various sources are recognized in the literature and individual chemicals are known which will inhibit one aspect or another of degradation derived from a single source. Degradation, loss of colour or flavour of freshly cut plant parts are known to be caused by oxidation, enzymes, microbes, and metal ions. For example, acidulants are known to prevent microbial degradation by maintaining a relatively low pH environment but their effectiveness has been only temporary.","Fatty bodies have a tendency to be oxidized, even at ambient temperature and this oxidation (or rancidness) makes them acquire new properties, principally of taste or smell, which are generally considered as undesirable when these fatty bodies are incorporated, for example, in food compositions or in cosmetic compositions.","There are currently employed, in compositions containing fatty bodies or materials, protective agents which, in fact, play the role of an anti-oxidant.","Among known anti-oxidants, ascorbic acid is currently used which acts principally by direct absorption of oxygen. However, ascorbic acid is only very slightly soluble in fatty bodies and it is consequently difficult to use in order to protect the fatty material against oxidation. Moreover, although ascorbic acid may inhibit enzymatic browning it promotes non-enzymatic browning. Therefore it may not be used in many applications.","In order to solubilise the ascorbic acid molecule in fatty materials, it has been proposed to use various ascorbyl esters such as, for example, ascorbyl stearate, palmitate or laurate; see for example, the article of C. F. Bourgeois, \u201cNo. 9, pages 353-356 (September 1981).","It is also known, apart from their own anti-oxidant properties, that ascorbic derivatives also have the property of improving the activity of anti-oxidant agents such as tocopherols or cafeic acid and its esters, by favoring the regeneration of these anti-oxidant agents; see for example H. S. Olcott, \u201c18, (1941), 77 and U.S. Pat. No. 2,462,663.","Various improvements of these binary anti-oxidant agents, of the ascorbic derivatives+tocopherols or ascorbic derivatives+cafeic derivatives types have been proposed, by providing for the addition of a third constituent which again improves anti-oxidant effects. Among the third constituents of these ternary systems, there can be mentioned, principally, p-aminobenzoic acid (U.S. Pat. No. 2,462,633), phospholipids (R. W. Riemenschneider et al., \u201c1941, 47) and amines (Klaui. \u201c() \u201d, ed. by M. Stein, University of Nottingham Seminar Vitamins. London. England, 1971, page 110).","It is also known that sulfiting agents including sulfur dioxide, sodium sulfite, sodium and potassium bisulfite and sodium and potassium metabisulfite act as anti-oxidants and possess the ability to preserve vegetable food products. Sulfites have also been employed as preservatives in prepared foods such as flavored beverages, syrup concentrates, wine and vinegar as well as in the processing of sugar, corn starch and shrimp. Because of the recent increase in reported allergic reactions to these compounds, their use has fallen into disfavor. Regulatory actions involving the use of sulfites have been initiated and the former status of \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d GRAS use of sulfites on raw foods and vegetables has been withdrawn by the U.S. Government Food and Drug Administration. Further labeling requirements have been imposed by the Food and Drug Administration on packaged food containing direct or indirect additions of sulfites.","Synthetic anti-oxidants for foodstuffs are known, such as dibutylhydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylhydroxyanisole (BHA). These compounds are, however, disadvantageous in that their amounts to be added to foodstuffs should be strictly controlled. For example, a maximum permissible content of BHT or BHA in fats and oils or in butter under the Japanese safety regulations must not exceed 0.02%, such limitation bringing about an insufficient anti-oxidative effect in some cases.","Besides the above named anti-oxidants for foodstuffs, several compounds have been proposed, for example alpha\/omega-bis(2,5-dihydroxyphenyl)alkanes are disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 42-6973, and hexahydrocurcumin or octahydrocurcumin are disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 48-39930. The compounds, however, have drawbacks in their synthesis and effectiveness. Generally, anti-oxidants originating in natural products are preferred to synthetic anti-oxidants as food additives from the standpoint of safety and taste.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,195,101 proposes use as an anti-oxidant of 2\u2032,6\u2032-dihydroxy-9-(2,5-dihydroxy-phenyl)octylphenone. It is taught that this compound serves as an anti-oxidant in foodstuffs, such as lard or the like, exhibiting higher anti-oxidative activities than the conventional anti-oxidant BHA. U.S. Pat. No. 4,195,101 discloses the preparation of the compound by extraction and separation of mace, or Hautt, (a known spice) successively with petroleum ether, diethylether, n-hexane and carbon tetrachloride, followed by column chromatographic separation.","According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an anti-oxidant composition comprising a cyclic compound having Formula I \n\n\nor a derivative thereof, wherein Rand Rare independently selected from \u2014OH, \u2550O, wherein Ris a substituent comprising an \u2014OH group; and wherein Rand Rare other than H: with the proviso that the compound is other than ascorbic acid.\n","According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for prevention and\/or reduction of oxidation of a material, the process comprising the step of contacting the material with a cyclic compound having Formula I \n\n\nor a derivative thereof, wherein Rand Rare independently selected from \u2014OH, \u2550O, wherein Ris a substituent comprising an \u2014OH group; and wherein Rand Rare other than H; with the proviso that the compound is other than ascorbic acid.\n","According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided use of a compound for prevention and\/or reduction of oxidation of a material, wherein the compound is a cyclic compound having Formula I \n\n\nor a derivative thereof, wherein Rand Rare independently selected from \u2014OH, \u2550O, wherein Ris a substituent comprising an \u2014OH group; and wherein Rand Rare other than H; with the proviso that the compound is other than ascorbic acid.\n","Preferably the material is a plant or fungal material.","The present invention may provide an anti-oxidant which on contact with plant or fungal material reduces and\/or prevents the discolouration of the plant or fungal material.

Examples of such substituents may include halo-, alkoxy-, nitro-, hydroxy, carboxyl, epoxy, acrylics hydrocarbon, N-acyl, or cyclic group etc. In addition to the possibility of the substituents being a cyclic group, a combination of substituents may form a cyclic group. If the hydrocarbyl group comprises more than one C then those carbons need not necessarily be linked to each other. For example, at least two of the carbons may be linked via a suitable element or group. Thus, the hydrocarbyl group may contain hetero atoms. Suitable hetero atoms will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include, for instance, sulphur, nitrogen and oxygen.","The groups Rand Rof the general formula may independently be selected from alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl and aryl or may together represent an alkylene.","Preferably, the cyclic compound of the general formula comprises a five or a six membered ring.","Preferably, the compound of the general formula is selected from ascopyrones, kojic acid, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the compound of the general formula is a compound selected from Ascopyrone M, Ascopyrone P, Ascopyrone T, Ascopyrone T, Ascopyrone T, kojic acid, and mixtures thereof. Thus, according to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided an anti-oxidant comprising a compound selected from Ascopyrone M, Ascopyrone P, Ascopyrone T, Ascopyrone T, Ascopyrone T, kojic acid, and mixtures thereof.","The compounds of the present invention may provide strong anti-oxidant activity. For example, the compounds may prevent and\/or delay the oxidation of carotenes or may prevent and\/or delay the oxidative degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids.","In particular ascopyrones and kojic acid of the present invention provide strong anti-oxidant activity.","The use of ascopyrones in the present invention has been found to be particularly advantageous for at least two reasons. Ascorbic acid is a standard anti-oxidant which is considered \u201cfood safe\u201d. Ascopyrones have been found by the applicant to be up to 100 times more potent as anti-oxidants than ascorbic acid. In other words, to achieve the same effect as a given amount of ascorbic acid, as little as one hundredth of the amount of ascopyrone may be required. Secondly, the production cost of ascopyrones may be approximately one tenth of that of ascorbic acid.","Ascopyrone is a known compound. In 1978 and 1981, a group of American scientists prepared ascopyrone P by pyrolysis of cellulose at the Wood Chemistry laboratory in Montana, with the intention of using ascopyrone P as a starting material for organic synthesis [1-2]. They characterized ascopyrone P by, for example, H and C NMR, and IR spectroscopy techniques. A 3-dimensional structure of ascopyrone P was provided. The yield of ascopyrone P obtained by pyrolysis was only 1.4% and complicated separation methods had to be used.","The natural occurrence of ascopyrone P in some species of very scarcely studied fungi collected from the Alps has been taught [3]. The occurrence of ascopyrone P in fungi immediately prompted the hypothesis that ascopyrone P would act as an antibiotic. However, ascopyrone P did not function satisfactorily as an antibiotic in the disclosed tests.","The preparation of ascopyrone P from anhydrofructose by a chemical method was disclosed in [4].","The six ascopyrone molecules the formulae of which are shown in  are known. However, their use as anti-oxidants is new.","Ascopyrone P and ascopyrone T can be produced from 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose by EDTA-sensitive dehydratases isolated from the fungi of the order Pezizales, such as and and the order of Tuberales, such as, Ascopyrone T, the dihydrate form of ascopyrone T; Ascopyrone Tand T, the tautomeric monohydrate forms of ascopyrone T.","Ascopyrone M can be produced from 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose by EDTA-sensitive dehydratases isolated from the fungi Morels, such as , such as ","Ascopyrone M, P and T can also be produced by treatment of 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose with alkali under mild conditions (Ahmand, T., 1995).","Preferably, the compound of the present invention is prepared by chemical means or enzymatic means.","When the compound of the present invention is prepared by chemical means, it may be prepared in accordance with one of the following methods\n\n","The structures of all ascopyrones produced were confirmed by NMR techniques.","Preferably, the compound of the present invention is prepared by enzymatic means as disclosed in [3].
