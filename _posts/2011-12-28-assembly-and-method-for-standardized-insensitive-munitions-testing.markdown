title: Assembly and method for standardized insensitive munitions testing
abstract: A test assembly for building a safety profile and a sensitivity profile of an explosive, by impacting the test assembly with a projectile. The safety profile of the explosive is built by determining a detonation threshold of the explosive in reaction to the projectile. The sensitivity profile is built by measuring a pressure difference between pressures acquired by the top sensor and the bottom sensor, resulting from a shock wave that travels through the explosive.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by, or for the Government of the United States for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.","The present invention relates in general to the field of munitions. More specifically, this invention relates to a relatively low cost, standardized, Insensitive Munitions (IM) testing of explosives for classification relative to safety and sensitivity.","The development and production of Insensitive Munitions (IM) testing of explosives is very important and valuable to the armed forces. More specifically, explosive munitions must possess certain minimum safety requirements when under attack from thermal or other physical sources or threats.","Tactics such as redesigned or experimental munitions and less sensitive explosive fills are being continuously explored. In order to evaluate the effect of these changes to the munition, IM testing is used. IM testing generally includes taking a given munition and subjecting it to some stress, in order to simulate a hostile combat environment. For example, to simulate an impact from a fragment, a carefully shaped metal object is launched at the tested munition at 8,300 ft\/second. IM testing is a critical part of the development of Insensitive Munitions.","IM Testing, while, quite necessary and important, it can be prohibitively expensive.","Extensive research has been conducted to implement methods according to which all munitions would be required to reach IM compliance. One method of achieving this goal is to replace the formulation within the explosive ordnance so that it is less sensitive to bullet or fragment impacts.","When a replacement formulation is desired, multiple candidates need to be evaluated. Normally, this is done using calculations and a relatively small scale testing. It would be desirable to have such testing correlate directly to real world threats. Although it would be desirable to have each new or experimental formulation tested, testing can be quite a time consuming, costly process, specifically if the round in question is rather large or expensive to produce.","What is therefore needed is a standardized test assembly and method of use, which is relatively simple and inexpensive to implement. Prior to the advent of the present invention, the need for such a standardized test assembly and procedure has heretofore remained unsatisfied.","The present invention satisfies this need, and describes a standardized test assembly and method of use the same. The test assembly provides a standard protocol for rating explosive response.","The test assembly (or test device) simulates a munition for IM testing purposes, and is relatively simple and inexpensive to implement.","The test assembly provides a controlled repeatable way of obtaining data for comparison and ranking, and thus reduces problems associated with errors at the impact point.","The test assembly is designed to maintain confinement after impact. It simplifies loading and testing of new or experimental energetic explosives.","The test assembly provides data that is vital to increase the accuracy of present shock models.","The test assembly provides a cost and schedule effective way of explosive down-selection for new end items.","The robust design of the test assembly makes it capable of testing multiple items for explosive implementation.","Consequently, the test assembly enables an efficient down-selection of explosives, resulting in the following advantages:\n\n","The foregoing and additional features and advantages of the present invention are realized by a standardized test assembly that generally includes, in a preferred embodiment, a one half inch steel cylinder with interchangeable plates on one open end that is impacted by the testing projectile. The plates are interchangeable so plates of varying thicknesses can be used, thus altering the amount of shock imparted into an explosive munition.","The test assembly presents a relatively inexpensive alternative to narrow down and select the optimal candidate explosives that will perform according to desired specifications. The test assembly can be used to evaluate the validity of shock initiation and detonation models and can greatly increase the confidence level of IM testing.","The test assembly is highly flexible, and is capable of replicating numerous types of munitions that can be loaded as melt pours, pressed munitions, or cast cure items.","To this end, a principal goal of the present test assembly is to distinguish if the event is primarily shock driven or if the shock just sets up damage region that subsequently explodes. In the former case, formulators would concentrate on reducing shock sensitivity, while in the latter case, formulators would likely consider softening their formulation, making it less brittle.","By analyzing pressure data obtained by top and bottom sensors (or gauges), the test assembly provides an understanding of the cause of violence in non-detonation explosion, thus enabling the determination of alternative ways for altering the explosives formulations in order to mitigate this effect.","The test assembly enables the use of generic hardware (GH) to augment testing, in order to improve the confidence level of explosive reaction using statistical analysis.","Similar numerals refer to similar elements in the drawings. It should be understood that the sizes of the different components in the figures are not necessarily in exact proportion or to scale, and are shown for visual clarity and for the purpose of explanation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","150","400","100","100"]},"The test assembly  is generally formed of a vessel  with an open top end and a partially open bottom end, as it will be explained later in greater detail. The top end is closed by an impact plate  that is maintained in a hermetically locked position against the vessel  by means of a top cap . The bottom end of the test assembly  is hermetically sealed with a bottom plug  ().","As further illustrated in , , and , a top sensor  is located near the top end of the vessel  and is connected to external test equipment (or computer)  by means of a cable . Similarly, a bottom sensor  is located near the bottom end of the vessel , and is connected to the external test equipment  by means of a cable . The external test equipment  interprets the measurements acquired by the top and bottom sensors , , in order to assist in ranking the explosive  being tested.","In operation, the bottom sensor  is inserted at or near the bottom end of the vessel , and the bottom plug  is screwed onto the vessel  to provide a tight closure. The explosive  to be tested is then packed inside the vessel  to fill the entire internal volume of the body . The top sensor  is the inserted at or near the top end of the vessel , and the impact plate  is placed on the vessel . A top cap  is then screwed onto the vessel  to provide a tight closure.","The projectile  is then aimed and shot at the impact plate . A principal objective of the present test assembly  is to determine if the event is primarily shock driven or if the shock just sets up damage region that subsequently explodes. In the event it is determined that the event is primarily shock driven, formulators in the external test equipment  would concentrate on reducing shock sensitivity. On the other hand, if it is determined that the shock just sets up damage region that subsequently explodes, formulators in the external test equipment  would likely consider softening their formulation, making the final material more robust and less brittle.","The external test equipment  analyzes the pressure data acquired by the top and bottom sensors , , so that the test assembly  provides an understanding of the cause of violence in non-detonation explosion, thus enabling the determination of alternative ways for altering the explosives formulations in order to mitigate this effect.","Considering now the individual components of the test assembly  in more detail,  illustrate an exemplary vessel . The vessel  is integrally formed of a generally cylindrical body  with an open top end, and which terminates at its bottom end into a bottom . While the body  is described herein as having a cylindrical shape, it should be understandable that different shaped might be alternatively used.","The bottom  is generally disc shaped, having a central bottom threaded access opening  for mating with the bottom plug . While the access opening  is shown as extending through the bottom , it should be understood that the access opening  could be disposed at a different suitable location along the body .","The top end of the body  includes an externally threaded section  that allows it to threadably secure the body and the impact plate  to the top cap . The threaded section  is chamfered into a top lateral access channel or groove  that accommodates the conductor (or cable)  of the top sensor , to enable external access to the top sensor , which is inserted within the body .","The periphery of the top end of the body  is provided with two alignment holes , , that are designed and disposed so that they align with corresponding alignment through holes ,  in the impact plate  (, , ), in order to enable dowel pins ,  (, , ) to be inserted therethrough, for preventing the rotational movement of the impact plate .","In this particular embodiment the vessel  has a uniform thickness that ranges between, for example only, approximately 0.490 in and 0.510 in. The body  has an outer diameter of, for example, 6 inches, and an inner diameter of, for example 5 inches. The height of the body is approximately 5 inches. The threaded section  is preferably, approximately 1.5 in wide. The bottom threaded access opening  is generally circularly shaped with a diameter of preferably, approximately 1.00 in. It should be understood that different tests might require other shapes and dimensions of the vessel  and its components, which are foreseeable within the scope of the present invention.","The vessel  and the main components of the test assembly  are made of any suitable material that can withstand anything less severe than a deflagration (fast burning reaction). An exemplary material would be steel, such as steel 4340. The dowel pins ,  are preferably made of steel 1080.","When testing the explosive , the projectile  is fired directly at the impact plate , in order to generate a shock wave that travels axially through the impact plate  and then through the explosive . It would be desirable that the vessel  remain intact so that the shock wave generated by the impacting projectile  has time to reach the bottom  of the vessel  where the bottom sensor  is located.","In an exemplary embodiment, the top sensor  and the bottom sensor  are preferably pressure sensors. It should however be understood that other sensors might alternatively be used. As an example, the top and\/or bottom sensors ,  may be MnCn, PDV, PVDF, Crush, etc. sensors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIGS. 7","b":["8","9","111","106","110","111","105","100"]},"The thickness of the impact plate  can vary, depending on the test and type of munition being simulated. For illustration purpose, the thickness of the impact plate  can vary from approximately 0.002 in to 2.00 in.","The impact plate  includes two alignment through holes ,  to lock the impact plate  in place (i.e., to prevent its rotational movement). In the present preferred embodiment, the through holes ,  are illustrated as being diametrically oppositely disposed. It should be understood that a different number of through holes ,  can be disposed at different locations around the periphery of the impact plate .","Upon assembly, the impact plate  is simply placed on the top of the body  and the load of explosive , the through holes ,  are aligned with the holes , , and the dowel pins ,  are inserted therethrough, as shown in , , , to prevent the rotational movement of the impact plate .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIGS. 10","FIGS. 2"],"b":["11","12","110","110","316","317","317","111","111","150","316","106","318","3","110","111","105"]},"Two wrench holes ,  are formed in the flange  to enable the further tightening of the top cap  to the vessel .

The bottom plug  is then threaded onto the bottom .","The present test assembly  enables the identification of the safety and sensitivity of the explosive  being tested. Safety is assessed by the reaction of the explosive  to the impacting projectile (or a given threat) . If the explosive  reaction falls outside the allowed limits, the explosive  would be determined to be unsafe. The safety profile of the explosive  can then be built by determining a detonation threshold of the explosive  in reaction to the impacting projectile .","The sensitivity that characterizes the explosive  is defined as the level of pressure or energy that is required to detonate the explosive . According to the present invention, sensitivity is measured with the pressure sensors ,  that measure the pressure difference between the pressures measured by the top sensor  and the bottom sensor , due to the shock wave that travels through the explosive .","The measured pressure difference is then compared to the actual reaction of the explosive  that can be, for example visually determined. As an example, in a first test, the measured pressure difference for a particular explosive  is approximately \u00b150 kBar and the explosive  did not detonate. The test is repeated several times, using different threats or projectiles  and the pressure differences are measured, and the reactions of the explosive  are noted, particularly those pressure differences that trigger the detonation of the explosive .","Consequently, the test assembly  enables the experimenter to build accurate safety and sensitivity profiles for the explosive , in a very efficient and economical way.","It should be understood that other modifications may be made to the present design without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above and other features of the present invention and the manner of attaining them, will become apparent, and the invention itself will be best understood, by reference to the following description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-3","FIG. 3"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 1-4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIGS. 7 and 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIGS. 1-4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIGS. 10 and 11","FIG. 11"],"b":["12","12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIGS. 1-4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 13"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
