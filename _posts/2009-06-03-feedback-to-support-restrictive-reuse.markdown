title: Feedback to support restrictive reuse
abstract: The scheduler in a base station needs CQI information from a terminal for all re-use sets every 5 ms. to decide on which re-use set to schedule a given terminal. For MIMO users, the problem is that the CQI cannot be reconstructed for all re-use sets, using the current design. Solution: (1) For Multiple Code Word MIMO users, a MIMO VCQI connection layer message enables the base station to reconstruct the MIMO-CQI for all reuse sets on a packet-by-packet basis. This will enable dynamic scheduling (RESTRICTIVE REUSE) gains. (2) For Single Code Word users, dynamic RESTRICTIVE REUSE can be obtained by changing the CQI reporting format, and also sending a MIMO-VCQI connection layer message. (3) For Single Code Word design, quasi-static scheduling gains can be obtained by sending a MIMO-VCQI connection layer message.

No. 7,257,406, assigned to the assignee hereof, and expressly incorporated by reference herein.","The present application for patent is related to the following co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/871,084 entitled \u201cRestrictive Reuse For A Wireless Communication System\u201d filed Jun. 18, 2004, assigned to the assignee hereof, and expressly incorporated by reference herein.","I. Field","The present invention relates generally to communications and more specifically to data transmission in a wireless multiple-access communication system.","II. Background","A wireless multiple-access system can concurrently support communication for multiple wireless terminals on the forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from base stations to terminals, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from terminals to base stations. Multiple terminals may simultaneously transmit data on the reverse link and\/or receive data on the forward link. This may be achieved by multiplexing the data transmissions on each link to be orthogonal to one another in time, frequency, and\/or code domain. The orthogonality ensures that the data transmission for each terminal does not interfere with the data transmissions for other terminals.","A multiple-access system typically has many cells, where the term \u201ccell\u201d can refer to a base station and\/or its coverage area depending on the context in which the term is used. Data transmissions for terminals in the same cell may be sent using orthogonal multiplexing to avoid \u201cintra-cell\u201d interference. However, data transmissions for terminals in different cells may not be orthogonalized, in which case each terminal would observe \u201cinter-cell\u201d interference from other cells. The inter-cell interference may significantly degrade performance for certain disadvantaged terminals observing high levels of interference.","To combat inter-cell interference, a wireless system may employ a frequency reuse scheme whereby not all frequency bands available in the system are used in each cell. For example, a system may employ a 7-cell reuse pattern and a reuse factor of K=7. For this system, the overall system bandwidth W is divided into seven equal frequency bands, and each cell in a 7-cell cluster is assigned one of the seven frequency bands. Each cell uses only one frequency band, and every seventh cell reuses the same frequency band. With this frequency reuse scheme, the same frequency band is only reused in cells that are not adjacent to each other, and the inter-cell interference observed in each cell is reduced relative to the case in which all cells use the same frequency band. However, a large reuse factor represents inefficient use of the available system resources since each cell is able to use only a fraction of the overall system bandwidth. More precisely, each cell is able to use only a reciprocal of the reuse factor, i.e., 1\/K.","Active set based restricted frequency hopping (ASBR) reduces inter-cell interference in an OFDMA based system. ASBR is a global frequency planning scheme that takes into account the channel and interference measured by users. The key idea behind ASBR is to intelligently deploy frequency reuse for selected users based on their channel qualities. In CDMA systems, active set has been defined for each user for handoff purposes. Sectors in the active set of a user usually contribute most interference to this user's reception on FL and being interfered most severely by this user's transmission on RL. Avoiding interference from sectors in a user's active set is expected to reduce the interference on both FL and RL. Simulations and analysis have shown that the frequency reuse assignment algorithm based on a user's active set yields a 3.5 dB signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) improvement with 25% bandwidth partial loading.","There is therefore a need in the art for techniques to provide feedback to a base station from a terminal to reduce inter-cell interference in a more efficient manner.","In an aspect, a method of providing feedback to support restrictive reuse in a single-input single-output (SISO) system comprises sending a quality indicator for a non-restrictive reuse set and sending a vectored quality indicator for reuse sets other than the non-restrictive reuse set.","In another aspect, a method of providing feedback to support restrictive reuse in a multiple code word (MCW) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system comprises sending a quality indicator for a non-restrictive reuse set, and sending a vectored quality indicator for at least two reuse sets other than the non-restrictive reuse set for all layers.","In another aspect, a method of providing feedback to support restrictive reuse in a single code word (SCW) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system comprises sending a quality indicator for a non-restrictive reuse set, and sending a vectored quality indicator for all reuse sets other than the non-restrictive reuse set for all layers.","In yet another aspect, a method of providing feedback to support restrictive reuse in a single code word (SCW) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system comprises sending a quality indicator for a reuse set with an optimum quality indicator for each layer, and sending a vectored quality indicator for all reuse sets for all layers.","In an aspect, an apparatus for wireless communications comprises means for sending a quality indicator for a non-restrictive reuse set, and means for sending a vectored quality indicator for reuse sets other than the non-restrictive reuse set.","In another aspect, an apparatus for wireless communications comprises a controller operative to sending a quality indicator for a non-restrictive reuse set, and sending a vectored quality indicator for reuse sets other than the non-restrictive reuse set.","In another aspect, a controller in a wireless device operative to sending a quality indicator for a non-restrictive reuse set, and sending a vectored quality indicator for reuse sets other than the non-restrictive reuse set.","In yet another aspect, a readable media embodying a method for wireless communications comprises sending a quality indicator for a non-restrictive reuse set, and sending a vectored quality indicator for reuse sets other than the non-restrictive reuse set.","Various aspects and embodiments of the invention are described in further detail below.","The word \u201cexemplary\u201d is used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment or design described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments or designs.","Techniques to efficiently avoid or reduce interference from strong interferers in a wireless communication system are described herein. A strong interferer to a given user u may be a base station (on the forward link) or another user (on the reverse link). User u may also be a strong interferer to other users. A strong interference entity for user u may be a strong interferer causing high interference to user u and\/or a strong interferee observing high interference from or due to user u. Strong interference entities (or interferers\/interferees, or simply, interferers\/ees) for each user may be identified as described below. Users are allocated system resources (e.g., frequency subbands) that are orthogonal to those used by their strong interferers\/ees and thus avoid interfering with one another. These techniques are called \u201crestrictive reuse\u201d techniques and may be used for various wireless systems and for both the forward and reverse links.","In an embodiment of restrictive reuse, each cell\/sector is assigned (1) a set of usable subbands that may be allocated to users in the cell\/sector and (2) a set of forbidden subbands that are not allocated to the users in the cell\/sector. The usable set and the forbidden set for each cell\/sector are orthogonal to one other. The usable set for each cell\/sector also overlaps the forbidden set for each neighboring cell\/sector. A given user u in a cell\/sector x may be allocated subbands in the usable set for that cell\/sector. If user u observes (or causes) high level of interference from (to) a neighboring cell\/sector y, then user u may be allocated subbands from a \u201crestricted\u201d set that contains subbands included in both the usable set for cell\/sector x and the forbidden set for cell\/sector y. User u would then observe (cause) no interference from (to) cell\/sector y since the subbands allocated to user u are members of the forbidden set not used by cell\/sector y. The subband restriction may be extended to avoid interference from multiple neighboring cells\/sectors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","120"]},"Communication systems are widely deployed to provide various communication services such as voice, packet data, and so on. These systems may be time, frequency, and\/or code division multiple-access systems capable of supporting communication with multiple users simultaneously by sharing the available system resources. Examples of such multiple-access systems include Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems, Multiple-Carrier CDMA (MC-CDMA), Wideband CDMA (W-CDMA), High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems, Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) systems, and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) systems.","For a centralized architecture, a system controller  couples to the base stations and provides coordination and control for these base stations. For a distributed architecture, the base stations may communicate with one another as needed, e.g., to serve a terminal, coordinate usage of system resources, and so on.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["210","212","212","212","1","2","3"],"i":["a","b","c"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["210","210"]},"Each sector is typically served by a base transceiver subsystem (BTS). In general, the term \u201csector\u201d can refer to a BTS and\/or its coverage area, depending on the context in which the term is used. For a sectorized cell, the base station for that cell typically includes the BTSs for all sectors of that cell. For simplicity, in the following description, the term \u201cbase station\u201d is used generically for both a fixed station that serves a cell and a fixed station that serves a sector. A \u201cserving\u201d base station or \u201cserving\u201d sector is one with which a terminal communicates. The terms \u201cterminal\u201d and \u201cuser\u201d are also used interchangeably herein.","The restrictive reuse techniques may be used for various communication systems. For clarity, these techniques are described for an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) system that utilizes orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM effectively partitions the overall system bandwidth into a number of (N) orthogonal frequency subbands, which are also referred to as tones, sub-carriers, bins, frequency channels, and so on. Each subband is associated with a respective sub-carrier that may be modulated with data.","In the OFDMA system, multiple orthogonal \u201ctraffic\u201d channels may be defined whereby (1) each subband is used for only one traffic channel in any given time interval and (2) each traffic channel may be assigned zero, one, or multiple subbands in each time interval. A traffic channel may be viewed as a convenient way of expressing an assignment of subbands for different time intervals. Each terminal may be assigned a different traffic channel. For each sector, multiple data transmissions may be sent simultaneously on multiple traffic channels without interfering with one another.","The OFDMA system may or may not use frequency hopping (FH). With frequency hopping, a data transmission hops from subband to subband in a pseudo-random manner, which can provide frequency diversity and other benefits. For a frequency hopping OFDMA (FH-OFDMA) system, each traffic channel may be associated with a specific FH sequence that indicates the particular subband(s) to use for that traffic channel in each time interval (or hop period). The FH sequences for different traffic channels in each sector are orthogonal to one another so that no two traffic channels use the same subband in any given hop period. The FH sequences for each sector may also be pseudo-random with respect to the FH sequences for neighboring sectors. These properties for the FH sequences minimize intra-sector interference and randomize inter-sector interference.","In the OFDMA system, users with different channel conditions may be distributed throughout the system. These users may have different contribution and tolerance to inter-sector interference. The channel condition for each user may be quantified by a signal quality metric, which may be defined by a signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR), a channel gain, a received pilot power, and\/or some other quantity measured for the user's serving base station, some other measurements, or any combination thereof A weak user has a relatively poor signal quality metric (e.g., a low SINR) for its serving base station, e.g., due to a low channel gain for its serving base station and\/or high inter-sector interference. A weak user may in general be located anywhere within a sector but is typically located far away from the serving base station. In general, a weak user is less tolerant to inter-sector interference, causes more interference to users in other sectors, has poor performance, and may be a bottleneck in a system that imposes a fairness requirement.","Restrictive reuse can avoid or reduce interference observed\/caused by weak users. This may be achieved by determining the likely sources of high inter-sector interference (or strong interferers) and\/or the likely victims of high inter-sector interference (or strong interferees) for the weak users. The strong interferers may be base stations (on the forward link) and\/or users (on the reverse link) in neighboring sectors. The strong interferees may be users in neighboring sectors. In any case, the weak users are allocated subbands that are orthogonal to those used by the strong interferers\/ees.","In an embodiment of restrictive reuse, each sector x is assigned a usable subband set (denoted as Ux) and a forbidden or unused subband set (denoted as Fx). The usable set contains subbands that may be allocated to the users in the sector. The forbidden set contains subbands that are not allocated to users in the sector. The usable set and the forbidden set for each sector are orthogonal or disjoint in that no subband is included in both sets. The usable set for each sector also overlaps the forbidden set for each neighboring sector. The forbidden sets for multiple neighboring sectors may also overlap. The users in each sector may be allocated subbands from the usable set as described below.","Restrictive reuse may be used for systems composed of unsectorized cells as well as systems composed of sectorized cells.

Restricted sets U- and U- are mutually orthogonal since each restricted set Ucontains only subbands that are excluded from the usable set Uof which the other restricted set Uis a subset. Because users  and  are allocated subbands from orthogonal restricted sets U- and U-, respectively, these two users do not interfere with one another.","As shown in , the interference experienced by a user decreases as the size of its reuse set increases. A user with a reuse set size of one (e.g., user  in ) is interfered by distant interferers in six first-tier neighboring sectors. A user with a reuse set size of two (e.g., user  in ) is interfered by distant interferers in three first-tier neighboring sectors. A user with a reuse set size of three is interfered by interferers in second-tier neighbor sectors. In contrast, without restrictive reuse, all users in the system would be interfered by randomly distributed interferers from all six first-tier neighboring sectors.","Restrictive reuse may be used to mitigate inter-sector interference for weak users on both the forward and reverse links. On the forward link, a weak user u in sector x may observe high inter-sector interference from base stations for neighboring sectors that are in its reuse set. Weak user u may be allocated subbands that are not used by these neighboring sectors and would then observe no interference from the base stations for these sectors. Restrictive reuse may thus directly improve the SINRs of individual weak user u.","On the reverse link, weak user u may observe high inter-sector interference from users in neighboring sectors that are in its reuse set. Weak user u may be allocated subbands that are not used by these neighboring sectors and would then observe no interference from the users in these sectors. Weak user u may also be a strong interferer to the users in the neighboring sectors. Weak user u typically transmits at a high power level in order to improve its received SINR at its serving sector x. The high transmit power causes more interference to all users in the neighboring sectors. By restricting weak user u to subbands not used by the neighboring sectors in the reuse set, weak user u would cause no interference to the users in these sectors.","When restrictive reuse is applied across the system, weak user u may benefit from lower inter-sector interference on the reverse link even if the strong interferers to weak user u cannot be identified. Weak users in neighboring sectors that have sector x in their reuse sets may be strong interferers to weak user u as well as other users in sector x. These strong interferers may be allocated subbands that are not used by sector x and would then cause no interference to the users in sector x. User u may thus observe no inter-sector interference from these strong interferers even though user u is not able to identify them. Restrictive reuse generally improves the SINRs of all weak users.","For both the forward and reverse links, restrictive reuse can avoid or reduce interference observed by weak users from strong interferers and thus improve the SINRs for the weak users. Restrictive reuse may reduce the variation in SINRs among users in the system. As a result, improved communication coverage as well as higher overall system capacity may be achieved for the system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","812","814","816","818"],"sub":["x-y ","x","y "]},"Process  shows allocation of subbands to weak users with at least one strong interference entity first, then allocation of remaining subbands to strong users. In general, the weak and strong users may be allocated subbands in any order. For example, users may be allocated subbands based on their priority, which may be determined from various factors such as the SINRs achieved by the users, the data rates supported by the users, the payload size, the type of data to be sent, the amount of delay already experienced by the users, outage probability, the maximum available transmit power, the type of data services being offered, and so on. These various factors may be given appropriate weights and used to prioritize the users. The users may then be allocated subbands based on their priority.","Process  may be performed by each sector in each scheduling interval, which may be a predetermined time interval. Each sector may send signaling (e.g., to all users or to only users allocated different subbands) to indicate the subbands allocated to each user. Process  may also be performed (1) whenever there is a change in users in the sector (e.g., if a new user is added or a current user is removed), (2) whenever the channel conditions for the users change (e.g., whenever the reuse set for a user changes), or (3) at any time and\/or due to any triggering criterion. At any given moment, all of the subbands may not be available for scheduling, e.g., some subbands may already be in use for retransmissions or some other purposes.","The forbidden sets represent overhead for supporting restrictive reuse. Since the subbands in forbidden set Fare not used by sector x, the percentage of the total subbands usable by sector x, which is also the effective reuse factor for sector x, may be given as: |U|\/|\u03a9|=(|\u03a9|\u2212|F|)\/|\u03a9|, where |U| denotes the size of set U. To reduce the amount of overhead for restrictive reuse, the forbidden sets may be defined to be as small as possible. However, the sizes of the restricted sets are dependent on the sizes of the forbidden sets. Thus, the forbidden sets may be defined based on expected requirements for weak users and possibly other factors.","The usable and forbidden sets may be defined in various manners. In one embodiment, the usable and forbidden sets are defined based on global frequency planning for the system and remain static. Each sector is assigned a usable set and a forbidden set, forms its restricted sets as described above, and thereafter uses the usable and restricted sets. This embodiment simplifies implementation for restrictive reuse since each sector can act autonomously, and no signaling between neighboring sectors is required. In a second embodiment, the usable and forbidden sets may be dynamically defined based on sector loading and possibly other factors. For example, the forbidden set for each sector may be dependent on the number of weak users in neighboring sectors, which may change over time. A designated sector or a system entity (e.g., system controller ) may receive loading information for various sectors, define the usable and forbidden sets, and assign the sets to the sectors. This embodiment may allow for better utilization of system resources based on the distribution of users. In yet another embodiment, the sectors may send inter-sector messages to negotiate the usable and forbidden sets.","Restrictive reuse can support handoff, which refers to the transfer of a user from a current serving base station to another base station that is deemed better. Handoff may be performed as needed to maintain good channel conditions for users on the edge of sector coverage (or \u201csector-edge\u201d users). Some conventional systems (e.g., a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) system) support \u201chard\u201d handoff whereby a user first breaks away from the current serving base station and then switches to a new serving base station. A Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system supports \u201csoft\u201d and \u201csofter\u201d handoffs, which allow a user to simultaneously communicate with multiple cells (for soft handoff) or multiple sectors (for softer handoff). Soft and softer handoffs can provide additional mitigation against fast fading.","Restrictive reuse can reduce interference for sector-edge users, which are good candidates for handoff. Restrictive reuse can also support hard, soft, and softer handoffs. A sector-edge user u in sector x may be allocated subbands in the restricted set U, which is free of interference from neighboring sector y. Sector-edge user u may also communicate with sector y via subbands in the restricted set U, which is free of interference from sector x. Since the restricted sets Uand Uare disjoint, user u may simultaneously communicate with both sectors x and y (and with no interference from strong interferers in both sectors) for soft or softer handoff. User u may also perform hard handoff from sector x to sector y. Since restricted sets Uand Uare absent of strong interferers from sectors y and x, respectively, the received SINR of user u may not change quite as abruptly when user u is handed off from sector x to sector y, which can ensure a smooth handoff.","Power control may or may not be used in combination with restrictive reuse. Power control adjusts the transmit power for a data transmission such that the received SINR for the transmission is maintained at a target SINR, which may in turn be adjusted to achieve a particular level of performance, e.g., 1% packet error rate (PER). Power control may be used to adjust the amount of transmit power used for a given data rate, so that interference is minimized. Power control be used for certain (e.g., fixed rate) transmissions and omitted for other (e.g., variable rate) transmissions. Full transmit power may be used for a variable rate transmission (such as a hybrid automatic retransmission (H-ARQ), which is continual transmission of additional redundancy information for each packet until the packet is decoded correctly) in order to achieve the highest rate possible for a given channel condition.","In the above embodiment for restrictive reuse, each sector is associated with one usable set and one forbidden set. Some other embodiments of restrictive reuse are described below.","In another embodiment of restrictive reuse, each sector x is assigned an unrestricted usable subband set Ux and a \u201climited use\u201d subband set Lx. The unrestricted usable set contains subbands that may be allocated to any users in the sector. The limited use set contains subbands having certain use restrictions such as, e.g., a lower transmit power limit. Sets Ux and Lx may be formed in the manner described above for sets Ux and Fx, respectively.","Each sector x may allocate the subbands in sets Ux and Lx by taking into account the channel conditions for the users so that good performance may be achieved for all users. The subbands in set Ux may be allocated to any user in sector x. Weak users in sector x may be allocated subbands in (1) a restricted set U=U\u2229L, if high interference is observed from neighboring sector y, (2) a restricted set U=U\u2229L, if high interference is observed from neighboring sector z, or (3) a restricted set U=U\u2229L\u2229L, if high interference is observed from neighboring sectors y and z. Strong users in sector x may be allocated subbands in Lx.","A strong user v in sector x has a good signal quality metric for its serving sector x and may be allocated subbands in the limited use set Lx. On the forward link, sector x may transmit at or below the lower power limit for set Lx to strong user v. On the reverse link, strong user v may transmit at or below the lower power limit to serving sector x. Good performance may be achieved for strong user v for both the forward and reverse links, even with the lower transmit power, because of the good signal quality metric achieved by strong user v for sector x.","Strong user v typically has poor signal quality metrics for neighboring sectors. On the forward link, the lower transmit power used by sector x for strong user v causes low (and typically tolerable) levels of interference to users in neighboring sectors. On the reverse link, the lower transmit power used by strong user v plus the lower channel gains for neighboring sectors result in low (and typically tolerable) levels of interference to the users in the neighboring sectors.","In yet another embodiment of restrictive reuse, each reuse set is associated with a sorted list of subband sets that may be used for the reuse set. Due to frequency planning restrictions, the bandwidth of some restricted sets may be quite small, such as restricted set U- which corresponds to reuse set (1, 2, 3). Suppose user u observes high interference from sectors  and  and is assigned to reuse set (1, 2, 3). Although user u will experience higher SINR due to reduced interference, the bandwidth loss resulting from a restriction to a small restricted set U- may be detrimental in terms of the achievable throughput of user u. Hence, for users in reuse set (1, 2, 3), a sorted list of subband sets with descending preference may be defined, e.g., (U-, [U-, U-], U), where the subband sets within the square brackets have equal preference. The users in reuse set (1, 2, 3) may then use larger bandwidth, if necessary, by using additional subband sets in the sorted list associated with reuse set (1, 2, 3). For users in reuse set (1, 2), the sorted list may be (U-, U, U-, U-). For users in reuse set (1), the sorted list may be (U, [U-, U-], U-). The sorted list for each reuse set may be defined to (1) reduce the amount of interference observed by the users in the reuse set and\/or (2) reduce the amount of interference caused by the users in the reuse set.","In still yet another embodiment of restrictive reuse, each sector x is assigned multiple (M) usable sets and multiple (e.g., M) forbidden sets. The number of usable sets may or may not be equal to the number of forbidden sets. As an example, multiple (M) pairs of usable and forbidden sets may be formed, with the usable set Ux and the forbidden set Fx in each pair being formed such that each of the N total subbands is included in only set Ux or set Fx, e.g., \u03a9=U\u2229F, where \u201c\u2229\u201d denotes a union set operation. However, in general, the M usable sets and M forbidden sets may be formed in various manners.","For example, the M usable sets may be formed such that they are successively smaller subsets of the largest usable set. Each sector may then use the smallest possible usable set based on its loading. This may reduce the total interference to neighboring sectors when the sector is partially loaded. This may also increase the variation in the interference observed by neighboring sectors, which may be exploited to improve overall system performance.","The M forbidden sets may be formed such that they are non-overlapping. The number of weaker users in each sector and their data requirements are typically not known a priori. Each sector may utilize as many forbidden sets for neighboring sectors as required to support its weak users. For example, sector x may utilize subbands in more forbidden sets for sector y to provide higher data rates to one or more weak users in sector x observing high interference from sector y, or to support more of these weak users. The sectors may coordinate usage of the forbidden sets.","In general, each sector may be assigned any number of unrestricted usable subband sets and any number of \u201cconstrained\u201d subband sets. A constrained subband set may be a forbidden subband set or a limited use subband set. As an example, a sector may be assigned multiple constrained subband sets. One constrained subband set may be a forbidden subband set, and the remaining constrained subband set(s) may have different transmit power limits and may be allocated to different tiers of strong users. As another example, a sector may be assigned multiple constrained subband sets, where each constrained subband set may have a different transmit power limit (i.e., no forbidden set). The use of multiple usable and\/or constrained sets for each sector may allow for better matching of subbands to weak users in different sectors.","For clarity, restrictive reuse has been specifically described for a system with 3-sector cells. In general, restrictive reuse may be used with any reuse pattern. For a K-sector\/cell reuse pattern, the forbidden set for each sector\/cell may be defined such that it overlaps with the forbidden set for each of the other K\u22121 sectors\/cells, and may overlap with different combinations of other forbidden sets. Each sector\/cell may form different restricted sets for different neighboring sectors based on its usable set and the forbidden sets for the neighboring sectors. Each sector\/cell may then use the usable and restricted sets as described above.","Restrictive reuse has also been described for an OFDMA system. Restrictive reuse may also be used for a TDMA system, a Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) system, a CDMA system, a multi-carrier CDMA system, an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) system, and so on. A TDMA system uses time division multiplexing (TDM), and transmissions for different users are orthogonalized by transmitting in different time intervals. An FDMA system uses frequency division multiplexing (FDM), and transmissions for different users are orthogonalized by transmitting in different frequency channels or subbands. In general, the system resources to be reused (e.g., frequency subbands\/channels, time slots, and so on) may be partitioned into usable and forbidden sets. The forbidden sets for neighboring sectors\/cells overlap one another, as described above. Each sector may form restricted sets based on its usable set and the forbidden sets for neighboring sectors\/cells, as described above.","Restrictive reuse may be used for a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) system. A GSM system may operate in one or more frequency bands. Each frequency band covers a specific range of frequencies and is divided into a number of 200 kHz radio frequency (RF) channels. Each RF channel is identified by a specific ARFCN (absolute radio frequency channel number). For example, the GSM 900 frequency band covers ARFCNs 1 through 124, the GSM 1800 frequency band covers ARFCNs 512 through 885, and the GSM 1900 frequency band covers ARFCNs 512 through 810. Conventionally, each GSM cell is assigned a set of RF channels and only transmits on the assigned RF channels. To reduce inter-cell interference, GSM cells located near each other are normally assigned different sets of RF channels such that the transmissions for neighboring cells do not interfere with one another. GSM typically employs a reuse factor greater than one (e.g., K=7).","Restrictive reuse may be used to improve efficiency and reduce inter-sector interference for a GSM system. The available RF channels for the GSM system may be used to form K pairs of usable and forbidden sets (e.g., K=7), and each GSM cell may be assigned one of the K set pairs. Each GSM cell may then allocate RF channels in its usable set to users in the cell and RF channels in its restricted sets to weak users. Restrictive reuse allows each GSM cell to use a larger percentage of the available RF channels, and a reuse factor closer to one may be achieved.","Restrictive reuse may also be used for a multi-carrier communication system that utilizes multiple \u201ccarriers\u201d for data transmission. Each carrier is a sinusoidal signal that may be independently modulated with data and is associated with a particular bandwidth. One such system is a multi-carrier IS-856 system (also called 3x-DO (data-only)) that has multiple 1.23 MHz carriers. Each sector\/cell in the system may be allowed to use all carriers or only a subset of the carriers. A sector\/cell may be forbidden to use a given carrier to avoid causing interference on the carrier, which may allow other sectors\/cells using this carrier to observe less (or no) interference, achieve higher SINR, and attain better performance. Alternatively, a sector\/cell may be constrained to use a lower transmit power limit on a given carrier to reduce interference on the carrier. For each sector, the constrained (forbidden or limited use) carrier(s) may be statically or dynamically assigned.","Each sector may assign its users to its usable carrier(s). Each sector may also assign each user to a carrier in a manner to avoid strong interferers\/ees for the user. For example, if multiple usable carriers are available, then a user may be assigned one of the carriers having less interference for the user (e.g., a carrier not used by a strong interferer to the user).","The processing for data transmission and reception with restrictive reuse is dependent on system design. For clarity, exemplary transmitting and receiving entities in a frequency hopping OFDMA system for the restrictive reuse embodiment with a pair of usable and forbidden subband sets for each sector are described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0121"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["110","110","914","912","916","940","940","916","916"],"i":["x","x"]},"An OFDM modulator  receives N transmit symbols for each OFDM symbol period and generates a corresponding OFDM symbol. OFDM modulator  typically includes an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) unit and a cyclic prefix generator. For each OFDM symbol period, the IFFT unit transforms the N transmit symbols to the time domain using an N-point inverse FFT to obtain a \u201ctransformed\u201d symbol that contains N time-domain chips. Each chip is a complex value to be transmitted in one chip period. The cyclic prefix generator then repeats a portion of each transformed symbol to form an OFDM symbol that contains N+C chips, where C is the number of chips being repeated. The repeated portion is often called a cyclic prefix and is used to combat inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by frequency selective fading. An OFDM symbol period corresponds to the duration of one OFDM symbol, which is N+C chip periods. OFDM modulator  provides a stream of OFDM symbols. A transmitter unit (TMTR)  processes (e.g., converts to analog, filters, amplifies, and frequency upconverts) the OFDM symbol stream to generate a modulated signal, which is transmitted from an antenna .","Controller  directs the operation at transmitting entity .

Each sector then provides each user with its assigned traffic channel, e.g., via over-the-air signaling. The transmitting and receiving entities for each user then perform the appropriate processing to transmit and receive data on the subbands indicated by the assigned traffic channel.","The restrictive reuse techniques described herein may be implemented by various means. For example, these techniques may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof. For a hardware implementation, the processing units used to identify strong interferers\/ees, determine restricted sets, allocate subbands, process data for transmission or reception, and perform other functions related to restrictive reuse may be implemented within one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), digital signal processors (DSPs), digital signal processing devices (DSPDs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), processors, controllers, micro-controllers, microprocessors, other electronic units designed to perform the functions described herein, or a combination thereof.","For a software implementation, the restrictive reuse techniques may be implemented with modules (e.g., procedures, functions, and so on) that perform the functions described herein.

The memory unit may be implemented within the processor or external to the processor.","Feedback","In an embodiment, the scheduler in the base station needs CQI information from the terminal, for all re-use sets about every 5 msec, to decide on which re-use set to schedule a given terminal. This is a lot of feedback. To minimize this feedback, in the current design, the terminal feeds back a (slow) connection layer message to base station, indicating the VCQI (average CQI) for all re-use sets, once every few 100 msec. The base station then calculates the CQI for all reuse sets on a packet by packet basis, and dynamically schedules the terminal in an appropriate re-use set.","A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system utilizes multiple antennas for both transmitting and receiving. An advantage of a MIMO system over a single-input single-output (SISO) system is that a MIMO system produces a \u201crich\u201d multipath because the MIMO system has M antennas at the transmitter and M antennas at the receiver.","For MIMO users, the problem is that the CQI cannot be reconstructed for all re-use sets, using the current design. Solution: (1) For Multiple Code Word MIMO users, we propose a MIMO VCQI connection layer message that will enable the base station to reconstruct the MIMO-CQI for all reuse sets on a packet-by-packet basis. This will enable dynamic scheduling (restrictive reuse) gains. (2) For Single Code Word users, dynamic RESTRICTIVE REUSE can be obtained by changing the CQI reporting format, and also sending a MIMO-VCQI connection layer message. (3) For Single Code Word design, quasi-static scheduling gains can be obtained by sending a MIMO-VCQI connection layer message .","The CQI Value is a computed CQI value corresponding to a target sector. The number of bits is based on a CQI reporting mode and the active set size. If the active set size is 1 and the CQI reporting mode is SISO then the CQI Value is 4 bits. If the active set size is more than 1 and the CQI reporting mode is SISO the CQI Value is 3 bits. If the active set size is 1 and the CQI reporting mode is MCW-MIMO then the CQI Value is 8 bits. If the active set size is greater than 1 and the CQI reporting mode is MCW-MIMO then the CQI Value is 6 bits.","In a current design, a SISO terminal feeds-back the CQI information for a non-restrictive re-use set (111) every 5 msec. The terminal also sends a low-bandwidth VCQI (average CQI) connection layer message for all re-use sets about every few 100 msec. The base station can use this information to calculate the CQI for all reuse sets on a packet-by-packet basis and dynamically schedule users in different re-use sets to obtain RESTRICTIVE REUSE gains.","The question is whether such a scheme can also support MIMO users? If not, what can be done to enable dynamic scheduling (RESTRICTIVE REUSE gains) for MIMO users? For MIMO users, the current VCQI feedback scheme is not sufficient to obtain RESTRICTIVE REUSE gains for MIMO users.","For MIMO-Multiple-Code-Word (MIMO-MCW) users, dynamic RESTRICTIVE REUSE gains are feasible if a MIMO-VCQI connection layer message containing the VCQI for all layers and re-use sets are sent from the terminal to a base station.","For MIMO-Single-Code-Word (MIMO-SCW) users, dynamic RESTRICTIVE REUSE gains are feasible if (a) CQI feedback format is changed from a (6-bit CQI+2 bit-rank) to a (4-bit CQI for each possible rank) and (b) MIMO-VCQI connection layer message containing the VCQI for all ranks and re-use sets are sent from the terminal to a base station. The CQI format change leads to a performance loss for the (111) re-use set users, and traded-off with the RESTRICTIVE REUSE gains for (non-111) re-use set users.","For MIMO-SCW users, (quasi-static)

Furthermore, the CQI quantization required is 0.5 dB for SCW since we have 32 PFs.

Since we only have a 4-bit CQI and not a 6-bit CQI, the drawback is that there is (a) a potential 1.5 dB performance penalty for the users remaining in the (111) re-use set due to coarse CQI feedback (4 bits instead of 6 bits), and (b) Low Doppler tolerance since CQI feedback now spans 10 msec instead of 5 msec. On the flip-side, the benefit is that rank & rate prediction can now operate at the transmitter and incorporate any power control changes.","Conclusion #2: Dynamic RESTRICTIVE REUSE gains for SCW is possible with a MIMO-VCQI reporting and a 4-bit CQI reporting for all ranks. The drawback is that the coarse quantization due to a 4-bit CQI reporting leads to performance loss for (111) re-use set users.
