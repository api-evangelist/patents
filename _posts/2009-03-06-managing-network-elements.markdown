{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Example Use Case","Configuration of Home eNodeB"],"p":["The present invention relates to telecommunications network in general, and in particular, to implementing functions required for managing network elements operating in said network.","The concept of Self Organising Networks (SON) is driven in the telecommunications industry by network operators as a way of reducing cost of operating the networks. This will be especially important with the introduction of home base stations also known as home eNodeBs, which will be part of the telecommunications network run by the network operator, but installed at homes of the end users. This makes the task of managing the network a big challenge due to the number of the home base stations and the fact that they will be supplied by different vendors. A self organising network may provide mechanisms for self-configuration and self-discovery that enable network devices (managed elements) of the SON to be transparent to ordinary users (e.g. the home eNodeB installed in the home of an individual user). SON networks also ensure robustness of the network during dynamic changes of network topology and link breakages. Operational and maintenance (OAM) architecture of a self organising network includes a domain manager (DM) and its managed elements (ME), an enterprise management system (EMS) and other elements of the network.","The present solutions defined in 3GPP standards require heavy involvement of the Network Management System (NMS) that needs very detailed knowledge of static Network Resource Models (NRM), interactions and semantics of the internal and external relationships between these models. This known approach is difficult to scale, or at least scaling it up by adding potentially millions of home eNodeBs will make the management layer thicker and more distributed. All that will additionally cause substantial increase of OAM traffic going up and down the hierarchy of the network.","According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for use in management of network elements in a communications network performed by a network element of said network. The method comprises receiving by an agent operating in said network element a request to execute a first function, wherein said first function relates to management of at least one network element; sending to said first function a message corresponding to said request and executing said first function. Said request being from a predefined set of requests and said first function being from a predefined set of functions. Said first function is implemented in a network element where it is to be executed.","According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a network element for use in a communications network comprising an agent servicing an interface for communicating with other network elements and a first function related to management of at least one network element, wherein said first function being from a predefined set of functions. Said agent is adapted to receive a request to execute said first function. Said request is from a predefined set of requests. Said agent is further adapted to send to said first function a message corresponding to said request, wherein said message triggers execution of said first function in said network element.","According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a communications network comprising a plurality of network elements. At least one of said network elements comprises an agent servicing an interface for communicating with other network elements and a first function related to management of at least one network element. Said first function is from a predefined set of functions. Said agent is adapted to receive a request to execute said first function. Said request is from a predefined set of requests. Said agent is further adapted to send to said first function a message corresponding to said request, wherein said message triggers execution of said first function in said network element","Further features of the present invention are as claimed in the dependent claims.","In the present invention SON functions are implemented at the appropriate level of abstraction in the network and the network management layer need not have a very fine-grained knowledge of the NRM models, their interactions and semantics. An additional advantage is that the solution according to the present invention scales well when it is implemented in the communications network. Because the implementation of SON functions can be deployed close to, or even on, the managed element affected by the function, bandwidth use for exchange OAM traffic is significantly reduced. It is also important that by distributing the implementations of the SON functions close to the network elements that are affected by these functions, processing and storage is distributed and not located in one NMS system. Because it is also possible to have peer-to-peer co-operation between Domain Managers and even between managed elements in the implementation of the SON function the design choices for the implementers are improved.","The present invention is well aligned with the concept where networks are autonomously managed without the need for detailed interference by a NMS.","The term network element used herein refers to an entity that is part of a communications network and from the perspective of OAM architecture includes for example: domain manager (DM), managed element, Network Management System.","With reference to  and  one embodiment of a method used in management of network elements in a communications network  is presented. The steps of the method in a simplest embodiment are performed by a domain manager  operating in the communications network . In alternative embodiments the steps can also be carried out by other types of network elements.","The first step of the method comprises receiving  by an agent  operating in said domain manager  a request to execute a first function  implemented in this domain manager . The agent  is servicing an interface  and via said interface the requests are received. The first function  relates to management of at least one network element. The request received by the domain manager is one from a predefined set of requests. By using a predefined set of requests it is possible to implement the method in a network with equipment supplied by different vendors. For the same reason said first function  is also one of functions from a predefined set of functions related to management of network elements, also referred to as a SON function. The first function  is implemented in the domain manager  and if invoked it is to be executed in said domain manager . The implementation of the SON function or functions in the element where the function is to be executed simplifies the process of managing this element of the network because all the information necessary for executing this function is readily available and does not have to be transmitted from the network element to other parts of the network. Once the request is received by the agent  in the next step the agent sends  a message that corresponds to the received request to said first function  and upon reception of the message said first function is executed .","In one embodiment the agent  and the SON function  invoked by said agent are implemented in the same network element\u2014e.g. domain manager  as illustrated in  or agent  and SON function  shown in . In other embodiment is also possible that the SON function and the agent invoking it are implemented in two different devices. This embodiment is shown in , where the agent  implemented in domain manager  can invoke a SON function  or  implemented in a separate managed element .","The inventors introduced a new Interface IRP (Integration Reference Point), called SON Functional IRP (SON-F IRP), into the 3GPP Integration Reference Point framework so that EMS and other users can call the SON functions in the managed network. The embodiments introduce references into 3GPP NRM models that allow managed objects to reference the SON functions that affect them.","The embodiments of the method disclosed allow for implementation of SON functions at the level appropriate for these functions in the self organising network. This method extends the 3GPP approach to management in a backwardly compatible manner and  shows how the method relates to the 3GPP Management Reference Model.","The SON-F IRP is a functional API (Application Programming Interface) that allows a client to invoke a subset of the SON functions listed in Table 1 below. The list presented in Table 1 is not exhaustive and other SON functions could be specified as standard or as vendor-specific extensions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Self-Configuration Use Cases"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","Planning of eNB location, capacity and coverage"]},{"entry":["2","Planning radio parameters of a new eNB"]},{"entry":["3","Planning transport parameters of a new eNB"]},{"entry":["4","Planning data alignment for all neighbour nodes"]},{"entry":["5","HW installation of eNB"]},{"entry":["6","Transmission setup"]},{"entry":["7","Node authentication"]},{"entry":["8","Setup of secure tunnel to O&M and access gateways"]},{"entry":["9","Automatic Inventory"]},{"entry":["10","Automatic SW Download to eNB"]},{"entry":["11","Self test"]},{"entry":["12","Configuration of Home eNB"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Self-Optimisation Use Cases"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","Overall optimisation requirements: Support of"]},{"entry":[{},"centralized optimisation entity"]},{"entry":["2","Neighbour Cell List Optimisation"]},{"entry":["3","Interference Control"]},{"entry":["4","Handover Parameter Optimisation"]},{"entry":["5","QoS related parameter Optimisation"]},{"entry":["6","Load Balancing"]},{"entry":["7","Optimisation of Home eNB"]},{"entry":["8","RACH Load Optimisation"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Fault Management and Fault Correction Use Cases"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","Information Correlation"]},{"entry":["2","Cell\/service outage detection & compensation"]},{"entry":["3","Mitigation of unit outage"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"OAM related SON Use Cases"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","Hardware\/Capacity extensions"]},{"entry":["2","Automated NEM upgrade"]},{"entry":["3","Compensation for Outage of higher level network elements"]},{"entry":["4","Fast recovery of unstable NEM system"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"SON Enabling Use Cases"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","Performance Management in real time"]},{"entry":["2","Direct KPI reporting in real time"]},{"entry":["3","Subscriber and equipment trace"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Returning to , the IRP may be used on the northbound interface (Itf-N)  in a north-south manner by an EMS or by an NMS towards a domain manager, DM or a managed element. It may also be used in an east-west manner on the Itf-P2P and so that domain managers can access SON functions in other domain managers. The SON-F IRP or vendor-specific subsets of it may be used between domain managers and managed elements, interface , and even between managed elements, interface .","As illustrated in  SON functions - are implemented in domain managers  and managed elements , . In the case where a domain manager or a managed element supports the SON-F IRP, the SON implementation in that domain manager or managed element is a full implementation of a subset of the SON functions implemented in the network. The element  in  in most situations in this description is referred to as a domain manager, but it is important to note that the full implementation of a subset of the SON functions (i.e. with SON-F IRP agent and register) is also possible in a managed element. In the case of a managed element, that supports SON functions via a domain manager, it may support a vendor-specific implementation of the SON functions with its domain manager providing the complete implementation of the IRP.","SON-F IRP","In order to implement the SON-F IRP  as a functional API (Application Programming Interface) an agent  handling the traffic on the SON-F IRP  interface is installed in a domain manager  as illustrated in . As discussed earlier, in an alternative embodiment, the element  in  can be a managed element with a full implementation of a subset of SON functions. The SON-F IRP supports a number of method calls. In one embodiment the method calls include, although this is not an exhaustive list:\n\n","In one embodiment the SON-F IRP  uses the notification IRP as defined in 3GPP TS 32.302 V7.0.0 to inform users of changes to its list of supported SON functions. In one embodiment the users can register for the SupportedSONFunctionsModified notification on the Notification IRP towards the domain manager in question. When the list of supported SON functions changes, the notification is sent to all registered users.","In accordance with 3GPP management practice for IRPs, the SON-F IRP may be implemented using any technology. In one embodiment of the present invention a Web Services interface (as specified in Web Services Architecture, W3C Working Group Note 11 Feb. 2004) can be used with the SON-F IRP specified in Web Services Description Language.","Additions to NRM IRPs","The SON functions affect Managed Objects (MO) in a NRM (Network Resource Model) . An optional attribute is introduced in Managed Objects and this attribute lists the SON functions that affect that particular MO. A Managed Object is a representation of an entity that is managed in the network. This entity could be an entire network, a network element, a cell, a link, a board, or even a single parameter like the speed of a connection. A Managed Element is a physical device that has a management interface. An example of a Managed Element is a router, switch, base station etc. In fact, a Managed Element appears as a Managed Object called \u201cManagedElement\u201d in a NRM . All the information that is being managed is modelled as a Network Resource Model . The NRM  is an object oriented hierarchy made up of Managed Objects. When a SON function is executed, it will affect the NRM in some way: MOs may be added or deleted, and attributes in MOs may change . In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, in the case of changes to the NRM , all MOs in the NRM  that are changed  by the SON function are tagged  with the SON function and transaction ID that changed them.","SON Functional Reference Implementation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["404","406","408","410","402","450","412","414","422","404","406","408","404","406","408"]},"The domain manager , and in alternative embodiments also other network elements, comprise a register  used for recording information about the SON functions ,  implemented in said domain manager .

In such an implementation, the SON bus  handles SON function implementations -, , , and , registrations and delegations between co-operating domain managers ,  over the Itf-P2P interface.","One practical realization of the reference implementation is to describe each SON functional implementation in WSDL, with each implementation published as a web service. The SON bus  is in a preferred embodiment realized as an ESB (Enterprise Service Bus).","With reference to  and  and the following description it is explained how a home eNodeB is configured using embodiment of the present invention.","There are four steps in the Configuration of Home eNodeB use case as specified in NGMN Recommendation on SON & OAM (A Requirement Specification by Next Generation Mobile Networks Alliance). They are:\n\n","In step 1, as illustrated in , after switching on, the home eNodeB  connects to a DHCP sever  and obtains its IP address, relevant DHCP options and establishes connection to IP broadband network. In an embodiment alternative to using DHCP the home eNodeB could also be statically configured with it's network information or the user could enter the information on a local craft terminal. In step 2 of the process the home eNodeB  informs its operator's enterprise system  that said eNodeB exists and has been switched on. Once the EMS  knows the home eNodeB  exists, the home eNodeB  can be configured, steps 3 and 4 in the process above, and brought into service.","One example of implementation of steps 3 and 4 in the process above using embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in :\n\n","The SON-F IRP can be implemented in one embodiment on the SON Bus and in an alternative embodiment on the Itf-P2P interface. The SON Bus and the Itf-P2P are functionally equivalent, but their implementation is different.","The SON bus covers the case of a single distributed SON-F System implemented using an application server such as for example WebSphere, WebLogic, or jBoss. The SON bus runs over the Enterprise Service Bus in such a system. Therefore, the SON bus is distributed but is also internal to such a SON-F system and practically would be owned by a single organization. In such a setup there would probably be only one SON-F IRP agent working northbound.","The Itf-P2P case covers the inter-system case where two or more such SON-F Systems interact. In such a case, two or more SON-F IRP agents co-ordinates their activities so there is exchange of SON-F IRP messages on this interface. In other words, the SON-F IRP agents in each system use \u201cgetSupportedSONFunctions( )\u201d to find out what the other can do, and then can call SON Functions on each other's systems.","Domain manager  in  is one embodiment of the network element in accordance with the present invention. The domain manager  operating in a communications network  comprises a SON-F IRP agent  that supports an interface (SON-F IRP)  for communicating with other network elements, including NMS and EMS. The domain manager  also has a first function  related to management of at least one network element and in the embodiment illustrated in  it is \u201cConfiguration of Home eNodeB\u201d function. Said first function is one of a predefined set of functions (e.g. listed in Table 1). When said SON-F IRP agent  receives a request to execute said \u201cConfiguration of Home eNodeB\u201d function  it sends to said function  a message that corresponds to said request received over the SON-F IRP. In order to maintain interoperability between devices of different vendors the request received is also from a set of predefined requests. The message sent by the agent , when received by said function  triggers execution of the \u201cConfiguration of Home eNodeB\u201d function  in said network element .","One embodiment of a network  in accordance with the present invention is illustrated in . The communications network  comprises a plurality of network elements - wherein at least one of said network elements  comprises a SON-F IRP agent  supporting an interface  for communicating with other network elements. Said network element also comprises an implementation of a first function  that relates to management of at least one network element. When the SON-F IRP agent receives over said interface a request to execute \u201cConfiguration of Home eNodeB\u201d function  (i.e. said first function) it sends to the \u201cConfiguration of Home eNodeB\u201d function a message corresponding to said request. When the message is received by said function it triggers execution of \u201cConfiguration of Home eNodeB\u201d function in said network element. What is important in embodiments of the present invention is that the function related to management of network element is implemented very close to said network element that is affected by its execution. The function is executed in the network element where it is implemented, but it may also invoke other functions related to management of network elements implemented in the same network element, like for example \u201cAutomatic SW Download\u201d to eNodeB function  implemented in said network element  (domain controller). It may also invoke function implemented in another network element, like for example \u201cNode Authentication\u201d function  in Home eNodeB .","As mentioned earlier in order maintain interoperability between devices of different vendors the request received is from a set of predefined requests and also the functions related to management of network elements are from a predefined set of functions.","Further details of operations of the network element  and the network  were described in detail in the paragraphs related to various embodiments of the method of the present invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention will be understood and appreciated more fully from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
