title: Facilitating group access control to data objects in peer-to-peer overlay networks
abstract: Methods and apparatuses are provided for facilitating group access controls in peer-to-peer or other similar overlay networks. A group administrator may create a group in the overlay network and may assign peer-specific certificates to each member of the group for indicating membership in the group. A group member peer node can access data objects in the overlay network using its respective peer-specific certificate to authenticate itself as a group member. The authentication is performed by another peer node in the network. The validating peer node can authenticate that the group member is the rightful possessor of the peer-specific certificate using a public key associated with the peer node to which the peer-specific certificate was issued. The validating peer node can also validate that the peer-specific certificate was properly issued to the group member using a public key of the apparatus that issued the peer-specific certificate.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field","Various features disclosed herein pertain generally to peer-to-peer overlay networks, and at least some features pertain to devices and methods for facilitating group access control to data objects in peer-to-peer overlay networks.","2. Background","Peer-to-peer (or p2p) and other similar overlay networks include a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Such peer-to-peer overlay networks can be built on top of an underlying network, such as a network utilizing the Internet Protocol (IP).","Typically, peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application, and are typically said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes. The various peer nodes cooperate with each other both to provide services and to maintain the network. Peer nodes typically make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts. Generally speaking, the peer nodes are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional client-server model where only servers supply, and clients consume.","Peer-to-peer and similar overlay networks can be employed in many environments for low-cost scalability and easy deployment of applications. Typically, such networks are relatively open, allowing devices (i.e., nodes) to join and leave at will. In some implementations of such a network, a user's data can be stored in a distributed fashion on a remote node in the network, which might be known or unknown to the user. As a result some users may not have full confidence in the overlay's data storage capability unless there are assurances that the user's data will not be accessed (e.g., read and\/or modified) in unauthorized fashion. The data owner may, therefore, be able to specify access controls defining who can access the stored data objects.","Conventionally, each data object stored in a peer-to-peer overlay network has a respective access control list indicating the access control policy for that particular data object. For example, the respective access control list may indicate which users or groups of users have a specified type of access to the data object. However, providing efficient group-based access control can be challenging in a peer-to-peer overlay network in which there may or may not be any central authority to enforce access control based on group membership. For example, without a central authority, it may be difficult to authenticate peer nodes as valid group members. Therefore, there is a need for systems, devices and\/or methods for managing and authenticating group membership among peer nodes in a peer-to-peer overlay network.","Various features provide peer nodes for facilitating group-based access control in a peer-to-peer overlay network. One or more features provide group administrator peer nodes, which may include a communications interface and a storage medium, each coupled to a processing circuit. The communications interface may be adapted to facilitate communications on a peer-to-peer overlay network. The storage medium may include a private and public key pair associated with the group administrator peer node.","According to various implementations, the processing circuit may be adapted to create a peer group, which defines one or more peer nodes as members of the group. The processing circuit may further assign a peer-specific certificate to a group member peer node that is a member of the group, the peer-specific certificate adapted to authenticate membership in the group to other peer nodes in the peer-to-peer overlay network and including a group identity, an identity of the group member peer node, an identity of an issuing apparatus and a signature by a private key of the issuing apparatus over one or more components of the peer-specific certificate.","Methods operational in a group administrator peer node are also provided. According to one or more implementations of such methods, a public and private key pair associated with the group administrator peer node may be obtained. A peer group may be created in a peer-to-peer overlay network, where the group defines one or more peer nodes that are members of the group. A peer-specific certificate may be assigned to a group member peer node that is a member of the group, where the peer-specific certificate is adapted to authenticate membership in the group to other peer nodes in the peer-to-peer overlay network. The peer-specific certificate may include a group identity, an identity of the group member peer node, an identity of an issuing apparatus and a signature by a private key of the issuing apparatus over one or more components of the peer-specific certificate.","At least one other feature provides group member peer nodes, which may include a communications interface and a storage medium, each coupled to a processing circuit. The communications interface may be adapted to facilitate communication on a peer-to-peer overlay network. The storage medium may include a private key and a public key pair associated with the group member peer node.","According to various implementations, the processing circuit may be adapted to receive a peer-specific group certificate via the communications interface. The peer-specific group certificate may be issued to the group member peer node from a group administrator peer node, and may include a group identity, an identity of the group member peer node, an identity of the group administrator peer node and a signature by a private key of the group administrator peer node over one or more components of the peer-specific group certificate. The processing circuit may further send the peer-specific group certificate to a validating peer node via the communications interface. The processing circuit may also send authentication data to the validating peer node via the communications interface. The authentication data may be signed using the private key associated with the group member peer node.","Methods operational in a group member peer node are also provided. According to one or more implementations of such methods, a public and private key pair associated with the group member peer node may be obtained. A peer-specific group certificate issued to the group member peer node from a group administrator peer node may be received. The peer-specific group certificate may include a group identity, an identity of the group member peer node, an identity of the group administrator peer node and a signature by a private key of the group administrator peer node over one or more components of the peer-specific group certificate. The peer-specific group certificate may be sent to a validating peer node to authenticate the group member peer node as a group member, where the peer-specific group certificate is adapted to be authenticated by the validating peer node. Authentication data may also be sent to the validating peer node, where the authentication data is signed using the private key associated with the group member peer node.","Additional features provide validating peer nodes, which may comprise a communications interface adapted to facilitate communication on a peer-to-peer overlay network, and a processing circuit coupled to the communications interface. According to various implementations, the processing circuit may be adapted to receive via the communications interface a peer-specific group certificate from a group member peer node seeking authentication as a member of a group. The peer-specific group certificate may include a group identity, an identity of the group member peer node, an identity of a group administrator peer node and a signature by a private key of the group administrator peer node over one or more components of the peer-specific group certificate. The processing circuit may obtain a group token from the peer-to-peer overlay network. The group token may include a signature by the private key of the group administrator peer node, and may be stored in the peer-to-peer overlay network as a data object identified by the group identity. The processing circuit may verify the signature of the group token using the public key of the group administrator peer node to validate that the group administrator peer node was authorized to issue the peer-specific group certificate, and may verify the peer-specific group certificate using a public key associated with the group administrator peer node.","Methods operational in a validating peer node are also provided. According to one or more implementations of such methods, a peer-specific group certificate may be received from a group member peer node seeking authentication as a member of a group. The peer-specific group certificate may include a group identity, an identity of the group member peer node, an identity of a group administrator peer node and a signature by a private key of the group administrator peer node over one or more components of the peer-specific group certificate. A group token may be obtained from the peer-to-peer overlay network. The group token may include a signature by the private key of the group administrator peer node, and may be stored in the peer-to-peer overlay network as a data object identified by the group identity. The signature of the group token may be verified using the public key of the group administrator peer node to validate that the group administrator peer node was authorized to issue the peer-specific group certificate, and the peer-specific group certificate may be verified using a public key associated with the group administrator peer node.","In the following description, specific details are given to provide a thorough understanding of the described implementations. However, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that various implementations may be practiced without these specific details. For example, circuits may be shown in block diagrams in order not to obscure the implementations in unnecessary detail. In other instances, well-known circuits, structures and techniques may be shown in detail in order not to obscure the described implementations.","The word \u201cexemplary\u201d is used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any implementation or embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments or implementations. Likewise, the term \u201cembodiments\u201d does not require that all embodiments include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation. The terms \u201cpeer-to-peer overlay network\u201d and \u201cpeer node\u201d as used herein are meant to be interpreted broadly. For example, a \u201cpeer-to-peer overlay network\u201d may refer to an overlay network that is not centrally coordinated by servers or stable hosts and that includes a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Furthermore, a \u201cpeer node\u201d may refer to a device that facilitates communication on a peer-to-peer overlay network. Examples of \u201cpeer nodes\u201d may include printers, tablet computers, televisions, mobile phones, personal digital assistants, personal media players, laptop computers, notebook computers, desktop computers, etc.","Overview","One feature facilitates group access controls within a peer-to-peer overlay network. A group can be formed by a user in a peer-to-peer overlay network. The group is given a group name by which it is identified in the peer-to-peer overlay network and which may be unique from other groups and\/or data objects in the peer-to-peer overlay network. A group administrator, which may be the peer node or user who created the group, can manage the group's membership. The group administrator may assign a peer-specific certificate to each group member. In some implementations, the group administrator can assign the peer-specific certificates by issuing the certificate itself. In other implementations, the group administrator can request a trusted authority to issue the peer-specific certificate for each group member.","According to a feature, each group member with a peer-specific certificate can use the certificate to authenticate itself as a valid member of the group. Such authentication procedures can be distributed among peer nodes in the overlay network. For instance, a validating peer node can receive the peer-specific certificate from a group member and can validate the group member to authenticate that the group member is the rightful possessor of the certificate. The validating peer node uses a public key of the node to which the certificate was issued, which public key is either included in the certificate or can be located from an identity of the peer node associated with the public key included in the certificate, to validate the group member. In addition, the validating peer node can also validate the certificate itself using a public key of the apparatus that issued the certificate to authenticate that the peer-specific group certificate was properly issued.","Exemplary Network Environments",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","102","104","104","102"]},"Peer nodes A-F can include any device adapted to communicate via the peer-to-peer overlay network . Such devices may include a middleware layer adapted to facilitate communications via the peer-to-peer overlay network . By way of example and not limitation, peer nodes A-F can include devices such as printers, tablet computers, televisions, mobile phones, personal digital assistants, personal media players, laptop and notebook computers and\/or desktop computers, as well as other devices.","According to one or more implementations described herein, each peer node A-F is provided with a private key and public key pair. The private key is kept secret by the respective peer node A-F, and only known to itself. The public key can be distributed to other peer nodes. Each peer node A-F further obtains a node certificate from a trusted authority (e.g., an Enrollment Server). Each node certificate can include the respective peer node's identity and\/or a user identity, the peer node's public key, the identity of the trusted authority issuing the node certificate, and a signature by the trusted authority. The trusted authority's public key can be distributed to each of the peer nodes A-F for verification of the certificate signed by the trusted authority.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["202","104","104","104","104","102","204","202","202","206"]},"The peer node  may send a transmission  to the trusted authority  requesting a node certificate. The transmission may include the peer node's public key (PbK-Peer) if the peer node  was previously provided with the public key (PbK-Peer). Upon receipt of the request, the trusted authority  generates a peer identity (Peer ID) . As used herein, a peer identity can comprise an identity of a peer device and\/or an identity of a user of the peer device. The trusted authority  can then generate a node certificate (Node Cert)  for the peer node , and sends  the node certificate to the peer node . The node certificate includes the peer identity (Peer ID) for the peer node , the peer node's public key (PbK-Peer), the trusted authority's identity (TA-ID) and a signature by the private key of the trusted authority (Sig). According to various implementations, the signature by the private key of the trusted authority (Sig) can comprise a signature of the entire node certificate (as shown), or of one or more of the individual data pieces (or components) included in the node certificate. The public key (PbK-TA) for the trusted authority  can be distributed to each peer node on the peer-to-peer overlay network for verification of node certificates.","The node certificate can accordingly be employed in authenticating the peer node . For example, a validating peer node can receive the node certificate from the peer node . Using the public key (PbK-Peer) of the peer node  included in the certificate, the validating peer node can perform a challenge response to verify that the peer node  is the true owner of the node certificate. Additionally, the validating peer node can use the identity of trusted authority (TA-ID) to retrieve the trusted authority's  public key. Using the trusted authority's  public key, the validating peer node can also validate the signature (Sig) of the node certificate, which indicates that the node certificate was issued by the trusted authority .","Referring again to , each of the peer nodes A-F are able to communicate with other peer nodes A-F via the peer-to-peer overlay network , without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts. For example, each of the peer nodes A-F can make a portion of their resources (e.g., processing power, disk storage, network bandwidth) available to another peer node, and can utilize a portion of another peer node's resources without a server or stable host for central coordination. In at least some implementations, at least some of the peer nodes A-F may store a data object in the peer-to-peer overlay network . When a data object is stored in the peer-to-peer overlay network , an identifier associated with the data object is employed to locate the data object within the peer-to-peer overlay network when access to the data object is desired. The data object is then stored within the peer-to-peer overlay network  by storing the data object at one of the other peer nodes A-F.","The owner of a data object can specify access controls for the data object that is stored in the peer-to-peer network overlay . For example, peer node A and\/or its user can specify a group of peer nodes and\/or a group of users who are authorized to access the data object that it has stored in the peer-to-peer overlay network . Such a group of authorized peer nodes and\/or users may be referred to generally herein as a group.","Facilitating Group Management and Member Authentication","Turning to , a network environment for facilitating group management and member authentication is shown for an overlay network that is not centrally coordinated by servers or stable hosts. In this example, the peer nodes A-C from  are used for illustration purposes. When the peer node A and\/or its user specifies (or creates) a group, that peer node A and\/or its user may manage the group's membership in the peer-to-peer overlay network , and may be referred to herein as a group administrator. As used throughout this disclosure reference to a group administrator peer node (e.g. group administrator peer node A) refers to the peer node device and\/or its user. According to a feature, the group administrator peer node A can assign a peer-specific certificate to each peer node  and\/or user that is a member of the group. In some implementations, the peer-specific certificate can comprise a peer-specific group certificate that is issued by the group administrator peer node A. In other implementations, the peer-specific certificate can comprise a peer-specific node certificate that is issued by the trusted authority to each group member, after authorization from the group administrator peer node A.","A peer node and\/or a user that is a member of the group (e.g., peer node B) may subsequently request access to the stored data object via the peer-to-peer overlay network . As used herein, an access request may comprise a request for one of various levels of access, including but not limited to, read access or reading\/modifying access (i.e., read\/write access). A peer node and\/or user that is a member of a group and that requests access to the data object may be referred to herein as a group member peer node (e.g., group member peer node B) or an accessing peer node. The access controls may specify that members of the group are allowed certain access, but it is desirable to validate that the group member peer node B truly is a member of the group.","According to a feature, enforcement of the group access controls can be distributed among the peer nodes in the overlay network. For instance, a peer node may be employed to validate that the group member peer node B is actually a member of the group, as asserted by the group member peer node B. Such a peer node that authenticates or validates the group membership of the group member peer node B may be referred to herein as a validating peer node C. According to one or more implementations, the group member peer node B can send its peer-specific certificate (e.g., peer-specific group certificate, peer-specific node certificate) to the validating peer node C. The validating peer node C can then validate the group member peer node B using a public key that is either included in the peer-specific certificate, or is located from other information included in the peer-specific certificate (e.g., the group member peer node's B identity) The validating peer node C can also validate the peer-specific certificate using a public key of the apparatus that issued the certificate (e.g., the group administrator peer node in the case of a peer-specific group certificate, the trusted authority in the case of a peer-specific node certificate). According to a feature, the validating peer node C is able to independently validate that the group member peer node B is a member of a group. That is, the validating peer node C can autonomously validate the group membership of the group member peer node B without employing another peer node or a central server to provide validation information or to perform one or more of the validating functions.","It should be noted that although the group administrator peer node A, the group member peer node B and the validating peer node C are depicted as distinct peer nodes according to the implementation illustrated, a peer node can perform the rolls of a plurality of the depicted peer nodes in various implementations. For example, the group administrator peer node A may also be a group member peer node B that requests access to a data object and is validated by a validating peer node C. In another example, the group administrator peer node A may be employed to validate a group member peer node B that is requesting access to a data object, in which case the group administrator peer node A would also be a validating peer node C. In yet another example, a group member peer node B may also operate as a validating peer node C when employed to validate another group member peer node.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIGS. 4 and 5","FIG. 4","FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIG. 1"],"b":["104","104","104"]},"Initially, the group administrator peer node A A, can obtain a node certificate (Node Cert-A)  from a trusted authority (e.g., trusted authority  in ). The node certificate  includes the peer node A's identity (Peer-A ID), peer node A's public key (PbK-A), the trusted authority's identity (TA-ID), and a signature by the trusted authority, and may be obtained in a manner similar to that described above with reference to .","At , the peer node A A can create a group and give the group a name (e.g., group X). The group name is a unique name used to identify the group. In order to ensure the group name is unique, the peer node A A can generate a group token and can store the group token under the group name in the peer-to-peer overlay network . The group token (shown as group token  in ) can be stored using a single-value model in which there can be only one data object stored in the peer-to-peer overlay network under any particular name. Accordingly, if another data object or group is already using the group name as an identifier, then the group token  using the repeated name would be routed by the peer-to-peer overlay network to the same storing peer node as the other similarly named object, resulting in a name collision at the storing peer node. When such a collision occurs, the group administrator peer node A A can be informed that a different group name is to be chosen. When no name collision occurs, the group administrator peer node A A can be assured that the selected group name is unique.","The group token  can include a description of the group (e.g. Group-X), the identity of the group administrator, the identities of the members of the group and\/or other information. The group token can also include a signature generated using the private key of the group administrator peer node A A (Group-X Token (Sig)).","With the group created and the group token stored in the peer-to-peer overlay network, the group administrator peer node A A can generate a peer-specific group certificate for each member of the group , and can send the respective peer-specific group certificate to each member peer node . For example, a peer-specific group certificate (e.g., Group-X_Cert) may be generated for peer node B B at , and then sent to the peer node B B at . The peer-specific group certificate (Group-X_Cert) can include the group name (Group-X), the group administrator peer node A's A identity (Peer-A ID), and the receiving peer node's identity (Peer-B ID). According to at least some implementations, the peer-specific group certificate (Group-X_Cert) may also include the receiving peer node's public key (PbK-B). The group administrator peer node A A also signs the peer-specific group certificate using its private key (Sig). For example, the peer-specific group certificate can be signed using a signature scheme such as an RSA signature, elliptic curve signature, or other known algorithms. Although  shows the signature by the private key (Sig) as comprising a signature of the entire peer-specific group certificate (Group-X_Cert), in other implementations the signature (Sig) can comprise a signature of any one or more of the individual data pieces included in the peer-specific group certificate (Group-X_Cert) Peer node B B can receive and store the peer-specific group certificate for future use in identifying itself as a member of group X at .","Turning to , when the group member peer node B B desires to access some data object that requires group membership, another peer node in the peer-to-peer overlay network may be employed to validate the group member peer node's membership in the group. In the example shown in , peer node C C is employed as the validating peer node. The validating peer node C C may be the same peer node storing the data object that group member peer node B B is requesting to access, or the validating peer node C C may be another peer node in the network. In order to validate the group member peer node B's B group membership, the group member peer node B B can send the peer-specific group certificate (Group-X_Cert) to the validating peer node C C.","Employing information from the peer-specific group certificate (Group-X_Cert), the validating peer node C C can authenticate that peer node B B is a valid member of group X. For instance, the validating peer node C C can verify that the group member peer node B B is the rightful owner of the peer-specific group certificate (Group-X_Cert) and that the certificate was rightfully issued by the group administrator peer node A A.","As shown in , the validating peer node C C can obtain a digital signature corresponding to a piece of data signed using the group member peer node B's B private key to verify the group member peer node B B is in possession of the private key corresponding to either the public key in the peer-specific group certificate or to the public key associated with the peer node B identity (Peer-B ID) included in the peer-specific group certificate. For example, the validating peer node C C can send  a random challenge to the group member peer node B B. Using its private key, the group member peer node B B can sign the random challenge and send the signed random challenge (Sig(Random Challenge)) to the validating peer node C C at step . The validating peer node C C can then use the peer-specific public key (PbK-B) included in the peer-specific group certificate (Group-X_Cert) to validate the signed response .","In other implementations, the validating peer node C C can obtain the peer-specific public key (PbK-B) from the peer-to-peer overlay network using the identity of the group member peer node B B (Peer-B ID) from the peer-specific group certificate. For example, the validating peer node C C can use the identity Peer-B ID from the group certificate to obtain the public key directly from the group member peer node B B. In other implementations, the validating peer node C C can use the identity Peer-B ID to obtain the node certificate for peer node B B, which includes its public key as noted above, and which also provides further trust since it is issued and signed by the trusted authority.","The validating peer node C C can also verify that the group administrator peer node A A is truly the group administrator, as well as the signature of the peer-specific group certificate to verify that the certificate was signed by the group administrator peer node A A. For example, the validating peer node C C can obtain  the node certificate for the group administrator peer node A A (Node Cert-A), which can be authenticated from the signature by the trusted authority (Sig). In at least one example, the validating peer node C C can use the group administrator peer node's identity (Peer-A ID) from the peer-specific group certificate (Group-X_Cert) to retrieve the node certificate (Node Cert-A) for the group administrator peer node A. In at least another example in which the identity of the group administrator may not be included in the peer-specific group certificate, the validating peer node C C can use the group name (Group-X) to obtain the group token from the peer-to-peer overlay network to discover the identity of the group administrator.","If the validating peer node C C has not already accessed the group token, it may be retrieved from the peer-to-peer overlay network , and the group administrator peer node A's A public key (PbK-A) from the node certificate (Node Cert-A) can be used to verify the signature of the group token to verify that the peer node A A is the group administrator and authorized the issue and\/or sign the peer-specific group certificate . Using the public key (PbK-A) from the group administrator peer node A's A node certificate (Node Cert-A), the validating peer node C C can also verify the signature (Sig) included with the peer-specific group certificate (Group-X_Cert) .","If the validating peer node C C successfully verifies that the group member peer node B B is the rightful owner of the peer-specific group certificate (Group-X_Cert) and that the certificate was rightfully issued by the group administrator peer node A A, then the group member peer node B's B group membership is verified , and the validating peer node C C can grant access to the requested data object . If any of the verification steps fails, the group membership of the group member peer node B B is not established and access to the data object may be denied.","According to at least some implementations, the validating peer node C C can cache the group administrator peer node A's A identity (Peer-A ID) and public key (PbK-A), together with the group name for future verification of other members of the same group. In the implementation described with reference to , both group membership management and peer-specific certificate issuance are performed by the group administrator peer node. The trusted authority is, therefore, not involved in the group management process, but is involved in providing an additional layer of trust by issuing node certificates to the various peer nodes, which can be used the verify public keys and identities, as noted herein.","Turning now to  (including ), a flow diagram is shown illustrating group management and member authentication according to at least one implementation employing peer-specific node certificates for group-member peer nodes. In this example, the trusted authority is responsible for issuing peer-specific certificates to group members, while enforcement of group access control is still distributed among all the peer nodes of the peer-to-peer overlay network. As illustrated, the group administrator peer node A A, the group member peer node B B, and the validating peer node C C described with reference to , as well as the trusted authority  described with reference to  are used for illustration purposes. In the implementation shown in , instead of generating the peer-specific certificate itself, the group administrator peer node A A communicates with the trusted authority , which generates a peer-specific node certificate for each group member.","Referring initially to , the group administrator peer node A A can obtain a node certificate (Node Cert-A) , and the peer node B B can obtain a node certificate (Node Cert-B)  from the trusted authority . The node certificate for peer node A includes the peer node A's identity (Peer-A ID), peer node A's public key (PbK-A), the trusted authority's identity (TA-ID), and a signature by the trusted authority  (Sig). Similarly, the node certificate for peer node B includes the peer node B's identity (Peer-B ID), peer node B's public key (PbK-B), the trusted authority's identity (TA-ID), and a signature by the trusted authority  (Sig). The respective node certificates can be obtained in a manner similar to that described above with reference to .","At , the peer node A A can create a group and give the group a name (e.g., group X). The group name is a unique name used to identify the group. In this example, the group administrator peer node A A registers  the group under the group name with the trusted authority . The uniqueness of the group name is checked and ensured by the trusted authority . The trusted authority  can maintain a record of all group names and the identity of the group administrator for each group. In some implementations, registration of the group with the trusted authority  may be used in conjunction with storing a group token on the peer-to-peer overlay network as well, in which case the trusted authority  can verify uniqueness of the group name by verifying the information stored on the overlay, as described above with reference to .","When a peer node or its user desires to join a group, a request can be sent to the group administrator. For example, if peer node B B wishes to join group-X, a request  to join group-X can be sent to group administrator peer node A A. The request to join group-X includes the node certificate (Node Cert-B) for peer node B B. The group administrator peer node A A can approve or deny the request. If the request to join group-X is approved, the group administrator peer node A A assigns a peer-specific certificate for the peer node B B. For example, the group administrator peer node A A can assign the peer-specific certificate by sending a request  to the trusted authority  asking the trusted authority  to add peer node B B as a member of the group-X and to issue a peer-specific node certificate to peer node B B. The request to add peer node B B may include forwarding the node certificate (Node Cert-B) for peer node B B to the trusted authority .","On receipt of the request from the group administrator peer node A A, the trusted authority  authenticates the node identity (Peer-A ID) for the group administrator peer node A A, and verifies that the node identity (Peer-A ID) matches the group administrator's identity in its group record . If the verification is successful, the trusted authority  issues  a new node certificate (New Node Cert-B) to the peer node B B. The new node certificate includes all the information that was in the old certificate (Node Cert-B) plus the group name that the peer recently joined. For instance, the new node certificate (New Node Cert-B) includes the peer node B's identity (Peer-B ID), peer node B's public key (PbK-B), the trusted authority's identity (TA-ID), and a signature by the trusted authority  (Sig), as well as the group name (Group-X) to indicate that peer node B B is a member of the group Group-X. The new node certificate (New Node Cert-B) may be sent to the peer node B B either directly from the trusted authority , or via the group administrator peer node A A. As used herein, a new node certificate indicating group membership may also be referred to as a peer-specific node certificate.","Turning to , when the peer node B B desires to access some data object that requires membership in a group (e.g., Group-X), another peer node in the peer-to-peer overlay network may be employed to validate the group member peer node's membership in the group. In the example shown in , peer node C C is employed as the validating peer node. It is noted for clarification that the trusted authority  shown in  is not shown in , while peer node A A and peer node B B are illustrated as continuing onto . A circled \u2018A\u2019 and a circled \u2018B\u2019 are shown to depict that the peer node A A and peer node B B continue from  onto . Also of note, the peer node C C is illustrated in , which was not illustrated in .","As noted, the validating peer node C C shown in  is employed to validate that the group member peer node B B is a member of the group. The validating peer node C C may be the same peer node storing the data object that group member peer node B B is requesting to access, or the validating peer node C C may be another peer node in the network. In order to validate the group membership of the group member peer node B B, the group member peer node B B can send  its peer-specific node certificate (New Node Cert-B) to the validating peer node C C.","Employing information from the peer-specific node certificate (New Node Cert-B), the validating peer node C C can authenticate that group member peer node B B is a valid member of group X. For instance, the validating peer node C C can verify that the group member peer node B B is the rightful owner of the peer-specific node certificate (New Node Cert-B) and that the certificate was truly issued by the trusted authority .","To verify that the group member peer node B B is the rightful owner of the peer-specific node certificate (New Node Cert-B), the validating peer node C C can obtain a digital signature corresponding to a piece of data signed using the private key of the group member peer node B B. The validating peer node C C can use the digital signature to verify that the group member peer node B B is in possession of the private key corresponding to the public key in the peer-specific node certificate (New Node Cert-B). For example, the validating peer node C C can send a random challenge  to the group member peer node B B. Using its private key, the group member peer node B B can sign the random challenge and send the signed random challenge (Sig(Random Challenge)) to the validating peer node C C at step . The validating peer node C C can then use the peer-specific public key (PbK-B) to validate the signed response . If the response is validated, the validating peer node C C is ensured that the group member peer node B B is in possession of the private key associated with the peer-specific node certificate (New Node Cert-B).","The validating peer node C C can also verify the signature of the peer-specific node certificate (New Node Cert-B) to verify that the certificate was issued by the trusted authority . For example, the validating peer node C C can retrieve the public key (PbK-TA) for the trusted authority . In some instances, the validating peer node C C may already have a copy of the trusted authority's public key (PbK-TA), or the validating peer node C C can use the identity of the trusted authority  (Peer-A ID) included in the peer-specific node certificate (New Node Cert-B) to retrieve the trusted authority's public key (PbK-TA). Using the public key (PbK-TA) for the trusted authority , the validating peer node C C can verify the signature (Sig) included with the peer-specific node certificate (New Node Cert-B) .","If the validating peer node C C successfully verifies that the group member peer node B B is the rightful owner of the peer-specific node certificate (New Node Cert-B) and that the certificate was rightfully issued by the trusted authority , then the group member peer node B's B group membership is verified , and the validating peer node C C can grant access to the requested data object . If any of the verification steps fails, the group membership of the group member peer node B B is not established and access to the data object may be denied.","Exemplary Group Administrator Peer Nodes",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","600","602","604","606"]},"The processing circuit  is generally arranged to obtain, process and\/or send data, control data access and storage, issue commands, and control other desired operations, and may comprise circuitry configured to implement desired programming provided by appropriate media, such as storage medium , in at least one embodiment.","The storage medium  may represent one or more devices for storing programming and\/or data, such as processor executable code or instructions (e.g., software, firmware), electronic data, databases, or other digital information.
