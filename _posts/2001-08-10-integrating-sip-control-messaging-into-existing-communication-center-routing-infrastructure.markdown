{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED DOCUMENTS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention is a Continuation-In-Part (CIP) to a U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/160,558, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Providing Integrated Routing for PSTN and IPNT Calls in a Call Center\u201d, filed on Sep. 24, 1998, disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. The inventor of the instant application has also participated in the document disclosure program and claims priority to the contents of document disclosure number 496199 dated Jun. 19, 2001.","The present invention is in the field of telephony communication and pertains more particularly to methods and apparatus for using session initiation protocol (SIP) in the routing infrastructure of a communication center.","In the field of telephony communication, there have been many improvements in technology over the years that have contributed to more efficient use of telephone communication within hosted call-center environments. Most of these improvements involve integrating the telephones and switching systems in such call centers with computer hardware and software adapted for, among other things, better routing of telephone calls, faster delivery of telephone calls and associated information, and improved service with regards to client satisfaction. Such computer-enhanced telephony is known in the art as computer-telephony integration (CTI).","Generally speaking, CTI implementations of various design and purpose are accomplished both within individual call-centers and, in some cases, at the network level. For example, processors running CTI software applications may be linked to telephone switches, service control points (SCP), and network entry points within a public or private telephone network. At the call-center level, CTI-enhanced processors, data servers, transaction servers, and the like, are linked to telephone switches and, in some cases, to similar CTI hardware at the network level, often by a dedicated digital link. CTI and other hardware within a call-center is commonly referred to as customer premises equipment (CPE). It is the CTI processor and application software at such centers that provides computer enhancement to a call center.","In a CTI-enhanced call center, telephones at agent stations are connected to a central telephony switching apparatus, such as an automatic call distributor (ACD) switch or a private branch exchange (PBX). The agent stations may also be equipped with computer terminals such as personal computer\/video display unit's (PC\/VDU's) so that agents manning such stations may have access to stored data as well as being linked to incoming callers by telephone equipment. Such stations may be interconnected through the PC\/VDUs by a local area network (LAN). One or more data or transaction servers may also be connected to the LAN that interconnects agent stations. The LAN is, in turn, connected to the CTI processor, which is connected to the call switching apparatus of the call center.","When a call arrives at a call center, whether or not the call has been pre-processed at an SCP, typically at least the telephone number of the calling line is made available to the receiving switch at the call center by the network provider. This service is available by most networks as caller-ID information in one of several formats such as Automatic Number Identification Service (ANIS). If the call center is computer-enhanced (CTI) the phone number of the calling party may be used to access additional information from a customer information system (CIS) database at a server on the network that connects the agent workstations. In this manner information pertinent to a call may be provided to an agent, often as a screen pop.","In recent years, advances in computer technology, telephony equipment, and infrastructure have provided many opportunities for improving telephone service in publicly-switched and private telephone intelligent networks. Similarly, development of a separate information and data network known as the Internet, together with advances in computer hardware and software have led to a new multi-media telephone system known in the art by several names. In this new systemology, telephone calls are simulated by multi-media computer equipment, and data, such as audio data, is transmitted over data networks as data packets. In this application the broad term used to describe such computer-simulated telephony is Data Network Telephony (DNT).","For purposes of nomenclature and definition, the inventors wish to distinguish clearly between what might be called conventional telephony, which is the telephone service enjoyed by nearly all citizens through local telephone companies and several long-distance telephone network providers, and what has been described herein as computer-simulated telephony or DNT. The conventional system is familiar to nearly all, and is often referred to in the art as connection-oriented-switched-telephony (COST). The COST designation will be used extensively herein. The computer-simulated, or DNT systems are familiar to those who use and understand computer systems. Perhaps the best example of DNT is telephone service provided over the Internet, which will be referred to herein as Internet-Protocol-Network-Telephony (IPNT), by far the most extensive, but still a subset of DNT.","Both systems use signals transmitted over network links. In fact, connection to data networks for DNT such as IPNT is typically accomplished over local telephone lines, used to reach such as an Internet Service Provider (ISP). The definitive difference is that COST telephony may be considered to be connection-oriented telephony. In the COST system, calls are placed and connected by a specific dedicated path, and the connection path is maintained over the time of the call. Bandwidth is thus assured. Other calls and data do not share a connected channel path in a COST system. In a DNT system, on the other hand, the system is not dedicated or connection oriented. That is, data, including audio data, is prepared, sent, and received as data packets. The data packets share network links, and may travel by variable paths, being reassembled into serial order after receipt. Therefore, bandwidth is not guaranteed.","Under ideal operating circumstances a DNT network, such as the Internet, has all of the audio quality of conventional public and private intelligent telephone-networks, and many advantages accruing from the aspect of direct computer-to-computer linking. However, DNT applications must share the bandwidth available on the network in which they are traveling. As a result, real-time voice communication may at times suffer dropout and delay. This is at least partially due to packet loss experienced during periods of less-than-needed bandwidth which may prevail under certain conditions such as congestion during peak periods of use, and so on.","Recent improvements to available technologies associated with the transmission and reception of data packets during real-time DNT communication have enabled companies to successfully add DNT, principally IPNT capabilities, to existing CTI-enhanced call centers. Such improvements, as described herein and known to the inventor, include methods for guaranteeing available bandwidth or quality of service (QoS) for a transaction, improved mechanisms for organizing, coding, compressing, and carrying data more efficiently using less bandwidth, and methods and apparatus for intelligently replacing lost data by using voice supplementation methods and enhanced buffering capabilities.","In typical call centers, DNT is accomplished by Internet connection and IPNT calls. For this reason, IPNT and the Internet will be used almost exclusively in examples to follow. It should be understood, however, that this usage is exemplary, and not limiting.","In systems known to the inventors, incoming IPNT calls are processed and routed within an IPNT-capable call center in much the same way as COST calls are routed in a CTI-enhanced center, using similar or identical routing rules, waiting queues, and so on, aside from the fact that there are two separate networks involved. Call centers having both CTI and IPNT capability utilize LAN-connected agent-stations with each station having a telephony-switch-connected headset or phone, and a PC connected, in most cases via LAN, to the LAN over which IPNT calls may be routed. Therefore, in most cases, IPNT calls are routed to the agent's PC while conventional telephony calls are routed to the agent's conventional telephone or headset. However, a method known to the inventor allows one headset to be used at an agent's station for handling both IPNT and COST calls. This is accomplished via connecting the agent's telephone to the sound card on the agent's PC\/VDU with an I\/O cable. In most prior art and current art systems, separate lines and equipment must be implemented for each type of call weather COST or IPNT.","Due in part to added costs associated with additional equipment, lines, and data ports that are needed to add IPNT capability to a CTI-enhanced call-center, companies are currently experimenting with various forms of integration between the older COST system and the newer IPNT system. For example, by enhancing data servers, interactive voice response units (IVRs), agent-connecting networks, and so on, with the capability of understanding Internet protocol, data arriving from either network may be integrated requiring less equipment and lines to facilitate processing, storage, and transfer of data. However, telephony, trunks and IPNT network lines representing the separate networks involved still provide for significant costs and maintenance.","In some current art implementations, incoming data from the COST network and the Internet is caused to run side by side from the network level to a call center over a telephone connection (T\/E) acting as a telephone-data bridge, wherein a certain channels are reserved for COST connection, and this portion is dedicated as is necessary in COST protocol (connection oriented), and the remainder is used for DNT such as IPNT calls, and for perhaps other data transmission. Such a service is generally offered by a local phone company. This service eliminates the requirement for leasing numerous telephony trunks and data-network connections. Routing and other equipment, however, must be implemented at both the call-center level and network level significantly reducing any realized cost savings.","A significant disadvantage of such a bridge, having dedicated equipment on each end, is the dedicated nature of individual channels over the bridging link. Efficient use of bandwidth cannot be assured during variable traffic conditions that may prevail at certain times. For example, dedicated channels assigned to IPNT traffic would not be utilized if there were not enough traffic to facilitate their use. Similarly, if there was more COST traffic than the allotted number of COST channels could carry, no additional channels could be made available.","In a yet more advanced system, known in some call centers, a central switch within the call center is enhanced with IP conversion capability and can communicate via LAN to connected IP phone-sets and PC's eliminating the need for regular telephone wiring within a call center. However, the service is still delivered via a telephone-data bridge as described above. Therefore, additional requirements for equipment and inefficiency regarding use of bandwidth are still factors.","In still other systems known to the inventor, IPNT to COST conversion or COST to IPNT conversion is performed within the call center instead of via a network bridge. This is accomplished via a gateway connected to both an IPNT router and a central telephony-switching apparatus. In the first case, all calls are converted to and routed as COST calls over internal telephone wiring to switch-connected headsets. In the second case, all COST calls are converted to and routed as IPNT calls over a LAN to individual PC\/VDU's.","In all of the described prior art systems, the concerted goal has been to integrate COST and IPNT data via converging at the network level or within the call center. The addition of dedicated hardware both at the network level and within the call center adds to the expense of providing such integrated data.","In a system known to the inventor and described with reference to Ser. No. 09\/160,558 listed in the cross-reference section of this specification, an integrated router is provided within a call center. The integrated router monitors and controls both a telephony switch receiving and forwarding connection-oriented, switched telephony (COST) calls and a Data Network Telephony (DNT) processor receiving and forwarding DNT calls. The integrated router is enabled by software to consult a common data repository storing status of agents answering both types of calls within the center and routes all calls according to a single set of routing rules, which can take a variety of forms. In one aspect, telephone devices at agent stations are adapted to handle both COST and DNT calls.","It has occurred to the inventor that in addition to being able to unify all routed events within a communication center under a common set of rules, it would be desirable to adapt established IP network protocols for use as routing tools within a communication center for the purpose of saving time and costs of developing proprietary protocols and expensive client applications using them.","One standard Internet-based protocol that may be adapted for communication center use is the well-known session initiation protocol (SIP). Very basically, SIP is an application-layer control (signaling) protocol for creating, modifying and terminating communication sessions with one or more participants. These sessions include Internet multimedia conferences, Internet telephone calls and multimedia distribution. Members in a session can communicate via multicast or via a mesh of unicast relations, or a combination of these.","A SIP session can include both persons and automated systems such as a media storage service. A SIP session can include both unicast and multicast sessions. A session initiator does not necessarily have to be a member of an initiated session to which SIP is used to initiate. SIP transparently supports name mapping and redirection services, allowing the implementation of ISDN and Intelligent Network telephony subscriber services. These facilities also enable personal mobility.","In the parlance of telecommunications intelligent network services, personal mobility is defined as the ability of end users to originate and receive calls and access subscribed telecommunication services on any terminal in any location, and the ability of the network to identify end users as they move. Personal mobility is based on unique identification numbering and compliments terminal mobility, which enables an end terminal to be moved from one sub-net to another.","SIP is designed as part of the well-known IETF multimedia data and control architecture, which is currently incorporating protocols such as RSVP for reserving network resources; the real-time transport protocol (RTP) for transporting real-time data and providing QoS feedback; the real-time streaming protocol (RTSP) for controlling delivery of streaming media; the session announcement protocol (SAP) for advertising multimedia sessions via multicast; and the session description protocol (SDP) for describing multimedia sessions.","It is known to the inventors that SIP can be used in conjunction with other call setup and signaling protocols. In this mode, an end system uses SIP exchanges to determine the appropriate end system address and protocol from a given address that is protocol-independent. For example, SIP could be used to determine that the party can be reached via H.323, obtain the H.245 gateway and user address and then use H.225.0 to establish a call, for example. In another example, SIP might be used to determine that a call recipient is reachable via the PSTN and indicate the phone number to be called, possibly suggesting an Internet-to-PSTN gateway to be used.","Although SIP protocol is extremely versatile in application, it is yet to be incorporated in call routing infrastructure that depends on a variety of strict call routing rules such as would be the case within a complex communication center. In a complex central routing system such as would be established in a state-of-art communication center, practicing IPNT and COST\/DNT integration, further innovation is required to enable application of SIP as a routing tool that is integrated with established routing protocols.","What is clearly needed is a routing system enabled to route both COST and IPNT calls to available agents sharing a LAN within a call center, wherein SIP protocols are used to set-up, manage, and terminate sessions between agents and clients of the center and between agents and other agents associated with the center according to established routing rules setup for the center.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a software suite is provided for routing communication events over a data-packet-network using an IP session initiation and management protocol. The software suite comprises, a server application running on the network for computing and serving routing determinations per request, a session management application running on the network for initiating and managing routed and established session events, a parsing application running on the network for parsing request data received under session initiation protocol and a conversion application running on the network for converting data received under session initiation protocol into a routing request. All received communication requests for routing are in the form of the session initiation protocol wherein they are parsed and converted into routing requests processed by the server application and routed to determined destinations and wherein events are established as session events conducted under the session initiation and management protocol.","In a preferred embodiment, the data-packet-network comprises the Internet network. In this preferred embodiment, the Internet network further connects to a LAN network. In one aspect, the software suite controls internal routing within a communication center. In another aspect, the session management application follows SIP protocols. In still another aspect, the communication events are sourced from clients of the center and routed to agents or automated systems at work within the center.","In another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for intelligent routing of communication events from a source to a destination over a data-packet-network using a session initiation and management protocol. The method comprises the steps of, (a) receiving a request at a routing point for establishing a session event, the request of the form the session initiation and management protocol, (b) parsing the request for body content and header information, (c) converting the parsed data into a formal routing request of a form generic to a routing determination software, (d) determining the best destination according to the request and returning the result to the routing point and (e) establishing the communication event between the source party and the determined destination under the session protocol.","In a preferred embodiment, the data-packet-network comprises the Internet network. Also in a preferred embodiment, the Internet network further connects to a LAN network. In one embodiment, the method is practiced within a communication center. In one aspect of the method in step (a) the routing point is a proxy server and the session initiation and management protocol is SIP protocol. In another aspect of the method in step (b) the body content of the request is an electronic form populated by the requesting party. In one aspect of the method in step (d) additional information pertinent to the requesting party not originally part of the request is obtained passed back to the routing point along with the determination results. In one aspect of the method in step (e) the routing point establishes and maintains the session until a party of the session terminates the session. In another aspect of the method in step (e) the session is established and maintained by a network-connected node other than the routing node.","Now, for the first time, a routing system is provided that is able to route both COST and IPNT calls to available agents sharing a LAN within a call center wherein SIP protocols are used to set-up, manage, and terminate sessions between agents and clients of the center and between agents and other agents associated with the center according to established routing rules set-up for the center.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},"In  telecommunications network  comprises a publicly-switched telephone network (PSTN) , the Internet network , and a call center . PSTN network  may be a private network rather than a public network, and Internet  may be another public or a private data network as are known in the art.","In this basic prior art example, call center  is equipped to handle both COST calls and IPNT calls. Both COST calls and IPNT calls are delivered to call-center  by separate network connections. For example, a telephony switch  in the PSTN may receive incoming telephone calls and rout them over a COST network trunk  to a central switching apparatus  located within call center . IPNT calls from Internet  are routed via a data router  over a data-network connection  to an IPNT router  within call center . In this example, network switch  is meant to represent a wide variety of processing and switching equipment in a PSTN, and router  is exemplary of many routers and IP switches in the Internet, as known in the art.","Call center  further comprises four agent stations , , , and . Each of these agent stations, such as agent station , for example, comprises an agent's telephone  adapted for COST telephone communication and an agent's PC\/VDU  adapted for IPNT communication and additional data processing and viewing. Agent's telephones , , , and  along with agent's PC\/VDU , , , and  are in similar arrangement in agent stations , , , and  respectively. Agent's telephones, such as agent's telephone , are connected to COST switching apparatus  via telephone wiring .","A LAN  connects agent's PC\/VDU's to one another and to a CPE IPNT router . A client-information-system (CIS) server  is connected to LAN  and provides additional stored information about callers to each LAN-connected agent. Router  routes incoming IPNT calls to agent's PC\/VDU's that are also LAN connected as previously described. A data network connection  connects data router  to data router  located in Internet . Specific Internet access and connectivity is not shown, as such is well known in the art, and may be accomplished in any one of several ways. The salient feature to be emphasized in this prior art example is that separate connections and equipment are necessary and implemented to be able to handle both COST and IPNT calls at the call center.","Each agent's PC\/VDU, such as PC\/VDU  has a connection via LAN  and data network connection  to Internet  while the assigned agent is logged on to the system, however, this is not specifically required but rather preferred, so that incoming IPNT calls may be routed efficiently. Dial-up connecting rather than a continuous connection to Internet  may sometimes be employed.","An agent operating at an agent station such as agent station  may have COST calls arriving on agent's telephone  while IPNT calls are arriving on agent's PC\/VDU . In examples prior to this example, router  would not have a connection to central switching apparatus . Having no such connection creates a cumbersome situation, requiring agents to distribute their time as best they can between the two types of calls. Thus, agent time is not utilized to maximum efficiency with respect to the total incoming calls possible from both networks.","In this embodiment however, router  is connected to an IPNT-to-COST gateway  via data connection . Gateway  is connected to central switch  via CTI connection . Gateway  is adapted to convert all incoming and outgoing IPNT calls to COST calls where they may be routed over wiring  to agents (incoming), or over trunk  to switch  in cloud  (outgoing). In this way, agents may use switch-connected telephones, such as telephone  to answer both IPNT-to-COST converts and regular incoming COST calls. The agent's time is better utilized, and additional network equipment comprising a network bridge and associated network connections are not required.","This prior art example, however, presents some problems and limitations. One problem is that traditional COST equipment such as routers, switches, and wiring may have to be significantly expanded to handle more traffic regarding the added call-load received from cloud . Further, the ability to predict possible call overload situations is significantly complicated because of the convergence of IPNT calls into the COST routing system. As IPNT calls are now received by agents as COST calls, certain features inherent to IPNT applications will be lost such as multimedia enhancements, and the like.","One advantage with this example is that calls originating as IPNT calls within call center  may be sent as IPNT calls over data connection , or as converted COST calls over trunk . Another advantage is that LAN  is free to carry data other than IPNT audio packets.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},"Call center  receives COST calls from cloud  over trunk , and IPNT calls from cloud  over data connection  as described with the prior art example of . However, instead of having a central telephony-switch such as switch  of , a COST-to-IPNT gateway  is provided and adapted to convert COST calls to IPNT calls.","After converting incoming COST calls to IPNT calls, these are routed via data connection  to an IPNT switch . IPNT switch  is adapted to distribute the resulting IPNT calls to selected agent's over LAN . Regular IPNT calls are routed to LAN-connected agents via router .","Agent's telephones \u2013 are, in this example, adapted as IP phones and are each connected to LAN . Internal wiring and other COST related architecture is not required, which is one distinct advantage of this prior art system.","A disadvantage of this system is that there is no provision to make outbound calls to the PSTN . Only further enhancement to gateway  to convert IPNT calls to COST calls enables out-bound dialing to PSTN  from within call center . Under heavy call-load situations, a dual gateway such as would be the case with gateway  may become congested and cause delay. Additional apparatus may be required to alleviate this problem. In some cases wherein there are concerted outbound campaigns taking place on a frequent basis, it may be more prudent to maintain a COST switch and internal wiring within call center  connected to either agent telephones (maintaining dual capability) or, to add a second set of telephones dedicated for outbound campaigns. Moreover, agents are reintroduced with a problem solved in the example of  of having to deal with incoming calls to both IP phones, and PC\/VDU's.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},"According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, call center  receives COST and IPNT calls from their respective separate networks comprising telecommunication system . Call center  is, in this example, enhanced with an integrated router (IR)  capable of routing both COST calls and IPNT calls. Central switch  is connected via CTI link to a processor running instances of a CTI application known to the inventors as T-server and Stat-server (TS\/STAT). An intelligent peripheral in the form of an IVR  is connected to processor  via data link . Processors  and IVR  provide CTI enhancement to switch , as well as an application programming interface (API) to IR  via installed software.","It will be apparent to the skilled artisan that processor , IVR  and IR  may be implemented in a single computing machine executing all of the necessary software, but the functions have separated here for clarity in description.","A multimedia data server (MIS)  is connected to LAN , and is adapted to store and serve certain multimedia content as known in the art. Switch  and Router  are maintained as call-arrival points for calls arriving from either PSTN  or Internet  adhering to the separate network-architecture previously described.","IR  performs in an innovative manner in that it not only controls central switch  through interaction with processor , and therefore routing of COST calls, but also controls processor  and the routing of IPNT calls. IR  controls routing of both COST and IPNT calls whether such calls are incoming or outgoing.","An agent status-table  is a real-time database containing agent availability information, which is continually updated as operation of the call center proceeds. Table  may reside in IR  as shown, or may reside on processor  as part of the T-Server software.

It will be appreciated that any combination of rules set by the company hosting center  may be in place such as priority routing, routing based on skill, statistical routing, and so on, in various combinations known to the inventors.","Integrated routing as provided by IR  allows calls of both types (COST\/IPNT) to be distributed evenly among available agents without adding expensive call conversion equipment, or effecting outbound dialing capabilities.","Yet another improvement in this example over prior art systems is known to the inventor and implemented at some or all agent stations such as stations \u2013.

Client information contained in repository  and servable by server  may include client history data, client identification data, contact information, payment history data, order status data, and so on. Server  functions, in this example, as a centralized information source for agents as well as for automated systems at work in the center. Information contained in repository  may be continually updated as events arrive and are internally routed within center .","A proxy server  is provided within center  and illustrated as connected to LAN . Proxy server  is adapted with a modified version of session initiation protocol (SIP) as is illustrated in this example by a software instance (SW) . SW  is installed on and executable on server  in accordance with events for internal routing within the center. Server  has an Internet connection to Internet backbone  by an Internet access pipeline . Server  functions also as an Internet router (IR) as described further above with reference to IR  of .","As an IR, server  performs all of the internal routing of events arriving thereto from Internet  and from PSTN  through switch . To this effect, server  is directly connected by a CTI link to switch . In one embodiment, switch  is adapted to convert COST events to IPNT ring events. In another embodiment, server  simply routes events from switch  but connection for such events is physically made on conventional telephones and internal telephony wiring. In still another embodiment, switch , if adapted as an IP conversion switch, may be directly connected to LAN . There are many possibilities.","User  has an instance of a software compatible with SIP protocol (SW)  executable thereon that is adapted as a simple client application to SW  in server . SW  may be a browser plug-in in one embodiment, for example. In another embodiment, SW  may be a stand-alone application. Another instance of software labeled SW , is illustrated on PC (user)  and adapted as a form-filler (FF) application. FF  may be assumed to be part of SW  as one application in many embodiments, or be connected to it in a direct or indirect manner. The inventor logically separates FF  from SW  for illustration of function only. In another embodiment, the functions of SW  and FF  may be provided in and accessible from server  within Internet .","The purpose of FF  is to enable a user, in this case user , to communicate a text reason for a desired connection event to an agent or system, of communication center . FF  provides functionality that would otherwise be covered by an interactive voice response (IVR) system that may be assumed to be implemented either in PSTN  and connected to switch , or within center  connected to switch .","User  may access server  and then be provided with applicable client software or he or she may already have the appropriate software installed as a resident program. Filling out an electronic form using FF  and submitting the form while connected online with server  causes a telephony event request to be initiated having an SIP header and the completed form as the body of the SIP message. The SIP event arrives at server  where SW  parses the message for content and separates the header information and content (form data) from the SIP message.","The parsed data is then re-formatted into language that is understood by T-server  and sent as a routing request to the server. Record of the event remains at server  until a response is received from T-server  concerning routing determination. T-server  executes any applicable routing routines using the re-formatted SIP data and sends a routing result or recommendation back to server . In some embodiments T-server  consults with server  for any information required for optimizing a best determination for routing the particular event.","Server  receives a routing determination from sever , and then routes the target event to an available agent or system based on the response. All SIP functionality built into SW  can be leveraged to provide information that is useful for establishing a successful connection.","For events arriving at switch  wherein there is no agent-level routing performed at PSTN  network level, IVR interaction can provide the equivalent of FF  of PC . SW  is capable of parsing a textualized of digitized version of an IVR message and of generating an SIP message containing the information. As described above, T-server  receives a routing request from server  in the form of a SIP message. Server  computes routing results according to included information and sends the results to server . Server  then routes the event to an appropriate agent or system connected to LAN .","If events arriving at switch  are to be passed directly to LAN  through a dedicated LAN connection (not shown), then server  simply routes notifications of pending ringing events. Alternatively, server  may receive the actual events digitized and my directly route them to appropriate agents or systems over LAN . Again, all of the functionality of SIP messaging may be tapped wherein it may be useful as a routing variable. Such functions include bandwidth reservation, handshake protocols, media designations, callback information, presence information and so on.","The method and apparatus of the present invention allows integration of strict routing conventions and SIP functionality without requiring significant modification of or provision of special application program interfaces (APIs) to be distributed to key components of the system, namely T-server , server , and perhaps at switch .","One with skill in the art will recognize that there may be a variety of routing infrastructures having differing hardware components and connectivity that can be enhanced with SIP-Routing capability according to embodiments of the present invention. Likewise, the preferred method may be employed to directly route and forward actual events and for routing notification of pending events wherein subsequent call connection is a COST connection made between a terminal and a central switch of the center.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["501","410","502","501","502","412","503","502"]},"In the meantime, at step  the proxy server waits for the result\/response from the request sent at step . In step  the requesting party or originator of the event remains in queue. At step  the T-server uses additional information provided by form filling to help granulate a routing determination to more narrowly define an appropriate routing destination for the event. This may involve access and consultation with a server\/database analogous to server  connected to repository  described with reference to . At this time, repository  may also be updated with new data from information provided with the original SIP request. At step  the T-server retrieves any required additional information from a database of information analogous to the repository\/server combination described above. This data may be passed to an appropriate agent with or ahead of the routed event.","At step , the T-server responds to the request of , after processing and retrieving any additional data at step , by sending the best possible routing information or result to the proxy server. The result may well be a final routing determination or command necessitating no further determination by the proxy. In another embodiment, routing information may simply consist of a data record indicating all of the parameters of the route computation wherein some further computation to determine final destination is left for the proxy server.","At step , the proxy sever of step  routes any additional hard data to the intended recipient of the call in the form of a screen pop-up or other well-known convention. Simultaneously at step , the processed event is routed by the proxy server to the same recipient. The recipient is most likely a live agent but may also be an automated robotic system.","In one embodiment, the live connection is established and the session maintained within the proxy. In another embodiment only notification of an event is routed and actual physical connection made by another IP router (dumb switch) other than the proxy server. In the event of telephony events arriving through the COAST network (PSTN), the SIP request sent to the proxy is generated at an enhanced central switch wherein the IVR interaction, if any, is translated into the form content of the SIP message. Therefore, the client in  in the case of COST events would be the central switch analogous to switch  described with reference to . The active SIP session whether COST initiated or IPNT initiated is maintained in the proxy server or another designated server.","Using SIP data to manage internal routing enables all IP communication forms such as IP telephony, Chat, multiparty conferencing and so on to be routed and maintained as traditional telephony call events following strict intelligent routing regimens. In the case of multiparty conferencing, many steps otherwise required for conferencing in various parties is eliminated. Each selected party would receive an identical routed event, which when taken or picked-up automatically initiates the party into the conference. Similarly, other traditional steps associated with center telephony such as call holding, call waiting, call transfer, etc. can be simplified using SIP parameters. Many individual characteristics of SIP capability can be leveraged for media identification, reserving bandwidth, end user identification, protocol switching to improve transmission quality, and so on.","The method and apparatus of the present invention can be practiced internally within a communication center and externally between communications centers connected to a common network. The invention may also be practiced on virtual IPNT communication networks utilizing remote agents. All that is required in the case of a virtual center is a centralized routing point (proxy server) and the transaction server capabilities and routines required to provide intelligent routing among remotely connected agents.","The method and apparatus of the present invention should, in light of the many applicable embodiments, be afforded the broadest scope under examination. The method and apparatus of the present invention should be limited only by the claims that follow."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
