title: Service for managing digital content licenses
abstract: A content management system may receive, purchase or otherwise obtain licenses from content owners or licensors and provide such content licenses to application developers or other content creators. The content management system can act as a central broker for licensing content rights to developers. The application developers can then generate content items based on the obtained licenses and provide or sell those content items to users of their applications. For instance, the developer may license an automobile design, brand name or performance data from an automobile manufacturer and create an automobile model for a racing game application.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The growth of the Internet has made digital distribution of content more desirable. The lower costs of digital distribution over a computer network versus distribution using physical media can only be expected to further drive the growth of the digital distribution channel. A growing number of content types such as applications, games, music, books and movies are now available through digital downloads, including mobile applications for wireless devices (sometimes called \u201capps\u201d).","With the growth of digital content, content developers are able to distribute content items at relatively low cost. This has resulted in the growth of the market for digital content items. In addition, the increase in digital content items has created a need for managing rights for digital items, such as Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems. With the proliferation of digital content items, managing, tracking and transferring rights to such content items have become more difficult.","I. Introduction","Many applications, such as games, allow users to purchase content items or other additions to the application, such as game maps, game items, characters, UI themes, music, levels, additional functionality, etc. These content items can be purchased from digital content stores or content marketplaces and can then be utilized within the application. However, typically, the content items are tied by Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems to a particular user computing device or user account associated with the purchasing user and cannot be used except on the same user computing device or by the same user account. As a result, the content items cannot be resold or traded to another user. Thus, if the purchasing user grows tired of the content item, the user cannot resell or trade the content item.","This disclosure describes systems and associated processes that provide a solution to the above problem. In certain embodiments, these system and processes can advantageously couple DRM protection of content items with digital content stores in order to allow content items to be transferred from one user computing system to another computing system. For instance, these systems and processes can be implemented in the context of an application store or content management system that distributes applications for purchase or for free to user devices. Developers can submit applications to the content management system for distribution to end users. In response to receiving an application from a developer, the content management system can generate application-specific digital stores that allow end users to conduct transactions with other end users to sell, trade and\/or buy content items associated with the application. In response to a sale or trade, DRM protections associated with the content items can allow a content item to be removed (e.g., deleted or disabled) on one user computing device and provided to another computing device, while maintaining the same number of outstanding active copies of the content item before and after the sales transaction between users. The DRM protection associated with the content items may also prevent or otherwise reduce copying or modifying of the application.","In an embodiment, the content management system may receive, purchase or otherwise obtain licenses from content owners or licensors and provide such content licenses to application developers or other content creators. The content management system can act as a central broker for licensing content rights to developers. The application developers can then generate content items based on the obtained licenses and provide or sell those content items to users of their applications. For instance, the developer may license an automobile design, brand name or performance data from an automobile manufacturer and create an automobile model for a racing game application. These and other features are described in greater detail below with respect to the figures.","Various aspects of the disclosure will now be described with regard to certain examples and embodiments, which are intended to illustrate but not to limit the disclosure. Nothing in this disclosure is intended to imply that any particular feature or characteristic of the disclosed embodiments is essential. The scope of protection is defined by the claims.","II. Content Management System Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100"]},"The content management system  can include any system capable of receiving the applications and application content items from developers and providing the applications and application content items to users. The applications and application content items can be made available via download, streaming, application virtualization, or the like. This can include, for example, making the application available for a one-time cost, for a subscription, or for free. Further, this can include, for example, making the application available to any number of users, to a predetermined number of users, to a predetermined set of users, for a limited time, for a limited number of uses, or indefinitely.","In , the content management system  is in communication with user computing devices , developer systems  and\/or content licensor systems  over a communication network . The network  may, for example, be a publicly accessible network of linked networks, possibly operated by various distinct parties, such as the Internet. In other embodiments, the network  may be a private network, such as, for example, a corporate or university network that is wholly or partially inaccessible to non-privileged users. In still other embodiments, the network  may include one or more private networks with access to and\/or from the Internet.","Developers, using their computing systems , can develop applications and submit those applications to the content management system  to have that content item made available for purchase and\/or download by customers for their customer devices , such as tablets, smart phones, e-book readers, non-mobile computers, and other types of computing devices . The devices  can generally include any computing device(s), such as wireless mobile devices (such as smart phones, PDAs, tablets, or the like), desktops, laptops, video game platforms, television set-top boxes, televisions (e.g., internet TVs), and computerized appliances, to name a few. Further, it is possible for the devices  to be different types of devices, to include different applications, or to otherwise be configured differently. In addition, the devices ,  can include any type of operating system (\u201cOS\u201d). For example, the computing devices  can implement an Android\u2122 OS, a Windows\u00ae OS, a Mac\u00ae OS, a Linux or Unix-based OS, or the like.","After receiving the content submission from the developer, the content management system  can list an application or application content item with the content marketplace system  or with a third-party marketplace. Typically, the content marketplace system  and third-party marketplaces are operated by different business entities, though a single business entity may operate more than one content marketplace. For example, the third-party marketplaces may operate on computing systems comprising one or more computing devices, the computing systems operated by different business entities, the computing systems in communication with the content management system  via the network .","In some embodiments, the content submission from the developer may include access credentials (e.g., keys, tokens, usernames, account names, passwords, etc.) for submitting the content to the content marketplace system  or verifying the source of the content submission. The access credentials may be stored in an account of the content management system associated with the user or may be matched with already-stored access credentials in the account. In some embodiments, the content submission is digitally signed with a public key certificate or other electronic certificate in order to verify that the content submission came from a particular user.","After the content management system  receives the content submission request from the user, the content management system  stores content submission data, such as the application(s), application content item(s) or content metadata, on data storage  (e.g., database, flat file or data structure on a storage device such as a file server, hard drive, optical drive, etc.) of the content management system . The data storage  may also store user credentials related to user accounts. For example, the content management system  may check access credentials received with the content submission to determine whether the user submitting the content has access rights to an account maintained by the content management system. If access rights are verified, the content management system  can then update content submissions and other data associated with the account.","Typically, the content management system  manages or coordinates the distribution of applications and application content items. Many applications allow users of those applications to obtain additional or \u201cadd-on\u201d application content items distinct from the application itself. These application content items may be purchased or obtained from within an application (e.g., in-app purchase) or may be purchased through interfaces provided by the content management system  (e.g. web services or device-installed marketplace app). For example, such application content items can include game maps, game levels, game saves, game items, game characters, game data, videos, images, music, designs, avatars, characters, descriptions, guides, hints, news, e-books, other written messages or content or the like. These content items can be utilized within the applications associated with the content items. In one example, a user using an e-reader device or other computing device having an e-reader application can purchase an electronic book within the e-reader application for reading on the device.","Referring to , the user computing devices  run one or more applications, such as application , that include functionality for interacting with the content management system  (as described below). The application  may, for example, be a game, navigation app, social networking app, business app, productivity app, utility app, media app, entertainment app or the like.","In some embodiments, the content management system  or a related entity may provide a software development kit (\u201cSDK\u201d) for creating such applications. Applications  created with the SDK may automatically or by default include certain code modules, such as a DRM client module  or a distribution service module , to provide certain functionality without requiring developers to implement the functionality themselves. For example, the DRM client module  can track entitlement rights for content items  on the user device computing device  for the content management system , control access to content items on the user computing device , and\/or remove expired or transferred content items from the computing device . The distribution service module  can obtain content items from the content management system , for example, through download. In some embodiments, the application  may also include a purchasing module  that allows purchasing of application content items  from within the application. The purchasing module  may communicate with a content marketplace system  to provide a list of available content items . In some embodiments, the functionality implement by the modules may be implemented by an application store client and not on developer applications.","The application  and associated application content items  may be developed or created on the developer systems  associated with respective developers. Developers, using the SDK, can generate the application  and content items associated with the application. The developers can then submit or upload the application and content items with the content management system  for inclusion in the content marketplace system . In some embodiments, developers may use an integrated development environment, a source code editor or the like, in addition to, or as alternative to using the SDK to develop the application.","In some situations, the application content items  may include intellectual property (IP) owned by another party. For example, the content items  may incorporate designs, brands, specifications, or other data protected by trademark, copyright or other IP protection. To simplify or otherwise facilitate the development process, the content management system  may act as a centralized broker for the licensing of such intellectual property. The content management system  may obtain licenses from a plurality of content licensors or computing systems associated with the content licensors  and provide those content licenses  to developers desiring to create content items based on those licenses. Such content items can include sport event scores and data, sport player statistics, vehicle designs, weapon designs, character designs, brand names or marks or the like.","In some embodiments, the content management system  acts as a broker for content licenses  between developers and content licensors. By acting as a central broker, the content management system  can potentially simplify the licensing process for content developers by automating (partially or wholly) the licensing process. In addition, the content management system  may enforce content licenses by monitoring, tracking, and\/or managing the content licenses. For example, if the content management system  receives a content item from a developer, it can determine if a content license covers the content item and whether the content item is compliant with the content license.","In some embodiments, the content management system  may create license bundles of content licenses from multiple content licensors and provide the bundles to developers. Such bundles can be grouped by subject matter, popularity, or other commonality. For example, the content management system  can create license bundles such as 10-best sports cars, top 5 trucks, special forces weapons pack, sports teams packs (e.g., current or historical), other vehicle packs, character packs, item packs, or the like. Developers who license the bundles can then create licensed content items which can be used in different types of applications and for different uses. However, in some embodiments, uses or amounts of the licensed content items may be specified and\/or limited by the content licenses.","The license bundles can include content licenses  from multiple content licensors, thus allowing developers to license content items  for their application without necessarily negotiating with multiple parties. In some embodiments, the content management system  may allow developers to create their own license bundles. Content licenses may also be licensed individually by the developers. The content management system  can provide a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for developers to obtain licenses, thereby simplifying or otherwise facilitating the content licensing process. The content management system  may track content licenses associated with developers, verify developer compliance with the licenses, collect license fees, and\/or split revenues from content item purchases. In some embodiments, the developers may pay a fee for use of the license, split revenues with the content licensor or a combination of the above. The content management system  may charge fees to the content licensor or developer or take a split of revenues for its services.","III. Example Scenarios","In one example, the content management system  may obtain licenses  for superhero characters from multiple comic publishers. The content management system  may then generate license bundles for groups of characters (e.g., golden age heroes, X-MEN, flying heroes, alien heroes, etc.) that developers can license. Developers can then use the characters in their applications, such as a role-playing game, fighting game, strategy game, puzzle game or the like.","In another example scenario, the content management system  can obtain licenses to team names from baseball teams and game data from the baseball league. The content management system  may then group or bundle the licenses, such as creating a bundle corresponding to a current baseball team or a historical baseball team. The content management system  can then provide the license bundle to developers or other content creators, who can then use the license bundle in a variety of ways and in a variety of applications.","In another example scenario, the content management system  provides or generates an application-specific digital store for a fantasy baseball application. Users of the application can trade or sell players to one another. In one embodiment, multiple application-specific digital stores may be created for the fantasy baseball application so that end users may compete in leagues or be otherwise grouped together. DRM protection can be applied to baseball player content items in order to keep baseball players unique to a particular application-specific digital store, with only one end user associated with the application-specific digital store able to own a particular player at one time. The content management system can track ownership of players and manage transfers of baseball players from one user to another, thereby allowing end users to bid for, sell, trade or buy baseball players.","IV. Content Management System Details","In , the content management system  comprises a content manager , data storage  and, optionally, a content marketplace system  in communication via a communication medium , such as network. The content marketplace  may be operated by the content management service provider or by another entity.","Typically, the data storage  stores the applications and content items associated with respective applications. A requesting computing device  can download applications and content items from the content management system . The application data may include images, binaries, videos, and\/or other electronic data, and may be grouped as a content bundle comprising a single content file or stream, a compressed file (e.g., ZIP, RAR, or other compressed file format) or multiple files. Typically, the content data is stored and\/or transmitted as electronic files, though the content data may also be transmitted as one or more data streams. The data storage  may also store content metadata describing the content data. In some embodiments, the content metadata comprises content file titles, descriptions, key words, content price, versioning information and\/or the like. The content metadata may be provided by the content marketplace system  on its catalog  and associated with respective content data.","The content management system  may be associated with a particular content marketplace system  or digital store. For example, the content management system  and content marketplace system  may be operated by the same business entity or related business entities. Among other functions, the content marketplace system  may store or provide content items\/products (e.g., applications, e-books, etc.) submitted by publishers, authors, developers and\/or other professional content creators, and make these items available to customers. The content marketplace system  can also provide application content items associated with respective developer applications for sale or download.","The content marketplace system  can be a server system that hosts a web site, or that hosts another type of interactive system for enabling users to browse and make purchases from a catalog. Referring to , the content marketplace system  comprises a marketplace interface , an electronic catalog  of content items and an ordering and\/or checkout processing module  (hereinafter \u201corder\/checkout module \u201d). The above components of the content marketplace system  may operate on the same computing devices or on separate computing devices.","The marketplace interface  can provide user computing devices  with access to the content marketplace system's catalog . The marketplace interface  may comprise a network application interface (e.g., a web server), an Application Programming Interface, or other type of interface. In one embodiment, an application store client operating on the user computing device  is in communication with the marketplace interface  in order provide the user computing device  access to the catalog .","The catalog  can include content items available for purchase, such as applications and content items associated with respective applications. The catalog  may also include content item metadata that describes the content items.","The electronic catalog  can provide functionality for customers to locate, download, and, where applicable, pay for applications and application content items of interest. The electronic catalog may be accessible via a web site, an \u201capp store\u201d application that runs on mobile devices of users, and\/or other types of interactive systems. Typically, the electronic catalog includes a separate detail page for each application. The detail page for a given application may, for example, include a description provided by the item's creator, price information, information about the item's creator, customer reviews, device compatibility information, screen shots (where applicable), and other types of information that may be useful to customers. In some embodiments, the detail page can include a list of available application content items associated with the given application. In some embodiments, the list may be filtered or generated based on settings or information associated with a user account. The content list may also be filtered using a variety of criteria, such as ratings, price, popularity or availability.","The order\/checkout module  can receive and\/or process customer orders for content items. In one embodiment, the order\/checkout module  may receive customer orders, for example via the marketplace interface , process the order, bill or accept payment from the user for the order, credit a seller or developer for the purchase, split payments between different parties, and\/or arrange for distribution of the content item. The order\/checkout module  may perform other functions related to order processing. In some embodiments, the order\/checkout module  may split fees received from end users (e.g., purchase fees or content delivery fees) with the accounts of developers, content licensors, and\/or the operator of the content management system .","In , the content manager  comprises a monitoring and reporting module , a licensing module , and a DRM module . Each such module may, for example, be implemented by program code executed by computer hardware, or by application-specific hardware. The content manager  may also provide a submission interface for developers and content licensors to submit applications, application content items, and\/or content licenses. A submission can be received directly from a user (e.g., via an interactive console or other GUI provided by the program execution service), from a program that interacts with the content manager via an Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) (e.g., an API that uses Web services), from the content marketplace system  and so forth.","In some embodiments, the monitoring and reporting module  monitors content item purchases, transfers of content items, usage of content licenses, prices paid, frequency of purchases, other purchase data or the like, in accordance with the customers' privacy rights. In some embodiments, such data may be anonymized in order to protect customers' privacy. The content management system  may data mine the collected data to generate one or more reports associated with the content management service, identify trends in purchases, determine popular items, determine user preferences, generate recommendations for other products, identify cross-marketing opportunities, identify cross-selling or related products, determine pricing information (e.g., market price, price ranges for content items or types of content items, demand at particular price points, etc.), of content items based on resale prices of the content items or perform other analysis on the data.","The monitoring and reporting module  can report information and statistics to end users, developers, content licensors or personnel (e.g., administrators) of the content management system . For example, the monitoring and reporting module  may track content submission histories, content sales, versioning data for submitted content, purchase data, or the like. In some such embodiments, the monitoring and reporting module  may provide interactive feedback to the user including, for example, current status of a purchase, time till completion of a download, etc. In some embodiments, the monitoring and reporting module  can generate a report detailing or summarizing the purchase data and communicate the report to users via electronic mail or provide access to the report, usage statistics, or interactive feedback via Web services.","The licensing module  can monitor and track content licenses  from content licensors. The licensing module  may also track conditions associated with content licenses  and determine if the conditions are being fulfilled by a licensees. For example, the licensing module  may determine if the number of content items generated by a licensee exceeds a quota, maximum amount, or threshold specified by the content license. In another example, the content license may prohibit reselling of content items, limit the applications in which the content items may be used, or otherwise prohibit particular uses of the content items associated with the content license.","In some embodiments, the licensing module  generates report(s) that indicate whether the number of content items exceeds the quota, maximum amount, or threshold specified by the content license or whether the licensee is otherwise non-compliant with the content license. The licensing module  may transmit such reports to the content licensor or otherwise notify the content licensor to violations of the content license.","The licensing module  may also determine license fees or other payments due to the content licensor. The licensing module  may arrange for purchase payments (or other payments) to be divided between at least the content licensor and the developer, for example, by accessing and\/or crediting accounts associated with the content licensor and developer with portions of the purchase payments. The licensing module  may also determine how to apportion the payments between developers and content licensors. For example, a content license may specify that a certain percentage of proceeds from sales of content items be given to the content licensor and the licensing module  can calculate the percentage of the payment due to the content licensor.","The DRM module  can generate or validate authorization or security tokens (or other authentication data) for managing content items. The security tokens can be used to control usage of the content items or manage transfer of the content items. For example, the security tokens can include computing device identifiers or other parameters that uniquely identify user computing devices . The security token created by the DRM module  can be associated with the content item . The security token can be created to include a checksum of the content item and information relating to the user who purchases the content item from the content management system . For example, the security token can include a user identifier and a device identifier, to name a couple. Some events, such as transfer of the associated content item to another user computing device  can cause the content management system  to update the security token.","In some embodiments, the security or authorization token can provide additional functionality. For example, the security token may include an expiration parameter. The expiration parameter or field can be used to end usage of a content item. For example, a token associated with a baseball player content item may be valid only for a particular season (e.g., the 2011 season). In another example, the security token can include a parameter identifying an associated content license. This content license parameter can allow the content management system  to determine the total number of content items generated under a particular content license, and to thereby monitor compliance with the content license. In one embodiment, analyzing the security token can include determining that the content management system  created the security token or that the security token is unexpired or otherwise valid (e.g. when receiving a request to validate a token from a source computing device). In one embodiment, analyzing the security token can include creating a checksum of the content item and comparing the checksum to one included with the security token. In one embodiment, the security token is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) (or other data schema), compressed using zlib (or other data compression software), encrypted using a private asymmetric key known by the content management system , and encoded in Base  format (or other encoding format).","The security token may also include parameters specifying the situations in which the content item associated with the token may be used. In some embodiments, the security token includes a time limit specifying how long the security token is valid; in such embodiments, the content management system  authenticates the token only if the time limit has not passed or if a timestamp of the security token is within the time limit or within a threshold time range (e.g., within 30 minutes of purchase, 1 hour, 1 day, etc). In some embodiments, the security token is a one-time use token, and the content management system  authenticates the token only if the token has not already been used.","In creating the checksum, digital certificate(s) associated with the application developers and\/or the content management system  can be included with or applied to the checksum. Further, in creating a security token, a certificate can be used to sign the security token; this provides a level of assurance that the security token has not been modified by an entity other than the entity that created the security token. Generally, a digital certificate identifies a user or an organization and provides a level of assurance that the user or the organization is who he\/she\/it claims to be. This level of assurance is associated with the trust placed in the certificate authority that issues the certificate. The certificate typically includes, among possibly other things, a public key associated with the certificate owner's private key and an issuer that identifies an entity (e.g., the certificate authority) that verified the certificate owner. Non-limiting examples of certificate provider systems or certificate authorities include VeriSign\u2122, GoDaddy\u2122, and Comodo\u2122. Generally, these certificate provider systems are the certificate issuers identified with the digital certificate. The certificate may be stored in the data storage  or other system capable of storing certificates.","In response to the user's purchasing a digital content item, the content management system  can provide the digital content item along with the security token to the purchasing user computing device . The DRM client module  on the user computing device  can use the security token to determine whether to provide access to the content item on the user computing device . In the event of a resale of the content item, the content management system  can cause the security token to expire in order to prevent further access to the content item or the content management system  can cause the content item to be disabled or deleted, for example, by communicating the DRM client module  and issuing a command to remove the content item.","In some embodiments, the content management system  maintains accounts for its users. The content management system may maintain different types of accounts for different types of users (e.g., developers, customers and content licensors) or the accounts may be the same type. In one embodiment, the account of a developer can include information about the developer's applications and content items, such as the price of the content, description of the content, current version of the content or other account information. This data can be updated based at least partly on content submissions sent by the developer. For example, if a developer wants to publish a new version a content item, the developer can register the new content item. The content management system can then update the information associated with that content item. Customer accounts may include information about content purchases, credit card or payment information, account balance, shipping options, address, user computing device information (e.g., unique device identifier, device model, device specifications, operation system, IP address, port address, network address), or the like. In some embodiments (e.g., where the content management system  is associated with a content marketplace system ), the content management system  may maintain or have access to accounts of content marketplace system  customers. In some embodiments, the accounts of the content management system  and the content marketplace system  are the same.","In some embodiments, the content management system  may be configured differently than illustrated in . For example, various functionalities provided by the illustrated modules can be combined, rearranged, added, or deleted. In some embodiments, additional or different processors or modules may perform some or all of the functionalities described with reference to the example embodiment illustrated in . Many implementation variations are possible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","105","105","100","100","100","105"],"i":["a","b "]},"In event  of , a developer system  or developer  associated with the system requests that the content management system  create application-specific digital store(s)  for content items for a given application developed by the developer . In response to the request, the content management system  creates such digital store(s). In some embodiments, the application-specific digital store  may be created automatically by the content management system , for example, after receiving an application submission from a developer.","An application-specific digital store  may be distinct or separate from the application associated with the digital store. Thus, the digital store  does not need to be created by the developer  as part of the application. Rather, the digital store  may be dynamically created by the content management system , thereby allowing digital stores to be created as needed. For example, referring back to the baseball fantasy baseball example, additional digital stores  may be created if additional end users begin using the application, thereby allowing additional groups or leagues to be created, as needed. In another example, a digital store  may be created for a particular period of time, such as a sports season, with a new digital store  with updated content items (e.g., sports player content items) generated at the beginning of the next season. This can allow application content items to be updated without requiring changes to the application itself.","In some embodiments, the application-specific digital stores  may be part of the content marketplace system . For example, the digital stores  may be a set of detail pages or content items in the catalog  associated with the given application. The digital store  may be accessible directly through the given application or may be accessible as a web service using a web browser. In one embodiment, a user of the given application uses the application-specific digital store  to view or purchase content items associated with the given application or buy, sell or trade content items with other application users.","Depending on the particular application, there may be one or more digital stores  created. For example, a fantasy baseball application may require multiple digital stores  corresponding to different leagues or groups of users. In some embodiments, content items are unique to or of limited number in each application-specific digital store. For example, a given baseball player may be unique to a particular user group, wherein only a single user in the group can draft the given baseball player.","At event  of , a user  or user computing device  purchases a content item from an electronic catalog from a content marketplace system  or an application-specific digital store . The catalog may be viewed within an application  associated with the content item or from a separate program, such as a web browser or application marketplace (e.g., an \u201capp store\u201d) or other application configured to provide or list items from the electronic catalog  to the user. The user  may purchase the content items from the catalog using the computing device . A user account associated with the user  and\/or user computing device may be charged for the purchase, for example, by a content marketplace system  that hosts or otherwise provides the electronic catalog .","In event  of , the user  or user computing device requests the content item to be listed for resale by the content management system . For example, if the user gets tired of the content item or otherwise no longer wants it, then the user  can resell or trade the content item on the application specific digital store . In some embodiments, the developer  may be incentivized to allow resale of content items by receiving a portion of the payment received during a resale of the content item. The payment may be a flat fee or a percentage of the sale.","In some embodiments, the content management system  may validate the content item listed for sale. Such validation can include checking that the user  actually owns the content item, that the content item is unexpired or other validation procedures. In one embodiment, validation is performed by examining the security token associated with the content item.","In event  of , a second user  purchases the content item through the content management system . The content management system  can bill the second user  for the purchase price of the content item and then provide the payment to the user  or credit an account of the user . The content management system  may receive a portion of the payment as a fee. The content management system  may also provide a portion of the payment to the developer  or the developer's account.","In event  of , the content management system  transfers content rights for the content item between from the first user  to the second user . In one embodiment, content rights may be managed by the DRM module  or another component of the content management system . In one embodiment, the transfer is accomplished by updating a security token (or other data structure) of the content management system  as described above. For example, the security token associated with the content item may be updated or re-generated to reflect the transfer to the second user computing device associated with the second user .","In event  of , the content management system  removes the content item from the user computing device .

Data representing the content licenses may be stored by the content management system . For example, the content licenses may be represented as content license objects or data structures that contain information about the content license, such as limitations, maximum amount of content items creatable, allowed or disallowed uses, royalties or other terms. The content management system  may purchase the content licenses from the licensor systems and sublicense the content licenses to developers or provide the content licenses on behalf of the licensors as a service. Such licensing by the content management system may involve communicating with the developer systems  to execute licensing transactions.","In event  of , the content management system  creates license bundle(s) , . The license bundles may be created by combining content licenses from two or more licensors , . The licenses may be grouped based on common subject matter. For example, the license bundles may be for characters, automobile designs, sports data or the like. By combining license bundles, the content management system  simplifies the content licensing process for developers.","In some embodiments, the license bundles are created based on selections from developers. For example, the developer may select content licenses that it is interested in. In some embodiments, content licenses may be selected individually.","In event  of , the developer  selects a license bundle from a plurality of license bundles. In , the developer selects licenses bundle A . The license bundle may include terms or parameters of use. For example, the license bundle  may specify a maximum number of content items created under the license. It can also specify the type or number of applications in which the content items may be used. Other terms may also be specified by the license, such as whether content items may be resold between users.","In event  of , the developer  generates content items corresponding to the license bundle A. The content items may be used for any application of the developer. The content items can be listed on a content marketplace system  and provided to users for purchase.","In some embodiments, the content management system  determines whether the content items created by the developer  are in compliance with the terms of the license bundle . For example, the content management system  may determine if any limits specified by the license bundle  are exceeded.","In event  of , a user  purchases content item(s) provided by the developer . The content management system  provides the content item to the user computing device  associated with the user . In some embodiments, the content management system  splits the purchase payment from the user  between the developer  and the licensors , .
