The United States government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to methods and compounds for controlling virulence in bacteria, methods of identifying further compounds for controlling virulence in bacteria, and methods, compounds, and compositions for treating subjects with bacterial infections to reduce virulence of bacteria in said subjects.","GacS\/GacA is a two component signal transduction system (\u201cTCSTS\u201d) that is widely distributed in many bacteria to respond to environmental stimuli and adapt to different environmental conditions. GacS is a putative histidine kinase sensor and GacA is the response regulator. The homologs of the TCSTS of GacS\/GacA have been reported in a variety of Gram-negative bacteria, including (BarA\/UvrY), spp., (BarA\/SirA), spp. (GacS\/GacA), (LetS\/LetA) and species.","GacS\/GacA and homologous systems regulate many virulence factors including, but not limited to, regulatory RNA, quorum sensing (\u201cQS\u201d) signals, type III secretion system (\u201cT3SS\u201d) genes, pectate lyases, proteases, biofilm formation, and toxins. For example, in , the GacS\/GacA system is located at the top of a regulatory cascade and functions as a central regulator by controlling an assortment of transcriptional and posttranscriptional factors. Mainly, the influence of the GacS\/GacA system on pectinase production and T3SS gene expression is channeled through a regulatory RNA system, the Rsm system, by activating rsmB which binds to and inhibits the T3SS mRNA decay effect of RsmA.","In addition to the GacS\/GacA-RsmA-rsmB-hrpL regulatory pathway, the T3SS of , which belongs to Group I T3SS of phytobacteria, is regulated by a HrpX\/Y-HrpS-HrpL pathway. The two-component system HrpX\/HrpY activates the gene encoding HrpS, which is required for expression of hrpL. HrpL, an alternative sigma factor, further activates expression of genes encoding the T3SS apparatus and its secreted products. Thus, the GacS\/GacA and HrpX\/HrpY TCSTS systems both exert a regulatory effect in , in particular through the T3SS system.","In one embodiment, the invention may provide a method of reducing virulence in a bacterium comprising at least one of a GacS\/GacA-type system, a HrpX\/HrpY-type system, a T3SS-type system, and a Rsm-type system, the method comprising contacting the bacterium with an effective amount of a compound described herein, such as compounds of Formula (I), Formula (II), Formula (III), Formula (IV), Formula (V), Formula (VI) and Formula (VII) described herein.","In another embodiment, the invention may provide a compound selected from the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"245.36mm","wi":"54.27mm","file":"US09260382-20160216-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"221.57mm","wi":"46.06mm","file":"US09260382-20160216-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"238.17mm","wi":"74.00mm","file":"US09260382-20160216-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"239.01mm","wi":"48.09mm","file":"US09260382-20160216-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"240.28mm","wi":"55.54mm","file":"US09260382-20160216-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"237.57mm","wi":"68.66mm","file":"US09260382-20160216-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}]},"Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the following drawings.

Rsm is a novel type of post-transcriptional regulatory system that plays a critical role in gene expression. RsmA is a small RNA-binding protein that acts by lowering the half-life of the target mRNA. rsmB is an untranslated regulatory RNA that binds RsmA and inhibits its activity by forming an inactive ribonucleoprotein complex. In Ech3937, GacS\/GacA upregulates hrpL mRNA through a post-transcriptional regulation by enhancing the rsmB RNA level, which binds to RsmA and inhibits the hrpL mRNA decay effect of RsmA ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"Dickeya dadantii "},"The T3SS contributes to bacterial virulence within a host. A gacA deletion mutant of (3937) was found to exhibit diminished production of pectate lyase, protease, and cellulose, enzymes that normally lead to loss of structural integrity of plant cell walls. Diminished production of enzymes that attack the plant cell walls leads to diminished bacterial virulence.","Several compounds, including o-coumaric acid (\u201cOCA\u201d) and t-cinnamic acid (\u201cTCA\u201d), have been identified as inducers of the GacS\/GacA regulatory system. Induction of the GacS\/GacA system in turn affects the Rsm system, which further affects the expression of T3SS genes, including pectinase genes.","In further studies the inventors have screened compounds, including t-cinnamic acid, o-coumaric acid, m-coumaric acid, p-coumaric acid, hydrocinnamic acid, phenoxyacetic acid, trans-2-phenylcyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, trans-3-(3-pyridyl)acrylic acid, trans-3-indoleacrylic acid, 2-methylcinnamic acid, 2-chlorocinnamic acid, methyl trans-cinnamate, and cinnamyl alcohol. Two compounds, p-coumaric acid (PCA) and cinnamyl alcohol, were found to reduce induction of virulence in . Without being limited as to theory, PCA appears to reduce virulence through the HrpX\/HrpY system (see , Example 10).","Based on the discovery that OCA, TCA, PCA, and cinnamyl alcohol can regulate (i.e. promote or reduce) bacterial virulence, further screening was conducted in order to identify compounds that reduce bacterial virulence. Various compounds were synthesized and screened for their ability to reduce bacterial virulence. The synthesized compounds were tested for an ability to reduce virulence of bacteria having a two-component signal transduction system such as. a GacS\/GacA system (or a homolog of the GacS\/GacA system), a HrpX\/HrpY system (or a homolog of the HrpX\/HrpY system), an Rsm system (or homolog), and\/or a T3SS system (or homolog).","The compounds produced for testing include compounds referred to herein as \u201cphenylpropanoid derivatives.\u201d A description of phenylpropanoid derivatives generally is found in U.S. patent application Ser.

For example, \u201creducing expression\u201d of a polynucleotide in a bacterium in response to contacting the bacterium with a test compound means lowering the amount of expression of the polynucleotide (e.g. lowering the amount of polynucleotide-encoded mRNA or protein formed) relative to the level of expression of the polynucleotide in the same bacterium under control conditions. The control conditions may include exposing the bacterium to the same conditions without contacting the bacterium with the test compound.","\u201cReducing virulence\u201d in a bacterium refers to altering expression of genes associated with virulence, including regulators of virulence. Reducing virulence also refers to physical and biochemical manifestations of virulence including those manifestations associated with any step of the bacterial life cycle when it is associated with a host, including without limitation the adherence, invasion, replication, evasion of host defenses, and transmittal to a new host. Reduced bacterial virulence may be manifested in the form of reduced symptoms in a host, and thus may be detected by monitoring the host for a reduced reaction to the bacteria associated therewith. Reduced virulence may arise as a result of either inhibition or stimulation of a two-component regulatory system such as a GacS\/GacA-type system or a HrpX\/HrpY-type system, which could lead to increases or decreases of polynucleotide and polypeptide production. For example, reduced virulence may be associated with increase production of a repressor, reduced production of a transcription factor, or increased production of enzymes or toxins. Regulation of bacterial virulence may lead to alterations in the production of pectinase, exoprotease, syringomycin, syringolin, alginate, tolaasin, siderophores, pyocyanin, cyanide, lipase, type III secretion system (T3SS) genes, cholera toxin, polyhydroxybutyrate, or a polynucleotide controlled by a GacS\/GacA-type system or a HrpX\/HrpY-type system in a Gram negative bacterium. A reduction in virulence may be at least about a 1% reduction, at least about a 10% reduction, at least about a 20% reduction, at least about a 30% reduction, at least about a 40% reduction, at least about a 50% reduction, at least about a 60% reduction, at least about a 70% reduction, at least about a 80% reduction, at least about a 90% reduction, or at least about a 100% reduction of virulence, as measured by any assay described herein or known to those of skill in the art, when measured against a suitable control.","\u201cComponents\u201d of a GacS\/GacA-type system, a HrpX\/HrpY-type system, a T3SS-type system, and a Rsm-type system include without limitation polynucleotides and polypeptides that are part of the respective systems (including genes and gene products of the named operons) as well as polynucleotides, polypeptides, and other molecules that regulate the systems including genes and gene products that are upstream or downstream of the system. \u201cComponents\u201d also includes molecules that are products of the genes or gene products of the systems as well as genes or gene products that generate posttranslational modifications of polynucleotides or polypeptides of the systems. A \u201cregulator\u201d is a component that changes (increases or decreases) an expression or activity level of a component. A \u201crepressor\u201d is a component that decreases an expression or activity level of a component, arising from either an increase or a decrease in the amount or activity level of the repressor. An \u201ceffector\u201d is a component that puts into effect the activity of the system, e.g. exoenzymes of the T3SS-type system are nonlimiting examples of effectors. A component is \u201cassociated with virulence\u201d if a change in an amount or activity of the component leads, directly or indirectly, to an increase or reduction in some aspect of bacterial virulence.","A \u201cphenylpropanoid-type inhibitory compound\u201d as used herein includes phenylpropanoid compounds, such as p-coumaric acid or cinnamyl alcohol, that reduce bacterial virulence. In addition, \u201cphenylpropanoid-type inhibitory compound\u201d also includes phenylpropanoid derivative that have been found to be \u201cactive compounds,\u201d i.e. compounds that have shown through screening to have bacterial virulence-reducing activity.","A bacterium is \u201cassociated with\u201d (or \u201cassociated therewith\u201d) a host or subject such as a plant or animal (including a human) when the bacterium is in or on the host or subject. For a plant host or subject, an associated bacterium can be on a plant part such as a root, stem, leaf, flower, or fruit of the plant, or in the soil adjacent to the roots or base of the stem. For an animal host or subject, an associated bacterium can be on the outer surface of the animal or on an inner surface such as an intestinal surface, or the associated bacterium can be within the animal, e.g. in a tissue or fluid of the animal or any other internal portion of the animal.","\u201cTreating\u201d or \u201ctreatment,\u201d as used herein in the context of treating a condition, pertains generally to treatment and therapy, whether of a human, an animal (e.g. in veterinary applications), or plants, in which some desired therapeutic effect is achieved, for example, the reduction of the progress of the condition, and includes a reduction in the rate of progress, a halt in the rate of progress, amelioration of the condition, and cure of the condition.

For example, compounds may have the present structures except for the replacement of hydrogen by deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by a C- or C-enriched carbon.","A compound described herein can be in the form of a salt, e.g., a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d includes salts of the active compounds that are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amino, or magnesium salt, or a similar salt. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, for example, Berge et al, J. Pharma. Science 1977, 66: 1-19). Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.","The neutral forms of the compounds may be regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the compound for the purposes of the present invention.","In addition to salt forms, the present invention may also provide compounds that are in a prodrug form. Prodrugs of the compounds described herein are those compounds that readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds described herein. For instance, prodrugs for carboxylic acid compounds of the invention include a variety of esters. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the present invention by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to the compounds of the present invention when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent.","Synthesis of Compounds","Compounds that may be used in the methods described herein may be synthesized using a variety of methods. Compounds that may be used in the methods described herein include phenylpropanoids, which are plant-derived organic compounds synthesized from phenylalanine. Phenylpropanoid derivatives can be made by adding or removing substituents using methods known to those of skill in the art. As shown in the Examples, phenylpropanoid derivatives such as those disclosed herein can be synthesized de novo or by modifying naturally-occurring compounds.","The synthetic routes for the compounds are described in the schemes presented in  and -. In , aryl bromides A1 are reacted with ethyl acrylate to give ethyl trans-cinnamates A2 under the Heck reaction conditions (Patel, B. A., et al. 1977, 42: 3903-3907). After removing the protecting group by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), the ester was displaced by hydroxylamine to result in hydroxamates A3 with hydroxy, hydroxythio, amino and other groups in phenyl group, respectively. Basic hydrolysis of esters A2 followed by TFA deprotection affords cinnamic acid derivatives A4. The carboxyl group in A4 can be reduced by diborane, resulting in cinnamyl alcohols A5. By following the reported procedure (Zhang, X., et al. 2002, 67: 9471-9474), hydrazides A6 can be obtained from acids A4 by treating with HOBt and hydrazine. Under the Corey-Chaykovsky cyclopropanation reaction conditions (TMSOI, NaH, DMSO) (Corey, E. J., Chaykovsky, M. 1965, 87: 1353-1364), ethyl cinnamates A2 are transformed to cyclopropanyl esters A7. The latter can be further converted to cyclopropanyl hydroxamatates A8 by TFA deprotection and reacting with hydroxylamine, or to the corresponding alcohols A9 by LAH reduction and TFA de-protection. The analogs with other heterocycles, such as indolyl, thionaphthyl, naphthyl, and other groups can be synthesized in the similar ways.","As shown in , benzaldehydes B1 react with ethyl chloroacetate to afford ethyl oxiranecarboxylates B2 in the presence of sodium ethoxide (Li, S. W., et al. 1998, 26: 45-50). Conversion of B2 to 3-aryl oxiranecarboxylic acids B4 will be accomplished by deprotection with TFA followed by basic hydrolysis ().","As shown in , Knoevenagel reaction of benzaldehydes B1 with diethylphosphonoacetic acid leads to the formation of diethyl trans-2-arylvinylphosphonates C1 (Krawczyk, H., Albrecht, L. 2005, 17: 2887-2896). Upon treatment with trimethylsilyl bromide (TMSBr) and TFA, the phosphonates C1 can be converted to trans-2-arylvinylphosphoric acids C3 (). In the similar way, trans-2-(indol-3-yl)vinylphosphoric acids C4 can be obtained from the corresponding indol-3-aldehydes.","As shown in , In the presence of n-butyllithium, benzaldehydes B1 are reacted with ethyl diethylphosphoryl-methanesulfonate to generate ethyl trans-2-arylethenylsulfonates D1 (Niimi, T., et al. 2001, 44: 4737-4740) (). The ethyl sulfonates D1 can be cleaved with tetra-n-butylammonium iodide (n-BuNI), and further deprotection with TFA affords the trans-2-arylethenylsulfonic acids D2. Corey-Chaykovsky cyclopropanation reaction of D1 produces cyclopropanyl sulfonates D3, and the corresponding sulfonic acids D4 will be obtained from D3 after treating with n-BuNI and TFA.","In , cinnamic acids are converted into the corresponding methyl esters. The latter can be further transformed into hydroxamic acids by treating with hydroxylamine under basic condition. When the substituent in the phenyl group is halo, methyl, methoxy, or other groups which will not form amide\/ester, the hydroxamic acids can be obtained directly from the corresponding carboxylic acids. By refluxing with ammonia in methanol, the corresponding amides can be obtained from the methyl esters. The esters can readily reduced by LiAlH\/AlClsystem, resulting in cinnamyl alcohols. By employing the reported procedure (Zhang et al. 2002), hydrazides can be obtained from cinnamic acids by treating with HOBt and EDC followed by hydrazine.","Under the Corey-Chaykovsky cyclopropanation reaction conditions (Corey and Chaykovsky, 1965), ethyl 4-methoxycinnamate was transformed into cyclopropanyl ester (100). Upon hydrolysis, acid 105 was obtained. Demethylation of 100 with borane tribromide gave 106. The latter was further hydrolyzed with lithium hydroxide to afford the corresponding carboxylic acid 107 ().","Knoevenagel reaction (Krawczyk and Albrecht 2005) of 4-hydroxybenzaldehydes with diethylphosphonoacetic acid leads to the formation of diethyl trans-2-arylvinylphosphonates 114. Upon treatment with trimethylsilyl bromide (TMSBr), the phosphonate was converted into vinylphosphoric acid 115 (). In the similar way, other trans-2-arylvinylphosphoric acids can be obtained from the corresponding arylaldehydes.","In the presence of n-butyllithium, benzaldehyde can reacted with ethyl diethylphosphoryl-methanesulfonate to generate ethyl trans-2-arylethenylsulfonates (Niimi et al. 2001) (). The resulting ethyl sulfonates can be cleaved with tetra-n-butylammonium iodide (n-BuNI), affording the trans-2-arylethenylsulfonic acids.","Phthalimide potassium salt can be alkylated with allyl chloride in DMF to produce N-allylphthalimide. Under the Heck reaction conditions (Patel et al. 1977), N-allylphthalimide reacted with aryl bromide to give N-cinnamyl phthalimide. Upon treatment with hydrazine, cinnamyl amine was obtained from N-cinnamyl phthalimide ().","As can be appreciated by the skilled artisan, alternative methods of synthesizing the compounds of the formulae herein will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art. Additionally, the various synthetic steps may be performed in an alternate sequence or order to give the desired compounds. Synthetic chemistry transformations and protecting group methodologies (protection and deprotection) useful in synthesizing the compounds described herein are known in the art and include, for example, those such as described in R. Larock, , VCH Publishers (1989); T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, 2d. Ed., John Wiley and Sons (1991); L. Fieser and M. Fieser, , John Wiley and Sons (1994); and L. Paquette, ed., , John Wiley and Sons (1995), and subsequent editions thereof.","Activity of Compounds","Activity assays may be carried out on intact bacteria or on isolated bacterial components. For example, receptor portions of the GacS\/GacA-type system or HrpX\/HrpY-type system may be reconstituted in vitro, e.g. in membrane microsomes, or as isolated, soluble protein components. In one embodiment, the assay includes measurement of binding affinity of a test compound to the GacS-type or HrpX-type polypeptide.","The assays may also be conducted on genetically-engineered bacteria in which the GacS\/GacA-type system or HrpX\/HrpY-type system is coupled to a reporter. Thus, a test compound can be screened by contacting the compound with an appropriately engineered bacterium so that the binding and\/or activation of the GacS\/GacA pathway by the compound will be directly reported without the need to assay a downstream target or effector such as a component of the Rsm pathway or T3SS system. The reporter in the genetically-engineered bacterium could be linked to any number of known fluorescent or colorimetric assays, e.g. green fluorescent protein (GFP), to make possible rapid screening of large numbers of compounds.","Various assays may be used to test the efficacy of the compounds, such as any of the assays described herein, including without limitation promoter-probe bioreporter assays, cell sorting (FACS), pectinase activity assays, qRT-PCR analysis, analysis of the phosphorylation of GacA or HrpY, leaf maceraction assays, growth kinetics assays, plate assays, analysis of pellicle formation, analysis of exoenzyme production, and spectrophotometric quantification assays. Assays may be performed using or any other suitable bacterial species or strain having a GacS\/GacA-type system, a HrpX\/HrpY-type system, an Rsm-type system, and\/or a T3SS-type system. Leaf maceraction assays may be carried out using leaves from any of a variety of plants, including African violet, Chinese cabbage, or witloof chicory leaves.","In addition to the methods described herein, additional methods known to those skilled in the art may be employed as needed in screening and assaying the synthesized compounds. For example, to detect and measure amounts of polypeptides, methods such as SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA) may be used, among other techniques. To detect and measure polynucleotides, polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) as well as electrophoretic mobility-based methods such as Southern and Northern blotting may be used, among other techniques.","The bacterium can be any one of a number of virulent bacterial species or strains, including those bacterial species or strains having at least one of a GacS\/GacA-type system, a HrpX\/HrpY-type system, a Rsm-type system, and\/or a T3SS-type system.

Those compounds that demonstrate activity in reducing bacterial virulence in the assays may then be used as antimicrobial compounds, for example as described herein.","Accordingly, the invention may provide a method of screening a compound for an ability to reduce virulence of a bacterium comprising at least one of a GacS\/GacA-type system, a HrpX\/HrpY-type system, a T3SS-type system, and a Rsm-type system.

Suitable active substances may also be granulated in the manner which is conventional for the production of fertilizer granules, if desired in a mixture with fertilizers.","In one embodiment, the concentration of active compound in wettable powders may be, for example, about 10 to about 95% by weight, the remainder to 100% by weight is composed of conventional formulation components. In the case of emulsifiable concentrates, the concentration of active compound may be about 1 to about 85% by weight, preferably about 5 to about 80% by weight. Formulations in the form of dusts usually contain about 1 to about 25% by weight, mostly about 5 to about 20% by weight of active compound, sprayable solutions about 0.2 to about 25% by weight, preferably about 2 to about 20% by weight, of active compound. In the case of granules, such as water-dispersible granules, the active compound content depends partly on whether the active compound is liquid or solid and on which granulation auxiliaries and fillers are used. The content in water-dispersible granules is generally between about 10 and about 90% by weight.","In addition, the active compound formulations mentioned contain, if appropriate, the adhesives, wetting agents, dispersing agents, emulsifiers, penetrants, solvents, fillers or carriers which are conventional in each case.","For use, the formulations, present in commercially-available form, may be diluted, if appropriate, in a customary manner, for example using water in the case of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions and water-dispersible granules. Preparations in the form of dusts, granules for soil application and\/or broadcasting, and also sprayable solutions are usually not further diluted with other inert substances before use.","The application rate required for the compositions varies with the external conditions, such as, inter alia, temperature, humidity, and the nature of the compound and composition used.","Further information regarding formulation and application of compositions for agricultural use are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,447,903, incorporated herein by reference.","The compositions may be applied to different parts of the plant, including leaves, stems, roots, buds fruits, frill, stump, bark, and roots, as well as to soil in the vicinity of a plant (e.g., the rhizosphere). Methods of application may include spraying, irrigating, dusting, and spreading or broadcasting of granules, powders, or other solid or liquid forms.","The composition may be applied to leaf surfaces, stems of plants including agricultural crops, and irrigated into soil to protect root systems from human and other pathogens (including, for example, O157:H7 on lettuce, spinach) which may be present as contaminants from exposure to animal waste.","The composition may be applied to the surfaces of stored crops (including without limitation onions, potatoes, grains, squash, melons) to reduce post-harvest infection and contamination by plant, animal, and human pathogens.","The composition may be applied to leaf surfaces, stems, fruits, and other portions of plants intended for consumption by animals including humans, either for fresh consumption or consumption following cooking or other preparation. The composition may be applied at various stages including while the plant is still in the ground; post-harvest; and prior to, during, or after shipping. Application of the composition may reduce post-harvest infection and contamination by plant, animal, and human pathogens.","The composition may be applied once or in repeated applications. Applications may be repeated any number of times daily, weekly, monthly, or annually. Applications may be repeated about 1 to about 100 times per day, week, month, or year, as needed.","Applying a composition comprising an active compound may reduce virulence of bacteria associated with the plant.","Use in Animals Including Humans","The active compound or a pharmaceutical composition comprising the active compound may be administered to an animal subject by any convenient route of administration, whether systemically\/peripherally or at the site of desired action, including but not limited to, oral (e.g. by ingestion); topical (including e.g. transdermal, intranasal, ocular, buccal, and sublingual); pulmonary (e.g. by inhalation or insufflation therapy using, e.g. an aerosol, e.g. through mouth or nose); rectal; vaginal; parenteral, for example, by injection, including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intracardiac, intrathecal, intraspinal, intracapsular, subcapsular, intraorbital, intraperitoneal, intratracheal, subcuticular, intraarticular, subarachnoid, and intrasternal; by implant of a depot, for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Additional modes of administration may include adding the active compound and\/or a composition comprising the active compound to a food or beverage, including a water supply for an animal, to supply the active compound as part of the animal's diet.","The subject may include, without limitation, a eukaryote, an animal, a vertebrate animal, a bird, a reptile, an insect, a mammal, a rodent (e.g., a guinea pig, a hamster, a rat, a mouse), canine (e.g., a dog), feline (e.g., a cat), equine (e.g., a horse), ovine (e.g., a sheep), bovine (e.g., a cow), a primate such as a monkey (e.g. marmoset, baboon) or an ape (e.g. gorilla, chimpanzee, orangutan, gibbon), or a human.","While it is possible for the active compound to be administered alone, in some embodiments the active compound may be presented as a pharmaceutical composition (e.g., formulation) comprising at least one active compound, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, adjuvants, excipients, diluents, fillers, buffers, stabilizers, preservatives, lubricants, or other materials well known to those skilled in the art and optionally other therapeutic or prophylactic agents.","Thus, the present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions, as defined above, and methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one active compound, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, buffers, adjuvants, stabilizers, or other materials, as described herein.","Suitable carriers, excipients, etc. can be found in standard pharmaceutical texts, for example Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1990.","The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any method well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations may be prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active compound with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product.","Formulations may be in the form of liquids, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, syrups, tablets, lozenges, granules, powders, capsules, cachets, pills, ampoules, suppositories, pessaries, ointments, gels, pastes, creams, sprays, mists, foams, lotions, oils, boluses, electuaries, or aerosols.","Formulations suitable for oral administration (e.g., by ingestion) may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active compound; as a powder or granules; as a solution or suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion; as a bolus; as an electuary; or as a paste.","A tablet may be made by conventional means, e.g., compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active compound in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with one or more binders (e.g., povidone, gelatin, acacia, sorbitol, tragacanth, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose); fillers or diluents (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc, silica); disintegrants (e.g., sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked povidone, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose); surface-active or dispersing or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate); and preservatives (e.g., methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, sorbic acid). Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active compound therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile. Tablets may optionally be provided with an enteric coating, to provide release in parts of the gut other than the stomach.","Formulations suitable for topical administration (e.g., transdermal, intranasal, ocular, buccal, and sublingual) may be formulated as an ointment, cream, suspension, lotion, powder, solution, past, gel, spray, aerosol, or oil. Alternatively, a formulation may comprise a patch or a dressing such as a bandage or adhesive plaster impregnated with active compounds and optionally one or more excipients or diluents. In addition, a formulation may be added to a conventional bandage, e.g. to a gauze portion that contacts the wound, as an antimicrobial agent.","Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active compound in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active compound in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active compound in a suitable liquid carrier.","Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active compound is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active compound.","Formulations suitable for nasal administration, wherein the carrier is a solid, include a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, in the range of about 20 to about 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e., by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid for administration as, for example, nasal spray, nasal drops, or by aerosol administration by nebulizer, include aqueous or oily solutions of the active compound.","Formulations suitable for administration by inhalation include those presented as an aerosol spray from a pressurized pack, with the use of a suitable propellant, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichoro-tetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gases.","Formulations suitable for topical administration via the skin include ointments, creams, and emulsions. When formulated in an ointment, the active compound may optionally be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active compounds may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base. If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example, at least about 30% w\/w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e., an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane-1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active compound through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethylsulfoxide and related analogues.","When formulated as a topical emulsion, the oily phase may optionally comprise merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), or it may comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and\/or fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.","Suitable emulgents and emulsion stabilizers include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate and sodium lauryl sulphate. The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties, since the solubility of the active compound in most oils likely to be used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations may be very low. Thus the cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as diisoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the last three being preferred esters. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required. Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and\/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils can be used.","Formulations suitable for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising, for example, cocoa butter or a salicylate.","Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active compound, such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.","Formulations suitable for parenteral administration (e.g., by injection, including cutaneous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal), include aqueous and non-aqueous isotonic, pyrogen-free, sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, preservatives, stabilizers, bacteriostats in addition to the active compound, and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents, and liposomes or other microparticulate systems which are designed to target the compound to blood components or one or more organs. Examples of suitable isotonic vehicles for use in such formulations include Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Solution, or Lactated Ringer's Injection. Typically, the concentration of the active compound in the solution is from about 1 ng\/ml to about 1 \u03bcg\/ml, although other concentrations are possible and are encompassed within the invention. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example, ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets. Formulations may be in the form of liposomes or other microparticulate systems which are designed to target the active compound to blood components or one or more organs.","It will be appreciated that appropriate dosages of the active compounds, and compositions comprising the active compounds, can vary from patient to patient. Determining the optimal dosage will generally involve the balancing of the level of therapeutic benefit against any risk or deleterious side effects of the treatments of the present invention. The selected dosage level will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the activity of the particular compound, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds, and\/or materials used in combination, and the age, sex, weight, condition, general health, and prior medical history of the patient. The amount of compound and route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician, although generally the dosage will be to achieve local concentrations at the site of action which achieve the desired effect without causing substantial harmful or deleterious side-effects.","Administration in vivo can be effected in one dose, continuously or intermittently (e.g., in divided doses at appropriate intervals) throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the art and will vary with the formulation used for therapy, the purpose of the therapy, the target cell being treated, and the subject being treated. Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician.","In general, a suitable dose of the active compound is in the range of about 100 \u03bcg to about 250 mg per kilogram body weight of the subject per day. Where the active compound is a salt, an ester, prodrug, or the like, the amount administered is calculated on the basis of the parent compound and so the actual weight to be used is increased proportionately.","Further information regarding formulation of and treatment with pharmaceutical compositions are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,196,085, incorporated herein by reference.","The composition may be administered once, on a continuous basis (e.g. by an intravenous drip), or on a periodic\/intermittent basis, including about once per hour, about once per two hours, about once per four hours, about once per eight hours, about once per twelve hours, about once per day, about once per two days, about once per three days, about twice per week, about once per week, and about once per month.

For FACS analysis, samples were collected by centrifugation, washed with 1\u00d7 phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at 13,000 rpm for 1 min, and re-suspended in 1\u00d7PBS to ca 10CFU\/ml prior to being run in a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, CA). Three replicates were performed for each treatment.","qRT-PCR Analysis","Bacterial strains were grown in MM. Total RNA from the bacterial cells was isolated by using the TRI reagent method (Sigma, Mo.) and treated with Turbo DNA-free DNase kits (Ambion, Tex.) as described (Peng et al., 2006). An iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, CA) was used to synthesize cDNA from 0.5 \u03bcg of treated total RNA. The Real Master Mix (Eppendorf, Westbury, N.Y.) was used for qRT-PCR reaction to quantify the cDNA level of target genes in different samples. The rplU was used as the endogenous control for data analysis. qRT-PCR data were analyzed using Relative Expression Software Tool as described (Pfaffl, M. W., Horgan, G. W., and Dempfle, L.

In this study, the expression of dspE of Ech3937 was further compared in bacterial cells grown in a nutrient rich LB medium, a nutrient-limited medium (MM), and the MM supplemented with Chinese cabbage juice (10% V\/V). For this purpose, a GFP reporter plasmid pdspE (pProbe-AT derivative with PCR fragment containing dspE promoter region) was used and cells cultured under different conditions were compared by flow cytometry. A higher total GFP intensity was observed in Ech3937 (pdspE) (Ech3937 cells carrying plasmid pdspE) grown in MM compared with the bacterial cells grown in LB (Table 2). The expression of dspE was further induced in MM supplemented with Chinese cabbage juice in comparison with the bacterial cells grown in MM alone.

Phenolic compounds constitute an important class of organic substances produced by plants. The phenolic compound SA is a signaling molecule that plays a role in host defenses. OCA and TCA are the biosynthetic precursors of SA and are also reported to induce the expression of defense-related genes in plants. OCA, TCA, and SA were examined to elucidate their effects on the expression of T3SS genes. The expression of the T3SS gene hrpN was examined in MM and MM supplemented with OCA, TCA, and SA, at concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mM, respectively.  show the promoter activities of hrpN in 3937 (Ech3937) grown in MM and MM supplemented with 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mM OCA, TCA, and SA at 12 h () and 24 h () post-inoculation. GFP intensity was determined on gated populations of bacterial cells by flow cytometry and analyzed with the Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.). The growth of Ech3937 in MM supplemented with different concentrations of OCA, TCA and SA was recorded. Compared with MM alone, the average GFP fluorescence intensity of bacterial cells of Ech3937 (phrpN) was increased approximately 4-fold when 0.05 mM of OCA and TCA were added to the medium (, B). The addition of SA did not result in increased GFP fluorescence intensity of Ech3937 (, B). No reduction of bacterial growth was observed when OCA, TCA, and SA were added into the MM (, B).","The concentration of the phenolic compound t-cinnamic acid (TCA) in healthy potato leaves is approximately 0.5 \u03bcM and levels in the leaves can rise to approximately 10 uM after exposure to a cell-free culture filtrate (CF) of E. c. carotovora. To investigate whether the level of the phenolic compounds in plants is able to induce the expression of T3SS gene, the expression of hrpN was examined using concentrations of TCA comparable to levels found in plants.

Compared with Ech-Rif (phrpA) grown in MM alone, a higher GFP intensity was observed in bacterial cells grown in MM supplemented with OCA. However, similar GFP intensity was observed in Ech137 (phrpA) cells grown in MM and MM supplemented with OCA, suggesting that OCA may induce the T3SS gene expression through Gac-Rsm pathway (Table 5). To further confirm that the influence of OCA on T3SS is through the Gac-Rsm system, the expression of gacA and rsmB was examined by qRT-PCR. The results showed that, compared with Ech3937 in MM alone (normalized to 1), a significantly higher rsmB mRNA (relative expression ratio 1.4, P=0.003) was observed in the bacterium grown in MM supplemented with OCA (). The effect of TCA on the mRNA level of rsmB of Ech3937 was also examined. Compared with Ech3937 grown in MM alone (normalized to 1), a significantly higher amount of rsmB mRNA was observed in Ech3937 grown in TCA (1.58, P=0.05). However, no significant difference in the level of gacA mRNA was observed in Ech3937 grown in MM and MM supplemented with OCA ().","HrpL appears to be involved in the induction of T3SS gene expression by the phenolic acids OCA and TCA, as the addition of OCA or TCA did not induce the T3SS gene expression (hrpA and hrpN) in the hrpL mutant background (Table 4). Given that T3SS genes are regulated through HrpX\/Y-HrpS-HrpL, experiments were performed to investigate whether OCA and TCA were able to induce the expression of T3SS genes in the absence of hrpX, hrpY, and hrpS, respectively. The GFP intensity of the wild-type Ech3937 and hrpX, hrpY, and hrpS mutants carrying phrpN grown in MM and MM supplemented with OCA and TCA, respectively, was measured ().  shows levels of expression of hrpN of Dickeya dadantii 3937 (Ech3937), hrpS mutant WPP90, hrpX mutant WPP67, hrpY mutant WPP92 in MM, MM supplemented with 0.1 mM OCA (MMOCA), and MM supplemented with 0.1 mM TCA (MMTCA). Ech3937 (pAT) is the wild-type containing the pPROBE-AT vector. The promoter activities were compared at 12 h of growth in the media. GFP intensity was determined on gated populations of bacterial cells by flow cytometry. The fluorescence intensities were an average GFP fluorescence intensity of total bacterial cells. Values (Mean Fluorescence Intensity; MFI) are a representative of three experiments. Three replicates were used in this experiment.

To further confirm the results of GFP-based FACS assays which showed auto-regulation of HrpL, the relative mRNA level of hrpS in Ech3937 and hrpL mutant Ech131 grown in MM was examined by qRT-PCR. Compared with Ech3937, a 4-fold higher level of hrpS mRNA was observed in Ech131 at 6 h of growth in MM (relative expression ratio 5.1, P=0.002). These results suggest that feedback inhibition of HrpL on hrpL itself and hrpS takes place in the bacterium. Similar GFP intensity was observed in Ech3937 and the hrpS mutant carrying phrpS, phrpX and phrpY, respectively, suggesting that HrpS did not regulate the expression of hrpS, hrpX and hrpY. Finally, similar GFP intensity was observed in Ech3937 and the hrpY mutant carrying phrpX and phrpY, respectively, suggesting that HrpY was unable to regulate the expression of hrpX and hrpY.","The following methods apply to Examples 4-9:","Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Media","The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this group of Examiners are listed in Table 6.

The DNA fragments of promoter regions of hrpA, hrpN, hrpL, and pelL were PCR amplified from Ech3937 chromosomal DNA and ligated into the pCR2.1-TOPO TA cloning vector system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., U.S.A.). The primer pair used for pelL promoter in this study is PpelL_F, 5\u2032ATG CGG TAA TGC GGG GAT3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:23) and PpelL_R, 5\u2032GGC CAG AAC TGA TGT ACT GT3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:24), which produces a 609-bp pelL promoter region sequence of Ech-Rif.

Because the gfp gene in the pPROBE-AT contains its own ribosome binding site, the stability of gfp mRNA should not be interfered by RsmA when a promoter-containing DNA region of Ech3937 is cloned into the reporter vector.","FACS Investigation of Promoter Activity","The bacterial cells of Ech-Rif and Ech137 carrying GFP reporter plasmid constructs were washed three times with 1\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer (8.0 g of NaCl, 0.2 g of KCl, 1.44 g of NaHPO, and 0.24 g of KHPOper liter, pH 7.2 to 7.4) and diluted to approximately 106 CFU\/ml before analysis. Bacterial cells were identified based on forward and side light scatter properties and electronically gated for analysis. The promoter activity was determined by FACS (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, Calif., U.S.A.) and the flow cytometry results were analyzed using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif., U.S.A.).","Real-Time PCR Analysis","Wild-type Ech-Rif and the gacA mutant Ech137 were grown in MM with glucose as carbon source (Yang et al. 2007). Total RNA from the bacteria was isolated by using TRI reagent method (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) and treated with Turbo DNA-free DNase kits (Ambion, Austin, Tex., U.S.A.).

Due to the slow formation of pellicle in Ech137, 10-day-old pellicles from Ech-Rif and Ech137 were used for SEM observation. The samples of pellicle were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS buffer (pH 7.0) for 2 h and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer for 1 h. After dehydration in the graded series of ethanol, specimens were infiltrated with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Cross sections of the pellicles were cut using an ultramicrotome. Then, PEG was extracted from the blocks by soaking in several changes of warm ethanol. After critical-point drying, the specimen was mounted on a stub coated with Duco cement, sputter coated with gold, and examined with a Hitachi S-570 Scanning Electron Microscope.","Plate assays for activity of Pel, Cel, and Prt and the spectrophotomeric assay of Pel activity for Ech-Rif, Ech137, and the complemented strain Ech137 (pCLgacA) were carried out as described (Matsumoto, H., Muroi, H., Umehara, M., Yoshitake, Y., and Tsuyumu, S. 2003. Peh production, flagellum synthesis, and virulence reduced in subsp. by mutation in a homologue of cytR. -16:389-397). Three biological replicates were performed for each treatment.","Virulence Assay, Growth Kinetics, and in Planta Pel Production","The local leaf maceration assay was carried out as described (Yang et al. 2004; Yang, C. H., Gavilanes-Ruiz, M., Okinaka, Y., Vedel, R., Berthuy, I., Boccara, M., Chen, J. W., Perna, N. T., and Keen, N. T. 2002. hrp genes of 3937 are important virulence factors. -15:472-480). Briefly, wild-type bacterial cells and gacA mutant Ech137 cells were syringe-infiltrated in the middle of each symmetric side of the same leaf with approximately 50 \u03bcl of a bacterial suspension at 106 CFU\/ml. Phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) was used to suspend the bacterial cells. Three replicate plants with a total of at least 12 leaves were inoculated. In the systemic invasion assay, the pathogenicity of the bacterium was evaluated as described (Franza, T., Sauvage, C., and Expert, D. 1999. Iron regulation and pathogenicity in 3937: Role of the fur repressor protein. -12:119-128), with minor modification. A volume of a 50 \u03bcl of the bacterial suspension with an optical density at 600 nm of 0.01 was inoculated into the front edge of the African violet leaf. For each bacterial strain, 12 plants were inoculated. Inoculated plants were kept in growth chambers at 28\u00b0 C., 95% relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 16 h. Development of symptoms induced by bacterial strains in African violet plants was considered as systemic when at least one leaf and its petiole were macerated. Progression of the symptoms was scored daily for 12 days.","Growth kinetics in planta was carried out in African violet cv. Gauguin as described (Yang et al. 2002). Briefly, leaves were syringe infiltrated with approximately 50 \u03bcl of bacterial suspension at 10CFU\/ml with a 1-ml syringe. Leaf discs (4 mm in diameter) around the maceration area were harvested at different intervals following infiltration and ground in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The bacterial concentration, (CFU\/cm2) was determined by plating serial dilutions of leaf extracts on LB agar plates. A spectrophotomeric assay was used to monitor the Pel production of Ech-Rif and Ech137 during the in planta growth. A 10-\u03bci supernatant of the plant juice from African violet leaves inoculated with the bacteria was added into 990 \u03bcl of Pel reaction buffer and the Pel production was quantified using the spectrophotomeric assay (Matsumoto et al. 2003). Pel production was the ratio of the optical density at 230 nm unit to the log unit of the bacterial concentration (U\/log [CFU\/cm]). Three replicate plants with a total of six leaves per plant were used in each sampling time for the in planta Pel production and bacterial growth kinetics assays.","Ech3937 is capable of forming a biofilm and pellicle in SOBG broth. A spontaneous rifampicin-resistant derivative of Ech3937, Ech-Rif, was used as a wild-type in this study (Table 6). A gacA deletion mutant Ech137 of Ech-Rif was constructed and confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. The gacA gene of Ech137 was deleted with only 20 by of the gacA open reading frame remaining. No significant difference in growth between Ech-Rif and the gacA mutant Ech137 was observed in M9 minimal medium (MM). Ech-Rif formed biofilm-pellicle in SOBG broth grown for 2 days at 28\u00b0 C. However, no visible biofilm-pellicle was observed in Ech137 until grown for 3 days in SOBG broth. This delayed biofilm-pellicle formation phenotype of the mutant could be restored nearly to the wild-type level when Ech137 was complemented with a low-copy-number plasmid pCLgacA (). The pellicles of Ech-Rif and Ech137 were sectioned using an ultramicrotome and the interior textures of the pellicles of the bacteria were compared using a scanning electron microscope. A more compact texture in 10-day-old pellicles was observed in Ech-Rif in comparison with Ech137 (). Pellicles of both Ech-Rif and Ech137 treated with cellulose disintegrated, suggesting that the major component, cellulose, was not altered in Ech137.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0371","num":"0370"},"figref":["FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B"],"b":["6","6","6","6","6","6","6","6","6","6","6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0372","num":"0371"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"406pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 6"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Bacterial Strains and Plasmids."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"259pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Strains, plasmids","Characteristics","Reference or source"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Strains",{},{}]},{"entry":[{"i":"Escherichia coli"},"\u03bb-pir Lysogen of S17-1","V. de Lorenzo, Madrid"]},{"entry":["S17-1 \u03bb-pir",{},{}]},{"entry":["Ech3937","Wild-type strain isolated from ","D.

GFP intensity was determined on gated populations of bacterial cells by flow cytometry and analyzed with the Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.). The growth of Ech3937 in MM supplemented with different concentrations of PCA was recorded. Compared with MM alone, the average GFP fluorescence intensity of bacterial cells of Ech3937 (phrpA) was reduced more than 4-fold when 0.05 and 0.1 mM of PCA were added to the medium (, B). The addition of PCA at concentrations at 0.001, 0.005 and 0.01 did not result in substantial reduction of GFP fluorescence intensity of Ech3937. Inhibition of bacterial growth was not observed when PCA was added into the MM (, B).","To confirm the inhibitory effect of PCA on T3SS of Ech3937, the promoter activity of hrpN of Ech3937 was also examined. A reduced expression of hrpN was observed in MM supplemented with 0.1 mM PCA in comparison with the bacterial cells grown in MM alone (Table 10). The mrp, whose protein product has an ATPase conserved domain (2e-06), was used as a reference gene.

To investigate whether PCA affects the T3SS gene expression through the Gac-Rsm regulatory pathway, the expression of rsmB was further examined by qRT-PCR.  shows pectate lyase (Pel) production of 3937 (Ech3937) grown in minimal medium (MM) and MM supplemented with 0.1 mM of p-coumaric acid (PCA) at 12 hexamined by plate assays as described (Matsumoto et al. 2003). Values are a representative of two experiments. Three replicates were used in this experiment. No significant difference was observed between Ech3937 grown in MM and MM supplemented with PCA for gene rsmB with the p=0.928 (). This result shows that the repression T3SS expression by PCA is not through the Gac-Rsm pathway. That the Gac-Rsm pathway is not interfered by PCA is further suggested by a pectinase assay. Similar pectate lyase production was observed between Ech3937 grown in MM and MM supplemented with 0.1 mM PCA, demonstrating that GacS\/GacA is not influenced by PCA ().","Along with GacS\/GacA-RsmA-rsmB-hrpL regulatory pathway, the T3SS of Ech3937, which belongs to Group I T3SS of phytobacteria, is primarily regulated by a HrpX\/Y-HrpS-HrpL pathway. The two-component system HrpX\/HrpY activates the gene encoding HrpS, which is required for expression of hrpL. HrpL, an alternative sigma factor, further activates expression of genes encoding the T3SS apparatus and its secreted substrates. To investigate whether PCA represses T3SS gene expression through HrpX\/Y-HrpS-HrpL pathway, the promoter activity of hrpS and hrpL was further examined. Compared with Ech3937(phrpS) and Ech3937(phrpL) in MM, a lower GFP intensity was observed in the bacterial cells carrying phrpS and phrpL grown in MM supplemented with 0.1 mM PCA (Table 10). The expression of hrpS and hrpL was also confirmed by qRT-PCR. The result showed that, compared with Ech3937 in MM alone (normalized to 1), a significantly lower amount of mRNA of hrpS (relative expression ratio 0.223, P=0.001) and hrpL (relative expression ratio 0.039, P=0.001) was observed in bacteria grown in MM supplemented with PCA ().","To further elucidate whether T3SS gene expression is mainly regulated through the HrpX\/Y-HrpS-HrpL regulatory pathway, the expression of hrpA and hrpN in wild-type Ech3937 and hrpX (WPP67), hrpY (WPP92), hrpS (WPP90), and hrpL (WPP96) mutants in MM were examined. The result showed that compared with Ech3937 carrying phrpA and phrpN, very low expression of hrpA and hrpN was observed in WPP67, WPP92, WPP90, and WPP96 grown in MM. Similar expression of hrpA and hrpN was observed among WPP67, WPP92, WPP90 and WPP96 carrying phrpA and phrpN grown in MM and MM supplemented with PCA. These results demonstrate that hrpX, hrpY, hrpS and hrpL are crucial for the T3SS gene expression and PCA inhibits expression of T3SS genes through HrpX\/Y-HrpS-HrpL regulatory pathway (Table 11). Since PCA represses the expression of several T3SS genes such as hrpN, the effect of PCA on protein production of HrpN was further examined.  shows HrpN protein expression of 3937 (Ech3937) in minimum medium (MM) and MM supplemented with 0.1 mM of p-Coumaric acid (PCA).

Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was performed on an Agilent 1100 Series LC\/MSD Trap Spectrometer with a Daly conversion dynode detector. Ionization was achieved in the positive or negative ion mode by application of +5 or \u22125 kV at the entrance to the capillary. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on precoated silica gel 60 Fplates (Merck, 0.25 mm, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Company).","All chemical reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used as received. All dry solvents (diethyl ether, DMF, DMSO, DCM, THF, MeOH, EtOH) were of anhydrous quality purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Company. Commercial grade solvents were used for routine purposes without further purification. All moisture-sensitive reactions were carried out using dry solvents and under a slight pressure of ultra-pure quality argon. Glassware was dried in an oven at 140\u00b0 C. for at least 12 h prior to use, and then assembled quickly while hot, sealed with rubber septa, and allowed to cool under a stream of argon. Reactions were stirred magnetically using Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bars.

The latter were further transformed into hydroxamic acids by treating with hydroxylamine under basic condition. When the substituent in the phenyl group is halo, methyl, methoxy, or other groups which will not form amide\/ester, the hydroxamic acids could be obtained directly from the corresponding carboxylic acids. By refluxing with ammonia in methanol, the corresponding amides were obtained from the methyl esters. The esters were readily reduced by LiAlH\/AlClsystem, resulting in cinnamyl alcohols. By employing the reported procedure (Zhang et al. 2002), hydrazides were obtained from cinnamic acids by treating with HOBt and EDC followed by hydrazine.","Under the Corey-Chaykovsky cyclopropanation reaction conditions (Corey and Chaykovsky, 1965), ethyl 4-methoxycinnamate was transformed into cyclopropanyl ester (100).

Sample preparation was performed as previously described with modifications (Yuan and He 1996). Wild-type DC3000 was grown overnight in King's B medium at 28\u00b0 C. The culture was washed with hrp-inducing medium (HIM) and resuspended in 40 ml of the same medium to an optical density (OD) at 600 nm of 0.1. To determine the effect of TCA on the HrpW protein level, TCA dissolved in DMSO was added to the culture at the final concentration of 250 \u03bcM and the culture was grown with moderate shaking at 28\u00b0 C. DMSO was added to a separate culture as a negative control. After 9 h, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 4,000\u00d7g for 10 min and resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM NaHPO, and 1.47 mM KHPO[pH 7.4]). Pelleted cells were resuspended in 1\u00d7 sample buffer (2% w\/v sodium dodecyl sulfate, 2% v\/v glycerol, 2 mM (3-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH6.8], and 0.01% w\/v bromophenol blue) and heat-treated at 98\u00b0 C. for 10 min using Dry Bath Incubator (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pa.). The supernatant proteins were concentrated 100-fold with Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Unit (30 kDa cut-off) (Millipore, Billerica, Mass.) and mixed with the same volume of 2\u00d7 sample buffer and heat-treated. Cell pellets were similarly heat-treated. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblot analysis were performed as previously described (Li et al. 2009). The chemiluminescent detection using BrightStar BioDetect Kit (Ambion, Austin, Tex.) was performed following the manufacturer's instructions.","To determine the maximum concentration of TCA that will inhibit hrpA promoter activity without affecting bacterial growth, DC3000 carrying phrpA was cultured in HIM and HIM supplemented with 25 \u03bcM, 50 \u03bcM, 100 \u03bcM, 250 \u03bcM, or 500 \u03bcM of TCA. Promoter activity was measured at 6 h and 9 h as mentioned above using flow cytometry. Bacterial growth was determined by withdrawing samples of each culture and spot-plating serial dilutions onto King's B agar (King et al. 1954) in tandem with promoter activity assays. Colonies were counted after 48 h of incubation at 28\u00b0 C. Addition of 100 \u03bcM of TCA to the growth medium (concentration used to screen chemical library) resulted in a 3-fold reduction in hrpA promoter activity, whereas lower concentrations of TCA (25 \u03bcM or 50 \u03bcM) had a less substantial effect (). HIM supplemented with TCA concentrations of 250 \u03bcM and 500 \u03bcM caused almost complete repression of hrpA promoter activity which was similar to expression levels measured in the empty vector control (DC3000 containing pPROBE-NT;  and ). Colony counts of DC3000 at 6 h and 9 h were similar among the control culture (0 \u03bcM TCA) and the cultures to which TCA was added at concentrations of 250 \u03bcM or less, whereas colony counts were slightly lower in cultures containing 500 \u03bcM TCA (). These results suggest that the degree of inhibition on DC3000 hrpA is proportional to the concentration of TCA added to the growth medium. In addition, TCA does not significantly inhibit nor enhance growth of DC3000 when TCA was added to HIM at or below concentrations of 250 \u03bcM.","In DC3000, mutations in genes which encode components of the T3SS result in the inability to elicit HR in non-hosts (Collmer et al. 2000). Since TCA represses expression of hrpA (a major component of the T3SS) in vitro, the ability of TCA to suppress HR in planta was examined. DC3000 (OD=0.1) with 25 \u03bcM, 50 \u03bcM, 100 \u03bcM, 250 \u03bcM, or 500 \u03bcM of TCA in DMSO was injected into leaves of tobacco (cv. Xanthi). Concentrations of DMSO which correspond to similar amounts of TCA were also injected into the tobacco plants as negative controls. Tobacco leaves were assessed for HR symptoms 18 hours post-infiltration. No visible signs of tissue damage or HR were observed when DMSO or TCA was separately infiltrated into the tobacco leaves (data not shown). When bacterial cells were infiltrated into plants in combination with 250 \u03bcM of TCA, elicitation of HR by DC3000 was completely suppressed (). 100 \u03bcM of TCA was unable to completely block HR, but the symptoms were slightly less severe than those seen when either 50 \u03bcM or 25 \u03bcM was infiltrated with bacterial cells into tobacco leaves. These results revealed that TCA not only inhibits expression of the hrpA gene encoding the major structural component of the T3SS pilus, but also functions in planta to suppress the ability of DC3000 to elicit HR on a non-host. This effect is most likely due to lack of a functional T3SS.","Following the initial screen of the chemical library, several compounds were found to have little or no affect on hrpA promoter activity. One of these TCA analogs (104), was chosen as a negative control to evaluate the specificity of TCA to inhibit T3SS in planta. DC3000 (OD=0.1) with DMSO or with 25 \u03bcM, 50 \u03bcM, 100 \u03bcM, 250 \u03bcM, or 500 \u03bcM of Y104 (same concentrations as those used to evaluate TCA) was infiltrated into tobacco leaves and scored for HR symptoms after 18 h. 104 was ineffective at suppressing HR at all concentrations tested (). These results indicate that the inhibitory activity of TCA on the ability of DC3000 to cause HR is specific. In addition, the structure of TCA is important for its repressive effect on HR.","The T3SS is responsible for the translocation of virulence and accessory proteins which contribute to disease in plants (Lindeberg et al. 2006). HrpW is a T3SS-secreted harpin capable of eliciting HR on tobacco (Charkowski et al. 1998). The amount of hrpW mRNA and HrpW protein levels in the DC3000 cells grown in TCA can serve as an indicator of the HR response in tobacco plants by the bacterium (Wei et al. 2000). Real-time PCR was performed to examine the effect of TCA on hrpW expression. Compared to induction of T3SS in HIM alone, a significantly lower amount of hrpW mRNA (relative expression ratio 0.07, P=0.04) was observed in HIM supplemented with 250 \u03bcM TCA. Immunoblot analysis was performed on DC3000 cultured in HIM or in HIM supplemented with 250 \u03bcM TCA. When DC3000 cells were grown in HIM supplemented with 250 \u03bcM of TCA, HrpW was absent from the culture supernatants and was also undetectable in the whole cell lysates (). These results indicate that TCA inhibited the production and secretion of HrpW protein from the cells. Our results showed that the HrpW protein was detected at similar levels of intensity when DC3000 was grown in HIM or in HIM with DMSO (TCA solvent), which suggests that the concentrations of DMSO used in this study did not cause alteration of HrpW production in the bacterium.","Taken together, the above results indicate that TCA specifically blocks the action of T3SS by inhibiting its expression. The effects of TCA on virulence in tomato plants were examined. cv. Moneymaker plants were dip-inoculated with a negative control treatment (dHO with 0.02% Silwet L-77 and DMSO), a positive control treatment (DC3000 in dHO with 0.02% Silwet L-77 and DMSO), or with a chemical treatment (DC3000 in dHO with 0.02% Silwet L-77 and 250 \u03bcM TCA) as described in the methods. The lesions of bacterial speck on leaves per plant were counted and plants were classified with a disease severity index (DSI) as described in the methods. At five days post-inoculation, no bacterial speck lesions were observed in tomato plants treated with DC3000 and 250 \u03bcM TCA or with the negative control treatment (), which were all scored with a DSI of zero. Plants treated with DC3000 were all scored with a DSI of four ().","To identify T3SS inhibitors of PA01, a promoter-probe vector pPROBE-AT containing the promoterless green fluorescent protein (gfp) gene was used to construct an exoS promoter-gfp plasmid reporter, pATexoS. PA01 containing pATexoS was cultured in T3SS-inducing medium containing dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; solvent of chemical compounds), or supplemented with 250 \u03bcM of each compound, and promoter activity was assessed at 6 h by measuring GFP intensity using flow cytometry. 101 compounds (58 synthesized and 43 commercially available) were screened. Compounds 027, 032, 101, and 149 repressed exoS expression at the final concentration of 250 \u03bcM by at least one standard deviation below the sample average (Z score\u2266\u22121) ( A-E). Z score (or standard score) indicates how many standard deviations an observation or datum is above or below the mean [z=(x\u2212\u03bc)\/\u03c3, where x is a raw score to be standardized, \u03bc is the mean of the population, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the population]. 027, 032, 101, and 149 were found to function as T3 inhibitors of with minor alterations in bacterial growth at 250 \u03bcM ( A, C, and D). Additionally, two compounds 103 and 134 were found to induce exoS expression at the same concentration by at least 4 standard deviations above the sample average (Z score\u22674) ( and B). However, 103 and 134 showed some inhibition on bacterial growth.","To determine the effective concentration of compounds, the dose-dependent effect of potential inhibitors on exoS expression and bacterial growth were tested. cells carrying pATexoS were pre-cultured in LB supplemented with 200 mM NaCl and transferred to fresh LB with 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM NTA, and various concentrations of compounds (20, 50, 100, and 250 \u03bcM) or DMSO for 6 h. As shown in  and Table 17, 027 inhibited exoS expression at 20 \u03bcM but 101 did not. At 50 \u03bcM dosage, both 027 and 101 inhibited exoS expression at similar levels, and this inhibitory effect increased as compound concentration increased ( and Table 17). These two compounds had only minor effects on bacterial growth at different compound concentrations (up to 250 \u03bcM for 101 and up to 500 \u03bcM for 027) (). On the other hand, two T3 inducers 103 and 134 showed significant induction of exoS expression at 20 \u03bcM ( and Table 17). This induction effect increased as compound concentration increased ( and Table 17), and inverse relationship was observed between the compound concentration and bacterial growth (). These inhibitions\/inductions of exoS expression are caused by the shifting bacterial population between low-state expression cells and high-state expression cells ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0506","num":"0505"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00017","num":"00017"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 17"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Actual readings of flow cytometry (exoS expression) at various"},{"entry":"concentrations of compounds."},{"entry":"NC 50.42 \u00b1 0.51"},{"entry":"NC-NTA 125.11 \u00b1 1.98"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"20 uM","50 uM","100 uM","250 uM"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["DMSO","123.20 \u00b1 3.87","126.30 \u00b1 0.57","125.78 \u00b1 1.27","119.34 \u00b1 0.66"]},{"entry":["Yang-027","102.07 \u00b1 0.54","\u200297.23 \u00b1 0.72","\u200278.66 \u00b1 2.69","\u200272.16 \u00b1 1.13"]},{"entry":["Yang-101","122.82 \u00b1 2.89","106.83 \u00b1 3.09","100.10 \u00b1 1.33","\u200281.88 \u00b1 2.41"]},{"entry":["Yang-004 (PCA)","119.08 \u00b1 1.82","127.05 \u00b1 4.43","118.16 \u00b1 2.73","117.74 \u00b1 5.09"]},{"entry":["Yang-103","179.07 \u00b1 2.98","237.31 \u00b1 4.94","279.16 \u00b1 2.72","328.30 \u00b1 3.24"]},{"entry":["Yang-134","157.22 \u00b1 7.94","199.21 \u00b1 3.06","289.53 \u00b1 3.74","411.72 \u00b1 2.70"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"While screening for T3SS inhibitors, several compounds were found to have little or no effect on exoS promoter activity, such as 004, 132, and 137. Comparison of the effective T3SS inhibitors vs. non-effective chemicals reveals that the structure of 027 is identical to that of 004 except the hydroxyl group of the phenol ring has been replaced with an amide group (Table 18). Also, 101 is similar to 004 (carboxyl group was replaced with a carboxymethyl group) (Table 18). Given that 004 has almost no effect on exoS expression ( and Table 17) signifies that these two functional groups may be important for their exoS-inhibitory effect. Meanwhile, the T3 inducer 103 shares its structure with less-functional 132 (no hydroxyl group on the phenol ring) and nonfunctional 137 (the hydroxyl group on the carbonyl-nitrogen group was replaced with a methyl group), indicating that of these two functional groups, one enhances the effect of the compound and the other is crucial for its induction activity, respectively (Table 18).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0508","num":"0507"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00018","num":"00018"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 18"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Structure-activity relationships."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Fraction of"]},{"entry":["Compound",{},"untreated"]},{"entry":["ID","Stracture","control"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Yang-027",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00140","num":"00140"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00140","he":"13.63mm","wi":"38.27mm","file":"US09260382-20160216-C00140.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"0.66 \u00b1 0.04"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Yang-101",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00141","num":"00141"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00141","he":"13.12mm","wi":"38.86mm","file":"US09260382-20160216-C00141.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"0.65 \u00b1 0.03"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Yang-004",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00142","num":"00142"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00142","he":"13.12mm","wi":"37.34mm","file":"US09260382-20160216-C00142.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"0.94 \u00b1 0.05"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Yang-103",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00143","num":"00143"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00143","he":"18.80mm","wi":"44.53mm","file":"US09260382-20160216-C00143.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"2.04 \u00b1 0.13"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Yang-132",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00144","num":"00144"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00144","he":"17.95mm","wi":"37.00mm","file":"US09260382-20160216-C00144.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"1.53 \u00b1 0.19"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Yang-137",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00145","num":"00145"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00145","he":"18.71mm","wi":"44.03mm","file":"US09260382-20160216-C00145.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"0.92 \u00b1 0.05"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Wild-type 273 was used in this study.
