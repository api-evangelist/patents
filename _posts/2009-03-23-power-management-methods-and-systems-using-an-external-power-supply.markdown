{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to the field of information handling systems, and more specifically, to supplying power to information handling systems.","As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option available to users is an information handling system (IHS). An information handling system generally processes, compiles, stores, and\/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes thereby allowing users to take advantage of the value of the information. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements vary between different users or applications, information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for such systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data storage, or global communications. In addition, information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process, store, and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems.","For today's notebook computers and other portable electronic devices, their associated external power supplies must also be portable and be capable of operating under different load conditions. For example, different load conditions for an external power supply may exist depending on if a notebook computer is in standby mode, operating system (OS) idle or running a high performance application. Furthermore, different load conditions can exist depending on the charge level of the battery.","However, modern external power supplies are usually only optimized for power efficiency over a small range of load conditions. In other words, for certain load conditions, the external power supply may be relatively efficient while for other load conditions, it may be relatively inefficient. Furthermore, normal operation of an associated electronic device may not occur in the optimized range for the external power supply. For example, an AC adaptor for a notebook computer may be most efficient when operating at a 90% load rating, i.e., 90% of the maximum rated power output of the adapter. However, the notebook may rarely need such a high amount of power, and the AC adaptor may in fact frequently operate at a 10% to 20% load rating where it is much less efficient.","Current methods concerning external power supplies may focus on reducing power consumption when the external power supply is in an unused state. For example, if a notebook computer is switched off, an AC adaptor may be operable to reduce its power consumption since the notebook computer may need relatively little to no power. These methods, however, may not address increasing the efficiency of the external power supply while it is in operation.","Thus, a need exists for methods and systems for increasing the efficiency of an external power supply.","The following presents a general summary of several aspects of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of at least some aspects of the disclosure. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure. It is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the disclosure or to delineate the scope of the claims. The following summary merely presents some concepts of the disclosure in a general form as a prelude to the more detailed description that follows.","One aspect of the disclosure provides for a method for managing power to an information handling system (IHS) wherein the method includes providing a battery and an external power supply operable to supply power to the IHS. The method also includes providing an application programming interface (API) to the IHS, wherein the API is configured to monitor a first parameter and a second parameter. The method further includes supplying power to the IHS via the external power supply if the first parameter reaches a first threshold level and supplying power to the IHS via the battery if the second parameter reaches a second threshold level.","Another aspect of the disclosure provides for an information handling system (IHS) including an external power supply, a battery, and a controller operable to select between the external power supply and the battery to supply power to the IHS. The IHS further includes an application programmable interface (API) operable to monitor a first parameter and direct the controller to select the external power supply to supply power to the IHS if the first parameter reaches a first threshold level, and wherein the API is further operable to monitor a second parameter and direct the controller to select the battery to supply power to the IHS if the second parameter reaches a second threshold level.","Yet another aspect of the disclosure provides a method for providing power to an information handling system (IHS). The method includes providing a battery and an external power supply operable to supply power to the IHS and providing an application programming interface (API) to the IHS, wherein the API is configured to monitor a charge capacity of the battery, an IHS power level, and a current output by the external power supply. The method further includes supplying power to the IHS via the external power supply if the charge capacity of the battery reaches a first threshold level and the IHS power level reaches second threshold level. Furthermore, the method includes supplying power to the IHS via the battery if the current output by the external power supply reaches a third threshold level.","A further aspect of the disclosure provides a computer-readable medium having computer-executable instructions for performing a method for managing power to an information handling system (IHS) wherein the method includes providing a battery and an external power supply operable to supply power to the IHS. The method also includes providing an application programming interface (API) to the IHS, wherein the API is configured to monitor a first parameter and a second parameter. The method further includes supplying power to the IHS via the external power supply if the first parameter reaches a first threshold level and supplying power to the IHS via the battery if the second parameter reaches a second threshold level.","Before the present systems, methods, and computer-readable mediums are described, it is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to the particular apparatus, systems and methods described, as such may vary. One of ordinary skill in the art should understand that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing possible aspects, embodiments and\/or implementations only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure which will be limited only by the appended claims.","It must also be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201cand,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d may include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to \u201ca circuit\u201d refers to one or several circuits and reference to \u201ca method of managing\u201d includes reference to equivalent steps and methods known to those skilled in the art, and so forth.","For purposes of this disclosure, an embodiment of an Information Handling System (IHS) may include any instrumentality or aggregate of instrumentalities operable to compute, classify, process, transmit, receive, retrieve, originate, switch, store, display, manifest, detect, record, reproduce, handle, or utilize any form of information, intelligence, or data for business, scientific, control, or other purposes. For example, an IHS may be a personal computer, a storage device, or any other suitable device and may vary in size, shape, performance, functionality, and price. The IHS may include random access memory (RAM), one or more processing resources such as a central processing unit (CPU) or hardware or software control logic, ROM, and\/or other types of nonvolatile memory. Additional components of the IHS may include one or more disk drives, one or more network ports for communicating with external devices as well as various input and output (I\/O) devices, such as a keyboard, a mouse, and a video display. The IHS may also include one or more buses operable to transmit data communications between the various hardware components.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["5","10","5","10","10","10","30","15","40","15","25","25","25","60","65","55","15","20","20"]},"The IHS  may be implemented with a network port  to permit communication over a network  such as a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), such as the Internet. As understood by those skilled in the art, IHS  implementations may also include an assortment of ports and interfaces for different peripherals and components, such as video display adapters , disk drives port , and input\/output interfaces  (e.g., keyboard , mouse ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","205","200","5","200","205","5","205","5","205","200","205","5","245","5","245","5","205","200","245","5","205","5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["205","215","240","245","5","200","270","215","245","270","270"]},"The external power supply , by way of example, may be an Alternating Current (AC) adaptor. An AC adaptor may be a device for converting an AC voltage into a direct current (DC) voltage. The method by which an AC adaptor converts AC to DC voltage is well known in the art. Moreover, the external power supply  may also be capable of detecting when no load is coupled to it. Under these conditions, the external power supply  may toggled off or engage in \u201csleep mode\u201d so as to draw relatively little power, if any, from the AC power source.","The controller , as applied to , may be or may comprise an electronic device such as a circuit. Generally, the controller  may be operable to measure the power output by the external power supply via the current sense line . In addition, the controller  may manage the charging of the battery  via the charger control . Thus, the controller  may be operable to select a power source, between the external power supply  and the battery , to supply power to the IHS . Furthermore, in some implementations, the controller  may be embedded on the IHS .","In instances where the battery  is to supply power to the IHS , the API , may provide a battery enable  signal to the controller . In addition, while the battery  supplies power to the IHS , the API  may monitor the charge capacity of the battery  and an IHS power level via the battery current and voltage sense  signal path. An IHS power level may refer to the amount of power that the IHS  is drawing from the battery  which may be calculated by a combination of the battery voltage and current. Furthermore, if the battery enable  signal is provided to the controller, the p\/s enable switch  may be opened and the battery enable switch  may be closed to the voltage regulator . Thus, in effect, when the battery  is supplying power to the IHS , the external power supply  maybe uncoupled from the IHS  and not drawing any power.","On the other hand, during times where the external power supply  is to supply power to the IHS, the API  may provide a power supply (p\/s) enable  signal to the controller . During these instances, the API  may monitor a current output by the external power supply  via the current sense . Furthermore, if the p\/s enable  signal is provided to the controller, the controller  may initiate the battery charger  via the charger control  to charge the battery . The controller  may then cause the p\/s enable switch  to be closed to the IHS  and cause the battery enable switch  to open. Thus, when the external power supply  is supplying power to the IHS , the battery  may be uncoupled from the IHS  and may be charging.","In one implementation, the framework  may be designed to incorporate an external power supply  with relatively high load efficiency. In other words, the external power supply  may operate at a relatively high efficiency under a relatively high load condition and operate at a relatively low efficiency for a relatively low load condition. Therefore, in such an implementation, it may be desirable to enable the external power supply  to supply power to the IHS  under relatively high load conditions so that the external power supply  is operational during moments where it has a relatively high efficiency.","For example, if the battery  is providing power to the IHS , the API  may monitor the voltage or charge capacity of the battery  via the battery current and voltage sense  or any other capacity measurement device until the battery  reaches a threshold level such as 40% of its charge capacity. In one implementation, the framework  may include a Battery Management Unit (not pictured) operable to measure voltages on individual cells in the battery  as well as current flowing in and out of the cells. As such, when the charge on the battery  is at 40% of its capacity or perhaps lower, supplying current to charge the battery  by itself may be considered a high load condition for the external power supply  by the API. Indeed, at this charge capacity, the charge rate (i.e., current supplied to the battery  by the external power supply ) may be relatively high.","In another implementation, even if the battery has not reached a threshold level such as 40% of its charge capacity, the API may still determine that a high load condition exists if the IHS power level reaches its own separate threshold. In either implementation, an external power supply with a relatively high load efficiency may operate at a relatively high efficiency at these threshold levels. Therefore, the API  may provide a p\/s enable  signal to the controller  to initiate the external power supply  while simultaneously uncoupling the battery from the IHS and turning on the battery charger .","The API  may then continue monitoring the charge on the battery  until the charge reaches another threshold level such as 90% of the battery's  capacity. In this situation, the load condition for the external power supply may be considered relatively low because the battery charge rate may need to be reduced. Thus, the API  may then provide a battery enable signal  to the controller  to uncouple the external power supply  and revert back to the battery to supply power to the IHS .","It should be noted that while  is described with references to particular percentages in charge capacity, the present disclosure is not limited to these specific percentages and may encompass a wide range of percentages. Furthermore, in other implementations, while the external power supply  is supplying power to the IHS  and charging the battery , the API  may monitor the current output by the external power supply  rather than the charge on the battery  as a means to determine which power source to use. The API  may perform this function via the current sense  to the controller . Additionally, all components illustrated in  may also be embedded on the IHS , excluding the external power supply  and the IHS  itself.","Turning now to , a flow diagram is represented that provides a method  for operating an external power supply coupled to an IHS in accordance with one aspect of the present invention. The method  begins in step  where the IHS uses battery power. During this time, the API may monitor a first parameter, which may include the charge on the battery, in step . If the battery is good, i.e., the battery has not reached a first threshold level such as 40% of its charge capacity as described in , the API may continue to step . In step , the API may monitor the IHS power level. If the IHS power level is low, i.e., it remains below a separate threshold level, the IHS may continue using battery power in step . However, if the charge on the battery reaches the first threshold level (e.g. 40%), or the IHS power level reaches its separate threshold level, the API may toggle on the external power supply and charge the battery in step .","As previously mentioned, when the battery reaches the first threshold level, the external power supply may operate at a relatively high efficiency while charging the battery. Similarly, when the IHS power level reaches its threshold level, load conditions may be high enough that the external power supply can provide power to the IHS also at a relatively high efficiency. In one implementation, step  may be performed by coupling the external power supply to the IHS and uncoupling the battery as described in . In another implementation, the API may instead communicate with an optional control circuit within the external power supply in order to manually toggle the external power supply to an on-state, i.e. powering on the external power supply, from an off-state, i.e. a state in which the external power supply is powered off.","In step , after the API has toggled on the external power supply, the IHS may continue to use the external power supply to draw power. Next in step , the API may then monitor a second parameter, which may include the current output by the external power supply. If the current has not reached a second threshold level and is still sufficient for the external power supply to operate with a high efficiency, the IHS may continue to use the external power supply. However, if the current in fact reaches the second threshold level, the API may toggle off the power supply in step , and the IHS may revert back to using battery power in step . As such, the current reaching the second threshold level may indicate a relatively low current draw by the IHS. To this end, relatively low current draw may be associated with activities including, but not limited to, the IHS operating in a \u201csleep mode\u201d or \u201chibernate state,\u201d and\/or the IHS operating in an idle state with little application activity (e.g., reading emails, document editing, and the like).","As previously mentioned, in one implementation, the external power supply may be uncoupled from the IHS and the battery coupled as described with reference to . In another implementation, the API may toggle off the external power supply via an optional control circuit located within the external power supply. In yet another implementation, rather than monitoring the current output by the external power supply in step , the API may in fact monitor the charge on the battery as described in the framework of . Accordingly, the second threshold level would be the voltage on the battery in this situation. Thus, the method  may indicate a constant loop by which the API monitors the charge on the battery and the current output by the external power supply to determine which power source supplies power to the IHS.","As mentioned above, the external power supply may be efficient under relatively high load conditions. By toggling on the external power supply only when the charge on the battery has reached the first predetermined level, the method  may enable to external power supply to operate with relatively high efficiency. Furthermore, because the external power supply may be relatively inefficient under low load conditions, the method  may toggle off the external power supply during these moments. Thus, the overall efficiency of the external power supply when in operation may be increased.","It should be noted that various methods are contemplated by the present disclosure including any of the steps described herein or mentioned above, any number of repeats of any of the steps herein, and performance of the steps in any order. In addition, in reference to , both the first threshold level and the second threshold level may be a value, ratio, percentage, and\/or the like as determined or set by any entity, device, application, etc.","Furthermore, methods of the present disclosure, detailed description and claims may be presented in terms of logic, software or software implemented aspects typically encoded on a variety of media or medium including, but not limited to, computer-readable medium\/media, machine-readable medium\/media, program storage medium\/media or computer program product.

It should be understood that the given implementations are illustrative only and shall not limit the present disclosure.","Although the present disclosure has been described with reference to particular examples, embodiments and\/or implementations, those skilled in the art will recognize that modifications and variations may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the claimed subject matter.
