The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. The following notice applies to the software, data, and\/or screenshots that may be illustrated below and in the drawings that form a part of this document: Copyright \u00a9 2007, Adobe Systems Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.","The present application relates generally to the technical field of algorithms and programming and, in one specific example, to the digital signing of an electronic document.","Digital signatures are used to verify the identity of a party who signs a document. These signatures may be used to uniquely identify, for example, an author of a document, or, in some cases, a signing party who may or may not be an author. These digital signatures may or may not involve a certificate containing a symmetric or asymmetric key, and\/or information relating to the identity of the signing party.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of an embodiment of the present invention. It may be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention will be practiced without these specific details.","The leading digit(s) of reference numbers appearing in the figures generally corresponds to the figure number in which that component is first introduced, such that the same reference number is used throughout to refer to an identical component which appears in multiple figures. Signals and connections may be referred to by the same reference number or label, and the actual meaning will be clear from its use in the context of the description.","In some embodiments, a single action is used to digitally sign a piece of digital content such as an electronic document. This electronic document may be formatted using a Portable Document Format (PDF), eXtensible Markup Language (XML) Forms Architecture (XFA) format, a Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), or some other suitable format. In one embodiment, this single action is a mouse click, wherein a user clicks on a displayed area of an electronic document where the user intends to sign the electronic document. Further, this single action may include at least one of a sound, a selection using a television remote control, a selection of a key on a keypad, a selection using a pointing device, or a selection of a displayed indication. This displayed indication may include a displayed area of a document containing an indication (e.g., the phrase \u201csign here\u201d) as to where to sign the electronic document. This mouse click may be performed using some type of input device such as a mouse, or similar input devices such as a light pen, or via some other suitable input device. Once this single action is executed, certain types of visible and invisible data are associated with the electronic document. The visible data may include, for example, the name of the user, the date and time of the signature, and\/or other identifying information. The invisible information may be, for example, a digital key such as a symmetric or asymmetric key used to verify the identity of the signing party. In some cases, additional metadata (e.g., XML formatted data) may be associated with the electronic document prior to or contemporaneously with the signing of the document. This metadata may include location data illustrating the location of a signing server (e.g., a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), an Internet Protocol (IP) address, a Media Access Control (MAC) address, or some other identifying value). This location data may be considered as seed data. Through the use of location data, the signing server may be thought of as a roaming credential server not limited to use by authors of a particular geographical location.","Some embodiments may include the use of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) model and various associated technologies such as kerberos, and SAML to facilitate the digital signing of the electronic document. The use of kerberos and SAML facilitate the use of Single Sign On (SSO) authentication within the context of digital signatures, and more specifically the one-click signing of an electronic document. Other types of SSO technology that may be employed may include Java Open Single Sign-On (JOSSO), Web Single Sign-On (Web-SSO), Enterprise Single Sign-On (E-SSO), or some other suitable SSO authentication method and\/or system. In one embodiment, a user may authenticate themselves to an identity provider (e.g., a server is a kerberos-based network) using some type of verification mechanism. In certain cases, the user may be the author of the electronic document to be signed. In other cases, the user and author are distinct persons. Moreover, in certain cases, the identity provider may be a third-party server (e.g., an identity server run by VERISIGN, INC.\u2122 of Mountain View, Calif.).","The verification mechanism used to authenticate a party signing an electronic document may include the user identification and password for the particular user. This user identification and password may be supplied by, for example, a user at login, wherein the user logs into their own computer system, and the user's identity is verified using kerberos in conjunction with the identity provider. Once the user's identity is verified, the user is free to make a service request of the identity provider to receive services so as, for example, to facilitate the digital signing of an electronic document. For example, the user may make a request for and receive a SAML assertion (e.g., XML formatted data that identifies the user) from the identity provider that can be used to receive a credential from a signing server. This credential may contain a symmetric or asymmetric key to be used to digitally sign the document. In certain cases, the credential may observe the X.509 standard, and use a private key (e.g., the private key of the public key\/private key pair in the case of asymmetric key encryption) to digitally sign an electronic document. Once signed, the validity of the digital signature may be determined by a public key held by a verifying party (e.g., a party who seeks to verify the digital signature).","Example embodiments may include the use of an open PGP model in lieu of a PKI model for verifying the identity of the signing party and obtaining a credential for signing. As will be more fully illustrated below, in an open PGP model (e.g., open PGP system), multiple authenticating member servers are organized into a ring of trust, wherein each of these authenticating member servers performs the roles of both identity provider and signing server. In cases where an open PGP system is employed, the author of an electronic document may set the number of authenticating members required to authenticate a user's (e.g., a signing party) identity. Further, the author of an electronic document may be free to choose a particular authenticating member server to identify a user. In cases where a user is successfully identified, the user may receive a symmetric or asymmetric key with which to digitally sign an electronic document. This symmetric or asymmetric key may be provider to the user as part of a certificate containing other information needed for digital signing.","Some embodiments may include a user logging onto an operating system such as MICROSOFT WINDOWS\u2122 or LINUX\u2122 and the GUI (e.g., a desktop) associated therewith using a user identification and password. This login may be kerberos-based, and hence logging in results in a kerberos TGT being generated as a single sign-on token. Then, a user receives a PDF that needs to be signed using a signing server. This signing server may specify a seed value or other verifying value for the signature. Next, a user may initiate a single action (e.g., a single mouse click) on a signature field displayed on the document. When this single action is executed, the specific signing server is identified through its URL value (e.g., the seed data). In some embodiments, the user does not need to select the appropriate credential, since it is automatically selected for them. Moreover, in some embodiments, the user sees a signing dialog asking for confirmation. In other embodiments, the user does not see this signing dialog.","Once the user engages (e.g., executes) in this single action, a number of additional operations are automatically executed by the user's computer system. A signing server is automatically contacted through the use of the seed value (e.g., the URL). The signing server asks for authentication of the user's computer system, with a kerberos TGT being one of the acceptable forms of authentication. Next, using the TGT, the user's computer system automatically makes a service request of the identity provider to receive a SAML assertion for use with the signing server. In response, the identity provider provides a SAML assertion to be used by the computer system of the user who seeks to authenticate themselves to the signing server. This SAML assertion is then automatically provided to the signing server without prompting the user for any information. In response, the signing server automatically looks at the SAML assertion, and then checks its database of credentials for a credential for the particular user. If the signing server detects it doesn't have any credential for the user, it may contact an active directory server (e.g., or any other Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) based server). From this active directory server, it fetches the relevant information (e.g. user name, department, name of the company, and\/or location). In certain cases, the signing server will return a message to the computer system of the user verifying the user's identity based upon the SAML assertion. After the user's identity is verified the signing server may provide one or services to the user. The signing server may act as a signing proxy and sign a document on behalf of another person such as an author. In such a scenario, the user's computer system automatically asks the signing server to sign the electronic document, or a digest or that document using a private key of a public key\/private key pair. Once signed this electronic document or digest of that document is returned to the user. Another service that the signing server may provide is that it may grant the user a credential (e.g., an X.509 credential) to be used by the user to sign (e.g., the user will act as a signing party) an electronic document. This X.509 formatted credential contains a private key of a public key\/private key pair, and may be stored by the user for future use.","Example System","Some embodiments may include the use of a signing server to act as a signing proxy for a user or author (e.g., the signing party) such that the signing server signs the electronic document. In other embodiment, an author or user themselves is the signing party who actually digitally signs the electronic document. In either case, the electronic document is signed with a private key or a public key\/private key pair.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","100","102","103","104","104","104","104","105","103","101","106","102","101","102","101","104","101","101","107","105","108","108","107","108","108","101","101","107","107","106","108","109","105","106","109","101","104","109","110","105","113","113","113","101","101","109","110","116","108","113","116"]},"Once the identity of the user  is verified by the signing server , an electronic document signing request  that contains a digest of the electronic document may be transmitted by the computer system  across the network  to the signing server .

The signed digest  may contain, among other things, credential data such as an X.509 credential that contains, among other things, a private key. This X.509 credential, along with the signed digest itself, may be transmitted back across the network  to the user  to be received at the computer system . Once received by the user , the signed digest  may be checked to determine that the digest in the signed digest  corresponds to the digest contained in the document signing request . Where the digests correspond, the electronic document  may be deemed to be signed by the author  through the signing server  acting as a signing proxy for the author . In some cases, as will be more fully illustrated below, the digest in the document signing request  may be generated using some type of hashing function such as Message-Digest algorithm 5 (MD5), or Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1).","Example embodiments may include the transmission of an entire electronic document in lieu of a digest of an electronic document such that the entire electronic document and a SAML assertion is transmitted in place of the signing request .

The session key request  may contain data such as data  that includes, for example, the author\/user's  identity and the recipient's identity information. The data  may be the author\/user 's user identification and password, a symmetric or asymmetric key (e.g., a session key ), or some other unique identifying information. The session key request  may be formatted, for example, using XML, SAML, or some other suitable format. Once the session key request  is generated and formatted, it is sent over a network  to an authenticating member server . The authenticating member server  may then verify the identity of the author\/user  and make a determination as to whether or not it has the session key for the identified recipient , and\/or whether it can provide this key to the author\/user . As previously alluded to, in certain cases multiple layers of authentication may need to be addressed prior to the providing of a session key  to the author\/user . This requirement of multiple layers of authentication may be established or otherwise dictated by the recipient . As shown in , for example, the authenticating member server  determines that additional layers of authentication are required before the session key  is generated and provided to the author\/user . Next, a session key request  is generated and transmitted by the authenticating member server , and is sent to an authenticating member server  across the network .

Common to many of these components is the ability to generate, use, and manipulate the above-illustrated UI elements and layout elements and the data associated therewith. These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, or peer computer systems. These various components can be implemented into the system on an as-needed basis. These components may be written in an object-oriented computer language such that a component oriented or object-oriented programming technique can be implemented using a Visual Component Library (VCL), Component Library for Cross Platform (CLX), Java Beans (JB), Enterprise Java Beans (EJB), Component Object Model (COM), or Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) or other suitable technique. These components are linked to other components via various Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and then compiled into one complete server and\/or client application. The method for using components in the building of client and server applications is well known in the art. Further, these components may be linked together via various distributed programming protocols as distributed computing components.","Distributed Computing Components and Protocols","Some example embodiments may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of the above-illustrated components across a distributed programming environment. For example, a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system containing an interface level (e.g., a GUI). These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other configuration. The various levels can be written using the above-illustrated component design principles and can be written in the same programming language or a different programming languages. Various protocols may be implemented to enable these various levels and the components contained therein to communicate regardless of the programming language used to write these components. For example, an operation written in C++ using Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) or Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) can communicate with another remote module written in JAVA\u2122. Suitable protocols include SOAP, CORBA, and other protocols well-known in the art.","A System of Transmission Between a Server and Client","Some embodiments may utilize the OSI model or TCP\/IP protocol stack model for defining the protocols used by a network to transmit data. In applying these models, a system of data transmission between a server and client, or between peer computer systems, is illustrated as a series of roughly five layers comprising: an application layer, a transport layer, a network layer, a data link layer, and a physical layer. In the case of software having a three tier architecture, the various tiers (e.g., the interface, logic, and storage tiers) reside on the application layer of the TCP\/IP protocol stack. In an example implementation using the TCP\/IP protocol stack model, data from an application residing at the application layer is loaded into the data load field of a TCP segment residing at the transport layer. This TCP segment also contains port information for a recipient software application residing remotely. This TCP segment is loaded into the data load field of an IP datagram residing at the network layer. Next, this IP datagram is loaded into a frame residing at the data link layer. This frame is then encoded at the physical layer, and the data transmitted over a network such as an internet, Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), or some other suitable network. In some cases, internet refers to a network of networks. These networks may use a variety of protocols for the exchange of data, including the aforementioned TCP\/IP, and additionally ATM, SNA, SDI, or some other suitable protocol. These networks may be organized within a variety of topologies (e.g., a star topology) or structures.","A Computer System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 22","b":"2200"},"The example computer system  includes a processor  (e.g., a Central Processing Unit (CPU), a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) or both), a main memory , and a static memory , which communicate with each other via a bus . The computer system  may further include a video display unit  (e.g., a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) or a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)). The computer system  also includes an alphanumeric input device  (e.g., a keyboard), a User Interface (UI) cursor controller  (e.g., a mouse), a disk drive unit , a signal generation device  (e.g., a speaker) and a network interface device (e.g., a transmitter) .","The disk drive unit  includes a machine-readable medium  on which is stored one or more sets of instructions and data structures (e.g., software)  embodying or used by any one or more of the methodologies or functions illustrated herein. The software may also reside, completely or at least partially, within the main memory  and\/or within the processor  during execution thereof by the computer system , the main memory  and the processor  also constituting machine-readable media.","The instructions  may further be transmitted or received over a network  via the network interface device  using any one of a number of well-known transfer protocols (e.g., HTTP, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)).","The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, and\/or associated caches and servers) that store the one or more sets of instructions. The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing, encoding, or carrying a set of instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies illustrated herein. The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d shall accordingly be taken to include, but not be limited to, solid-state memories, optical and magnetic media, and carrier wave signals.","Marketplace Applications","In some embodiments, rather than an author having to specifically identify the particular signing server from which a user (e.g., a signing party) may obtain a key for a digital signature, in some cases this process may be fairly automated, requiring only a single action of the part of a user (e.g., a signing party and\/or an author). In certain cases, the ease of executing this single action may make digital signatures more easily used to sign a variety of electronic documents.","The Abstract of the Disclosure is provided to comply with 37 C.F.R. \u00a71.72(b), requiring an abstract that will allow the reader to quickly ascertain the nature of the technical disclosure.
