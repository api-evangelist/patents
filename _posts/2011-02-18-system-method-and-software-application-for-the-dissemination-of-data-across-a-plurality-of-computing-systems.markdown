The invention finds particular, but not exclusive, use in the area of peer to peer, multicasting and unicasting of data across a computing network.","The recent burgeoning of social networking computing systems and multi-user virtual computer environments is creating a significant demand for multiperson-to-multiperson communication.","Currently, the communication tools available to virtual communities are limited to asynchronous communications (e.g. chat, email, messaging) or to telephony-style one-to-one interaction. While some work is being done in the area of \u201cimmersive communications\u201d, the area still requires significant work to overcome certain bandwidth limitations.","Immersive communications provide aural and visual scenes created for the user that are similar to his\/her perceptions when mingling with a real crowd of people. For example, the voices of other people in the virtual crowd are spatially placed in the audio scene of the listener in perfect harmony with their respective virtual locations. Similarly, the videos of other participants are appropriately placed within the visual range of the viewer. Note that the term \u2018immersive\u2019 is not limited to the use of immersive display technology, such as Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Displays or Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE). The term \u2018immersive\u2019 is used broadly to refer to the availability of appropriate information within visual and aural scenes. In many scenarios, a simple monitor or even a hand-held display may be sufficient to provide an immersive experience.","Immersive multimedia communication is fundamentally a multipoint-to-multipoint communication system. The multimedia information generated by each user, such as his\/her voice and video or user-generated content, must reach a subset of other participants in real time. This subset will change dynamically as a result of movements of users within the virtual crowd and is affected by the presence of barriers, walls and other virtual artifacts within the environment. It may also depend on the propagation characteristics of the media through the virtual environment. Sound, for example, may propagate through walls but visual information cannot.","There has been little research into the viability of multipoint to multipoint communication systems.","In a first aspect, the present invention provides a method for transferring data between computing systems, comprising the steps of, for a plurality of computing systems, dividing the plurality of computing systems into at least two virtual zones, and, for each of the plurality of computers within each Virtual zone, utilising an algorithm to determine the manner in which the computers should be linked.","In one embodiment, there is provided a method wherein the computers are linked utilising a tree structure. The tree structure may utilise one of the virtual and physical distance between computers as a metric. In another embodiment, the tree structure may utilise a combination of the physical and virtual distances between computers as a metric.","In a second aspect, the present invention provides a system for transferring data between computing systems, comprising, for a plurality of computing systems, means for dividing the plurality of computing systems into at least two virtual zones, and, for each of the plurality of computers within each virtual zone, utilising an algorithm means to determine the manner in which the computers should be linked.","In one embodiment, there is provided a system wherein the computers are linked utilising a tree structure. The tree structure may utilise one of the virtual distance or the physical distance between computers as a metric. In another embodiment, the tree structure may utilise a combination of the physical and virtual distances between computers as a metric.","In a third aspect, the present invention provides a method for transferring data between computing systems, comprising the steps of, determining the topology of a computing network comprising a plurality of computing systems, and utilising the topology to select an appropriate network formation algorithm.","In a fourth aspect, the present invention provides a computer program comprising at least one instruction which, when implemented on a computer readable medium of a computer system, causes the computer system to implement the method in accordance with the first or the third aspect of the invention.","In a fifth aspect, the present invention provides a computer readable medium providing a computer program in accordance with the third aspect of the invention.","In the context of the specification, the term \u201cdata\u201d is intended to be construed broadly and include within its scope any block of arbitrary data that is utilisable by a computing system. Data may, for example, include multimedia files (e.g. audio files, video files, data files, etc.) or other information blocks, such as emails, instant messages, or any other self contained \u201cpiece\u201d of information. Moreover, the data may be encoded or encrypted as required.","In the description which follows an embodiment of the present invention is described in the context of a system and method for transferring any type of data between two or more computing systems, but particularly multimedia files, such as video and sound files (compressed or uncompressed), between two or more computers remotely connected over a communications network such as the Internet. However, it will be understood that the present invention is not limited to the example application described herein and is equally applicable to the transfer of any form of electronic file between any number and configuration of computing systems.","With reference to , data files are transferred between two or more computing devices in the form of one or more server computers , , respectively.","The computers ,  are connected over a communications network in the form of a local or wide area network  and communicate using a packet-switched protocol, such as the TCP\/IP protocol.","The computers ,  each comprise appropriate computer hardware including a motherboard, central processing unit , random access memory , hard disk  and networking hardware . In addition to the hardware, the computers ,  include an operating system (such as the Linux operating system, which can be obtained from the Internet from a number of providers, such as but not limited to websites located at URLs http:\/\/www.redhat.com, http:\/\/www.suse.com and http:\/\/www.ubuntu.com) that resides on the hard disk and which co-operates with the hardware to provide an environment in which the software applications can be executed.","The computers ,  also include a receiving module  including standard software and hardware (such as a TCP\/IP socket) for receiving (and transmitting) data files.","Referring now to , there are shown some example systems in more detail. In  a small portion of a virtual crowd is shown with numerals A-A signifying the virtual representations (avatars) of peers P-P respectively. P-P form a peer-to-peer overlay network over the underlying Internet or Intranet, as shown in .","Consider any member of this virtual crowd, say A corresponding to peer P, and assume that the example is restricted to immersive voice and video communications. Dissemination of other types of media, such as gestures, haptics and user generated content would have similar but distinct requirements, so are not considered for the purpose of this example. The visual and hearing ranges of A are shown in  as areas enclosed by solid and dashed curves respectively.","Assuming symmetry (that is, each member of the virtual crowd A-A can hear and see each other member A-A unless there is a barrier between the members, such as a wall), the voice and video of P must somehow reach all the peers residing in these ranges for inclusion in their aural and visual scenes. This corresponds to P-P for voice and P to P+P for video. In addition, A-A are further away from A and so, for these peers, A's voice can be delivered with more delay and rendered with less spatial accuracy. Similarly, A, A and A would be able to tolerate a lower resolution and frame rate for A's video because of the larger virtual separation. These QoS (Quality of Service) variations, however, depend on the current arrangements in the virtual crowd and could change with the passage of time as the avatars A-A move around in the virtual space.","In the absence of a native multicast support at the IP layer, a unicast model for dissemination of multipoint-to-multipoint content can be considered as shown in . To avoid cluttering , only the video distribution of P is shown. Each peer, however, has to unicast both voice and video to the subset of peers in its hearing or visual ranges. For the whole virtual crowd, therefore, mDN unicast flows are required on average, where m is the number of media types (e.g. voice and video), N is the number of participants, and the density D represents the average number of participants within the communication range of each peer. Focusing on P and assuming that r is the bit rate of video, the upload capacity required to distribute this peer's video will be rD on average. As discussed later, it is possible to reduce this by using some form of QoS differentiation among the video flows. Two possible coding techniques that could be used for this purpose are layered coding and multiple description coding. In both cases the unicast flow to peers who are further away in the virtual world would only contain a subset of video packets, which is shown as thinner arrows in .","On the receiving side, each peer receives a number of unicast flows from everyone in its hearing and visual ranges.","On average, this download capacity will be the same as the upload capacity in the case of unicast distribution. Note, however, that while it is conceivable to reduce the upload capacity requirements by using some form of multicast scheme, the only avenue to reduce the download capacity is to employ QoS differentiation as discussed above.","If a native multicast support is available at the IP layer, then P only needs to send one video flow as a multicast flow, which would reduce the upload capacity requirements significantly. The IP multicast would also improve the efficiency of using the network transmission capacity by eliminating duplicate flows over the same links. Provided, a shortest path tree was used for multicast and ignoring the additional processing needed for multicast flow replication and routing, the latency experienced by each flow would be close to the unicast case. The download capacity, however, would remain the same, and indeed if the multicast did not provide QoS differentiation, it could worsen.","Peer-to-Peer Models for Multicast","There are three methods for creating peer-to-peer multicast for dissemination of content. In the ensuing description a single multicast tree for delivery of P's video is used as an example. However, the multipoint-to-multipoint communication session would require mN overlay multicast trees and, on average, each peer would participate in \u2018mD+m\u2019 multicast connections either as the source, relay or leaf node and contribute to the overhead of formation and maintenance of these trees. Movements within the virtual crowd and churn (peers joining and leaving) would translate to changes in multicast trees. On average, virtual movement or churn of a participant would affect \u2018mD+m\u2019 multicast trees, which must be recalculated and communicated to other peers.","To clarify the following examples, it is assumed that the visual range of each participant can be divided into three zones (). The highest bit rate for video is required when the recipient is within zone . Zone  and  require progressively lower bit rates for video transmission. This could be achieved by either using a multiple description coding scheme with three descriptions or a hierarchical layered coding. Hereafter, for clarity, a single parameter is used to model the bit rate reduction at successive zones. In other words, it is assumed that the video bit rate is reduced by a factor of a as a recipient moves from zone  to  or from zone  to , where \u03b1\u22661. Experimental results were obtained for a large number of \u2018talking head\u2019 videos encoded using the main profile of H.264 (a video coding scheme developed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)). For the variations in video quality of interest, it was observed that \u03b1\u22480.65 is a good approximation of the achievable bit rate reduction rates.","The Multicast Tree Formation Schemes",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},"Without any additional algorithms to take the QoS differentiation into account, there may be some transmission capacity wastage. For example, although P is in Zone  with respect to P and would require video bit rate of \u03b12r, it must download at full rate because it is on the path to other peers that require higher quality content.","In contrast,  depicts the case where the multicast tree is constructed based on the arrangement of peers in the virtual scene, using the virtual distance between the avatars as the primary \u2018cost\u2019 metric. The advantage of this scheme is that as the multimedia content travels down the tree, more hops are traversed and delay increases. However, the virtual distance is also increasing, which means that the peer can tolerate longer delay with less perceptual impact.","For example, A and A, who are the closest avatars to A, receive the voice and video with minimal delay (direct overlay paths P-P and P-P), while the path to A has three overlay hops (path P-P-P-P).","Perceptually, the three zones within the visual range are shown and a represents the bit rate reduction factor associated with video quality reduction from one zone to another impact of this delay may be less due to virtual separation of A and A. Also, as video packets travel down the tree, the amount of information relayed at subsequent hops can be reduced, for example by relaying a smaller number of video layers or descriptions. QoS differentiation with respect to delay and bit rate, therefore, is a natural outcome of this approach; with little or no overhead.","The other, advantage of this approach is that there is no need to exchange topology information for the construction of trees. This is because the details of the virtual topology are already available to each peer through the exchange of state information to present a consistent virtual environment to everyone. This facilitates the development of distributed algorithms for the construction of multicast trees and their subsequent repair as a result of virtual movement or churn without any need for coordination among peers.","The key drawback of using the virtual distance as the basis of route optimization is that avatars that are close in the virtual environment may be physically far from each other leading to inefficient utilisation of transmission capacity. In the above example, the voice and video of A is sent to A and then A based on virtual proximity. Assume that P and P are in Australia and P is in UK. The fact that A content has to go to UK to reach A cannot be helped as these peers are in communication with each other. But the main concern is that A data has to come back from the UK to reach A.","The third approach shown in  is a hybrid scheme to tackle the shortcomings of the previous two schemes. In this case, the physical distance is used to create the shortest path tree, but the algorithm is employed on three successive stages according the virtual zones. In the above example, first a shortest path tree is created between P and all the other peers who are in zone . This tree is then expanded to include peers in zone  in the second stage. At the final stage, peers in zone  will join the tree. The aim is to improve on QoS differentiation scheme without sacrificing the capacity utilization efficiency excessively.","For ease of reference, the three methods described above for multicast tree formation will be referred to as the \u2018physical\u2019, \u2018virtual\u2019 and \u2018hybrid\u2019 models respectively.","Example Results","To test the three methods described above, a simulation was setup to simulate a transit-stub network topology with three (3) transit and twenty four (24) stub domains each with eight (8) routers on average. The maximum delay between node pairs in this topology is around 380 ms, which is an indication of the geographical span of the network infrastructure. A total of 5000 peers are randomly connected to stub nodes. To simulate a small virtual crowd, at each run twenty (20) peers are picked from this pool and generate a random arrangement of the corresponding avatars in a rectangular shaped virtual environment of 200\u00d7200 size. Using this unit of measurement for size, the zone , , and  distances are assumed to be 50, 100, and 150 units respectively. Moreover the acceptable latency for communication within zones , , and  are set at 100, 200, and 400 ms respectively.","Two parameters are used to vary the key characteristics of interest. The first parameter is a as defined above. This parameter is the multiplying factor by which the bit rate of video can be reduced for zone  and  and, of course, will be dependent on the type of video coding used and the required video presentation quality. By varying this parameter in the range of [0.1, 1.0] the effectiveness of QoS differentiation with respect to bit rate can be modelled. In other words, \u03b1=1.0 represents a case when no bit rate differentiation is possible across the communication zones while with \u03b1=0.1 the bit rate of video is reduced by one and two orders of magnitude as zones  and  are crossed, respectively.","The second parameter, denoted by \u03b2, changes the geographical scale of the network. This is achieved by multiplying the delay of each network link by this factor. As stated before, the maximum delay between node pairs in the original topology is around 380 ms. By changing \u03b2 in the range of [0.1, 5.0] a range of network scales associated with a typical city or state up to a global network can be simulated. Clearly, in a large-scale network the latency violations are more likely and the impact of any improper design with respect to delay control will become more apparent.","To generate the following results, ten (10) different physical network topologies are created, each with twenty (20) different node sets, where each node set includes twenty (20) avatars. Each point on the graph, therefore, is the result (e.g. average) of 200 simulation runs.","Transmission Efficiency","The first set of results show the effectiveness of the three multicast schemes (\u2018physical\u2019, \u2018virtual\u2019, and \u2018hybrid\u2019) in reducing the upload capacity requirements of the peers and the total transmission cost for the dissemination of multipoint-to-multipoint video.","In  the normalized total upload capacity cost is shown on the vertical axis. This cost is normalized with respect to the unicast scheme, which is shown in . The horizontal axis is the range of values for parameter \u03b1 from 0.1 to 1.0. It is clear from this graph that no peer-to-peer multicast scheme can improve the total upload capacity usage of peers compared to the unicast situation. Indeed when there is some opportunity for bit rate differentiation (\u03b1<1.0), the performance of the \u2018physical\u2019 multicast is even worse than the unicast by a significant margin.","This result can be explained as follows. For a single multicast, such as download of music files from a source, peer to-peer multicast is useful to reduce to upload cost on the source and distribute this load among all the participating peers. Even in this case, the total upload cost remains the same but each peer takes a share of this total, which improves the scalability. For the multipoint-to-multipoint content distribution scenario of interest to this paper, each peer is a source but also a relay node on other multicast trees. Each multicast tree will distribute the upload capacity of its source, but on the whole, the total remains the same and the average upload cost of the peers is not changed. In fact, this conclusion is true for any peer-to-peer multicast scheme including those that break the content into smaller blocks (e.g. BitTorrent) for distribution, because no assumptions were imposed about the granularity of packet sizes on our model.","The \u2018physical\u2019 multicast method performs worse than unicast for \u03b1<1.0 due to the inefficiency of this scheme in QoS differentiation as explained before (refer to ).","The only advantage of peer-to-peer multicast with respect to upload capacity criterion is that although the total is the same, the distribution of load among the peers is dependent on the way that the multicast trees are formed and the \u2018centrality\u2019 of a particular peer's position in those trees. In the simulations, while the unicast upload cost is distributed more or less uniformly, there is a significant variation among the peers in other schemes. With judicious design, this becomes an advantage, especially when there is heterogeneity among the peers. For example, some peers may perform the role of a super-peer and reduce the load on other, less capable, peers.","The graph in  shows that total transmission cost incurred by the underlying network infrastructure. This is defined as the bit rate used multiplied by the cost of the link (which in this case is proportional to the distance). It can be seen that both \u2018physical\u2019 and \u2018hybrid\u2019 methods result in a modest reduction in total transmission cost by using less of the high cost links. This benefit is higher when QoS differentiation with respect to bit rate, is not possible. As the opportunity for differentiation increases, the unicast performance will get very close to the multicast.","Latency Violations","As discussed earlier, the acceptable communication latency is dependent on the virtual distance. In the model described herein, three zones are utilized and the acceptable maximum delay for these zones are set at 100, 200, and 400 ms respectively. However, to be able to generalize the conclusions of this study, the geographical scale of the network is changed over a wide range, as shown on the horizontal axis in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},"It is also important to assess the degree of latency violation experienced. In  one possible metric for this purpose is shown. This metric represents the sum total of excess latency incurred normalized with respect to the acceptable level. Although in isolation, this metric may not translate to a physically intuitive measure, it is useful as a comparative tool. As shown in , the gap between the various schemes is an indication of the relative performance with respect to latency control.","The need for natural communication between members of a virtual crowd, in addition to current tools such as chat and email, is likely to grow as users expect more interactive and realistic multimedia experiences: There is a significant nascent demand for multipoint-to-multipoint multimedia communication services.","Peer-to-peer multicast is a popular technology for content delivery. However, the benefits of these schemes for the delivery of multipoint-to-multipoint multimedia communication are rather marginal.","In most cases, the simpler unicast method is equivalent and often outperforms overlay multicast. In the absence of an IP layer support for multicast, \u2018Area of Interest\u2019 management and QoS differentiation are tools which are more effective in reducing the capacity requirement of the service delivery.","One benefit of overlay multicast is the ability to distribute the upload cost among the peers in a non-uniform way to take advantage of heterogeneity among the peers. In such cases, the multicast scheme may present some benefits but at the cost of increased latency and more complex control system to establish and repair the trees.","In other words, utilizing a mixture of techniques, and utilizing the hybrid model described above, there can be provided a more effective methodology for transferring data across a plurality of connected computing systems. Such a methodology finds use in the burgeoning market for social networking and multiple user virtual environments.","It will be understood that further services may be added to the embodiments described herein without departing from the broader invention which is disclosed herein. For example, the software application may also be arranged to interact with other software applications on other computing systems not shown. Embodiments may also find application in mobile computing devices including mobile telephones. Such variations and modifications are within the purview of a person skilled in the art.","In one embodiment, the software application may be an application arranged to operate on a central server or servers. The application may be accessed from any suitable remote terminal, through a public or private network, such as the Internet.","Where the software application interfaces with another computing system and\/or a database, the data may be communicated via any suitable communication network, including the Internet, a proprietary network (e.g. a private connection between different offices of an organisation), a wireless network, such as an 802.11 standard network, or a telecommunications network (including but not limited to a telephone line, a GSM, CDMA, EDGE or 3G mobile telecommunications network, or a microwave link).","It will also be understood that the embodiments described may be implemented via or as an application programming interface (API), for use by a developer, or may be implemented as code within another software application.
