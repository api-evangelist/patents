title: Operations on multi-level nested data structure
abstract: Multiple sets of data are obtained from different sources. Each data set is represented using a different format having a different syntax and organized in a multi-level nested data structure. Each data set is reformatted into a standardized table format using a depth-first recursive algorithm without relying on the syntax schema of the original format of the data set. Various operations are performed on the tables corresponding to the data sets, including but not limited to joining multiple tables, grouping selected rows of a table, ranking rows of a table, adding or deleting fields from selected rows of a table, etc. Optionally, inferred namespace and text normalization are utilized for selected table operations. One or more templates are provided for converting the data set of a table to a format that may be presented to a user.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FILED","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to reformatting, combining, manipulating, and presenting multiple data sets where each data set is organized and represented using a multi-level nested data structure.","In the modern digital age, there is a vast amount of data publicly available stored in various types of data-stores or databases around the world. A person may retrieve desired portions of the data using various methods. A very convenient and widely employed method is through the Internet via either wired or wireless connections and using appropriate communication protocols. Alternatively, portions of data maybe retrieved from data-stores or databases directly using suitable query languages.","In such a distributed system where information is stored at many different locations, it is not unusual that information relating to a single subject matter may be stored at multiple locations. For example, suppose a person is interested in a particular political candidate in the upcoming election and wants to learn all he can about the candidate in order to make an informed decision on whether or not to vote for her in the election. There are many sources from where the person may obtain information about the candidate. Background information about the candidate or the candidate's political views and positions may be found at websites sponsored by the candidate's political party or supporters or informational websites (e.g., wikipedia). News stories about the candidate may be found at news agencies' websites (e.g., CNN or The New York Times) or via live news feeds (e.g. Yahoo!\u00ae News or Google\u2122 News). Private discussions or posts about the candidate may be found in different news groups or at different blog sites. Images or videos of the candidate may be found at image or video sharing websites (e.g. flickr\u2122, YouTube\u2122, or digg\u2122). As a result, in order to obtain a comprehensive collection of information about the candidate, the person often needs to visit many different sources (i.e., websites, news groups, live feeds, blogs, etc.).","It would be more convenient and helpful if a single centralized service existed that would retrieve information about a particular subject matter (e.g., the political candidate) from multiple sources, combine the results, organize the information in a suitable fashion, and present the complete final results to the person. Unfortunately, combining and processing data obtained from different sources may be difficult at times because there are many different formats that may be used to represent a set of data, and often, each format has very different syntaxes. Consequently, multiple data sets having different formats cannot be combined readily because of the conflicts in their respective syntaxes.","Broadly speaking, the present invention generally relates to reformatting, combining, manipulating, and presenting multiple data sets where each data set is organized and represented using a multi-level nested data structure. More specifically, the present invention relates to reformatting data sets organized in multi-level nested data structures into corresponding tables without relying on the syntax schemas of the original formats of the data sets, performing various operations on one or more tables corresponding to the data sets, and providing templates for presenting one or more tables to a user.","According to various embodiments, multiple data streams, each containing a set of data, are obtained from different sources. The data streams use different data formats having different syntaxes to represent the data sets. Conceptually, each data set contains multiple name-value pairs organized in a multi-level nested structure.","The data sets are reformatted into a standardized table format, such that each data set corresponds to a single table having at least one row and each row having at least one field. The reformatting does not require the syntax schema of any data set, but determines the proper entry in the table for a specific name-value pair in the data stream based on the location of the name-value pair within the multi-level nested structure. Specifically, if a name-value pair is located at two levels outside the innermost level, the name-value pair corresponds to a table. If a name-value pair is located at one level outside the innermost level, the name-value pair corresponds to a row in the table corresponding to its parent name-value pair. If a name-value pair is located at the innermost level, the name-value pair corresponds to a field in the row corresponding to its parent name-value pair in the table corresponding to its grandparent name-value pair. If a data set results in multiple tables, then the table corresponding to the name-value pair that has the largest size of data nested within it is selected as the table for the entire data set.","Various operations may then be performed on the tables corresponding to the data sets. For example, two or more input tables may be joined together to obtain a single output table according to a join predicate. Rows from the input tables that satisfy the join predicate are combined to form rows in the output table. Two or more rows in a table may be grouped together into a single row according to a group predicate. Rows in a table may be ranked according to a rank predicate. Other table operations may include adding fields to all or selected rows of a table, removing fields from all or selected rows of a table, selecting rows that satisfy a predicate from a table, etc.","During table operations, namespace qualifiers are automatically added or removed from field names when needed based on an inferred namespace scheme. For example, when joining two or more tables, if two or more rows that are to be combined have the same field, the field names are automatically further qualified with their respective table names. When performing word search or word matching, the namespace qualifiers added to field names are ignored.","A set of templates are provided for presenting the tables. The templates comply with various computer language syntax requirements or specification. A data set represented by a table may be converted back into a data stream in a computer readable format to be presented to the users.","These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the invention will be described in more detail below in the detailed description and in conjunction with the following figures.","The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to a few preferred embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps and\/or structures have not been described in detail in order to not unnecessarily obscure the present invention. In addition, while the invention will be described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it will be understood that this description is not intended to limit the invention to the described embodiments. To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.","I. Overview","Data obtained from different sources may be represented in various formats, and sometimes one format may differ greatly in syntax from another format. Syntax may refer to the code structure or definition, language specification, etc. It would be difficult to process multiple sets of data (e.g., combining them), each represented using a different format, because each format usually has its own unique syntax specification that requires a correspondingly suitable parsing scheme. One way to address this problem is to first reformat all the relevant data sets represented in different formats into a standard format. Once the multiple data sets all have the same standard format, they may then be combined and further manipulated or processed.","According to various embodiments, multiple data sets obtained from different sources and represented using different formats having different syntaxes are reformatted into a standardized table format. Thereafter, various operations may be performed on the tables. For example, two or more tables may be joined together to obtain a single table according to a set of criteria. Selected rows in a table may be grouped together according to another set of criteria. Rows in a table may be ranked, and so on. One or more templates may be provided to convert a table back to a data stream that complies with a computer language specification for presentation to the users.","II. Reformat Data Stream","A set of data may be converted from one format to another format. According to one embodiment, a data set represented in any format that complies with the XML or JSON syntax specification may be automatically and intelligently reformatted into a table.","The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple and flexible general-purpose text format for creating markup languages. It is widely used in connection with Internet applications, especially on the World Wide Web. A set of data represented using the XML format should meet the XML syntax requirements. The following is a sample data set represented using XML.

Each row has five fields corresponding to the five name-value pairs within each result (i.e., leaf nodes (A-G), (A-G), (A-G), (A-G), and (A-G)). In other words, a leaf node in the tree (i.e., a name-value pair located at the innermost level) corresponds to a field in a particular row in the table, and a set of leaf nodes under the same parent node form a row of the table.","To automatically parse a data set organized in a multi-level nested structure and reformat the data into a table, according to one embodiment, a depth-first recursive algorithm may be used to find a collection of data objects where each data object includes one or more name-value pairs, referred to as \u201cfields\u201d. To traverse a tree using the depth-first algorithm, one starts at the root node and traverses as far as possible along a branch (i.e., all the way to a leaf node) before backtracking up the tree to the next branch.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-2B"},"As the parser parses through the input data, a node is encountered. With XML format, a node may be indicated by a pair of tags. In the above Sample Code 1, the first tag to be encountered is \u201c<ysearchresponse>\u201d, and since this is the first tag, it is the root node (i.e., having no parent node). With JSON, a node may be indicated by a name string positioned on the left of a \u201c:\u201d. In Sample Code 2, the first name string to be encountered is \u201cysearchresponse\u201d. In , the \u201cysearchresponse\u201d tag or name string is represented by node .","A determination is made as to whether the current node (i.e., node ) has any child nodes (step ). With XML format, if a tag has one or more tags nested within itself, the tag has one or more child nodes. In Sample Code 1, the next tag to be encountered is \u201c<resultset_web>\u201d. This indicates that the current tag \u201c<ysearchresponse>\u201d has at least one additional tag nested within itself, and thus, the tag \u201c<ysearchresponse>\u201d has at least one child node. With JSON format, if the value corresponding to the name string positioned on the right of the \u201c:\u201d is not a string, then the name string has one or more child nodes. In Sample Code 2, on the right side of the \u201c:\u201d corresponding to the current name string \u201cysearchresponse\u201d is another object starting with a \u201c{\u201d, not a string, and thus, the name string \u201cysearchresponse\u201d has at least one child node.","If the current node has one or more child nodes (step ), then the current node is not a leaf node. The depth-first parser continues traversing down the current branch. A determination is made as to whether any of the child nodes of the current node has not been visited (step ). If one or more child nodes of the current node have not been visited, then the parser traverse down to the next unvisited child node (step ) and repeats steps  and . By repeatedly traversing down a branch of the tree, the parser will eventually reach a leaf node.","On the other hand, if all the child nodes of the current node have been visited already (step ), this indicates that the parser has parsed all the nodes within this particular branch of the tree. The parser needs to backtrack up a level in order to parse the next branch. Thus, a determination is made as to whether the current node has a parent node (step ). If the current node has a parent node, then the parser traverses up one level to the current node's parent node (step ) and repeats the same steps as before for the next branch. If the current node does not have a parent node (i.e., the current node is the root node), then the parser has reached the top level of the tree, and all the branches within the tree have been parsed since all the child nodes of the current node (i.e., the root node) have been visited. The parser stops at this point.","Referring back to step , if the current node does not have any child node, then the current node is a leaf node. With XML format, if a tag does not have any other tag nested within itself, then the tag is a leaf node. In other words, if a tag pair encloses a value string, then the tag is a leaf node. In Sample Code 1, the first tag that is a leaf node is the \u201c<abstract>\u201d tag that encloses the string value \u201cYahoo Mail provides . . . \u201d. With JSON format, if the value corresponding to the name string positioned on the right of the \u201c:\u201d is a string and not an object marked by \u201c{\u201d or an array marked by \u201c[\u201d, then the name string is a leaf node, because there is no additional levels of nesting within this name string. In Sample Code 2, the first name string that is a leaf node is again \u201cabstract\u201d, and its corresponding value string is \u201cYahoo Mail provides . . . \u201d. In , the first \u201cabstract\u201d tag or name string is represented by node A.","A XML element or JSON name-value pair is placed in the output table based on its position within the multi-level nested structure. As explained before, a leaf node corresponds to a field, and leaf nodes under the same parent node are placed within the same row of the table. Each parent node of the leaf nodes corresponds to an object and a row of the table. Each grandparent node of the leaf nodes (i.e., the parent node of the object node) corresponds to a table. Thus, once the parser encounters a leaf node, the leaf node's grandparent node corresponds to a table and the leaf node's parent node corresponds to a row. In , the parent node of the \u201cabstract\u201d node A is the \u201cresult\u201d node A, and the grandparent node of the \u201cabstract\u201d node A is the \u201cresultset_web\u201d node . In Sample Code 1, the element that encloses the \u201cabstract\u201d tag is the \u201cresult\u201d tag (i.e., the object or parent node), and the element that encloses the \u201cresult\u201d tag is the \u201cresultset_web\u201d tag (i.e., the list or grandparent node). In Sample Code 2, there is no \u201cresult\u201d name string due to the syntax of JSON. Instead, the \u201cresultset_web\u201d name string has an array as its value, which is indicated by \u201c[\u201d and \u201c]\u201d. The parser would have to traverse through all the outer tags or name strings in order to reach the innermost \u201cabstract\u201d tag or name string.","Once the parser encounters the first leaf node within a list, it marks the leaf node's grandparent node as starting a new table (step ) and marks the leaf node's parent node as starting a new row in the table (step ). Next, the leaf node's name-value pair is added to the current row in the current table (step ). Since the \u201cabstract\u201d node A is the first leaf node encountered, it is added to the table as the first field in the first row as shown in Table 1.","Since the parser has reached a leaf node, it backtracks up the tree to process the next branch. The parser traverses up to the leaf node's parent node (i.e., the object node, step ) and determines whether the object node has any additional child leaf nodes that have not been processed (step ) in order to add all other leaf nodes under the same object node to the same row of the table. If there is any additional unvisited child leaf nodes, then the parser traverses down to the next unvisited child leaf node (step ). In Sample Code 1, the next tag to be encountered is the \u201c<date>\u201d tag. This is also a leaf node because there is no additional tag nested within this tag. Similarly, in Sample Code 2, the next name string to be encountered is the \u201cdate\u201d, which has a corresponding string value of \u201c2008\/06\/27\u201d on the right side of \u201c:\u201d. The parser again adds the \u201cdate\u201d field to the first row after the \u201cabstract\u201d field (step ).","Steps , , , and  are repeated multiple times, until all the leaf nodes under the same parent object node have been processed and added to the current row of the table. In Sample Code 1, there are five tags nested within the \u201c<result>\u201d tag: \u201c<abstract>\u201d, \u201c<date>\u201d, \u201c<size>\u201d, \u201c<title>\u201d, and \u201c<url>\u201d, each tag corresponding to a field in the first row of Table 1. When it is determined that the current parent node does not have any additional unvisited child node (step ), the current row of the table is compeleted (step ) as all the leaf nodes under the current object node have been added.","As the current branch under the object node has been traversed completely, the parser backtracks one level up to the grandparent level of the leaf node (i.e., the list node, step ) in order to process the next branch of the object node. A determination is made as to whether the grandparent list node has any additional child nodes that have not been traversed (step ). If so, the parser starts a new row in the table (step ) and traverses down to the next unvisited child object node (step ) to process all the leaf nodes under this next object node. Steps , , , and  are repeated as before until all the leaf nodes under the current object node have been processed and added to the current row of the table. Thereafter, the parser proceeds to the next unvisited object node. In Sample Code 1, there are five \u201c<result>\u201d tags (i.e., the object nodes) nested under the \u201c<resultset_web>\u201d tag (i.e., list node), and each \u201c<result>\u201d tags corresponds to a row in Table 1. In Sample Code 2, there are five elements in the array corresponding to the name string \u201cresultset_web\u201d.","When all the object nodes under a list node have been processed (i.e., all the child nodes of a grandparent node have been visited and traversed, step ), the current table is completed (step ). A determination is made as whether the list node (i.e., the grandparent node) has a parent node (step ). If so, the parser traverses up to the parent node of the grandparent node (i.e., the great grandparent node, step ) in order to process the next branch of the list node, which corresponds to a new table as each list node corresponds to a different table. The same steps described above starting from step  repeat for the next list node, if one has not been processed.","In Sample Code 1 and Sample Code 2, the root node \u201cysearchresponse\u201d only has one child list node \u201cresultset_web\u201d, and thus, only one table (i.e., Table 1) is obtained from parsing through the input data stream. If the input data stream contains more than one list nodes, then each list node will result in a separate table, and the same recursive algorithm as illustrated in  may be repeated for each list node.","According to one embodiment, only one table corresponding to one list node is selected as the output table for a given XML or JSON data stream. If an input data stream only contains one list node, then the table corresponding to that list node is selected as the output table. However, if an input stream contains multiple list nodes, then the table corresponding to the list node that has the largest data size in bytes nested within it is selected as the output table. For example, if in Sample Code 1, the \u201c<ysearchresponse>\u201d tag has two or more \u201c<resultset_web>\u201d tags nested within it, then each of the \u201c<resultset_web>\u201d tags will result in a separate table. The table corresponding to the \u201c<resultset_web>\u201d tag that has the largest bytes of data nested within it will be chosen as the output table. The parser keeps track of the number of bytes of data nested within each of the \u201c<resultset_web>\u201d tags as it traverses through the input data stream. When the parser completes parsing the entire input data stream, the table corresponding to the \u201c<resultset_web>\u201d tag that has the largest bytes of data is selected.","The method shown in  only adds the foundational elements or name-value pairs (i.e., leaf nodes) into the resulting table, thus removing any unnecessary and unimportant data. For example, any XML element or JSON name-value pair that has another list nested within it is ignored. Similarly, metadata, format data (e.g., color, fonts, style, etc.), comments, etc. are also discarded. As a result, the output table is much cleaner than the original input data stream and easier to process. Furthermore, because the parser algorithm determines the table entries based on the structure of the tree and places a leaf node (i.e., an element or a name-value pair) in the appropriate row of the table based on the position of the leaf node within the tree structure, the algorithm is independent of any syntax or schema. The algorithm may be applied to a data stream expressed in any format that meets either XML or JSON syntax specification, including any format that extends XML, such as RSS, XHTML, Atom, etc., or any format that may be conceptually represented using a hierarchical tree structure (i.e., a multi-level nested structure). In other words, the parser does not require the syntax schema of the input data stream in order to reformat the data stream.","It is not necessary for all the object nodes to contain the same field nodes or the same number of field nodes. One object node may have one set of field nodes and another object node may have another set of field nodes. Each set of field nodes are added to the row that corresponds to their parent object node.","III. Combine Multiple Tables","Sometimes it is desirable to combine multiple sets of data obtained from different sources into a single set of data for further processing. For example, it may be beneficial to obtain information on a particular subject matter from different resources (e.g., the Internet, government and academic databases, news agencies, commercial institutes, etc.) and then combine them into a single and more comprehensive set of data for further analysis and\/or processing. If necessary, data sets obtained from different sources may be reformatted into a standardized table format using the method illustrated in . As a result, each set of data may be represented using a table similar to Table 1.","Once each of the available data sets is reformatted into the standardized table format, the tables may be joined together to obtain a single output table, which contains a collection of fields selected from all the input tables. The following Table 2 and Table 3 represent two sample sets of data, each obtained from a different source and having been reformatted into the standardized table format. Both sets of data relate to the subject matter \u201cthe Swan Lake ballet\u201d. One set of data (i.e., Table 2) contains video clips posted on YouTube\u2122 relating to the ballet, and the other set of data (i.e., Table 3) contains various types of information relating to the ballet. The joining of multiple tables will be explained using Table 2 and Table 3 as sample input tables. The same process may be used to join any number of tables, and there is no limitation on the number of tables that may be joined together. Similarly, there is no limitation on the size of an input table (i.e., the number of rows and the number of fields in each row).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Video Clips of the Swan Lake Ballet"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"title=\u201cballet - swan lake\u201d; length=1:12; date=2008\/04\/06;"]},{"entry":[{},"posted_by=\u201cMike28\u201d; tags=\u201cballet dance swan lake\u201d;"]},{"entry":[{},"url=http:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=mGWAzfGBbXI"]},{"entry":[{},"title=\u201cTchaikovsky Swan Lake Ballet\u201d; length=2:02;"]},{"entry":[{},"date=2008\/03\/02; posted_by=\u201cdarkman7717\u201d;"]},{"entry":[{},"tags=\u201cTchaikovsky swan lake cygnes Allegro moderato"]},{"entry":[{},"Barenboim Staatsoper\u201d;"]},{"entry":[{},"url=http:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=WmgfOXr-rZw"]},{"entry":[{},"title=\u201cSwan Lake Odette Variation\u201d; length=2:42;"]},{"entry":[{},"date=2007\/02\/07; posted_by=\u201cmydiorella\u201d; tags=\u201cSvetlana"]},{"entry":[{},"Zakharova Ballet Swan Lake\u201d;"]},{"entry":[{},"url=http:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=Q8nSUBcYk5w"]},{"entry":[{},"title=\u201cPas de Trois from Swan Lake\u201d; length=9:12;"]},{"entry":[{},"date=2007\/09\/04; posted_by=\u201cradostsguy\u201d; tags=\u201cSwan Lake"]},{"entry":[{},"Ballet American Tchaikovsky\u201d;"]},{"entry":[{},"url=http:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=9HlUPVTT9jA"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 3"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Information on the Swan Lake Ballet"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"title=\u201cThe History of the Ballet Swan Lake\u201d;"]},{"entry":[{},"abstract=\u201cComplete historical information on the ...\u201d;"]},{"entry":[{},"url=http:\/\/www.balletmet.org\/Notes\/SwanHist.html"]},{"entry":[{},"title=\u201cBallet West's \u2018Swan Lake\u2019 soars\u201d; abstract=\u201cDeseret"]},{"entry":[{},"Morning News ...\u201d; publish_date=2006\/04\/17; author=Scott"]},{"entry":[{},"Iwasaki;"]},{"entry":[{},"url=http:\/\/deseretnews.com\/dn\/view\/0,1249,635200412,00.html"]},{"entry":[{},"title=\u201cAmerican Ballet Theatre's Strong \u2018Swan Lake\u2019\u201d;"]},{"entry":[{},"abstract=\u201cFor American Ballet Theatre's ...\u201d;"]},{"entry":[{},"publish_date=2008\/05\/29; author=Joel Lobenthal;"]},{"entry":[{},"url=http:\/\/www.nysun.com\/arts\/american-ballet-theatres-"]},{"entry":[{},"strong-swan-lake\/78801\/"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"There are various ways to join multiple tables, among which are cross join, inner join, and left outer join.

The qualifier (i.e., the table name) is automatically added to those fields that need further qualification (e.g., duplicate field names from the input tables) but is not added to those fields that do not require further qualification (e.g., unique field names from the input tables). Thus, the \u201ctitle\u201d field from Table 2 is further qualified as \u201ctable2$title\u201d in Table 4, and the \u201ctitle\u201d field from Table 3 is further qualified as \u201ctable3$title\u201d in Table 4.

On the other hand, because the \u201cabstract\u201d field from Table 3 is a unique name (i.e., not found in Table 2), the \u201cabstract\u201d field does not require further qualification.","Cross join operation performed on two input tables may be expressed using the following pseudo-code:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00007","num":"00007"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"for (each row i in input table 1) {"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003for (each row j in input table 2) {"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003output table row k = row i + row j;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003if (a field in row i has the same name as a field in"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003row j) {"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003qualify the field from row i with input table 1"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003namespace;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003qualify the field from row j with input table 2"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003namespace;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003}"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003j++;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003k++;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003}"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003i++;"]},{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"An inner join of two input tables results an output table where a row from the first input table and a row from the second input table are combined to form a row in the output table only if the two rows from the two input table satisfy a set of criteria, which is also referred to as a join predicate.

Sometimes, selected rows from a table may have similar or related fields, and it may be desirable to group these rows for one reason or another (e.g., to reduce the complexity of data processing or analysis). According to one embodiment, rows of a table may be grouped together based on another set of criteria, which may be referred to as a group predicate and may be expressed as a predicate function. Any condition may be used to select and group rows. For example, rows may be grouped based on dates, keywords, field names and\/or values, sizes, etc. Furthermore, the selected rows that satisfy the grouping condition(s) may be grouped together in any way desirable. For example, the fields may be combined, the field values may be added together or averaged, etc.","Table 4, which is the cross join result of Table 2 and Table 3, has twelve rows and some of the field values in selected rows overlap with each other.

Those rows that do not contain the specified field are left unmodified. There are eight rows in Table 4 that contain the \u201cauthor\u201d field and therefore are grouped together into a single row.

A function for reformatting an input data stream may have the interface \u201cTable create (string table_name, pointer input_data)\u201d. This function takes as input a table name and a pointer to the input data stream to be reformatted and returns a table. It is not necessary to specify any parsing logic or schema as the parser automatically determines the appropriate entry in the output table for each name-value pair found in the input data stream based on the position of the name-value pair within the multi-level nested data structure.","A function that performs the join operation on two tables may have the interface \u201cTable join (Definition join_predicate, Table table 1, Table table 2)\u201d. This function takes as input a join predicate and two input tables and returns a result joined table. It is not necessary to specify any namespace qualification since the join function automatically and intelligently resolve any name conflict. If, as a result of joining two rows from the two input tables, there are two fields having the same name, then these two fields are automatically further qualified with their respective original table name. As a result the \u201cjoin\u201d function is commutative, such that it is not necessary to specify the join constraints for each input table, but only a join predicate for the input tables. Note that the same join algorithm may be used to join three or more tables.","A function that performs the group operation on selected rows of a table may have the interface \u201cTable group (Definition group_predicate, Definition group_method, Table table)\u201d. This function takes as input a group predicate that specifies what condition(s) need to be satisfied for selecting rows to be grouped together, a group method that specifies how to group the fields from the selected rows, and a table and returns a result joined table. Again, it is not necessary to specify any namespace qualification. For example, if a request is made to join any rows that include a particular field and if the specified field has been further qualified by a namespace, when parsing the rows to determine if a particular row satisfies the group predicate, the namespace of the field is automatically ignored.","In addition to the table operations, the API may include support functionalities. For example, various text normalization functions may be provided, which may include converting all alphabets in a text string to all lower case or all upper case, removing extra white space or trivial words such as \u201ca\u201d, \u201cthe\u201d, \u201cthat\u201d, \u201cthis\u201d, \u201cwhich\u201d, reordering words, etc. Such functions are useful when a predicate requires an overlap (e.g., multiple keywords matching) between fields from multiple tables or multiple rows of the same table. By performing text normalization before searching for overlaps, it is no longer necessary to require an exact match. Instead, certain degree of similarity may be sufficient to satisfy an overlap predicate. As a result, the overlap algorithm incorporates some intelligent decision making process.","For example, suppose a row from one table has a \u201ctitle\u201d field whose value is \u201cTchaikovsky's ballet swan lake\u201d and another row from another table has a \u201ctitle\u201d field whose value is \u201cSwan Lake by Tchaikovsky\u201d. A join predicate requires that the rows from the two input tables are to be selected for combining only if there are at least three overlapping words found in the \u201ctitle\u201d fields. Without first performing text normalization, the above sample does not satisfy the join predicate, because strictly speaking, \u201cswan\u201d does not equal \u201cSwan\u201d and \u201cTchaikovsky's\u201d does not equal \u201cTchaikovsky\u201d. However, applying text normalization to the two field values, the first \u201ctitle\u201d field value becomes \u201ctchaikovsky ballet swan lake\u201d and the second \u201ctitle\u201d field value becomes \u201cswan lake tchaikovsky\u201d. The two values now have three overlapping words.","The API may include templates in XML or JSON code for presenting a table to a user. Different templates may have different layout or design so that an appropriate template may be easily selected for a particular type of data set.","The API may be especially beneficial in combining and processing multiple sets of data obtained from different sources. For example, suppose a person initiates a search request for the subject matter \u201cthe Swan Lake ballet\u201d at an Internet search site. Traditional search engines would return a list of websites that has information on the Swan Lake ballet. On the other hand, a search engine incorporating the API is able to perform several searches on behalf of the person from many different sources (e.g., websites, news, blogs, video clips, images, live feeds, etc.) and combine multiple sets of search results together to present a more comprehensive search result. The search engine may also correlate related results from different sources and rank them in the order of relevance or other types of criteria. Suppose among one data set is a news story about a upcoming performance of the Swan Lake ballet by the American Ballet Theatre, and among another data set is a video clip of a past performance of the Swan Lake ballet by the American Ballet Theatre. By selecting the suitable join predicate (i.e., overlapping conditions), the search engine may determine that the news story and the video clip are closely related (e.g., by finding several matching words or phrases, such as \u201cballet\u201d, \u201cSwan Lake\u201d, \u201cAmerican Ballet Theatre\u201d, etc.) and combine them together. The search engine may then present the two search results together to the person. As a result, the person may read the news story and then watch a video clip about the performance thereafter if he or she so desires.","The API may be incorporated into an environment where multiple sets of data expressed in different formats are collected from multiple sources and need to be combined and processed together. For example, the API is useful in connection with any arbitrary Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs.

Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, and so forth, which perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The computer program instructions with which embodiments of the invention are implemented may be stored in any type of computer-readable media, and may be executed according to a variety of computing models including, for example, on a consumer electronic device, on a stand-alone computing device, or according to a distributed computing model in which various of the functionalities described herein may be effected or employed at different locations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","300"]},"Computer system  includes a display , one or more input devices  (e.g., keypad, keyboard, mouse, stylus, etc.), one or more output devices  (e.g., speaker), one or more storage devices , various types of storage medium .","The system bus  link a wide variety of subsystems. As understood by those skilled in the art, a \u201cbus\u201d refers to a plurality of digital signal lines serving a common function. The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example and not limitation, such architectures include the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, the Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, the Video Electronics Standards Association local (VLB) bus, the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus, the PCI-Express bus (PCI-X), and the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) bus.","Processor(s)  (also referred to as central processing units, or CPUs) optionally contain a cache memory unit  for temporary local storage of instructions, data, or computer addresses. Processor(s)  are coupled to storage devices including memory . Memory  includes random access memory (RAM)  and read-only memory (ROM) . As is well known in the art, ROM  acts to transfer data and instructions uni-directionally to the processor(s) , and RAM  is used typically to transfer data and instructions in a bi-directional manner. Both of these types of memories may include any suitable of the computer-readable media described below. A fixed storage  is also coupled bi-directionally to the processor(s) , optionally via a storage control unit . It provides additional data storage capacity and may also include any of the computer-readable media described below. Storage  may be used to store operating system , EXECs , application programs , data  and the like and is typically a secondary storage medium (such as a hard disk) that is slower than primary storage. It will be appreciated that the information retained within storage , may, in appropriate cases, be incorporated in standard fashion as virtual memory in memory .","Processor(s)  is also coupled to a variety of interfaces such as graphics control , video interface , input interface , output interface, storage interface, and these interfaces in turn are coupled to the appropriate devices. In general, an input\/output device may be any of: video displays, track balls, mice, keyboards, microphones, touch-sensitive displays, transducer card readers, magnetic or paper tape readers, tablets, styluses, voice or handwriting recognizers, biometrics readers, or other computers. Processor(s)  may be coupled to another computer or telecommunications network  using network interface . With such a network interface , it is contemplated that the CPU  might receive information from the network , or might output information to the network in the course of performing the above-described method steps. Furthermore, method embodiments of the present invention may execute solely upon CPU  or may execute over a network  such as the Internet in conjunction with a remote CPU  that shares a portion of the processing.","In addition, embodiments of the present invention further relate to computer storage products with a computer-readable medium that have computer code thereon for performing various computer-implemented operations. The media and computer code may be those specially designed and constructed for the purposes of the present invention, or they may be of the kind well known and available to those having skill in the computer software arts. Examples of computer-readable media include, but are not limited to: magnetic media such as hard disks, floppy disks, and magnetic tape; optical media such as CD-ROMs and holographic devices; magneto-optical media such as floptical disks; and hardware devices that are specially configured to store and execute program code, such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), programmable logic devices (PLDs) and ROM and RAM devices. Examples of computer code include machine code, such as produced by a compiler, and files containing higher-level code that are executed by a computer using an interpreter.","The present invention has several advantageous. First, for data reformatting, the parser relies on the hierarchical nature of the input data structure, not on the actual syntax schema of the format in which the data is represented. Thus, any data set organized in a multi-level nested data structure may be reformatted readily without actually knowing the actual syntax schema of a format used by the data set.","Second, for various table operations, an inferred namespace is used to automatically resolve any potential field name conflicts. For example, when joining two or more tables, fields having the same name from different tables are automatically further qualified with their original table name. When comparing field names against a predicate function, added qualifiers are ignored. In addition, text normalization enables an operation to find similarities among multiple fields instead of requiring exact matches.","While this invention has been described in terms of several preferred embodiments, there are alterations, permutations, and various substitute equivalents, which fall within the scope of this invention. It should also be noted that there are many alternative ways of implementing the methods and apparatuses of the present invention. It is therefore intended that the following appended claims be interpreted as including all such alterations, permutations, and various substitute equivalents as fall within the true spirit and scope of the present invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention is illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings and in which like reference numerals refer to similar elements and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
