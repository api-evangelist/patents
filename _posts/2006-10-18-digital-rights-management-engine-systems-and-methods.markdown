The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","In modern computing systems, it is often desirable to limit access to electronic content, services, and\/or processing resources, and\/or to allow only certain entities to perform certain actions. A variety of techniques have been developed or proposed to enable such control. These techniques are often referred to as digital rights management (DRM) techniques because, in general terms, their goal is to manage the rights of various entities in digital or other electronic content, services, or resources. A problem with many prior art techniques is that they are overly complex, overly restrictive, relatively inflexible, fail to enable certain natural types of relationships and processes, and\/or are uninteroperable with other DRM systems.","Systems and methods are described herein that can be used to ameliorate some or all of these problems. It should be appreciated that embodiments of the presently described inventive body of work can be implemented in numerous ways, including as processes, apparatuses, systems, devices, methods, computer readable media, and\/or as a combination thereof. Several illustrative embodiments are described below.","A detailed description of the inventive body of work is provided below. While several embodiments are described, it should be understood that the inventive body of work is not limited to any one embodiment, but instead encompasses numerous alternatives, modifications, and equivalents. In addition, while numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding of the inventive body of work, some embodiments can be practiced without some or all of these details. Moreover, for the purpose of clarity, certain technical material that is known in the related art has not been described in detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the inventive body work.","Commonly-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/863,551, Pub. No. 2005\/0027871 A1 (\u201cthe '551 application\u201d), which is hereby incorporated by reference, describes embodiments of a digital rights management (DRM) architecture and a novel DRM engine that overcome some of the weaknesses that characterize many previous DRM implementations. The present application describes enhancements, extensions, and modifications to, as well as alternative embodiments of, the architecture and DRM engine described in the '551 application, as well as new components, architectures, and embodiments.

The user's system also includes software and\/or hardware, referred to herein as a digital rights management engine , for evaluating the license  associated with the packaged content  and enforcing the terms thereof (and\/or enabling application  to enforce such terms), such as by selectively granting the user access to the content only if permitted by the license . Digital rights management engine  may be structurally or functionally integrated with application , or may comprise a separate piece of software and\/or hardware.

DRM Engine Architecture","In one embodiment a relatively simple, open, and flexible digital rights management (DRM) engine is used to implement core DRM functions. In a preferred embodiment, this DRM engine is designed to integrate relatively easily into a web services environment such as that described in the '551 application, and into virtually any host environment or software architecture. In a preferred embodiment, the DRM engine is independent of particular media formats and cryptographic protocols, allowing designers the flexibility to use standardized or proprietary technologies as required by the particular situation. The governance model used by preferred embodiments of the DRM engine is simple, but can be used to express sophisticated relationships and business models.","Some of the illustrative embodiments of a DRM engine that are described below relate to an example implementation referred to as \u201cOctopus\u201d; however, it will be appreciated that the present inventions are not limited to the specific details of the Octopus example, which are provided for purposes of illustration, not limitation.","1.1. Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["303","302","303","304","303","304","303","305","306","308","303","304","303","304","305","306","303","304"],"i":["a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a","a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a "]},"In the example shown in , DRM engine , host application , host services , and web services interface are loaded onto a device , such as an end user's personal computer (PC). Device is communicatively coupled to a server , from which content  and license  were obtained, as well as a portable device , to which device may forward content  and\/or license . Each of these other devices may include a DRM engine  that is similar or identical to DRM engine , which can be integrated with the particular host application and host environment of the device. For example, server might include a host application that performs bulk packaging of content and\/or licenses, and makes use of a DRM engine to evaluate controls associated with the content that is being packaged in order to comply with any redistribution restrictions. Similarly, device might include a host application that is capable of both rendering and packaging content, while device might include a host application that is simply able to render content. As yet another example of the potential diversity of host environments, device might not include a web services interface, but may instead rely on communication with device , and web services interface to the extent host application and\/or DRM engine require the use of any web services.  is only one example of a system in which a DRM engine might be used; it will be appreciated that embodiments of the DRM engines described herein can be implemented and integrated with applications and systems in many different ways, and are not limited to the illustrative examples shown in .","1.2. Objects","In preferred embodiments, content protection and governance objects are used to represent entities in a system, to protect content, to associate usage rules with the content, and to determine if access can be granted when requested.","As described in more detail below, in one embodiment, the following objects are used:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Object Type","Function"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Node","Represents entities"]},{"entry":[{},"Link","Represents a directed relationship between"]},{"entry":[{},{},"entities"]},{"entry":[{},"Content","Represents content (e.g., media content)"]},{"entry":[{},"ContentKey","Represents encryption keys used to encrypt"]},{"entry":[{},{},"content"]},{"entry":[{},"Control","Represents usage rules that govern interaction"]},{"entry":[{},{},"with content"]},{"entry":[{},"Controller","Represents associations between Control and"]},{"entry":[{},{},"ContentKey objects"]},{"entry":[{},"Protector","Represents associations between Content and"]},{"entry":[{},{},"ContentKey objects"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"1.2.1. Node Objects","Node objects are used to represent entities in the system. In practice, a node will usually represent a user, a device, or a group. Node objects will also typically have associated attributes that represent certain properties of the entity associated with the node.","For example,  shows two users (Xan  and Knox ), two devices (PC  and portable device ), and several entities that represent groups (e.g., members of the Carey family , members of the public library , subscribers to a particular music service , RIAA-approved devices , and devices manufactured by a specific company ), each having an associated node object.","In one embodiment node objects include attributes that define what the node represents. One example of an attribute is a node type. Besides representing users, groups, or devices, the node type attribute could be used to represent other entities. In some embodiments, a node object can also include cryptographic key information, such as when an embodiment of the key derivation and distribution techniques described elsewhere herein is used.","In some embodiments, node objects also include a confidentiality asymmetric key pair that is used for targeting confidential information to the subsystems that have access to the confidential parts of the node object. This could be the entity that the node represents (for example, the Music Service ) or some entity responsible for managing the node (for example, the end user (e.g., Knox ) could be responsible for managing his or her portable device ).","1.2.2. Link Objects","In a preferred embodiment, link objects are signed objects used to show the relationship between two nodes. For example, in  the link  from the PC node  to Knox  shows ownership. The link from Knox  to the Carey family node  shows membership, as does the link from the Carey family node  to the Music Service Subscribers node . In one embodiment, link objects express the relationship between two nodes, and thus the relationships shown in  could be represented using ten links.","As shown in , a graph  can be used to express the relationship between nodes, where link objects are the directed edges between nodes. For example, in , the relationship between the Carey family node  and the Music Service node  asserts that there exists a directed edge  in the graph whose vertices are the Carey family node  and the Music Service node . Knox  and Xan  are members of the Carey family . Because Knox  is linked to the Carey family  and the Carey family  is linked to the Music Service  there is said to be a path between Knox  and the Music Service . A DRM engine considers a node to be reachable from another node when there is a path from that node to the other node. This allows a control to be written that allows permission to access protected content based on the condition that a node is reachable from the device where the application that requests access to the protected content is executing.","As described in more detail below, link objects can also optionally contain some cryptographic data that allows derivation of content keys. Link objects may also contain control programs that define the conditions under which the link may be deemed to be valid. Such control programs can be executed or interpreted (these terms are used interchangeably herein) by a DRM engine's virtual machine to evaluate the validity of a link (e.g., to determine whether the link may be used to reach a given node in an authorization graph).","In one embodiment, links are signed. Any suitable digital signature mechanism can be used, and in one embodiment the DRM engine does not define how the link objects are signed and does not evaluate any associated certificates, instead, it relies on the host system to verify any such signatures and\/or certificates. This allows the system architect or administrator to define the lifetime of a link object, to revoke it, and so on (e.g., by using expiring keys or certificates, revocation, and\/or the like), thus providing an additional layer of policy management and security on top of the policy management and security provided by the DRM engine's evaluation of control programs and DRM objects in the context of specific pieces of protected content and\/or links (for example, expiration of a link could alternatively, or in addition, be implemented by including an appropriate control program in the link object itself, which, when executed would enforce the expiration date or other validity period). In one embodiment, the DRM engine is generic, and works with any suitable encryption, digital signature, revocation, and\/or other security scheme that is used by the host application and\/or environment. Thus, for example, if the DRM engine needs to determine if a particular link has been properly signed, it might simply call the host application (and\/or a host or system cryptographic service) to verify the signature in accordance with the particular signature scheme chosen by the system designer, the details of which the DRM engine itself may be unaware. In other embodiments, the DRM engine itself performs the actual signature evaluation, relying on the host simply to indicate the appropriate signature algorithm to use.","1.2.3. Content Protection and Governance","Referring once again to , in a typical scenario, a content provider uses an application that includes a packaging engine to encrypt or otherwise cryptographically secure a piece of electronic content  and creates a license  that governs access to or other use of that content. In one embodiment, license  comprises a set of objects  that specify how content  may be used, and also includes the content's encryption key(s) and\/or the information needed to obtain them. In one embodiment, content  and license  are logically separate, but are bound together by internal references (e.g., using object IDs ). In many situations it may be convenient to store and\/or deliver the content and the license together; however, this is not required in preferred embodiments. In one embodiment, a license can apply to more than one item of content, and more than one license can apply to any single item of content.","As shown in , when a host application running on a client device wants to perform an action on a particular piece of content , it asks DRM engine to check if the action it intends to perform (e.g., \u201cplay\u201d) is allowed. In one embodiment, the DRM engine will, from the information contained in the objects  comprising content license , load and execute a control program associated with content , and permission to perform the action will be granted or denied based on the result returned by the control program. Permission will typically require that some conditions be met, such as the condition that a node be reachable from the node representing the requesting entity\/device ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","502","504","504","506","508"]},"1.2.4. License DRM Objects","As shown in , in preferred embodiment a license  is a collection of objects. In the example shown in , license  comprises a ContentKey object , a protector object , a controller object , and a control object . As shown in , ContentKey object  includes encrypted key data  (e.g., an encrypted version of the key needed to decrypt encrypted content item ) and information regarding the cryptosystem used to encrypt the key data. Protector object  binds ContentKey object  to one or more content objects . As shown in , control object  includes and protects a control program  that specifies how content object  is governed. In a preferred embodiment, control program  is a piece of executable bytecode that runs on a virtual machine operated by the DRM engine. The control program governs whether certain actions can be performed on the content by checking for satisfaction of conditions specified in the control program, such as whether certain nodes are reachable using valid link objects, whether certain state objects have been stored, whether the host environment has certain characteristics, and\/or the like. Referring once again to , controller object  is used to bind one or more ContentKey object  to control object .","License  may also comprise additional objects, such as metadata providing a machine- or human-readable description of the content-access conditions required by the license. Alternatively, or in addition, such metadata can be included as a resource extension of one of the other objects (e.g., control object ). In the embodiment shown in , control object  and controller object  are both signed, so that the system can verify that the control information is from a trusted source before using it to make content-access decisions. In one embodiment, the validity of control object  can also be checked through verification of a secure hash included in controller object . Controller object  can also contain a hash value for each of the keys or other key data contained in the ContentKey object(s)  that it references, thereby rendering it relatively difficult for an attacker to tamper with the binding between the key data and the ContentKey object.","As shown in , in one embodiment content  is encrypted and is included in a content object . The decryption key  that is used is included within (or referenced by) ContentKey object , and the binding between the two is represented by the protector object . As shown in , unique IDs are used to facilitate the binding between content object  and ContentKey object . The rules that govern the use of key  to decrypt content  are included within control object , and the binding between control object  and ContentKey  is represented by controller object , again using unique IDs.","It will be appreciated that while  shows the objects that comprise a license in one preferred embodiment, the DRM systems and methods described herein are not limited to the use of this license structure. For example, without limitation, licenses could be used in which the functionality of the various objects shown in  are combined in a smaller number of objects, or spread out over additional objects, or broken up between objects in a different manner. Alternatively, or in addition, embodiments of the systems and methods described herein can be practiced with licenses that lack some of the functionality enabled by the license structure shown in , and\/or that provide additional functionality. Thus it will be appreciated that any suitable mechanism for associating licenses with content can be used in accordance with the principles described herein, although in preferred embodiments the advantageous structure shown in  is used.","1.3. State Database","In one embodiment, the DRM engine includes, or has access to, a secure, persistent object store that can be used to provide a secure state storage mechanism. Such a facility is useful to enable control programs to be able to read and write state information that is persistent from invocation to invocation. Such a state database can be used to store state objects such as play-counts, date of first use, accumulated rendering times, and\/or the like, as well as membership status, and\/or any other suitable data. In some embodiments, a DRM engine executing on a first system may not have access to a local state database, and may be operable to access a remote state database, e.g., using web and\/or host services. In some situations, it may be necessary for a DRM engine executing on a first system to access state information stored in a database on a remote system. For example the first system may not include a state database, or may not have the information it needs in its own state database. In some embodiments, when a DRM engine is faced with such a situation, it might access a remote state database via a services interface, and\/or by using agent programs, as described in more detail below.","1.4. About Control Programs","The systems and methods described herein make use of control programs in a variety of contexts. For example, control programs contained in control objects can be used to express the rules and conditions governing the use of protect content. In addition, control programs in link objects can be used to express the rules and conditions used to determine whether the link is valid for a given purpose (e.g., a node reachability analysis). Such control programs are sometimes referred to herein as link constraints. Yet another context in which control programs may be used is in agent or delegate objects, were the control code is used to perform an action on behalf of another entity (in the case of agent control programs) or on behalf of another control (in the case of delegate control programs).","In one embodiment, control programs are executed or interpreted by a virtual machine hosted by a DRM engine, as opposed to being executed directly by a physical processor. It will be appreciated, however, that a physical processor or other hardware logic could be readily constructed to execute control programs. In one embodiment, the control programs are in byte-code format, which facilitates interoperability across platforms.","In a preferred embodiment, control programs are written in assembly language and converted into byte code by an assembler program. In other embodiments, templates and\/or high-level rights expression languages could be used to provide the initial expression of rights, rules, and\/or conditions, and a compiler could be used to convert the high-level expression into byte code for execution by an embodiment of the DRM engine described herein. For example, rights expressions written in a proprietary DRM format could, with an appropriate compiler, be converted or translated into a functionally equivalent byte code expression for execution on an embodiment of the DRM engine described herein, thus enabling a protected piece of content to be used, in accordance with the conditions specified by the content provider, on systems that understand the proprietary DRM format, as well as systems that included a DRM engine such as that described herein. It should also be appreciated that the digital rights management engine systems and methods described herein are not limited to the use of byte code rights expressions, interpreted by a virtual machine. Instead, in some embodiments, rights can be expressed in any suitable manner (e.g., using a high-level rights expression language (REL), a template, etc.), and the authorization graph and\/or other techniques described herein performed using an application program designed to recognize and evaluate such rights expressions.","1.4.1. Conditions","As previously indicated, control programs typically express one or more conditions that must be satisfied in order for a request to use a piece of content to be granted, for a link to be deemed valid, and\/or the like. Any suitable conditions can be used, depending on the requirements of the content provider or system architect, and\/or the functionality provided by the system.","In preferred embodiments, the virtual machine used by the DRM engine supports arbitrarily complex programs that are capable of testing for conditions such as some or all of the following:\n\n","Using these or any other suitable conditions, a control object can express rules that govern how content can be rendered, transferred, exported, and\/or the like. It will be appreciated that the above list of conditions is illustrative in nature, and that any suitable conditions could be defined and used by, e.g., implementing a system call for use in testing for the desired condition. For example, without limitation, if it were desired to require that a device be located on a particular sub-network, a system call could be defined (e.g., GetIPConfig) that would be operable to return the host device's IPConfig information (or a remote device's IPConfig information, if the system call were run on a remote device using an agent), which could be used by a control program to test for whether the device was located on the prescribed sub-network.","1.4.2. Agents","Preferred embodiments of the DRM engine-related systems and methods described herein provide support for independent objects that carry control programs. Such \u201cagents\u201d can be distributed to a DRM engine running on a remote system in order to accomplish specified functions, such as writing into the remote DRM engine's secure state store. For example, an agent could be sent as a consequence of contacting a remote service, or executing a remote control program. An agent can also be used to effect a content move operation, to initialize a counter, to deregister a node, and\/or the like. As yet another example, an agent could be used to perform a reachability analysis from a remote node to another node. Such an agent could, e.g., be useful in enforcing a policy that prohibited a device registered to a first user from being registered to a second user. If the second user requested registration, an agent could be sent to the device by the second user, or a registration service acting on his or her behalf, to determine if the device was already registered to the first user, in which case the second user's registration request would be denied.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0110"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIG. 7A"],"b":["700","702","703","700","702","704","700"]},"For example, the DRM system  on system A  may be evaluating\/enforcing a rule for performing a remote rendering of content from system A  to system B , and the rule might indicate that such an operation is permitted only if system B  is part of a certain group of devices, where the membership in that group is asserted by the presence of a state object  in a secure state database  accessible on system B .","A method used in a preferred embodiment to handle such situations makes use of agents. For example, if system A  needs information from system B , system A  prepares an agent , which, in one embodiment, is a control program (e.g., a sequence of instructions that can be executed by a DRM engine) that is sent from system A  to system B . In one embodiment, system A  sends agent code  to system B  over an authenticated communication channel  so that system A  can be confident that it is indeed on system B  that agent  will run. In some embodiments, along with agent code , system A  may also communicates to system B  one or more parameters that may be used by agent code  to perform its work.","As shown in , system B  receives agent  and any associated agent parameters, and runs the agent code . When agent  is run on system B , it accesses system B's state database , retrieves state information  and\/or performs one or more computations therewith, and sends the results  back to system A , preferably over authenticated communication channel . At this point, system A  has the information it needs to continue with its evaluation.","1.4.3. Link Constraints","In one embodiment, the set of routines that represent the rules that govern the performance of a certain operation (such as \u201cplay\u201d) on a content item is called an \u201caction control\u201d. The set of routines that represent validity constraints on a link object is called a \u201clink constraint\u201d. Like action controls, in preferred embodiments link constraints can express any suitable combination of conditions. Also like action controls, link constraints can be evaluated locally and\/or remotely using a services interface or an agent.","1.4.4. Obligations and Callbacks","In one embodiment, certain actions, when granted, require further participation from the host application. Obligations represent operations that need to be performed by the host application upon or after the use of the content key it is requesting. Callbacks represent calls to one or more of the control program's routines that need to be performed by the host application upon or after the use of the content key it is requesting. Examples of obligations include, without limitation, a requirement that certain outputs and\/or controls be turned off while content is being rendered (e.g., to prevent writing the content to an unprotected output or to prevent fast-forwarding through certain important segments of the content); a requirement that information regarding use of the content be recorded (e.g., metering or audit information) and\/or sent to a remote site (e.g., a clearinghouse, service provider, or the like); a requirement that an agent program be executed locally or remotely; and\/or the like. Examples of callbacks include, without limitation a requirement that the host call the control program back at a certain absolute time, after a certain elapsed time (e.g., an elapsed time of content usage), after occurrence of a certain event (e.g., the completion of a trial content-rendering period), when the content has stopped being used, and\/or the like. For example, a callback after a certain elapsed time could be used to increment or decrement budgets, playcounts, and the like (e.g., only debiting the users budget if they use a piece of content for at least a certain amount of time), thus protecting the user from having his or her account debited if he or she accidently presses the play button but immediately presses stop.","In one embodiment, there are different types of obligations and callbacks, and if an application encounters any critical obligation or callback that it does not support, or does not understand (for example because the obligation type may have been defined after the application was implemented), the application is required to refuse to continue the action for which this obligation or callback parameter was returned.","1.4.5.

For example, in one embodiment content services  are responsible for acquiring content from media servers, and storing and managing the content on the client's persistent storage, while media rendering engine  is the subsystem responsible for accessing the multimedia content and rendering it (e.g., on a video and\/or audio output).

For example, without limitation, the logical division of functionality between the DRM engine and the host application in  is simply illustrative of one possible embodiment, and in practical implementations variations can be made. For example, the DRM engine could be integrated wholly or partially with the host application. Thus, it will be appreciated that any suitable division of functionality between host application and DRM engine can be used.","1.6. Packager Architecture","The following provides an example of the functions that a packaging engine might perform for a host application that packages electronic content. In practice, a packaging application may focus on packaging specifically, or could be part of a general-purpose application operating at a user system that also accesses protected content (either packaged locally or elsewhere, e.g., on a network).","In various embodiments, a packaging host application might perform some or all of the following:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0135","num":"0151"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1400","1416","1416"]},"In one embodiment, a host application  provides a user interface  and is responsible for obtaining information such as content references and the action(s) the user (typically a content owner or provider) wants to perform (e.g., to whom to bind content, what content-usage conditions to include in a license, etc). User interface  can also display information about the packaging process, such as the text of the license issued and, if a failure occurs, the reason for the failure. In some embodiments, some information needed by the host application  may require the use of other services, such as authentication or authorization services, and\/or membership through a Service Access Point (SAP). Thus, in some embodiments the packaging application  and\/or the host application  may need to implement some or all of the following:\n\n","The following describes a key derivation system that fits naturally with preferred embodiments of the DRM engine and system architecture described herein, and\/or can be used in other contexts. Some of the examples in the following section are taken from a reference implementation of a preferred embodiment of this key derivation system known as \u201cScuba\u201d. Additional embodiments are described in the '551 application.","As shown in , in some embodiments link objects , are used to distribute keys, in addition to their primary purpose of establishing relationships between nodes , , . As described above, a control object can contain a control program that can be used to decide if a request to perform an action should be granted or not. To do this, the control program may check whether a specific node is reachable via a chain of links. The key derivation techniques described herein take advantage of the existence of this chain of links to facilitate the distribution of a key, such that the key can be made available to the DRM engine that is executing the control program.","In one illustrative embodiment, each node object , , in a given deployment that uses the optional key distribution system has a set of keys that are used to encrypt content keys and other nodes' keys. Link objects , created for use in the same deployment contain some cryptographic data as a payload that allows key information do be derived when chains of links are processed by a DRM engine.","With nodes and links carrying keys in this manner, given a chain of links , from a node A to a node C C, an entity (e.g., the DRM engine of a client host application) that has access to the secret sharing keys of node A , , also has access to the secret sharing keys of node C , . Having access to node C's secret sharing keys gives the entity access to any content key encrypted with those keys.","1.7. Nodes, Entities, and Keys","1.7.1. Entities","In one embodiment of a DRM system, nodes are data objects, not active participants in the system. Active participants, in this context, are called entities. Examples of entities are media players, devices, a subscription service, content packagers, and the like. Entities typically have nodes associated with them. An entity that consumes content uses a DRM engine and manages at least one node object that constitutes its personality. In one embodiment, an entity is assumed to have access to all the data of the node objects it manages, including all the private information of those objects.","1.7.2. Nodes","Node objects that participate in an illustrative embodiment of the key derivation system contain keys as part of their data. In one embodiment, nodes may contain two general types of keys: sharing keys and confidentiality keys. The following sections list the different key types that can be used in various embodiments. It will be appreciated, however, that a specific deployment may use only a subset of these keys. For example, a system could be configured to work only with key pairs, omitting the use of secret symmetric keys. Or a system could be deployed without provisioning nodes with confidentiality keys if it only needed to use the sharing keys.","1.7.2.1. Sharing Keys","Sharing keys are public\/private key pairs and\/or symmetric keys that are shared by a node N and all the nodes Px for which there exists a link from Px to N that contains key derivation extensions.","Sharing Public Key:","Kpub-share[N] This is the public part of a pair of public\/private keys for the public key cipher. This key typically comes with a certificate so that its credentials can be verified by entities that want to cryptographically bind confidential information to it.","Sharing Private Key:","Kpriv-share[N] This is the private part of the public\/private key pair. The entity that manages the node is responsible for ensuring that this private key is kept secret. For that reason, this private key will generally be stored and transported separately from the rest of the node information. This private key can be shared downstream with other nodes through the key derivation extensions of links.","Sharing Symmetric Key:","Ks-share[N] This is a key that is used with a symmetric cipher. As with the private key, this key is confidential, and the entity that manages the node is responsible for keeping it secret. This secret key can be shared downstream with other nodes through the key derivation extensions of links.","1.7.2.2. Confidentiality Keys","Confidentiality keys are key pairs and\/or symmetric keys that are only known to the entity that manages the node to which they belong. The difference between these keys and the sharing keys described above is that they will not be shared with other nodes through the key derivation extensions in links.","Confidentiality Public Key:","Kpub-conf[N] This is the public part of a pair of public\/private keys for the public key cipher. This key typically comes with a certificate so that its credentials can be verified by entities that want to cryptographically bind confidential information to it.","Confidentiality Private Key:","Kpriv-conf[N] This is the private part of the public\/private key pair. The entity that manages the node is responsible for ensuring that this private key is kept secret. For that reason, this private key will generally be stored and transported separately from the rest of the node information.","Confidentiality Symmetric Key:","Ks-conf[N] This is a key that is used with a symmetric cipher. As with the confidentiality private key, this key is kept secret.","1.8. Cryptographic Elements","Preferred embodiments of the key derivation and distribution systems described herein can be implemented using a variety of different cryptographic algorithms, and are not restricted to any specific choice of cryptographic algorithm. Nevertheless, for a given deployment or profile, all participating entities will generally need to agree on a set of supported algorithms (where the term profile will generally refer to the specification of a set of actual technologies used in a particular implementation (e.g., an RSA for key derivation; XML for encoding objects; MP4 for the file format, etc.) and\/or other representation of the semantic context that exists when objects are defined in a practical deployment).","In one embodiment, deployments include support for at least one public key cipher (such as RSA) and one symmetric key cipher (such as AES).","The following notation will be used when referring to cryptographic functions:\n\n","1.9. Targeting of Content Keys","In a preferred embodiment, two types of cryptographic targeting are used. Targeting a content key to a target node's sharing keys means making that key available to all entities that share the secret sharing keys of that target node. Targeting a content key to a node's confidentiality keys means making that key available only to the entity that manages that node. Targeting of a content key is done by encrypting the content key, CK, carried in a ContentKey object using one or both of the following methods:\n\n","In a preferred embodiment, symmetric binding is used where possible, as it involves a less computationally intensive algorithm, and therefore makes it less onerous to the receiving entity. However, the entity (typically, a content packager) that creates the ContentKey object may not always have access to Ks[N]. If the packager does not have Ks[N], then it can use public binding, since Kpub[N] is not confidential information and therefore can be made available to entities that need to do public binding. Kpub[N] will usually be made available to entities that need to target content keys, accompanied by a certificate that can be inspected by the entity to decide whether Kpub[N] is indeed the key of a node that can be trusted to handle the content key in accordance with some agreed-upon policy (e.g., that the node corresponds to an entity running a DRM engine and host application that comply with the functional, operational, and security policies of the system).","1.10. Derivation of Keys Using Links","To allow an entity to have access to the sharing keys of all the nodes reachable from its personality node, in one embodiment link objects contain an optional key extension payload. This key extension payload allows entities that have access to the private\/secret keys of the link's \u201cfrom\u201d node to also have access to the private\/secret sharing keys of the link's \u201cto\u201d node. In this way, an entity can decrypt any content key targeted to a node that is reachable from its personality node (if the targeting was done using the target node's sharing keys).","In one embodiment, when a DRM engine processes link objects, it processes the key extension payload of each link in order to update an internal chain of keys to which it has access. In one embodiment, the key extension payload of a link, L, from node, F, to node, T, comprises either:\n\n","Where {Ks-share[T], Kpriv-share[T]} is a data structure containing Ks-share[T] and Kpriv-share[T].","The public derivation information is used to convey the secret sharing keys of node T, Ks-share[T] and Kpriv-share[T], to any entity that has access to the private sharing key of node F, Kpriv-share[F].","The symmetric derivation information is used to convey the secret sharing keys of node T, Ks-share[T] and Kpriv-share[T], to any entity that has access to the symmetric sharing key of node F, Ks-share[F].","As for targeting content keys to nodes, the preferred payload to include in a link is the symmetric derivation information. This is possible when the link creator has access to Ks-share[F]. If not, then the link creator will fall back to including the public derivation information as the payload for the link.","Assuming that the DRM engine processing a link already had Ks-share[F] and Kpriv-share[F] in its internal key chain, after processing the link, L[F\u2192T], it will also have Ks-share[T] and Kpriv-share[T].","Since, in one embodiment, links can be processed in any order, the DRM engine may not be able to do the key derivation computations at the time a given link, L, is processed. This might be due to the fact that, at that time, the DRM engine's key chain might not yet contain the keys of the \u201cfrom\u201d node of that link. In this case, the link is remembered, and processed again when new information becomes available to the DRM engine, such as after processing a new link, P. If the \u201cto\u201d node of link P is the same as the \u201cfrom\u201d node of link L, and the \u201cfrom\u201d node of link P is a reachable node, then the \u201cfrom\u201d node of link L will also be reachable, and the key derivation step adds the private sharing keys of the \u201cfrom\u201d node of link L to the key chain.","5. Implementation Examples","Several examples are provided below to illustrate how various embodiments of the systems and methods described herein could be applied in practice. The systems and methods described herein can enable a wide range of rights management and other functionality, and thus it will be appreciated that the specific examples that are given here are not intended to be exhaustive, but are rather illustrative of the scope of the inventive body of work.","1.11. Example: Users, PCs, and Devices","Assume that you want to implement a DRM system that ties the right to play content to a particular user, and you want to make it easy for the user to play content on all the playback devices that he or she owns. Assume that you decide that you are going to provide users with software that enables them to add playback devices as needed (e.g., mobile players). Also assume, however, that you want to set some policy to limit the number of general-purpose devices to which the user can transfer the content, so that the user does not have the ability to act as a distribution agency.","Based on these system requirements, it might, for example, make sense to tie the licenses you create to users, and to establish relationships between users and the devices that they use. Thus, in this example, you might first decide what kinds of nodes you need to establish the sorts of relationships that you require. For example, you might define the following types of nodes:\n\n","Each node object can include a type attribute that indicates whether the object represents a user, a PC, or a device.","Say, for example, that you decide to restrict the maximum number of PC node objects that can be attached to any one user at a particular time to four (4). You decide there is no need to restrict the number of devices attached to the user as long as you provide restriction on the number of PCs. Based on this, a control program can be set up to allow access if a relationship can be established between the user node and the node that requests access. That node, then, could be either a PC or a device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0184","num":"0214"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":["1600","1602","1602","1604","1604","1604","1604","1606","1608","1610","1612","1604","1606","1602","1600","1606","1614","1606","1614","1600","1614","1616","1606","1602","1616","1606","1604","1618","1600","1618","1602","1602","1619","1604","1618","1606","1620","1606","1619","1618","1602","1620","1616","1602","1606","1604","1618","1619"],"i":["a","b ","a","b","a","b ","a ","a","a","a ","a ","a","a ","a ","a ","a"]},"Since the content decryption key, in this example, is encrypted using a secret key associated with the user's node , this secret key will need to be obtained in order to decrypt the content decryption key. If the optional key derivation techniques described elsewhere herein have been used, the user node's key can be obtained simply by decrypting the key derivation information contained in link  using one of device 's secret keys. The decrypted key derivation information will contain the key needed to decrypt the content decryption key contained in license  (or information from which it can be derived or obtained).","Referring once again to , assume user wishes to associate a new PC  with his or her user node . Server  verifies that the maximum number of PCs have not already been associated with user node , and authorizes PC  to be associated with user node . To perform the association, however, server  needs to obtain personalization information from PC  (e.g., cryptographic keys, a unique identifier, etc.). If, however, the PC  has not been previously personalized (as might be the case if the user simply downloaded a copy of the PC software) server  will perform the personalization process (e.g., by creating a PC node object using the bootstrap protocol described elsewhere herein) or direct the user to a service provider who can perform the personalization process. Upon completion of the personalization process, server  can create a link  from PC  to user node and send the link to the PC , which could continue to use it as long as it remained valid.","The user could request to add additional PCs later, and the server would enforce the policy that limits the number of PC node objects per user to 4 (typically it would also provide the ability for users to remove PCs from its active list as needed).","As yet another example, assume now that the service provider has decided that users should be able to play any content that they own on any device that they own. The service provider might also wish to allow the user's PC software to create links to each of his or her devices, rather than requiring the user to contact server . In such an embodiment, when the user wished to play content on a new device, the user's PC software would access the new device's confidential personalization information and use it to create a new link for that device (e.g., a link from the new device to the user's node ). If the device was not personalized, then the PC software might access a remote service, or direct the device to access the remote service, to perform the personalization process. The PC software would then send the link to the new device, at which point the new device would be able to play the content as long as it remained valid, since, in one embodiment, once a link object exists there is no need to create another one unless the link object expires or is otherwise invalidated.","In the examples shown above, content is targeted to the user. To do this, a packager application chooses a new ID for the content, or uses an existing one, creates an encryption key and associated ContentKey object, as well as a protector object to bind the content object and the ContentKey object. The packager then creates a control object with a control program (e.g., compiled in byte code executable by the DRM engine's virtual machine) that allows the \u201cplay\u201d action to take place if and only if the user node is reachable from the PC or device node that is requesting the action. Typically, the control, controller, protector and ContentKey objects are embedded in the packaged content if appropriate, so that the PCs and devices do not have to obtain them separately.","In one embodiment, when a device or a PC wants to play content, it follows a process such as that previously described in connection with . That is, the DRM engine finds the protector object for the content ID of the content, then the ContentKey object referenced by that protector, then the controller object that references that ContentKey object, and finally the control object referenced by that controller. The DRM engine executes the control program of the control object, which checks whether or not the user node is reachable. If the device or PC node has the necessary link objects to verify that there exists a path between its node and the user node, then the condition is met and the control program allows the use of the key represented in the ContentKey object. The media rendering engine of the device or PC can then decrypt and play the content.","1.12.

In one embodiment, this could be done as follows:","For ease of explanation, assume that the DRM-enabled consuming software  required to play the DRM-protected content  is already present on the friend's PC . The file containing the content  and license  is transferred to the friend's PC . When the user tries to play the content , the software  recognizes that there is no valid link object linking the local PC node with the node of the user who owns the content. Software  prompts the user for his credentials  (this could be provided via a username\/password, a mobile phone authentication protocol, a smartcard, or any authentication system allowed under the policy of the system) and communicates with a backend system . The backend system  checks the attributes of the user node object and PC node object for which the link is requested, and checks that there is no active temporary login link object still valid. If those conditions are met, the backend service  creates a link object  linking the friend's PC node object and user's node, with a validity period limited to the requested login duration (e.g., less than 12 hours, to comply with the policy in this example). Having the link object  now enables the friend's PC  to play the user's content  until the link  expires.","1.13.

For example, a group called \u201cSpecial Projects Team\u201d may be set up by a company's system administrator to identify the members of the company's Special Projects Team.","In one embodiment the directory server  may comprise an Active Directory server running web services, such as those described in the '551 application (and implemented, e.g., with standard IIS based technologies on the Windows\u00ae platform), that issue nodes, links, and licenses to the people in the Special Projects Team group based on content that is accessed. If membership changes in the group, then new tokens may be issued. For revocation of rights, the directory server  can run a security metadata service based on technology such as that described in the '551 application (occasionally referred to herein as \u201cNEMO\u201d technology). In some embodiments, the client can be required to have an to-date time value or notion of time (based on whatever freshness value the company chooses to define (e.g., 1 week, 1 day, 1 hour, every 5 minutes, etc.)) in order to use DRM licenses. For example, a token that the security metadata service provides might include a trusted and authenticable time value. In some embodiments, the client can identify user node IDs in security metadata service interactions. Security metadata can be evaluated directly in the context of license controls to determine if a user still has a given membership. Security metadata can also return agents that can determine if relationships such as being a member in the Special Projects Team are valid.

Likewise, if he forwards this document to others, they can only access it if they also can produce a valid chain of links to the \u201cSpecial Projects Team\u201d Group Node (e.g., by requiring that the Special Projects Team Node be reachable by the device).","John might save the file (already protected) on his computer, and later attach it to an email message (action ). For example, he might open an old email to his boss (George), attach the file as he normally does, and send the message. As shown in , George also has the DRM plugin  installed on his computer . When he logged in to his computer , the plugin  opportunistically checked all of the groups that he has been added to (action ), and downloaded new, refreshed links for any that had expired (action ). If he had been added to \u201cSpecial Projects Team\u201d since his last login, his plugin  would download a Link Object  that links his User Node to the \u201cSpecial Projects Team\u201d Group Node. This Link  signifies that User Node \u201cGeorge\u201d is a member of the Group Node \u201cSpecial Projects Team\u201d. In this example, assume Link Object  has an expiration date after which it will no longer be valid (e.g., 3 days).","As shown in , when George tries to open the document (actions , ), the DRM plugin  checks the embedded (or attached) license, and learns that the \u201cSpecial Projects Team\u201d node must be reachable. His plugin  constructs (and validates) a chain of links ,  from his computer's Device Node to the User Node \u201cGeorge\u201d; and from User Node \u201cGeorge\u201d to Group Node \u201cSpecial Projects Team\u201d (action ).

Thus, in some embodiments, by producing a chain of Links to the Special Projects Team Node, the plugin can not only prove that it is permitted to access the content, but also that it is capable of decrypting a chain of keys that enable it to decrypt the content.","If, for example, another employee (\u201cCarol\u201d) receives John's email accidentally, and attempts to open the document, her DRM plugin will retrieve the license bundled with the file and evaluate the terms of the license. Her PC has a link to her User Node \u201cCarol\u201d; but since she is not a member of the team, there is no Link from \u201cCarol\u201d to the \u201cSpecial Projects Team\u201d Group Node. Since \u201cSpecial Projects Team\u201d is not reachable, she is not permitted to access the file.","If Carol is eventually added to the group \u201cSpecial Projects Team\u201d. The next time her DRM plugin refreshes her memberships, it will detect this new group, and download a Link Object that links her User Node to the Special Projects Team Node.

Since \u201cSpecial Projects Team\u201d is not reachable, he is not permitted to access the file.","Assume that the company has a policy that requires access to all confidential information to be logged. In one such an embodiment, the policy for the Special Projects Team dictates that all licenses that are created for this group also need to require collection and reporting of usage information to, e.g., a central repository. Thus, in this example, when evaluating (e.g., executing) the control program in the license, the plugin executes the requirement to log the access and does so.

When John installs the DRM plug-in  for his applications, it also installs items to his email toolbar. At some point during his composition of the email message, John accesses \u201cSet Permissions\u201d from a pull-down menu that was added to his toolbar. The DRM plug-in  contacts a Policy Service  and displays a list of corporate messaging policies from which to choose. John selects \u201cSpecial Project DRM Template\u201d and the DRM plug-in  uses the NEMO protocol to request and ensure the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of policy object that it receives. The policy describes how the licenses that use this template should be created, including how they should be targeted and bound.","When John hits \u201cSend\u201d, the DRM plugin  encrypts the message and attachment, and generates the associated license(s). The license requires that in order to access the email or the attachment, either the Special Projects Team Group Node or the \u201cAttorneys\u201d Group Node must be reachable.","The license(s) are bundled with the encrypted message payload and encrypted attachment. The message is subsequently sent to a list of recipients using standard email functionality.

The reporting step can additionally include an indicator as to whether or not access was granted or denied\u2014this is a matter of implementation choice. If such an indicator is used, a log can be maintained of the number of attempts to access a particular document, and status or other information on each (e.g., success, failure, etc.).","As yet another example, assume that one of the members (\u201cStephen\u201d) of the Special Projects Team travels to another company to perform work on the special project. Before leaving for the other company, Stephen's email client downloads a local copy of all the email in is Inbox.

If he attempts to access the file while offline, the Special Projects Team Group Node will still be reachable, and he will be permitted to access the file.","If, however, Stephen stays offline for more than three days, the Link Object linking him to the Special Projects Team will expire.

Since he is still part of the \u201cSpecial Projects Team\u201d group, he will receive a new link object from his User Node to the Special Projects Team Group Node. This link replaces the \u2018old\u2019 link which has expired and is no longer valid.","Since the \u201cSpecial Projects Team\u201d Node is now reachable using this new, refreshed Link, he is once again able to access the protected report. The new link object will be valid for a period of 3 days, after which it will also expire.","As yet another example, assume that a member (\u201cSally\u201d) of the Special Projects Team wishes to communicate with another team member via an instant messenger, save a copy of the communication, and give it to another member of the team (e.g., via an email attachment, a diskette, a dongle, or the like). In this example, the instant messenger client (and, potentially any other messaging or communication products which the company offers its employees) is linked to a DRM plugin which, as in the previous examples, accesses the Policy \u201cSpecial Project DRM Template\u201d that dictates how licenses are to be targeted and bound. When Sally attempts to save her instant messaging conversation (e.g., by selecting \u201cSave-As\u201d), the plug-in chooses an encryption key (e.g., randomly) and packages (encrypts) the text of the conversation. Per company policy, the DRM plugin then generates a license object that is targeted and bound to the Special Projects Team Group Node.","The file containing the protected IM transcript is bundled with the license to access the transcript contents.

Per the company's policy, this Link Object contains an expiration date that will cause it to expire in three days. Therefore, even if John remains disconnected, he will still have access as long as that link remains valid.","If, at some later time, John leaves the Special Projects Team for another job assignment, and finds the USB dongle from Sally in his bag and attempts to open the file using his desktop computer, the Link Object associating his User Node to the Special Projects Team will have expired.

In some embodiments, each time he attempts to access the file, a report can be generated and queued to be sent to a central repository.","The central repository receives multiple reports of unsuccessful attempts to access the file and flags a manager via email. The manager reminds John that he is no longer permitted to access the confidential material and asks for all files to be destroyed (even though the system indicates that access has not been granted).","As yet another example, assume that a governmental agency or outside auditor wishes to investigate or audit the Special Projects Team's handling of confidential information. To support the investigation, the company wishes to demonstrate audit records for access to sensitive information related to the Special Project.","To this end, the company first scans all cleartext message archives for any messages related to the Special Project. To their relief, they discover that, in adherence to company policy, no employees sent messages discussing the Special Project without appropriate DRM protection (e.g. outside of the system).","The company then uses the DRM access records to produce an audit trail detailing who was given access to protected information, and when.","Per company procedure, when the Special Projects Team Group was established, it also included the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) by default. A Link Object for Chief Compliance Officer was created and saved to the archive server, which allows him or her to review the contents of all messages if needed in the future.","In this example, the policy defined for the Special Projects Team indicated that all Licenses generated by the team must include the requirement to report any attempted access to the file, including the date and time, UserNode, and whether or not access was granted. These reports were saved in an access log on a central repository.","The CCO checks the access logs for all accesses associated with the Special Projects Team prior to the date when any leak or other irregularity was suspected to have occurred. The CCO also searches the email, IM, and network backup archives for all message traffic and system files on or before that date. Since each file has an attached license (with content key), and the CCO has the necessary Link Objects to satisfy the requirements of the License, he or she is permitted to access the contents of each and every message that was accessed prior to the time in question.","The access logs and unencrypted message contents are made fully available to the agency\/auditor as part of the investigation.","In some embodiments the policy for the Special Projects Team could also have included the requirement to set an expiration date for the all licenses related to the Special Project. For example, if the company were only statutorily required to keep records of this nature for a period of 1 year, they could indicate in the policy that Licenses expire one year following date of issue. In that case, the company might only keep records as long as legally required to do so. Even the CCO would not have access after that time.","In the foregoing discussion, reference has occasionally been made to \u201ctargeting\u201d and \u201cbinding\u201d. In preferred embodiments, targeting and binding represent two different, yet closely related processes. In preferred embodiments, \u201cbinding\u201d is primarily a cryptographic process, concerned with protecting the key that was used to encrypt the content. When a License is \u2018bound\u2019 to a Node (for example the \u201cSpecial Projects Team\u201d Node), it can mean, e.g., that the content key is encrypted with the public key associated with that Node. Thus, only devices that have access to the private key of the Node will have the necessary key to decrypt the content (and in preferred embodiments, the only way to get access to the private key of a Node is to decrypt a chain of Links to that Node); however, simply having the correct private key only indicates that the device has the capability to decrypt the content, if it is also permitted to do so.","In preferred embodiments, whether or not a device is permitted to access the content is determined by a Control Program within the License, and specifically, how it is \u201ctargeted\u201d. \u201cTargeting\u201d refers to adding a requirement in the Control Program to specify that a particular node (or nodes) \u201care reachable\u201d to perform a use of the content. In the examples shown above, the Control Program typically specifies that a particular Node \u201cSpecial Projects Team\u201d is reachable by the consuming device.","In some instances, it may be desirable to have licenses targeted to more than one Node, such as a new product development team at a company (\u201cCompany\u201d) that is working with multiple suppliers to bid on components for a new top secret product. Assume that during the early stages of the project, Supplier A and Supplier B (competitors) both have links to \u201cSecretProjectX\u201d. Supplier A wants its ideas to be shared with all members of SecretProjectX, but does not want them to inadvertently leak to Supplier B. Supplier A can target these licenses such that: (\u201cSecretProjectX is reachable\u201d) AND (\u201cSupplier A is reachable\u201d or \u201cCompany is reachable\u201d). If Company inadvertently shares this information to everyone in Secret Project X (including Supplier B), those at supplier B will not be permitted to look at it, limiting any non-disclosure risk to Company and eliminating the prospect of Supplier A losing its trade-secrets.","1.14.

If patient Y subsequently visits another healthcare provider, and authorizes that healthcare provider as one of his approved healthcare providers (e.g., by signing an authorization form), that healthcare provider will obtain a link to the patient y approved healthcare providers node, which the healthcare provider would store on his computer system. If that healthcare provider were to then obtain the medical record created by doctor x, he would be able to gain viewing access to that medical record, since patient y's approved healthcare provider node would be reachable from the new healthcare provider's computer system. If on the other hand, an unapproved healthcare provider were to obtain a copy of the (encrypted) medical record, he would be unable to access it since none of the required nodes (i.e., patient y's node, the node for all of patient y's approved healthcare providers, and the node for all of patient y's approved insurance companies) would be reachable from his computing system.","Note, however, that the example control program shown above includes an override feature that can be invoked, e.g., in emergencies if, for example, a healthcare provider needs to access the protected medical record, but is unable to satisfy the conditions of the control program (e.g., because the healthcare provider attempting to make emergency access to the medical record has not previously been registered as a healthcare provider of patient Y). Note also, however, that invocation of the emergency access exception will cause information to be automatically recorded regarding the invocation and\/or other circumstances, and, in this example, will also cause a notification to be sent (e.g., to the patient's preferred healthcare provider\u2014i.e., an entity explicitly authorized by the patient\u2014and\/or the patient himself). The association of such obligations with the emergency exception may discourage abuse of the exception, since a record of the abuse would exist.","It will be appreciated that this example program has been provided to facilitate explanation of certain embodiments of the systems and methods described herein. For example, whether a system includes support for emergency exceptions will typically depend on the requirements and desires of the system architect. Thus, for example, some embodiments may not support emergency exceptions, others may support emergency exceptions, but limit the class of entities who can invoke such exceptions to the class of \u201call doctors\u201d (e.g., by requiring that the EmergencyException flag be set to \u201ctrue\u201d AND the All Doctors node be reachable), and others still may support emergency exceptions, but not associate mandatory obligations therewith (since inability to comply with the obligation would, in a preferred embodiment, render the content inaccessible), relying instead on non-technical, legal or institutional means for enforcement (e.g., by trusting healthcare providers not to abuse the ability to invoke the exception, and\/or relying on industry certification and the legal system to prevent abuse).","Yet another variation that could be made to the examples provided above might be to require stronger proof that a doctor, or a specifically named doctor, was actually the one accessing a medical record, as opposed to someone else sitting at the computer that the doctor uses to access records (and thus a computer potentially containing the links necessary to satisfy a reachability analysis). Such a stronger form of authentication could be enforced in any suitable manner. For example, it could be wholly or partially enforced at the application or system level by protecting the doctor's computer and\/or the software used to access medical records using passwords, dongles, biometric identification mechanisms, and\/or the like. Alternatively, or in addition, the control programs associated with certain medical records could themselves include an obligation or condition require such stronger identification, such as checking for the presence of a dongle, requiring the host to obtain a password, and\/or the like.","1.15. Example: Subscriptions",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0251","num":"0281"},"figref":"FIG. 24","b":["2400","2401","2406","2401","2400","2402","2404","2401"]},"When Alice downloads a piece of content to her PC and attempts to play it, the DRM engine on her PC evaluates the license associated with the content, which indicates that subscription node  must be reachable in order to play the content. Alice had previously registered her PC with her ISP, at which time she received a link  from her PC node  to her account node . The DRM engine thus possess link objects ,  connecting PC node  to subscription node ; however, before granting Alice's request to play the content, the DRM engine first determines whether the links are valid by executing any control programs that the links contain. When the control program in link  is executed, the DRM engine checks the state database entry to determine if 5 plays have already been made, and, if they have not, grants her request to play the content, but also issues an obligation to the host application. The obligation requires the host to degrade the content before rendering. The host application determines that it is able to fulfill this obligation, and proceeds to render the content. In order to enable Alice to preview content before counting that content against her five free trial-offer plays, the control program might also include a callback that checks, e.g., 20 seconds after a request to play a piece of content has been granted, to see if the content is still being played. If the content is still being played, the play count is decremented, otherwise it is not. Thus, Alice can select from any of the content items offered by the subscription service, and play any five of them before her trial subscription expires.","Once Alice's trial subscription expires, Alice decides to purchase a full, monthly subscription which enables her to play as many content items as she wishes for a monthly fee. Alice use's her PC to sign up for the subscription, and receives a link  from her account node  to the subscription node . The link includes a control program indicating that the link is only valid for one month (e.g., the control program checks an entry in the state database to see if one month has elapsed since the link was issued). This link  is sent to Alice's PC, along with an agent program that is operable to initialize an appropriate entry in the state database of the PC's DRM engine indicating the date on which the link was issued. When Alice downloads a piece of content from the subscription service and attempts to play it, her PC's DRM engine determines that a path to the subscription node exists comprised of links , . The DRM engine executes any control programs contained in links ,  to determine if the links are valid. If less than a month has elapsed since link  was issued, the control program in link  will return a result indicating that link  is still valid, and Alice's request to play the piece of content. If Alice attempts to play a piece of content she previously obtained during her free trial period, the DRM engine on her PC will perform the same analysis and grant her request. Since the license associated with the piece of content obtained during the trial period indicates that if the TrialState variable in the secure database is not set, the only condition is that the subscription node must be reachable, Alice can now access that content once again since the subscription node is once again reachable from Alice's PC, this time via link , not link , which is no longer valid. Thus, Alice does not need to obtain a second copy of the content item to replace the copy she obtained during the free trial offer. Similarly, if Alice obtains a piece of subscription content from her friend, Bob, who is also a subscriber to the same service, Alice will, in this example, be able to play that content, too, since the content's license simply requires that the subscription node be reachable, not that it be reachable via Bob's PC or account.","It will be appreciated that the above examples are simply intended to illustrate some of the functionality that can be enabled by the systems and methods described herein, and is not intended to suggest that subscriptions must be implemented in precisely the manner described above. For example, in other embodiments, the license associated with a piece of subscription content might be bound to a user's node, rather than the subscription node, thus preventing two subscribers from sharing content like Bob and Alice were able to do in the example described above. It will be appreciated that many other variations to the above examples could be made.","The table below provides some illustrative pseudo-code for the agent, link, and license control programs in the example described above:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0256","num":"0286"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"================================"},{"entry":"The subscription trial gives you access to up to 5 pieces of"},{"entry":"subscription content.

Additional Examples: Content and Rights Sharing","As the preceding examples illustrate, embodiments of the systems and methods presented herein enable electronic content to be shared in natural ways. For example, the systems and methods described herein can be used to enable consumers to share entertainment content with their friends and family members, and\/or enjoy it on all of their family's devices, while simultaneously protecting against wider, unauthorized distribution. For example, automated peer-to-peer discovery and notification services can be used, such that when one device obtains content or associated rights, other devices can automatically become aware of that content, thereby providing a virtual distributed library that can be automatically updated. For example, in one embodiment if one user obtains content or rights on a portable device at one location, then comes home, the user's family's devices can automatically discover and make use of those rights. Conversely, if a user obtains rights on a device on his or her home network, his or her portable devices can discover and carry away that content for use elsewhere. Preferred embodiments of the systems and methods described herein can be used to create services and rights objects that allow the above-described scenarios to be completely automated, using, for example, the service discovery and inspection techniques described in the '551 application. For example, the devices registered to a particular domain may provide services to each other (e.g., sharing of rights and content), and\/or remote services can be invoked to facilitate local sharing of content. The systems and methods described enable the creation of DRM frameworks that are not focused on preventing the creation of copies per se, but rather are designed to work harmoniously with network technology to allow content to be shared, while protecting against consumers becoming illicit distributors of the content.","Preferred embodiments of the DRM systems and methods described herein also enable the determination of rights without the verbose types of rights expressions characteristic of some other DRM systems. Instead, preferred embodiments use a set of crafted rights objects that can interact contextually. These objects describe relationships and controls among entities such as users, devices, content, and groups thereof. For example, such contextual interactions might allow a device to determine that a given piece of content can be played because (a) the content was obtained from a legitimate content service that the user currently subscribes to, (b) the user is part of a specific family group, and (c) the device is associated with this specific family group. There are numerous types of relationships such as those described in this example, which users understand intuitively, and preferred embodiments of the systems and methods described herein enable the creation of systems that naturally understand these kinds of relationships. The relationships among entities can be created, destroyed, and changed over time, and preferred embodiments provide a natural way of determining rights in a dynamic networked environment\u2014an environment that consumers can naturally understand. Nevertheless, if a content deployer wants to use a more traditional rights expression approach, preferred embodiments can accommodate that as well. For example, tools can be used to translate traditional rights expressions into sets of objects such as those described above, and\/or a DRM engine can be implemented that operates directly on such rights expressions. Alternatively, in some embodiments, devices do not need to understand such traditional rights expressions, and are not constrained by their limitations.","Preferred embodiments of the systems and methods described herein also have a very general notion of a media service. A broadcast service and an Internet download or subscription service are examples of media services. Restrictions associated with these services can make content difficult to share. With preferred embodiments of the systems and methods described herein, content can be obtained on broadcast, broadband, and mobile services, and shared on a group of networked devices in the home, including portable devices. Alternatively, or in addition, services can be offered by individual devices in a peer-to-peer fashion via wireless connectivity. For example, the new generation of WiFi enabled cellphones can provide content catalog services to other devices. Such a service allows other devices to \u201csee\u201d what content is available to be shared from the device. The service provides information that can be used to determine the rights so that any limitations can be accepted or easily eliminated.","Preferred embodiments of the systems and methods described herein are not confined to one service or to one platform. As explained above, preferred embodiments are capable of working with numerous services, including \u201cpersonal\u201d services. This is becoming more and more important as home and personal networks become more ubiquitous. For example, digital cameras are now available with WiFi connectivity, making it very convenient to share photos over networks. It is nice to be able to automate the sharing of photographs, but the camera will encounter many different networks as it is carried about. Automated sharing is convenient, but personal photos are, of course, personal. Embodiments of the systems and methods described herein make it easy to share photos within a family on the family's devices, but not with arbitrary devices that happen to encounter the camera on a network. In general, as more devices become networked, it is going to be increasingly important to manage the rights of all content on those devices. Although the purpose of networking is to allow information on the networked devices to be shared, networks will overlap and merge into one another. Networks enable content to be shared easily but it should not be shared arbitrarily. Thus, it is desirable to have a DRM system that is network-aware and that can use the context provided by the content, the user, the network, and characteristics of devices to determine if and how content should be shared. Preferred embodiments of systems and methods described herein enable such an approach.","6.

In one embodiment, trusted systems will only make use of the content decryption key under governance of the rules expressed by the byte code in control object .  is a more detailed illustration of a license such as that shown in , and illustrates a signature scheme that is used in one embodiment.","1.19.1. Common Elements","In one embodiment, objects share common basic traits: they can each have an ID, a list of attributes, and a list of extensions.","1.19.1.1. IDs","Objects that are referenced by other objects have a unique ID. In one embodiment, IDs are simply URIs, and the convention is that those URIs are URNs","1.19.1.2. Attributes","Attributes are typed values. Attributes can be named or unnamed. The name of a named attribute is a simple string or URI. The value of an attribute is of a simple type (string, integer, or byte array) or a compound type (list and array). Attributes of type \u2018list\u2019 contain an unordered list of named attributes. Attributes of type \u2018array\u2019 contain an ordered array of unnamed attributes.","An object's \u2018attributes\u2019 field is a (possibly empty) unordered collection of named attributes.","1.19.1.3. Extensions","Extensions are elements that can be added to objects to carry optional or mandatory extra data. Extensions are typed, and have unique IDs as well. Extensions can be internal or external.","1.19.1.3.1. Internal extensions","Internal extensions are contained in the object they extend. They have a \u2018critical\u2019 flag that indicates whether the specific extension data type for the extension is required to be known to the implementation that uses the object. In one embodiment, if an implementation encounters an object with a critical extension with a data type that it does not understand, it must reject the entire object.","In one embodiment, the ID of an internal extension needs to be locally unique: an object cannot contain two extensions with the same ID, but it is possible that two different objects each contain an extension with the same ID as that of an extension of the other object.","An object's \u2018extensions\u2019 field is a (possibly empty) unordered collection of internal extensions.","1.19.1.3.2. External Extensions","External extensions are not contained in the object they extend. They appear independently of the object, and have a \u2018subject\u2019 field that contains the ID of the object they extend. In one embodiment, the ID of an external extension needs to be globally unique.","1.19.2. Content","In one embodiment, the content object is an \u201cexternal\u201d object. Its format and storage are not under the control of the DRM engine, but under the content management subsystem of the host application (for instance, the content could be an MP4 movie file, an MP3 music track, etc.). In one embodiment, the format for the content needs to provide support for associating an ID with the content payload data. The content payload is encrypted in a format-dependent manner (typically with a symmetric cipher, such as AES).","1.19.3. ContentKey","The ContentKey object represents a unique encryption key, and associates an ID with it. The purpose of the ID is to enable Protector objects and Controller objects to make references to ContentKey objects. The actual key data encapsulated in the ContentKey object is itself encrypted so that it can only be read by the recipients that are authorized to decrypt the content. The ContentKey object specifies which cryptosystem was used to encrypt the key data. The cryptosystem used to protect the content key data is called the Key Distribution System. Different Key Distribution Systems can be used. An example of a Key Distribution System is the Scuba Key Distribution System described above.","1.19.4. Protector","The Protector object contains the information that makes it possible to find out which key was used to encrypt the data of Content objects. It also contains information about which encryption algorithm was used to encrypt that data. In one embodiment, the Protector object contains one or more IDs that are references to Content objects, and exactly one ID that is a reference to the ContentKey object that represents the key that was used to encrypt the data. If the Protector points to more than one Content object, all those Content objects represent data that has been encrypted using the same encryption algorithm and the same key. In one embodiment, unless the cryptosystem used allows a safe way of using the same key for different data items, it is not recommended that a Protector object point to more than one Content object.","1.19.5. Control","The control object contains the information that allows the DRM engine to make decisions regarding whether certain actions on the content should be permitted when requested by the host application. In one embodiment, the rules that govern the use of content keys are encoded in the control object as byte code for execution by the virtual machine. The control object also has a unique ID so that it can be referenced by a controller object. In one embodiment, control objects are signed, so that the DRM engine can verify that the control byte code is valid and trusted before it is used to make decisions. The validity of the control object can also optionally be derived through the verification of a secure hash contained in a controller object.","1.19.6. Controller","The controller object contains the information that allows the DRM engine to find out which control governs the use of one or more keys represented by ContentKey objects. The controller object contains information that binds it to the ContentKey objects and the control object that it references. In one embodiment, controller objects are signed (e.g., by a packager application that has a certificate allowing it to sign controller objects), so that the validity of the binding between the ContentKey and the control object that governs it, as well as the validity of the binding between the ContentKey ID and the actual key data, can be established. The signature of the controller object can be a public key signature or a symmetric key signature, or a combination of both. Also, when the digest of the control object referenced by the controller object is included in the controller object, the validity of the control object can he derived without having to separately verify the signature of the control object.","1.19.6.1. Symmetric Key Signature","In one embodiment, this is the preferred type of signature for controller objects, and is implemented by computing a Message Authentication Code (MAC) of the controller object, keyed with the same key as the key represented by the corresponding ContentKey object. In one embodiment, the canonical method for this MAC is to use HMAC with the same hashing algorithm as the one chosen for the PKI signature algorithm used in the same deployment.","1.19.6.2. Public Key Signature","This type of signature is used when the identity of the signer of the controller object needs to be known. This type of signature is implemented with a public key signature algorithm, signing with the private key of the principal who is asserting the validity of this object. In one embodiment, when using this type of signature, a symmetric key signature will also be present, and sign both the controller object as well as the public key signature, so that is can be guaranteed that the principal who signed with its private key also had knowledge of the actual value of the content key carried in the ContentKey object.","1.20. Identity and Key Management DRM Objects","As previously described, node objects represent entities in a DRM profile, and no implicit or explicit semantics are used to define what the node objects represent. A given deployment (DRM profile) of a system will define what types of principals exist, and what roles and identities different node objects represent. That semantic information is typically expressed using attributes of the node object.","Link objects represent relationships between nodes. Link objects can also optionally contain some cryptographic data that allows the link to be used for content key derivation. Just as for nodes, in one embodiment no implicit or explicit semantics are used to define what a link relationship means. Depending on what the from and to nodes of the link represent in a given DRM Profile, the meaning of the link relationship can express membership, ownership, association, and\/or many other types of relationships. In a typical DRM profile, some node objects could represent users, other nodes could represent devices, and other nodes could represent user groups or authorized domains (ADs). In such a context, links between devices and users might represent an ownership relationship, and links between users and user groups or authorization domains might represent membership relationships.  illustrates the structure and interrelationship between nodes and links in one example embodiment.","1.20.1. Node","The node object represents an entity in the system. The node object's attributes define certain aspects of what the node object represents, such as the role or identity represented by the node object in the context of a DRM profile. The node object may also have a confidentiality asymmetric key pair that is used for targeting confidential information to the subsystems that have access to the confidential parts of the node object (typically, the entity represented by the node, or some entity that is responsible for managing that node). Confidential information targeted at a node can be encrypted with that node's confidentiality public key. The node object may also have a sharing asymmetric key pair and a sharing symmetric key can be used in conjunction with link objects when the system uses a ContentKey derivation system for ContentKey distribution, such as that described elsewhere herein. In a preferred embodiment, only entities that need to be referenced by link or control objects, or to receive cryptographically targeted information, need to have corresponding node objects.","1.20.2. Link","The link object is a signed assertion that there exists a directed edge in the graph whose vertices are the node objects. For a given set of nodes and links, we say that there is a path between a node X and a node Y if there exists a directed path between the node X vertex and the node Y vertex in the graph. When there is a path between node X and node Y, we say that node Y is reachable from node X. The assertions represented by link objects are used to express which nodes are reachable from other nodes. The controls that govern content objects can check, before they allow an action to be performed, that certain nodes are reachable from the node associated with the entity performing the action. For example, if node D represents a device that wants to perform the \u201cplay\u201d action on a content object, a control that governs the content object can test if a certain node, U, representing a certain user, is reachable from node D. To determine if node U is reachable, the DRM engine can check whether there is a set of link objects that can establish a path between node D and node U.","In one embodiment, the DRM engine verifies link objects before it uses them to decide the existence of paths in the node graph. Depending on the specific features of the certificate system (e.g., x509v3) used to sign link objects, link objects can be given limited lifetimes, be revoked, etc. In one embodiment, the policies that govern which keys can sign link objects, which link objects can be created, and the lifetime of link objects are not directly handled by the DRM engine. Instead, those policies leverage the node's attribute information. To facilitate the task of enforcing certain policies, in one embodiment, a way to extend standard certificate formats with additional constraint checking is provided. These extensions make it possible to express validity constraints on certificates for keys that sign links, such that constraints such as what type of nodes the link is connecting, as well as other attributes, can be checked before a link is considered valid.","In one embodiment, a link object can contain a control object that will be used to constrain the validity of the link. In addition, in one embodiment a link object may contain cryptographic key derivation data that provides the user with sharing keys for key distribution. That cryptographic data will contain, in addition to metadata, the private and\/or symmetric sharing keys of the \u201cfrom\u201d node, encrypted with the sharing public key and\/or the sharing symmetric key of the \u201cto\u201d node.","1.21. Data Structures","The following paragraphs describe, in more detail, an illustrative object model for the objects discussed above, defining the fields that each type of object has in one illustrative embodiment. Data structures are described using a relatively simple object description syntax. Each object type is defined by a class that can extend a parent class (this is an \u201cis-a\u201d relationship). The class descriptions are in terms of the simple abstract types \u201cstring\u201d (character strings), \u201cint\u201d (integer value), \u201cbyte\u201d (8-bit value), and \u201cboolean\u201d (true or false) but do not define any specific encoding for those data types, or for compound structures containing those types. The way objects are encoded, or represented, can vary depending on the implementation of the engine. In practice, a given profile of use of the DRM engine can specify how the fields are represented (e.g., using an XML schema).","In one illustrative embodiment, the following notations are used:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0391","num":"0421"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["class ClassName {","Defines a class type.

It is based on a simple, stack-oriented instruction set that is designed to be minimalist, without undue concern for execution speed or code density. In situations where compact code is required, data compression techniques can be used to compress the virtual machine's byte code.","In preferred embodiments, the control virtual machine is designed to be suitable as a target for low or high level programming languages, and supports assembler, C, and FORTH. In addition, it will be appreciated that compilers for other languages, such as Java or custom languages, can be created in a relatively straightforward fashion to compile code into the format (e.g., byte code) used by the virtual machine. In one embodiment the control virtual machine is designed to be hosted within a host environment, not run directly on a processor or in silicon. In preferred embodiments, the natural host environment for the virtual machine is the DRM engine, although it will be appreciated that the virtual machine architecture described herein could alternatively, or in addition, be used in other contexts.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0418","num":"0448"},"figref":["FIG. 29","FIG. 29","FIG. 29"],"b":["2902","2902","2904","2906","2908","2902","2908","2910"]},"1.22. Architecture","1.22.1. Execution Model","In preferred embodiments, the VM runs programs by executing instructions stored in byte code in code modules. Some of these instructions can call functions implemented outside of the program itself by making system calls. System calls can be implemented by the VM itself or delegated to the host environment.","In one embodiment, the VM executes instructions stored in code modules as a stream of byte codes loaded into memory. The VM maintains a virtual register called the Program Counter (PC), which is incremented as instructions are executed. The VM executes each instruction, in sequence, until an OP_STOP instruction is encountered, an OP_RET instruction is encountered with an empty call stack, or a runtime exception occurs. Jumps are specified either as a relative jump (specified as a byte offset from the current value of PC), or as an absolute address.","1.22.2. Memory Model","In one embodiment, the VM uses a relatively simple memory model, in which memory is separated into data memory and code memory. For example, data memory can be implemented as a single, flat, contiguous memory space, starting at address 0, and can be implemented as an array of bytes allocated within the heap memory of the host application or host environment. In one embodiment, attempts to access memory outside of the allocated space will cause a runtime exception which will cause program execution to terminate.","Data memory is potentially shared between several code modules concurrently loaded by the virtual machine. The data in the data memory can be accessed by memory-access instructions, which, in one embodiment, can be either 32-bit or 8-bit accesses. 32-bit memory accesses are performed using big-endian byte order. In a preferred embodiment, no assumptions are made with regards to alignment between the virtual machine-visible memory and the host-managed memory (i.e., the host CPU virtual or physical memory).","In one embodiment, code memory is a flat, contiguous memory space, starting at address 0, and can be implemented as an array of bytes allocated within the heap memory of the host application or host environment.","The VM may support loading more than one code module. If the VM loads several code modules, in one embodiment all the code modules share the same data memory (although each module's data is preferably loaded at a different address), but each has its own code memory, thus preventing a jump instruction in one code module to cause a jump to code in another code module.","1.22.3. Data Stack","In one embodiment, the VM has the notion of a data stack, which represents 32-bit data cells stored in the data memory. The VM maintains a virtual register called the Stack Pointer (SP). After reset, the SP points to the end of the data memory, and the stack grows downward (when data is pushed on the data stack, the SP register is decremented). The 32-bit data cells on the stack are interpreted either as 32-bit addresses or 32-bit integers, depending on the instruction referencing the stack data. Addresses are unsigned integers. In one embodiment, all other 32-bit integer values on the data stack are interpreted as signed integers unless otherwise specified.","1.22.4. Call Stack","In one embodiment, the VM manages a call stack used for making subroutine calls. In one embodiment, the values pushed on this stack cannot be read or written directly by the memory-access instructions. This stack is used internally by the VM when executing OP_JSR, OP_JSRR, and OP_RET instructions. For a given VM implementation, the size of this return address stack can be fixed to a maximum, which will allow only a certain number of nested calls.","1.22.5. Pseudo Registers","In one embodiment, the VM reserves a small address space at the beginning of data memory to map pseudo-registers. In one embodiment, the addresses of these pseudo-registers are fixed.

Executing Routines","Before executing a code routine, in one embodiment the virtual machine implementation resets the data stack pointer to point to the top of the initialized data stack. The initialized data stack contains the routine's input data, and extends to the end of the data memory. The initialized data stack may be used as a way to pass input arguments to a routine. When there is no initialized data stack, the data stack pointer points to the end of the data memory. In one embodiment, the initial call stack is either empty or contains a single terminal return address pointing to an OP_STOP instruction, which will force execution of the routine to end on an OP_STOP instruction in case the routine finished with an OP_RET instruction.","When execution stops, either because a final OP_RET instruction with an empty call stack has been executed or a final OP_STOP instruction has been executed, any data left on the data stack is considered to be the output of the routine.","1.22.8.

Operands are read from the data stack, and results pushed on the data stack. In one embodiment, the VM is a 32-bit VM: all the instructions operate on 32-bit stack operands, representing either memory addresses or signed integers.

Depending on the System Call, the implementation can be a byte code routine in a different code module (for instance, a library of utility functions), executed directly by the VM in the VM's native implementation format, or delegated to an external software module, such as the VM's host environment.","In one embodiment, if an OP_CALL instruction is executed with an operand that contains a number that does not correspond to any System Call, the VM behaves as if the SYS_NOP system call was called.","1.25.1. System Call Numbers Allocation","In the illustrative embodiment under discussion, System Call Numbers 0 to 1023 are reserved for fixed System Calls (these System Calls will have the same number on all VM implementations).

A call to this function causes the string of text to be printed to a debug output, which can be useful in debugging.

The call takes as its input (from the top of the stack) the address of a null-terminated ASCII string containing the name of the system call for which to look, and returns (to the top of the stack) the system call number if a system call with the specified name is implemented, an ERROR_NO_SUCH_ITEM if the system call is not implemented, and a negative error code if an error occurs.","System.Host.GetLocalTime.","This call takes no inputs, and returns, to the top of the stack, the current value of the local time of the host, which, in one embodiment, is expressed as a 32-bit signed integer equal to the number of minutes elapsed since Jan. 1, 1970 00:00:00, or a negative error code.","System.Host.GetLocalTimeOffset.","This call takes no inputs, and returns, to the top of the stack, the current time offset (from UTC time) of the host, which, in one embodiment, is expressed as a 32-bit signed integer number equal to the number of minutes difference between local time and UTC time (i.e. LocalTime-UTC).","System.Host.GetTrustedTime.","This call takes no inputs, and returns, to the top of the stack, the trusted time and the value of one or more flags.

Assembler Syntax","This section describes an example syntax for use in compiling programs into the bytecode format described elsewhere herein. It should be appreciated that this is just one example of one possible syntax, and that any suitable syntax could be used. As previously indicated, it should also be understood that the bytecode format presented herein is also just an example, and the systems and methods described herein could be used with any other suitable byte code format or other code format.","An assembler reads source files containing code, data, and processing instructions, and produces binary code modules that can be loaded by a control virtual machine. In one illustrative embodiment, the assembler processes a source file sequentially, line by line. Lines can be zero or more characters, followed by a newline. Each line can be one of: an empty line (whitespace only), a segment directive, a data directive, an assembler directive, a code instruction, a label, or an export directive. In addition, each line can end with a comment, which starts with a \u2018;\u2019 character and continues until the end of the line.","Data and instructions read from the source files have an implicit destination segment (i.e., where they end up when loaded by the VM). At any point during the parsing process, the assembler will have a \u201ccurrent\u201d segment which is the implicit destination segment for data and instructions. The current segment can be changed using segment directives.","1.26.1. Segment Directives","Segment directives change the current segment of the parser. In one embodiment, the supported segment directives are .code and .data. The .code segment holds the byte code instructions, and the .data segment holds global variables.","1.26.2. Data Directives","Data directives specify data (e.g., integers and strings) that will be loaded in the virtual machine's data segment. In one embodiment, the supported data directives are:\n\n","1.26.3. Assembler Directives","In one embodiment, the supported assembler directives are .equ <symbol>, <value>, which sets the symbol <symbol> to be equal to the value <value>. Symbols are typically used as operands or code instructions.","1.26.4. Labels","Labels are symbols that point to locations within segments. Labels pointing to instructions in the code segment are typically used for jump\/branch instructions. Labels pointing to data in the data segment are typically used to refer to variables. In one embodiment, the syntax for a label is: <LABEL>:","Note that there is nothing after the \u201c:\u201d, except an optional comment. A label points to the location of the next data or instruction. In one embodiment, it is ok to have more than one label pointing to the same address.","1.26.5. Export Directives","Export directives are used to create entries in the \u201cexport\u201d section of the code module produced by the assembler. Each entry in the export section is a (name, address) pair. In the illustrative embodiment under discussion, only addresses within the code segment can be specified in the export section.","The syntax of the export directive is: .export <label>, which will export the address pointed to by <label>, with the name \u201c<label>\u201d.","1.26.6. Code Instructions","When compiling data destined for the code segment, the assembler reads instructions that map directly, or indirectly, into byte codes. In the example instruction set shown above, most virtual machine byte codes have no direct operands, and appear with a simple mnemonic on a single line. To make the assembler syntax more readable, some instructions accept pseudo-operands, which look as if they were byte code operands, but are not really; in this case, the assembler generates one or more byte code instructions to produce the same effect as if the instruction did have a direct operand. For example, the branch instructions use pseudo-operands.","1.26.6.1. Branch Operands","Branch instructions can be specified verbatim (without any operand), or with an optional operand that will be converted by the assembler into a corresponding byte code sequence. The optional operand is an integer constant or a symbol. When the operand is a symbol, the assembler computes the correct integer relative offset so that the branch ends up at the address corresponding to the symbol.","1.26.6.2. Push Operands","In one embodiment, the PUSH instruction always takes one operand. The operand can be one of an integer constant, a symbol, or the prefix \u201c@\u201d directly followed by a label name. When the operand is a symbol, the value that is pushed is the direct value of that symbol, whether the symbol is a label or an .equ symbol (the value is not incremented by a segment offset). When the operand is a label name prefixed with \u201c@\u201d, the value pushed depends on what the label points to. The value pushed on the stack is the absolute address represented by the label (i.e., the local label value added to the segment offset).","1.26.7.

Controls","This section describes illustrative embodiments of control objects. Control objects can be used to represent rules that govern access to content by granting or denying the use of the ContentKey objects they control. They can also be used to represent constraints on the validity of a link object in which they are embedded. They can also be used as standalone program containers that are run on behalf of another entity, such as in agents or delegates. In one embodiment, controls contain metadata and byte-code programs, which implement a specific interaction protocol. The purpose of a Control Protocol is to specify the interaction between the DRM engine and a control program or between a host application and a control program through the DRM engine. This section also describes illustrative actions the application can perform on the content, which action parameters should be supplied to the control program, and how the control program encodes the return status indicating that the requested action can or cannot be performed, as well as parameters that can further describe the return status.","In this section, the following abbreviations and acronyms are used:\n\n","1.27. Control Programs","In one embodiment, a control object contains a control program. The control program includes a code module containing byte-code that is executable by a virtual machine, and a list of named routines (e.g., entries in the export table).","In one embodiment, the set of routines that represent the rules that govern the performance of a certain operation (such as \u201cplay\u201d) on a content item is called an \u2018action control\u2019. The set of routines that represent validity constraints on a link object is called a \u201clink constraint\u201d. The set of routines that are intended to be executed on behalf of a remote entity (such as during a protocol session with a DRM engine running on a different host) is called an \u201cagent\u201d. The set of routines that are intended to be executed on behalf of another control (such as when a control program uses the System.Host.CallVm system call) is called a \u201cdelegate\u201d.","1.27.1. Interface to Control Programs","In one embodiment, control programs are executed by a virtual machine running in a host environment. The host environment can be implemented in any suitable manner; however, for ease of explanation and for purposes of illustration, it will be assumed in the following discussion that the implementation of the virtual machine's host environment can be logically separated into two parts: a host application, and a DRM engine. It will be appreciated, however, that other embodiments may have a different logical separation of functions, which may be equivalent to the logical structure described above.","As was shown in , in preferred embodiments, the DRM engine  is the logical interface between the host application  and control programs . The host application  makes logical requests to the engine , such as requesting access to a content key for a certain purpose (e.g., to play or render a content stream). In one embodiment, the engine  ensures that the interaction protocol described below is implemented correctly, such as by ensuring that any guarantees regarding a control program's initialization, call sequence, and other interaction details are met.","When the host application  requests the use of content keys for a set of content IDs, the DRM engine  determines which Control object to use. The Protector objects allow the engine to resolve which ContentKey objects need to be accessed for the requested content IDs. The engine then finds the Controller object that references those ContentKey objects. In one embodiment, a Controller object can reference more than one ContentKey object. This allows multiple ContentKey objects to be governed by the same Control object. When the host application requests access to a content key by invoking an action, it can request content IDs as a group, to the extent that the ContentKey objects that correspond to them are referenced by the same Controller object. In one embodiment, a request to access a group of content keys referenced by more than one controller object is not allowed.","In one embodiment, the DRM engine follows a convention for mapping actions to routine names. For example, in one embodiment, for each of the routines described below, the name that appears in the Export Table entry in the code module is the respective string shown below in Sections 9.1.4-9.1.7.","1.27.1.1. Control Loading","In one embodiment, before the engine can make calls to control routines, it needs to load the control's code module into the virtual machine. In one embodiment, only one code module per VM is loaded.","1.27.1.2. Atomicity","In one embodiment, the engine ensures that calls to routines within control programs are atomic with respect to the resources it makes available to the routine, such as the object (or \u201cstate\u201d) database. Thus, in such an embodiment, the engine needs to ensure that those resources remain unmodified during the execution of any of the routines it calls. This may be done by effectively locking those resources during a routine call, or by preventing multiple VMs to run concurrently. However, the engine need not guarantee that those resources are unmodified across successive routine invocations.","1.27.2. Control Protocol","In one embodiment, the routine naming, the input\/output interface, and the data structures for each routine in a code module, together, constitute a Control Protocol. The protocol implemented by a code module is signaled in the Control object's \u201cprotocol\u201d field. The illustrative Control Protocol described below will be called the Standard Control Protocol, and its identifier (the value of the \u2018protocol\u2019 field) is \u201chttp:\/\/www.octopus-drm.com\/specs\/scp-1_0\u201d.","In one embodiment, before the DRM engine loads a code module and calls routines in the control program, it needs to guarantee that the interaction with the control program will be consistent with the specification for the specific protocol id signaled in the protocol field. That includes any guarantee about the features of the virtual machine that need to be implemented, guarantees about the size of the address space available to the control program, and the like.","It is possible for control protocols, such as the Standard Control Protocol, to evolve over time without having to create a new protocol specification. As long as the changes made to the protocol are consistent with previous revisions of the specification, and as long as existing implementations of the DRM engine, as well as existing control programs that comply with that protocol, continue to perform according to the specification, then the changes are deemed compatible. Such changes may include, for instance, new action types.","1.27.3. Byte Code Type","In the illustrative embodiment described above involving the Standard Control Protocol, the type of the byte-code module is \u201cPlankton byte-code module version 1.0\u201d. In this example embodiment, the value for the \u201ctype\u201d field of the Control object is \u201chttp:\/\/www.octopus-drm.com\/specs\/pkcm-1_0\u201d.","1.27.4. General Control Routines","General routines are routines that are applicable to the control as a whole, and are not specific to a given action or link constraint. The following general control routines are used in one illustrative embodiment:","1.27.4.1. Control.Init","This routine is optional (i.e., it is not required in all controls). If this routine is used, the engine calls it once before any other control routine is called. The routine has no inputs, and returns a ResultCode to the top of the stack as an output. The ResultCode is 0 on success, or a negative error code on failure. In one embodiment, if the ResultCode is not 0, the engine aborts the current control operation and does not make any further calls to routines for this control.","1.27.4.2. Control.Describe","This routine is optional. The routine is called when the application requests a description of the meaning of the rules represented by the control program in general (i.e. not for a specific action). The routine has no inputs, and returns a ResultCode and a StatusBlockPointer to the top of the stack as outputs, where the ResultCode is an integer value (0 if the routine completed successfully, or a negative error code otherwise), and where the StatusBlockPointer is the address of a standard ExtendedStatusBlock. The ExtendedStatusBlock contains information that an application can interpret and use to provide information to the user regarding the meaning of the rules represented by the control program.","1.27.4.3. Control.Release","This routine is optional. If this routine exists, the DRM engine calls it once after it no longer needs to call any other routine for the control. No other routine will be called for the control unless a new use of the control is initiated (in which case, the Control.Init routine will be called again). The routine has no inputs, and returns a ResultCode to the top of the stack as an output. The ResultCode is 0 on success, or a negative error code on failure.","1.27.5. Action Routines","Each possible action has a name (e.g., play, transfer, export, etc.). In one illustrative embodiment, for a given action <Action>, the following routine names are defined (where \u201c<Action>\u201d denotes the actual name of the action (e.g., \u201cplay\u201d, \u201ctransfer\u201d, \u201cexport\u201d, etc.)):","1.27.5.1. Control.Actions.<Action>.Init","This routine is optional. If it exists, the engine calls it once before any other routine is called for this action. The routine has no inputs, and returns a ResultCode to the top of the stack as an output. The ResultCode is 0 on success, or a negative error code on failure. In one embodiment, if ResultCode is not 0, the engine aborts the current action and does not make any further calls to routines for this action in this control.","1.27.5.2. Control.Actions.<Action>.Check","In the illustrate embodiment being discussed, this routine is required, and is called to check, without actually performing a given action, what the return status would be if the Perform routine were to be called for that action. It is important for this routine not to have any side effects. Note that if the Perform routine also has no side effects, the Check and Perform entries in the control's Entries Table can point to the same routine. This routine has the same inputs and outputs as the Perform routine described below.","1.27.5.3. Control.Actions.<Action>.Perform","In one embodiment, this routine is required, and is called when the application is about to perform the action. The routine has no inputs, and returns a ResultCode and a StatusBlockPointer to the top of the stack as outputs, where the ResultCode is an integer value (0 if the routine completed successfully, or a negative error code otherwise), and where the StatusBlockPointer is the address of a standard ExtendedStatusBlock. Note that in one embodiment a success ResultCode (i.e., 0) does not mean that the request was granted. It only means that the routine was able to run without error. It is the ExtendedStatusBlock that indicates whether the request was granted or denied. However, if the ResultCode indicates a failure, the host application proceeds as if the request was denied. For example, in one embodiment the StatusBlock's category should be ACTION_DENIED, or the returned ExtendedStatusBlock is rejected, and the host application aborts the action.","When an action is performed, only the Perform routine needs to be called. The engine does not need to call the Check routine beforehand. An implementation of the Perform routine can call the Check routine internally if it chooses to do so, but should not assume that the system will have called the Check routine beforehand.","1.27.5.4. Control.Actions.<Action>.Describe","This routine is optional, and is called when an application requests a description of the meaning of the rules and conditions represented by the control program for the given action. The routine has no inputs, and returns a ResultCode and a StatusBlockPointer to the top of the stack as outputs, where the ResultCode is an integer value (0 if the routine completed successfully, or a negative error code otherwise), and where the StatusBlockPointer is the address of a standard ExtendedStatusBlock.","1.27.5.5. Control.Actions.<Action>.Release","This routine is optional. If it exists, it is called once after the DRM engine no longer needs to call any other routines for the given action. No other routine are called for the given action unless a new use of the action is initiated (in which case, the Init routine will be called again). The routine has no inputs, and returns a ResultCode to the top of the stack as an output. The ResultCode is 0 on success and a negative error code on failure. If the ResultCode is not 0, the engine does not make any further calls to routines for the given action","1.27.6. Link Constraint Routines","In one embodiment, when a link object has an embedded control, the DRM engine calls the link constraint routines in that control to verify the validity of the link object. The following link constraint routines are used in one illustrative embodiment:","1.27.6.1. Control.Link.Constraint.Init","This routine is optional, and, if it exists, is called exactly once before any other routine is called for the given link constraint. The routine has no inputs, and returns a ResultCode to the top of the stack as an output. The ResultCode is 0 on success and a negative error code on failure. If the ResultCode is not 0, the engine deems the validity constraint for the link object to be unsatisfied, and avoids making further calls to routines for the link control.","1.27.6.2. Control.Link.Constraint.Check","In the illustrative embodiment being discussed, this routine is required, and is called to check if the validity constraint for a given link is satisfied. The routine has no inputs, and returns a ResultCode and a StatusBlockPointer to the top of the stack as outputs, where the ResultCode is an integer value (0 if the routine completed successfully, or a negative error code otherwise), and where the StatusBlockPointer is the address of a standard ExtendedStatusBlock. If the ResultCode is not 0, the engine deems the validity constraint for the link object to be unsatisfied, and avoids making further calls to routines for the link control. Even if the ResultCode is 0 (success), this does not mean that the constraint has been satisfied; it only means that the routine was able to run without error. It is the StatusBlock that indicates whether the constraint is satisfied or not.","1.27.6.3. Control.Link.Constraint.Describe","This routine is optional, and is called when the application requests a description of the meaning of the constraint represented by the control program for a given link. The routine has no inputs, and returns a ResultCode and a StatusBlockPointer to the top of the stack as outputs, where the ResultCode is an integer value (0 if the routine completed successfully, or a negative error code otherwise), and where the StatusBlockPointer is the address of a standard ExtendedStatusBlock.","1.27.6.4. Control.Link.Constraint.Release","This routine is optional, and, if it exists, is called by the engine once after the engine no longer needs to call any other routine for the given constraint. The routine has no inputs, and returns a ResultCode to the top of the stack as an output. The ResultCode is 0 on success and a negative error code on failure. In the embodiment being discussed, after calling this routine, no other routine can be called for the given constraint unless a new cycle is initiated (in which case, the Init routine is called again). Similarly, if the ResultCode is not 0, the engine does not make further calls to routines for the given link constraint.","1.27.7. Agent Routines","In one embodiment, an agent is a control object that is designed to run on behalf of an entity. Agents are typically used in the context of a service interaction between two endpoints, where one endpoint needs to execute some virtual machine code within the context of the second endpoint, and possibly obtain the result of that execution. In one embodiment, a control can contain multiple agents, and each agent can contain any number of routines that can be executed; however, in practice, agents typically have a single routine.","In one illustrative embodiment, the following entry points are defined for agents, where <Agent> is a name string that refers to the actual name of an agent.","1.27.7.1. Control.Agents.<Agent>.Init","This routine is optional, and, if it exists, the engine calls it once before any other routine is called for the given agent. The routine has no inputs, and returns a ResultCode to the top of the stack as an output. The ResultCode is 0 on success and a negative error code on failure.","1.27.7.2. Control.Agents.<Agent>.Run","In the illustrative embodiment under discussion, this routine is required, and is the main routine of the agent. The routine has no inputs, and returns a ResultCode, a ReturnBlockAddress, and a ReturnBlockSize to the top of the stack as outputs. The ResultCode is an integer value (0 if the routine completed successfully, or a negative error code otherwise), the ReturnBlockAddress is the address of a block of memory that contains data that the agent code is expected to return to the caller (if the routine does not need to return anything, the address is 0), and the ReturnBlockSize is the size in bytes of the block of memory at the ReturnBlockAddress. In one embodiment, if ReturnBlockAddress is 0, the value of ReturnBlockSize is also 0.","1.27.7.3. Control.Agents.<Agent>.Describe","This routine is optional, and is called when an application request a description of a given agent. The routine has no inputs, and returns a ResultCode and a StatusBlockPointer to the top of the stack as outputs, where the ResultCode is an integer value (0 if the routine completed successfully, or a negative error code otherwise), and where the StatusBlockPointer is the address of a standard ExtendedStatusBlock.","1.27.7.4. Control.Agents.<Agent>.Release","This routine is optional, and, if it exists, the engine calls it once after the engine no longer needs to call any other routines for this agent. No other routine will be called for this agent unless a new cycle is initiated (in which case, the Init routine will be called again). The routine has no inputs, and returns a ResultCode to the top of the stack as an output. The ResultCode is 0 on success and a negative error code on failure.","1.28. Extended Status Blocks","The following example definitions are applicable to the ExtendedStatusBlock data structures returned by illustrative embodiments of several of the routines described above. Examples of ExtendedStatusBlock data structures are described in connection with the description of the virtual machine.","In one embodiment, there are no global ExtendedStatusBlock flags. In this embodiment, control programs set the GlobalFlag field of the ExtendedStatuBlock to 0.","1.28.1. Categories","The following paragraphs define values for the Category field of ExtendedStatusBlocks in accordance with one embodiment. In one embodiment, none of these categories have sub-categories, and thus the value of the SubCategory field of the ExtendedStatusBlocks is set to 0.","In one embodiment, the following category codes are defined:","1.28.1.1.

In this embodiment, a container object contains zero or more objects. A container object is referred to as the parent of the objects it contains. The contained objects are referred to as the children of the container. All the container objects that make up the chain of an object's parent, the parent's parent, and so on, are called the object's ancestors. If an object has another object as it ancestor, that object is called a descendant of the ancestor object.","1.34. Object Lifetime","In one embodiment, the lifetime of objects in the state database follows a number of rules. Objects can be explicitly destroyed, or implicitly destroyed. Objects can also be destroyed as the result of a database garbage collection. Regardless of how an object is destroyed, in one embodiment the following rules apply:\n\n","1.34.1. Explicit Object Destruction","Explicit object destruction happens when a client of the database requests that an object be removed (see Object Access for more details on how this can be done using the Host.SetObject system call).","1.34.2. Implicit Object Destruction","Implicit object destruction happens when an object is being destroyed as the result of one of the objects in its ancestry being destroyed.","1.34.3. Garbage Collection","In one embodiment, the state database destroys any object that has expired. An object is considered to have expired when the local time on the system that implements the database is later than the ExpirationDate field of the object's metadata. An implementation may periodically scan the database for expired objects and destroy them, or it may wait until an object is accessed to check its expiration date. In one embodiment, an implementation must not return to a client an expired object. In one embodiment, when a container object is destroyed (e.g., because it has expired), its children objects are also destroyed (and all their descendants, recursively) even if they have not expired yet.","1.35. Object Access","In one embodiment, the objects in the state database can be accessed from virtual machine programs through a pair of system calls: System.Host.GetObject to read the value of an object, and System.Host.SetObject to create, destroy, or set the value of an object.","In one embodiment, to be visible as a tree of host objects, the state database is \u201cmounted\u201d under a certain name in the host object tree. This way, the database is visible as a sub-tree in the more general tree of host objects. To achieve this, in one embodiment the state database contains a top-level, built-in root container object that always exists. This root container is essentially the name of the database. All other objects in the database are descendants of the root container. Multiple state databases can be mounted at different places in the host object tree (for two databases to be mounted under the same host container, they need to have different names for their root container). For example, if a state database whose root container is named Database1, contains a single integer child object named Child1, the database could be mounted under the host object container \u201c\/SeaShell\u201d, in which case the Child1 object would be visible as \u201c\/SeaShell\/Database1\/Child1\u201d. In one embodiment, accesses to objects in the state database are governed by an access policy.","1.35.1. Reading objects","The value of an object can be read by using the system call System.Host.GetObject. In one embodiment of the state database, the four object types (integer, string, byte array, and container) that can exist in the database map directly onto their counterparts in the virtual machine. The object values can be accessed in the normal way, and the standard virtual names can be implemented.","1.35.2. Creating objects","Objects can be created calling System.Host.SetObject for an object name that does not already exist. The object creation is done according to the system call specification. In one embodiment, when an object is created, the state database does the following:\n\n","When creating an object under a path deeper than the existing container hierarchy, in one embodiment the state database implicitly creates the container objects that need to exist to create a path to the object being created. In one embodiment, implicit container object creation follows the same rules as an explicit creation. For example, if there is a container \u201cA\u201d with no children, a request to set \u201cA\/B\/C\/SomeObject\u201d will implicitly create containers \u201cA\/B\u201d and \u201cAB\/C\u201d before creating \u201cA\/B\/C\/SomeObject\u201d.","1.35.3. Writing Objects","The value of objects can be changed by calling System.Host.SetObject for an object that already exists. If the specified ObjectType does not match the type ID of the existing object, ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned. In one embodiment, if the type ID is OBJECT_TYPE_CONTAINER, no value needs to be specified (the ObjectAddress must be non-zero, but its value will be ignored). When an existing object is set, the state database sets the ModificationDate of object to the current local time.","1.35.4. Destroying objects","Objects can be explicitly destroyed by calling System.Host.SetObject for an object that already exists, with an ObjectAddress value of 0. When an object is destroyed, the state database preferably:\n\n","1.35.5. Object Metadata","In one embodiment, the metadata for state database objects is accessed by using the System.Host.GetObject and System.Host.SetObject system calls with virtual names. The following table lists the standard and extended virtual names that are available for objects in one embodiment of the state database, and how they map to the metadata fields.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0896","num":"0956"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00072","num":"00072"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Virtual Name","Type","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["@Name","String","The Name field of the object"]},{"entry":[{},{},"metada"]},{"entry":["@Owner","String","The Owner field of the object"]},{"entry":[{},{},"metadata"]},{"entry":["@CreationDate","32-bit unsigned","The CreationDate field of the"]},{"entry":[{},"integer","object metadata"]},{"entry":["@ModificationDate","32-bit unsigned","The ModificationDate field of the"]},{"entry":[{},"integer","object metadata"]},{"entry":["@ExpirationDate","32-bit unsigned","The ExpirationDate field of the"]},{"entry":[{},"integer","object metadata"]},{"entry":["@Flags","32-bit bit field","The Flags field of the object"]},{"entry":[{},{},"metadata"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In one embodiment, an implementation must refuse a request to set the Flags metadata field if one or more undefined flags are set to 1. In this case, the return value for the System.Host.SetObject is ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER. In one embodiment, when reading the Flags metadata field, a client must ignore any flag that is not predefined, and when setting the Flags field of an object, a client must first read its existing value and preserve the value of any flag that is not predefined (e.g., in a system specification).","1.36. Object Ownership and Access Control","In one embodiment, whenever a request is made to read, write, create, or destroy an object, the state database implementation first checks whether the caller has the permission to perform the request. The policy that governs access to objects is based on the concepts of principal identities and delegation. In order for the policy to be implemented, the trust model under which the implementation operates needs to support the notion of authenticated control programs. This is typically done by having the virtual machine code module that contains the program be digitally signed (directly or indirectly through a secure reference) with the private key of a PKI key pair, and having a name certificate that associates a principal name with the signing key; however, it will be appreciated that different ways of determining control program identities are possible, any suitable one of which could be used.","In one embodiment, the access policy for the objects in the state database is comprised of a few simple rules:\n\n","In one embodiment, when the access policy denies a client's request, the return value of the system call for the request is ERROR_PERMISSION_DENIED.","The root container of the state database is preferably fixed when the database is created. When an object is created, the value of its Owner metadata field is set to the same value as that of its parent container Owner metadata field. Ownership of an object can change. To change the ownership of an object, the value of the Owner metadata field can be set by calling the Sytem.Host.SetObject system call for the \u2018@Owner\u2019 virtual name of that object, provided that it is permitted under the access control rules.","In embodiments where it is not possible for a control program to access objects that are not owned by the same principal as the one whose identity it is running under, a control program needs to delegate access to \u201cforeign\u201d objects to programs loaded from code modules that have the ability to run under the identity of the owner of the \u201cforeign\u201d object. To do this, a control program may use the System.Host.SpawnVm, System.Host.CallVm, and System.Host.ReleaseVm system calls in the control virtual machine.","1.37. License Transfer Protocol","The storage of state information in a database such as that described above enables rights to be moved between devices or exported from a domain (e.g., by transferring the state information to another device). The following section describes embodiments of protocols by which the state of a database can be transferred from a source to a sink. Note that although this process will be referred to as a license transfer protocol, it is the state of the state database that is being transferred, as opposed to merely an actual license (e.g., a control object, etc.). The protocol is referred to as a license transfer protocol because, in one embodiment, the transfer is initiated by execution of a transfer action in a control program, and because transfer of the state information enables the sink to successfully execute the relevant license for a piece of content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0906","num":"0972"},"figref":["FIG. 32","FIG. 32","FIG. 32"],"b":["3200","3202","3204","3206","3210","3202","3212","3202","3212","3204","3210","3210","3210","3210","3212","3206"]},"While the approach shown in  can be used in some embodiments, some potential problems include:","There is No Way to Proactively Tell the Source that Rendering is Over.","In one embodiment, the protocol shown in  supports two modes where this is a problem: (i) render (no stop render), and (ii) checkout (no check-in). Because of this problem, control issuers may be led to issue timeouts on the states that are transferred. However, this can result in a bad consumer experience when, for example, a user wants to render content on one device but decides that she actually wants to render this content on another one: with the current design, it is likely that she will have to wait for the entire piece of content to he rendered on the first device before she is able to render it on the other device. This might be undesirable if the content is relatively long (e.g., a movie).","It can be Difficult to Resolve the License Associated with the Content IDs in the Request.","In one embodiment, the request contains only the Content IDs, and the source retrieves the license associated with the Content IDs from its license database. However, this process can be prone to error, since the licenses may be stored on a removable media, and at the time of engagement of the protocol, a particular license may not be available if the media has been removed. Moreover, even if the licenses are available, it can be cumbersome to perform a lookup for the licenses in the license store. Also, because there can be multiple licenses associated with a set of Content IDs, it may be difficult to determine if the resolved license is the same as the one that was intended in the request.","There is No Way for the Control Program to Proactively Ask for a Proximity Check.","In one embodiment, the set of system calls\/callbacks\/obligations does not support a way for a Control to ask for proximity checking of a peer. Instead, a control can only read a value of a host object Octopus\/Action\/Parameters\/Sink\/Proximity\/LastProbe that is populated by the application during a transfer with a value it got from a previous execution of a proximity checking protocol. This can be a problem in the case where it may be desirable to avoid a proximity check if such a proximity check is not needed (e.g., if the sink is known to be within a certain domain).","There are Only Three Rounds to the Protocol.","In the embodiment shown in , the protocol is limited to three rounds. This can be a serious limitation, since the the protocol will be unable to handle the case where the OnAgentCompletion callback returns an extended status block with another RunAgentOnPeer obligation. Moreover, after the protocol is finished, the sink will not really know if the protocol has succeeded or not. In addition, the proximity check will need to occur before the response is sent (see previous problem) but this is not needed in the case where the source and the sink are in the same domain. In addition, in the protocol shown in , the source gives the content key to the sink without knowing if this content key will ever be used.","No Way in the ESB to Hint that a License Transfer is Needed.","In the embodiment shown in , when a DRM Client evaluates a license (e.g. Control.Actions.Play.Check), there is no easy way for the control writer to hint that a license transfer is needed in order to get the state that will enable a successful evaluation of the control.","The Source Cannot Initiate the Transfer.","In the protocol shown in , the license transfer is initiated by the sink. It would be desirable for the source to be able to initiate the transfer as well.","The embodiments described below can solve or ameliorate some or all of the problems described above.","Solution for the Release Problem.","In one embodiment, a new release operation is introduced. When this operation is specified in the request, the Transfer Mode ID is set to Release. In order, for the client to do the correlation between a render\/checkout and a release operation, an optional element SessionId is added to the request (see section below). In one embodiment, when this element is present, it is reflected in the host object tree of the Transfer Action context under SessionId.","The sink knows that it has to send this SessionId in the release request if the Extended Status Block it will get in the Teardown message (see below) contains a parameter:","Parameter Name: SessionId","Parameter Type: String","The flag of this parameter is set to CRITICAL.","Solution for the License Resolution Problem (Refactoring the Request).","In one embodiment, the solution consists of having the sink device put the license bundle(s) in the request so that there is essentially a guarantee that the sink and the source will execute the same license.

Certificates","In one embodiment, certificates are used to check the credentials associated with cryptographic keys before making decisions based on the digital signature created with those keys.","In some embodiments, the DRM engine is designed to be compatible with standard certificate technologies, and can leverage information found in the elements of such certificates, such as validity periods, names, and the like. In addition to those basic constraints, in some embodiments additional constraints can be defined about what a certified key can and cannot be used for. This can accomplished by, for example, using key-usage extensions available as part of the standard encoding of the certificates. The information encoded in such extensions allows the DRM engine to check if the key that has signed a specific object was authorized to be used for that purpose. For example, a certain key may have a certificate that allows it to sign link objects only if the link is from a node with a specific attribute, to a node with another specific attribute, and no other link. Since the semantics of the generic technology used to express the certificate will generally not be capable of expressing such a constraint, as it will have no way of expressing conditions that relate to DRM engine-specific elements such as links and nodes, in one embodiment such DRM engine-specific constraints are conveyed as a key usage extension of the basic certificate that will be processed by applications that have been configured to use the DRM engine.","In one embodiment, the constraints in the key usage extension are expressed by a usage category and a VM constraint program. The usage category specifies what type of objects a key is authorized to sign. The constraint program can express dynamic conditions based on context. In one embodiment, any verifier that is being asked to verify the validity of such a certificate is required to understand the DRM engine semantics, and delegates the evaluation of the key usage extension expression to a DRM engine, which uses an instance of the virtual machine to execute the program. The certificate is considered valid if the result of the execution of that program is successful.","In one embodiment, the role of a constraint program is to return a boolean value. \u201cTrue\u201d means that the constraint conditions are met, and \u201cfalse\u201d means that they are not met. In one embodiment the control program will have access to some context information that can be used to reach a decision, such as information available to the program through the virtual machine's Host Object interface. The information available as context depends on what type of decision the DRM engine is trying to make when it requests the verification of the certificate. For example, before using the information in a link object, in one embodiment a DRM engine will need to verify that the certificate of the key that signed the object allows that key to be used for that purpose. When executing the constraint program, the virtual machine's environment will be populated with information regarding the link's attributes, as well as the attributes of the nodes referenced by the link.","In one embodiment, the constraint program embedded in the key usage extension is encoded as a virtual machine code module that exports at least one entry point named \u201cOctopus.Certificate.<Category>.Check\u201d, where \u201cCategory\u201d a name indicating which category of certificates needs to be checked. Parameters to the verification program will be pushed on the stack before calling the entry point. The number and types of parameters passed on the stack will generally depend on the category of certificate extension being evaluated.","12. Digital Signatures","In preferred embodiments, some or all of the objects used by the DRM engine are signed. The following is a description of how objects are digitally signed in one embodiment using the XML digital signature specification (http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/xmldsig-core) (\u201cXMLDSig\u201d). In addition, a canonicalization method of XML compatible with the XML exclusive canonicalization (http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/xml-exc-c14n\/) (\u201cc14n-ex\u201d) is also described, the output of which can be processed by a non-XML-namespace-aware parser. Appendix D provides more information on an exemplary object serialization, including an illustrative way to compute a canonical byte sequence for objects in an encoding-independent manner.","As shown in  in preferred embodiments certain elements in a DRM license are signed. Techniques such as those shown in  are useful in prevent or impeding tampering with or replacement of the license components. As shown in , in a preferred embodiment, controller object  includes cryptographic digests or hashes (or other suitable bindings) ,  of contentkey object  and control object , respectively. Controller  is itself signed with a MAC (or, preferably, an HMAC that makes use of the content key) and a public key signature (typically of the content or license provider) . In a preferred embodiment, the public key signature of the controller  is itself signed with an HMAC  using the content key. It will be appreciated that in other embodiments, other signature schemes could be used, depending on the desired level of security and\/or other system requirements. For example, different signature schemes could be used for the signature of the controller and\/or control, such as PKI, standard MACs, and\/or the like. As another example, a separate MAC signature could be computed for both the control and the controller, rather than including a digest of the control in the controller and computing a single MAC signature of the controller. In yet another example, the controller could be signed with both a MAC and a public key signature. Alternatively or in addition different keys than those described above could be used to generate the various signatures. Thus while  illustrate several advantageous signature techniques in accordance with some embodiments, it will be appreciated that these techniques are illustrative and non-limiting.  illustrates an embodiment in which a controller references multiple content keys.

Embodiments of a proximity check protocol are described below that provide security without unduly impeding the performance of the proximity check itself. The proximity check protocol lends itself to application in a wide variety of contexts, one of which is, as indicated above, in the context of digital rights management controls; however, it will be appreciated that the proximity checking systems and methods described below are not limited in application to the digital rights management context. For example, without limitation, the proximity checking techniques presented herein can also be used in the context of a network service orchestration system such as that described in the '551 application and\/or any other suitable context.","In one embodiment, a proximity check is performed by measuring the amount of time it takes a first computing node to receive a response from a second computing node to the first computing node's request. If the amount of time is less than a predefined threshold (generally indicating that the second computing node is within a certain physical distance of the first computing node), then the proximity check is deemed a success.","It will be appreciated that due to the wide variety of different network connections over which the request and\/or the response might be sent, a given amount of time may correspond to range of possible distances. In some embodiments, this variation is simply ignored, and the proximity check is deemed a success if the round-trip time of the request\/response exchange is less than the predefined threshold (e.g., 8 milliseconds, or any other suitable amount of time), regardless of whether, e.g., a fast network connection is being used that could mean that the requesting and responding nodes are actually relatively distant from each other. In other embodiments, a determination could be made as to the type of network connection being used, and different round-trip time requirements could be applied to each different network connection.","In a preferred embodiment, the proximity check allows an anchor (e.g., a client) to check the proximity of a target (e.g., a service). In one embodiment, the protocol is asymmetric, in that the anchor generates the secret seed that is used, and is the only one that makes use of a secure timer. Moreover, the target does not need to trust the anchor. Preferred embodiments of the proximity check are also cryptographically efficient: in one embodiment making use of only two public key operations.","Generation of a Set, R, of Q Pairs from a Seed, S","In one embodiment, a set R is obtained from a seed S according to the following formula: R=HS). Where H(M) is the digest value of the hash function H over the message M, and H(M)=H(H(M)) for n>=1 and H(M)=M. It will be appreciated that this is simply one illustrative technique for generating a shared secret, and that in other embodiments other techniques could be used without departing from the principles hereof.","In one embodiment, the algorithm used for the hash function H is SHA1 (see, e.g., FIPS PUB 180-1. Secure Hash Standard. U.S. Department of Commerce\/National Institute of Standards and Technology), although it will be appreciated that in other embodiments, other hash, message digest, or functions could be used.","In one embodiment, a proximity check is performed as follows, where \u201cA\u201d is the anchor (e.g., client) and \u201cB\u201d is the target (e.g., service):","(a) A generates a set R of Q pairs of random numbers {R, R}, {R, R} . . . {R, R}, as shown above.","(b) A sends to B: E(PubB, {Q,S}), where E(Y, X) denotes the encryption of X with the key Y, and PubB denotes B's public key in a public\/private key pair.","(c) B decrypts {Q,S} and precomputes R as shown above.","(d) B sends A an acknowledgement to indicate that it is ready to proceed.","(e) A sets a loop counter, k, to zero.","(f) A measures T=current time.","(g) A sends to B: {k, R}.","(h) If the value of Ris correct, B responds with R.","(i) A measures D=new current time\u2212T.","(j) If B responded to A with the correct value for R, and D is less than a predefined threshold, then the proximity check is deemed a success.","If k+1<Q, A can retry a new measurement by incrementing k and going to step (f). If it is needed to perform more than Q measurements, A can start from step (a) with a new set R. For example, in some embodiments the proximity check can be performed repeatedly (or a predefined number of times) until a correct response is received within the predefined threshold (or if correct responses are received within the predefined threshold more than a predefined percentage of a sequence of challenge\/responses), since even if two computing nodes are within the required proximity of each other, an abnormally slow network connection, heavy traffic, noise, and\/or the like can cause B's response to be delayed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1037","num":"1119"},"figref":["FIG. 36","FIG. 36"],"b":["3602","3606","3606","3602","3602","3602","3606","3602","3606","3606","3606"]},"As shown in , once A and B complete any initial set-up steps (e.g., steps (a) through (e), above) , , A and B engage in a secure, timed, challenge-response exchange (e.g., steps (f) through (i), above)  that enables A to determine whether B is within an acceptable proximity.","As shown in , in one embodiment A  sends B  a Setup Request  comprising E(PubB, {Q, S})\u2014i.e., the number of pairs, Q, as well as the secret pairs seed, S, encrypted with B's public encryption key (e.g., a key used by B in the context of service orchestration).

In other embodiments, a certain number of incorrect responses from B may be tolerated.","It will be appreciated that optimal values for Q and the predefined time threshold will typically depend on the unique circumstances of the application at hand (e.g., the speed of the network, the importance of ensuring a relatively tight proximity, etc.). Therefore, implementations should preferably provide for flexibility in configuring these values. In one embodiment, it is assumed that implementations will support a minimum value of 64 for Q and a value of 8 ms for the threshold (where, at some of today's network speeds, 8 ms may correspond to a proximity of a few miles).","Protocol Security Policies","In a preferred embodiment, no additional security is needed for the exchange of the request and the response. Because of the size of the messages being exchanged (e.g., 20 bytes), and their effective randomness (through use of the SHA1 hashing algorithm or other method), it will be cryptographically infeasible for an attacker to determine the correct response, even if the attacker manages to intercept the request.","It should be appreciated that the above-described embodiments are illustrative, and that numerous modifications could be made without departing from the inventive principles presented herein. For example, while a recursively hashed secret seed is described above, any suitable shared secret could be used for the challenge\/response. In one embodiment, the shared secret might simply comprise an encrypted number\/message sent from A to B, and the challenge\/response could simply comprise A and B exchanging portions of the number\/message (e.g., A sends B the first character of the message, and B sends A the second character of the message, and so forth). Although such a technique may lack the security of the embodiment described in connection with  (since a character in a message would be much easier to guess than a 20 byte hash), in some embodiments such a level of security may be adequate (especially where, for example, the variability of network delays makes the proximity checking mechanism a fairly coarse control of actual proximity anyway), and in other embodiments security could be enhanced by performing the proximity check multiple times, where, although any particular digit or bit may be relatively easy to guess, the likelihood that an attacker would be able to correctly guess a given sequence of digits or bits will rapidly decrease with the length of the sequence. In such an embodiment, the proximity check could be deemed a success only if B is able to provide more than a predefined number of consecutive correct responses (or a predefined percentage of correct responses).","For purposes of illustration and explanation, an additional illustrative example of a proximity check protocol is provided below. In this example, a first device, SRC, communicates with a second device, SNK, over a communication channel (e.g., a computer network). We want to be able to securely determine if SRC and SNK are within proximity of each other, as measured by the time it takes for SNK to respond to a communication request from SRC. A challenge or probe message is sent from SRC to SNK, and SNK replies with a response message. The period of time between the emission of the challenge and the reception of the response will be called the round trip time or RTT. To avoid introducing unnecessary overhead in the time it takes SNK to compute and send back a response to the challenge, it will generally be desirable to make the challenge\/response communication as lightweight as practical. In particular, it will typically be desirable to avoid requiring cryptographic operations by SRC or SNK between the emission of the challenge and the reception of the response.","Also, to ensure that only SNK is able to produce a valid response to the challenge from SRC (e.g., to avoid a man-in-the-middle attack, where a third party could intercept the challenge from SRC and send a response back, as if SNK had responded), the protocol could proceed as follows:","(1) SRC creates a secret. This secret is composed of one or more pairs of random or pseudo-random numbers.","(2) SRC sends to SNK the secret. This part of the protocol is not time-sensitive. The secret is kept confidential by SRC and SNK. The secret is also sent in a way that ensures that only SNK knows it. This typically involves sending the secret over a secure authenticated channel between SRC and SNK (for example, SRC can encrypt the secret data with a public key for which it knows that only SNK has the corresponding private key). The secret data does not have to be the pair(s) of random or pseudo-random numbers described above. Even in embodiments where such pairs are used, the secret data transmitted in this step only needs to be enough information to allow SNK to compute or deduct the values of the pair(s) of numbers. For example, the secret data could be a random seed number from which one or more pair(s) of pseudo-random numbers can be generated using a seeded pseudo-random number generator.","(3) Once SRC knows that SNK is ready to receive a challenge (for example, SNK may send a READY message after receiving and processing the secret data), SRC creates a challenge message. To create the challenge message. For example, in a preferred embodiment, SRC selects one of the random number pairs. If more than one pair is used, the challenge message data contains the information to indicate which pair was chosen, as well as one of the two numbers in that pair.","(4) SRC measures the value of the current time, T. Immediately after, SRC sends the challenge message (no need for encryption or digital signature), to SNK and waits for the response. Alternatively, SRC could measure the current time, T, immediately before sending the challenge message, although preferably after any concomitant cryptographic operations (e.g., encryption, signing, and\/or the like) had been performed.","(5) SNK receives the challenge, from which it can identify one of the pairs it has received previously. SNK checks that the random number in the challenge is part of the pair, and constructs a response message that contains the value of the other random number of that pair.","(6) SNK sends the response message to SRC (no need for encryption or digital signature).","(7) SRC receives the response message, and measures the value of the current time, T. The round trip time RTT is equal to T-T.","(8) SRC verifies that the number received in the response is equal to the other value in the pair that was chosen for the challenge. If the numbers match, the challenge response is successful, and SRC can be assured that SNK was within the proximity indicated by the roundtrip time. If the numbers do not match, SRC can abort the protocol, or, if more than one pair was shared, and there is at least one pair that has not been used, go back to step (3), and use a different pair.","It will be appreciated that a number of variations could be made to the illustrative proximity checking protocols described above without departing from the principles thereof. For example, without limitation, different cryptographic algorithms could be used, different shared secrets could be used, and\/or the like.","14. Security","In practical applications of the systems and methods described herein, security can be provided at a variety of different levels and using a variety of different techniques. The discussion herein has focused primarily on the design and operation of a DRM engine and related host application for use in efficiently regulating potentially complex business relationships. When the DRM engine and host application operate as intended, content is protected from unauthorized access or other use by the enforcement of the license terms associated therewith.","Protection of the DRM engine and\/or the environment in which the DRM engine runs (e.g., the applications and hardware with which it interacts) from malicious tampering or modification can be done using any suitable combination of security techniques. For example, cryptographic mechanisms such as encryption, digital signatures, digital certificates, message authentication codes, and the like can be employed, e.g., as described elsewhere herein, to protect the DRM engine, host application, and\/or other system software or hardware from tampering and\/or other attack, as could structural and\/or tactical security measures such as software obfuscation, self-checking, customization, watermarking, anti-debugging, and\/or other mechanisms.

No. 7,124,170 B1, Secure Processing Unit Systems and Methods, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Alternatively or in addition, physical security techniques (e.g., the use of relatively inaccessible memory, secure processors, secure memory management units, hardware-protected operating system modes, and\/or the like) can be used to further enhance security. Such security techniques will be well-known to one of ordinary skill in the art, and it will be appreciated that any suitable combination of some, none, or all of these techniques could be used depending on desired level of protection and\/or the details of the particular application at hand. Thus, it will be appreciated that while certain security mechanisms (e.g., key derivation techniques, digital signature techniques, encryption techniques, and the like) are described herein in connection with certain embodiments, use of these techniques is not required in all embodiments.","Yet another form of security can be provided by the institutional design and operation of the system, and by the legal and social regulation of the participants therein. For example, in order to obtain a personality node, keying material, protected content, and\/or the like, a device or entity may be required to contractually agree to adhere to system specifications and requirements, may need to submit to a certification process during which the entity's compliance with system requirements could be verified, and\/or the like. For example, a device or application may be required to implement the DRM engine in a way that is compatible with other implementations in the environment, and\/or be required to provide a certain type or level of tamper resistance or other security. Digital certificates could be issued that attested to a device's or other entity's compliance with such requirements, and these certificates could be verified before allowing the device or entity to participate in the system, or as a condition of allowing continuing access.","Additional, non-limiting information on security techniques that can be used in connection with the inventive body of work is provided below.","System Security","In some embodiments, a system designer may choose to use a combination of renewability, refusal, and\/or remediation techniques to manage risks and mitigate threats that may arise from attacks on and compromise of devices, applications, and services. Examples of various technical mechanisms that can be used to mitigate threats are presented below.","Renewal mechanisms can be used to serve at least two distinct purposes.","First, they can be used to convey up-to-date information to trusted system entities that allow them to refuse access or service to untrusted system entities. Second, renewal mechanisms enable an untrusted entity to regain trusted status by updating any compromised component(s). Refusal countermeasures can be further characterized as exhibiting one or more of the following behaviors:\n\n","For example, refusal mechanisms can be used to counter threats such as device cloning, impersonation attack, protocol failures, policy enforcement failures, application security failures, and stale or suspicious information.","The following table provides examples of potential threats, some of the risks they pose, and mechanisms to remedy the threat and renew system security.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1070","num":"1162"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00087","num":"00087"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},"Remediation","Renewal"]},{"entry":["Threat","Risks","Mechanism","Mechanism"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Cloned Device","Free-access devices.","Broadcast","BKB Update."]},{"entry":[{},{},"Encryption",{}]},{"entry":["Compromised","Unauthorized licenses,","Certificate","CRL Distribution."]},{"entry":["Certified Key","links, device state,","Revocation","Key renewal."]},{"entry":[{},"identities, service access.",{},{}]},{"entry":["Implementation","Recipes for device","Specification","Software upgrade"]},{"entry":["Failure","hacking.","Version Assertion",{}]},{"entry":["Protocol Failure","Compromised keys.","Security Metadata","Software upgrade"]},{"entry":[{},"Ungoverned access to","Assertion",{}]},{"entry":[{},"licensed content.",{},{}]},{"entry":["Stale Security","Bogus service interaction.","Security Metadata","Security Metadata"]},{"entry":["Metadata","Clock rollback, reliance","Assertion","update service."]},{"entry":[{},"on compromised information.",{},"Software upgrade."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Revocation","Revocation can be viewed as a remediation mechanism that relies on blacklisting an entity. Typically, what is revoked is a credential such as a public-key certificate. Upon revoking the credential, the blacklist will need to be updated and a renewal mechanism used to convey the update so that a relying party may benefit therefrom.","Thus, for example, devices, users, and\/or other entities can be required to present identity certificates, other credentials, and a variety of security data before they are given the information necessary to consume content or a service. Similarly, in order for a client to trust a service, the service may need to provide its credentials to the client.","Examples of ways that an entity can effectively invalidate information necessary for accessing a service include:\n\n","Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)","Revocation lists can be used by different entities to revoke identity certificates, licenses, links, and other security assertions. This mechanism is most effective to remedy the situation which results from a service being compromised. A number of techniques can be used for distributing CRLs. For example, some systems may employ an indirect CRL, so that there is a single CRL governing the entire ecosystem. In addition, entities can advertise (or publish) the CRL(s) in their possession, and\/or subscribe to an update service. CRL(s) can be distributed peer-to-peer in a viral fashion and\/or portable devices can receive published CRL(s) when tethered. The service orchestration techniques described in the '551 application can also be used for this purpose.","Validity Services","Validity services can be used to provide up-to-date information on the status of credentials and other security related data. Validity services can perform either active validation operations on behalf of a relying party or they can be used to manage security information on behalf of relying parties. An example of an active validity service is one that can check the validity of a credential or attribute. Examples of validity services that manage security information are those which disseminate CRL or security policy updates, or provide a secure time service. The use of validity services can help ensure that relying parties have current data to inform governance decisions.","Typically, not all system entities will need up-to-the-minute information on the validity of credentials and security data. For example, not all consumer devices will use an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) service to validate a license server's certificate chain each time a license is used or a new license is obtained. However, a license server may use an OCSP service with some frequency to check the validity of subscriber credentials. Policy (which can be easily updated) can determine when and what services must be used. By providing an opportunity to dynamically update policy, license servers can adapt to operational changes. Thus, security policy can evolve based on experience, technological progress, and market factors.","Directed Self-Destruction of Security Objects","Self-destruction of credentials and data by an entity is appropriate when the integrity of the entity's security processing is not suspect. When this option is available, it is often the most straightforward, expeditious, and efficient method of revocation. It can be particularly useful when there is little or no suspicion of breach of integrity, and bi-directional communication supports a protocol allowing specific directions for destruction along with verification that destruction has been completed.","There are a number of security objects that will often be useful to have destroyed or disabled. For example, when a device leaves a domain, or a content license times out, it will he useful for the associated objects that contain keys and can be used to access content to be destroyed. The agent control programs desdcribed in more detail elsewhere herein are well-suited to the implementation of self-destruction mechanisms. Agents can be crafted to destroy state in secure storage (e.g., the state database) to affect changes in domain membership or to remove keys that are no longer usable (e.g., due to changes in membership or policy).","Exclusion","Exclusion is a remediation mechanism which bars a bad actor (or group of bad actors) from participating in future consumption of goods and services. Due to the severe consequences exclusion imposes, it is typically only used as a last resort when circumstances warrant. Exclusion relies on a mechanism that effectively blacklists the bad actors, thereby prohibiting them from consuming media and media-related services. Dissemination of the blacklist relies upon a renewal mechanism to enable this remediation. However, exclusion does not necessarily provide a renewal mechanism to restore a bad actor to a trusted status.","Key Exclusion","Key exclusion is a key management mechanism that is used to broadcast key information to a set of receivers in such a way that at any given time a decision can be made to logically exclude some subset of receivers from the ability to decrypt future content. This is activated by using efficient techniques to construct a Broadcast Key Block (BKB) that includes information necessary for each member of a large group of receivers to decrypt content. The BKB is structured in such a way that it can be easily updated, excluding one or more members of the group from the ability to decrypt the content. In other words, the design of the BKB allows for an authority to update the system with a new BKB, so that a content provider can specifically exclude a target set of devices from making use of the BKB, even though s\/he may have access to it.","This mechanism is particularly effective against a cloning attack, where a pirate reverse engineers a legitimate device, extracts its keys, and then deploys copies of those keys to clone devices. The clones externally act like the original, except that these clones will not necessarily adhere to the governance model. Once the compromise is discovered, an updated BKB can be deployed that excludes the compromised device and all of its clones. However, key exclusion incurs some storage, transport, and computation overhead that in some situations make it less efficient than other methods. This is especially true when the content is not broadcast or when there is a back channel.","Shunning","Shunning is a remediation mechanism very similar in behavior to exclusion but with less severe repercussions. Essentially, it is a means for refusing service because of a runtime policy decision. Instead of more heavy-handed approaches to disable a device's capability through directed self-destruction or access denial via key exclusion, shunning offers a simple approach to disabling a device by having service providers refuse to supply it with services. With the current trend towards extending the value of devices by using externally provided services, shunning becomes a more effective security mechanism.","Device shunning is driven by policy and can be used to discriminate against entities (e.g., clients, servers, and specific role players) that do not produce all of the appropriate credentials that policy requires. Policy could, for example, require that an entity demonstrate it has administered the latest security update. Therefore shunning can be either a consequence of revocation or the failure to take some specific action. Shunning can be facilitated in a peer-to-peer fashion using the inspection services and services such as those describe in the '551 application. Also, a data certification service (e.g., an instance of a validity service) can perform shunning at policy enforcement time. After a system entity has been shunned, it can be informed of the specific credential or object that is failing to comply with the policy of the service. This can trigger the shunned entity to renew the object through an appropriate service interface.","Expiration","Expiration is a remediation mechanism that relies upon some temporal event to invalidate a credential or object. Expiration is effective in enabling temporary access to media or media services; once these have expired, the governance model ensures that access is no longer permitted. Effective use of expiration may require renewal mechanisms whereby the credential or object can be refreshed to enable continued access to media or media services.","Expiration of Credentials","Certified keys can have various expiry attributes assigned to protect relying parties. Expiration of credentials can be used to ensure that entities whose certificates have expired are refused service and used in conjunction with key rollover and key renewal procedures. When entities are expected to be frequently connected to a wide area network, best-practice dictates renewing credentials and other security data regularly. Another best-practice is to keep the validity period of these objects as short as reasonable. Various techniques such as overlapping validity periods and grace periods in validity checking policies can be used to ensure smooth operation during transitions. Short validity periods also help to reduce the size of CRLs.","Expiration of Links","As previously described, link objects may be assigned validity periods. Upon expiration, a link is deemed invalid and a DRM engine will not consider it in the construction of its graph. This mechanism can be used to enable temporary access to goods and services. Links can be renewed so that continued access to media may be granted as long as it is permitted by policy. Because, in one embodiment, links are relatively lightweight, self-protected objects they can be easily distributed over peer-to-peer protocols.","Renewability Mechanisms: Application and Policy Renewability","Efficient renewability will typically entail the rapid deployment of remedies to protocol failures, which are often the dominant security problems seen in security applications (including in DRM systems). Software updates can then be used to update the business logic and security protocols. When applications are designed to separate security policy and trust policy from application logic, a separate mechanism can be used to update policy; this is a less risky approach. In fact, peer-to-peer publishing mechanisms can be used to rapidly update policy. Otherwise, the application deployer's software update methods can be used to update security and trust policy.","Using the Right Tool for the Right Job","It will generally be desirable to use relatively lightweight tools when possible. Using credentials with limited validity periods and policies that check validity dates can help keep the overall population of entities to a manageable size and eliminate the need for growing CRLs too rapidly. Shunning an entity rather than excluding it from access to keys can extend the lifetime of BKBs; moreover, it has the advantage of enabling fine-grained policies that can be temporary and change with circumstances. Different CRLs that track specific types of credentials of interest to different role players can be used instead of BKBs which can be deployed where they are most effective (such as dealing with cloned receivers). Policies can direct the use of online validity services when those services can be expected to provide a reasonable return on investment of time and effort, where fresh credentials are very important, and where slower revocation mechanisms are inadequate. When a node is likely to have integrity and can be expected to do the right thing, and when a license or security object (such as a link for a subscription or a domain link) needs to be revoked, then a reasonable approach will typically be to tell the node to destroy the object. In such a situation, there is no need to tell the world that the license is invalid and there is no need to deploy a BKB or re-key a domain. Self-destruction driven by local policy or by an authoritative command is one of the more efficient methods for revocation.","It will be appreciated that while a variety of revocation, renewal, remediation, and other technologies and practices have been described, it will be appreciated that different situations call for different tools, and that preferred embodiments of the systems and methods described herein can be practiced using any suitable combination of some or none of these techniques.","Network Services Security","The following discussion illustrates some of the security considerations and techniques that can be relevant to embodiments in which the DRM engine and applications described above are used in connection with networked service orchestration systems and methods such as those described in the '551 application.","Practical implementations of DRM systems employing a DRM engine and architecture such as those disclosed herein will often perform networked transactions for accessing content and DRM objects. In such a context, the systems and methods described in the '551 application can be used to inter alia standardize message-layer security, including entity authentication and formats for authorization attributes (roles).","For the sake of discussion, the transactions that occur in a DRM system can be separated into at least two general categories based on the type of information being accessed, acquired, or manipulated:","Content Access Transactions involve direct access to or manipulation of media or enterprise content or other sensitive information protected by the DRM system. Examples of content access transactions include rendering a protected video clip, burning a copy of a protected audio track to a compact disc, moving a protected file to a portable device, emailing a confidential document, and the like. Content access transactions typically involve direct access to a content protection key and are performed at the point of consumption under the direction of a user.","Object Transactions are transactions in which a user or system acquires or interacts with objects defined by the DRM system that in some way govern access to protected content. Such objects include DRM licenses, membership tokens, revocation lists, and so forth. One or more object transactions are usually required before all of the collateral necessary to perform a content access transaction is available. Object transactions are typically characterized by the use of some type of communications network to assemble DRM objects at the point of consumption.","These two types of transactions define two points of governance that are generally relevant to most DRM systems.  shows a typical pair of interactions in which a DRM-enabled client  requests a DRM license  from an appropriate DRM license service . In the example shown in , the DRM license  is sent from the DRM license service  to the client , where it is evaluated in order to provide access to content .","DRM systems typically require that both content access and object transactions be performed in a manner that prevents unauthorized access to content and creation of objects that protect the content. However, the security concerns for the two types of transactions are naturally different. For example:","Content Access Transactions may require authenticating a human principal, checking a secure render count, evaluating a DRM license to derive a content protection key, etc. A major threat against legitimate execution of a content access transaction is breach of the tamper-resistant boundary that protects the objects and the data inside.","Object Transactions usually involve a communications channel between the entity that requires the DRM object and the entity that can provide it. As such, object transactions face communications-based threats such as man-in-the-middle attacks, replay attacks, denial-of-service attacks, and attacks in which unauthorized entities acquire DRM objects that they should not legitimately possess.","In general, object transactions involve authentication of two interacting entities, the protection of the messages passed between them, and authorization of the transaction. The primary purpose of such transactions is to gather integrity-protected DRM objects from legitimate sources so that content access transactions can be performed. From the perspective of a content access transaction, the mechanisms by which legitimate DRM objects are obtained and the collateral information used in obtaining them are essentially irrelevant; these mechanisms can (and preferably should) be invisible to the content access itself. This natural separation of concerns leads, in a preferred embodiment, to a layered communications model that distinguishes the trusted communications framework from applications that are built on top of it.","The simplified license acquisition and consumption example shown in  obscures some details that will generally be important in practical applications. For example, it does not show how the DRM license service verifies that the entity requesting a DRM license is in fact a legitimate DRM client and not a malicious entity attempting to obtain an unauthorized license or to deny service to legitimate clients by consuming network bandwidth and processing power. Nor does it show how sensitive information is protected for confidentiality and integrity as it moves through the communications channels connecting the client and service.","A more detailed view of this example transaction is shown in . Referring to , the dotted line represents the logical transaction from the point of view of the application-layer content rendering client  and DRM license server . The stack  below represents the layers of processing used to ensure trusted and protected delivery between the two endpoints.","In  a rendering client  requests a license  from a DRM license server . The dotted line in the diagram indicates that the original source and ultimate consumer of the information are the content rendering client  and the DRM license server . However, in practice the message payload may actually be handled by several layers of processing interposed between the application-layer logic and the unsecured communications channel  connecting the two endpoints.","The processing layers that separate the application layer components from the unsecured communications channel will be referred to collectively as the security stack. The security stack can be thought of as a secure messaging framework that ensures integrity-protected, confidential delivery of messages between trusted endpoints. The layered stack model offers advantages such as:","(1) Designers of the application layer logic do not need to expend effort developing the underlying secure communications mechanisms that connect endpoints. The trusted messaging infrastructure is a common design pattern that, once designed, can be deployed in many different situations regardless of the application layer logic that they are supporting.","(2) The messaging framework itself can remain agnostic to the precise semantics of the messages it is conveying and focus its efforts on preventing communications-related attacks and attacks on the authenticity of the messaging endpoints.","In one embodiment, the security stack consists of several distinct layers of processing, as described below. In one embodiment the service orchestration systems and methods described in the '551 application can be used to provide some or all of the operations of the security stack.","Authentication","In one embodiment, messaging endpoints may be authenticated. Authentication is a process by which a given endpoint demonstrates to another that it has been given a valid name by an authority trusted for this purpose. The naming authority should be trusted by the relying endpoint in a transaction; establishing such an authority is typically undertaken by the organizations deploying the trusted technology.","A common mechanism for demonstrating possession of a valid name uses public key cryptography and digital signatures. Using this approach, an entity is provided with three pieces of information:","(1) A distinguished name that provides an identifier for the entity;","(2) An asymmetric key pair, consisting of a public key and a secret private key; and","(3) A digitally signed certificate that asserts that the holder of the private key has the given distinguished name.","The certificate binds the distinguished name and the private key. An entity that uses the private key to sign a piece of information is trusted to have the given distinguished name. The signature can be verified using only the public key. For example, authentication can be based on the X.509v3 standard.","Since, in one embodiment, an entity that can demonstrate possession of a certified private key is trusted to have the distinguished name indicated in the certificate, protecting the private key used to sign information becomes an important consideration. In effect, the ability to use the private signing key defines the boundaries of the entity identified by the distinguished name. At the application layer, senders and recipients need to know that messages originate from trusted counterparts. As such, in one embodiment it is important that the application layer logic itself be part of the authenticated entity. For this reason, in one embodiment the security stack and the application layers that rely upon it are preferably enclosed in a trust boundary, such that a subsystem contained within the trust boundary is assumed to share access to the entity's private message signing key.","Authorization","The authentication mechanism described above proves to distributed messaging endpoints that their correspondent's identity is trustworthy. In many applications, this information is too coarse\u2014more detailed information about the capabilities and properties of the endpoints may be needed to make policy decisions about certain transactions. For example, in the context of , the content rendering client may need to know not only that it is communicating with an authenticated endpoint, but also whether it is communicating with a service that has been deemed competent to provide valid DRM license objects.","Embodiments of the security stack provide a mechanism for asserting, conveying, and applying policy that is based on more fine-grained attributes about authenticated entities via an authorization mechanism. Using this mechanism, entities that already possess authentication credentials are assigned role assertions that associate a named set of capabilities with the distinguished name of the entity. For example, role names can be defined for a DRM client and a DRM license server.","The named roles are intended to convey specific capabilities held by an entity. In practice, roles can be attached to an entity by asserting an association between the entity's distinguished name and the role name. As with authentication certificates, which associate keys with distinguished names, in one embodiment role assertions used for authorization are signed by a trusted role authority that may be different from the name issuer. Inside an entity, role assertions are verified along with the authentication credentials as a condition for granting access to a messaging endpoint's application layer.","An entity may hold as many role attributes as are required by the application being built. The example in  shows an entity with multiple roles: one role that indicates the ability to function as a DRM client and two service roles. For example, one entity may be simultaneously a DRM client, a DRM object provider, and a security data provider. In one embodiment, SAML 1.1 is used for assertions regarding entity attributes.","Message Security","The bottom layer of the security stack is the message security layer, which provides integrity, confidentiality, and freshness protection for messages, and mitigates the risk of attacks on the communications channel such as replay attacks. In the message security layer:\n\n","In one illustrative embodiment, support is provided for AES symmetric encryption, RSA public key cryptography, SHA-256 signature digests, and mechanisms to signal other algorithms in messages.","15. Bootstrap Protocol","In some embodiments, a bootstrap protocol is used to deliver initial confidential configuration data to entities such as devices and software clients. For example, when an entity wishes to join a larger network or system and communicate with other entities using cryptographic protocols, it may need to be configured with personalized data, including a set of keys (shared, secret, and public). When it is not possible or practical for the entity to be pre-configured with personalized data, it will need to \u201cbootstrap\u201d itself using a cryptographic protocol.","The example protocol described below uses a shared secret as the basis for bootstrapping an entity with a set of keys and other configuration data. In the following sections, the following notation will be used:\n\n","1.38. Initial State","1.38.1. Client","In one embodiment, the client has the following set of bootstrap tokens (preloaded at manufacturing time and\/or in firmware\/software):\n\n","The client may be configured with multiple BootRootCertificate certificates and BAK authentication keys, in order to be able to participate in the Boot Protocol with different Boot Servers that may require different trust domains.","1.38.2. Server","In one embodiment the server has the following tokens:\n\n","1.39. Protocol Description","An illustrative embodiment of a bootstrap protocol is shown in  and described below. A failure during the process (for example, when verifying a signature or a certificate chain) will lead to an error and stop the protocol progression.","BootstrapRequestMessage","The client sends a request to the server, indicating that it wants to initiate a bootstrap session and provides some initial parameters (e.g., protocol version, profile, etc.), as well as a session ID (to prevent replay attacks) and a list of Trust Domains in which it can participate.

Appendix B presents the XML encoding of objects in one embodiment of a system using the example Octopus DRM engine described elsewhere herein. For a particular application, an application-specific XML schema can be created by importing the XML schema shown below (the \u201cOctopus XML Schema\u201d) and adding elements specific to the application (e.g., extensions used for revocation). In one embodiment, the encoding of objects in XML need to be able to be validated against the application-specific XML schema. Additional possible constraints on these XML encodings can be found below.","In the example illustrated in this Appendix B, the base XML-Schema Type for all the DRM objects is OctopusObjectType. This means that all the objects support attributes and extensions. The type of each Octopus object element is derived from this base type. These types may aggregate other elements such as the SecretKey element for the ContentKeyType for instance.","In this example embodiment, the Scuba key distribution system keys are described in terms of an extension: the ScubaKeys element will then be a child of the extension element. The same applies for revocation keys with the Torpedo extension.","As described elsewhere herein, there are different kinds of Octopus Objects (e.g., ContentKey, Protector, Controller, Control, Node, and Link). These objects can be bundled together along with extensions using the <Bundle> element. In one embodiment, if objects or extensions are signed within the <Bundle>, the <Bundle> will contain <Signature> elements as described elsewhere herein.","Octopus XML Schema

(CBS) for objects is presented below and used, in preferred embodiments, in the calculation of digests for use digitally signing objects. This byte sequence is independent of the way the objects are represented or transmitted, thus enabling the same digest and signature values to be used throughout systems in which multiple encoding formats (e.g., XML, ANS1), programming languages, or the like are used.","1. Canonical Byte Sequence Algorithm","The canonical byte sequence algorithm consists of constructing sequences of bytes from value of fields. Each field has a value with a simple type or a compound type. Some fields can be specified to be optional (the field may be present or omitted).","In one embodiment, simple types are: integer, string, byte, and boolean.","Compound types consist of one or more sub-fields; each sub-field having a value with a simple or compound type. Compound types are either heterogeneous or homogenous, meaning that there are one or more sub-field values (simple or compound) of different types (i.e., heterogeneous), or that there are one or more sub-field values (simple or compound) all of the same type (homogeneous).","The canonical byte sequence of a field is obtained by applying the encoding rule to the field's value when the field is always present or the encoding rule for optional fields when the field is specified to be optional. In the following encoding rule descriptions, the term byte means an 8-bit value (octet):","1.1. Optional Fields","If an optional field is present, its value is serialized as the byte value 1 followed by the canonical byte sequence of the field value. If it is omitted, its value is serialized as the byte value 0.","1.2. Heterogeneous Compound","The canonical byte sequence is the concatenation of the canonical byte sequences of each sub-field value (optional fields are not skipped, but serialized according to the rule for optional fields).","1.3. Homogeneous Compound","The canonical byte sequence is the sub-field count, encoded as a sequence of 4 bytes in big-endian order, followed by the concatenation of each sub-field value's canonical byte sequence. If the sub-field count is 0, then nothing follows the 4-bytes field count (in this case, all 4 bytes have the value 0).","1.4.

For homogeneous compound types, the order of the elements is specified in the following paragraphs.\n\n","An object's \u201cattributes\u201d field is treated as an unnamed attribute of type \u201clist\u201d (it is an unsorted container of named attributes). Named attributes contained in the value of attributes of type \u201clist\u201d are sorted lexicographically by their \u201cname\u201d field.
