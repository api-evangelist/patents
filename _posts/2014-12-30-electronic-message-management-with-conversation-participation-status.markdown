title: Electronic message management with conversation participation status
abstract: Electronic message management with conversation participation status is enabled. Accordingly, time may be saved and lost productivity due to overload of messages may be reduced. Electronic conversations may be associated with a set of participants. Each participant may have a varying and/or changing level of interest in the conversation. Each participant may specify a conversation participation status and the conversation participation status and/or user status of each participant may be communicated and/or presented to each of the other participants. Messaging clients may change presentation of conversations and/or electronic messages for a participant based on the participant's specified conversation participation status. Participants sending messages may specify message status specific for each participant to alter treatment of message that would be based on participant status and/or conversation participation status when message is received by each participant.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Implementation Examples"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62\/044,042, filed Aug. 29, 2014, the full disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention relates generally to computer-facilitated communication and more particularly to electronic messaging with human-readable content.","Email has become a common tool with respect to business communication. Other types of electronic messages such as instant messages, text messages, and social networking posts are catching up fast. Email can be an efficient communication mechanism, for example, when sending a message to a limited or large number of recipients, who may be near the sender's work location or across the globe. The recipients of a message can then add further recipients to the communication, reply \u201cto all\u201d or to a few, and propagate these messages.","Unfortunately, the ease of using email can also make it into a nuisance. It is not uncommon that users receive hundreds of emails a week, some or even many of which they do not need to receive or have low relevance. By some estimates about 10% of employee time is being wasted in attending to unnecessary internal emails. In many cases, such emails cannot be filtered as effectively as external junk emails. With many email participants clicking the \u201creply-all\u201d button, the recipients of these emails can become victims of email overload.","Conventional attempts to address these issues are inefficient, ineffective and\/or have undesirable side effects or other drawbacks with respect to at least one significant use case.","For example, some electronic messaging management tools have functionality such as \u201ckill an email thread\u201d or \u201cmute an email thread.\u201d However the other participants of the conversation do not become aware when one or more of the recipients are ignoring the conversation. As another example, some electronic messaging management tools attempt to inform subsequent repliers when they attempt to send an email to someone who has unsubscribed to the thread. However, thread participants do not know such information unless they have opted to send an email. As yet another example, some electronic messaging management tools send emails to all participants when one of the participants \u201copts out\u201d from a message thread. However, this can actually create more traffic for the remaining participants, potentially causing more harm than good.","Embodiments of the invention are directed toward solving these and other problems individually and collectively.","The subject matter of embodiments of the present invention is described here with specificity to meet statutory requirements, but this description is not necessarily intended to limit the scope of the claims. The claimed subject matter may be embodied in other ways, may include different elements or steps, and may be used in conjunction with other existing or future technologies. This description should not be interpreted as implying any particular order or arrangement among or between various steps or elements except when the order of individual steps or arrangement of elements is explicitly described.","In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, electronic message management with conversation participation status is enabled. Utilizing methods, articles and systems in accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, time may be saved and lost productivity due to overload of messages may be reduced. Sets of electronic messages (e.g., email messages) may be identified as associated with an electronic conversation (e.g., by subject line or any suitable conversation identification technique). The electronic conversation (\u201cconversation\u201d) may then be associated with a set of participants. Each participant may have a varying and\/or changing level of interest in the conversation. In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, each participant may specify a conversation participation status, and the conversation participation status of each participant may be communicated and\/or presented to each or some of the other participants depending on security settings. Alternatively, or in addition, each conversation participant may specify a \u201cparticipant status\u201d such as \u201cbusy\u201d, \u201cdo not disturb\u201d or \u201cquiet mode\u201d, and the participant status of each participant may be likewise communicated and\/or presented to each or some of the other participants depending on security settings. As a further alternative, or further in addition, the conversation itself may have a status (\u201cconversation status\u201d) such as \u201cclosed\u201d, and the conversation status may be likewise communicated and\/or presented to each or some of the other participants depending on security settings. Participants may change their conversation participation status, participant status and\/or the conversation status from time to time and updated status may be communicated and\/or presented to each or some of the other participants depending on security settings. Messaging clients may change presentation of conversations and\/or electronic messages for a participant based on the participant's specified conversation participation status. Further, participants sending messages may be able to see conversation participation status and\/or participant status for each or some of the intended recipients and may be able to alter behavior of the message presentation for each or some of the recipients.","For example, a particular participant, Alice, may specify a \u201csideline\u201d status for a particular conversation. Information regarding Alice's new conversation participation status is provided to each other participant in the conversation: Bob, Carol, David. Bob, Carol and David are now aware that Alice is paying less immediate attention to the conversation. For example, Alice's messaging client may be configured to store messages associated with a sidelined conversation in a dedicated presentation grouping (e.g., a special purpose \u201csidelined\u201d email conversation folder) or weight associated messages lower as part of a relevance scoring algorithm. Alice may provide an indication of the reason for the conversation participation status change (e.g., freeform text such as \u201cCarol, will handle\u201d). Specifying a conversation participation status may be performed manually using one or more suitable user interface elements. Alternatively, or in addition, conversation participation status may be set according to rules specified by a participant and\/or an administrator (e.g., \u201cSideline conversation when email subject contains \u2018donuts\u2019\u201d). Further examples of conversation participation status types include redirected, withdrawn, and delegated, and are describe in more detail below. David may indicate that Alice's approval is needed in one of the messages during conversation and such a message may be treated differently, for example, sending to Alice's default inbox rather than moving it to a sidelined email conversation folder, so that Alice may see the message more readily.","Throughout this description \u201cemail\u201d is used to refer to electronic messages for clarity. However, any suitable type of electronic messages may be utilized including, but not limited to, text messages, social networking messages, photo sharing, and voice messages delivered electronically. Wherever the term \u201cemail\u201d is used, current and future electronic messages of various types may be substituted. Suitable electronic messages include messages received in an electronic inbox (sometimes called a virtual inbox) such as an email inbox, a wall such as used by Facebook, a voice message inbox, and a text messaging client. In addition, electronic messages are described throughout this description as being grouped into one or more \u201cfolders\u201d. However, any suitable type of email grouping mechanism may be utilized including, but not limited to, message tagging (e.g., messages with same tags are members of a corresponding group), message classification, message categorization, message grouping, message collections, message lists, message \u201cwalls\u201d and\/or \u201cwall\u201d posts, message streams, message channels, and message forums and sub-forums. Message groupings may be hierarchical and may be created, viewed, edited and deleted with user interface idioms and affordances corresponding to those for message folders such as \u201cdrag and drop\u201d idioms.","In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, lost productivity due to email overload, particularly from users' colleagues and\/or friends, may be reduced. These types of messages may not be filtered by junk mail filters, which typically target emails from bulk mailers, or relative strangers. Users are enabled to act on conversations rather than individual messages, to keep other selected participants of the messages in the know of what actions others have taken, and\/or to reduce proliferation of messages. Overload of messages received by users may be reduced and\/or made easier to find. Users are enabled to pay attention to messages more relevant to them, to experience less interruptions and loss of focus, to experience less lost opportunity costs due to fewer messages getting ignored, and\/or to reduce time wasted in waiting for someone's reply (e.g., due to reduced overload). In a work context, team and\/or employee morale may be enhanced, and increased job satisfaction may result.","At times, it is possible for an electronic messaging participant to assume that a person who should see a particular email is seeing it and to move on, when in fact the other person is buried under a lot of emails and doesn't see it in time, or has muted the conversation. In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, anyone looking at an email in the thread is enabled to readily see individuals currently ignoring an email thread (e.g., by \u201cgoing to sideline\u201d) as well as those who may not have read the email already, and\/or other suitable conversation participation states.","In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, electronic message management tools may provide one or more of the following features:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","106","108","110","112","102","104","106","110","112"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["202","202","204","206","208","210"]},"In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, a conversation participation status module  may maintain a conversation participation status for each participant of each conversation, as well as provide updates with respect to conversation participation status changes to conversation participants. Message processing procedures may differ based on conversation participation status and the conversation participation status module  may determine suitable non-default procedures for processing a message based on one or more associated conversation participation status types (e.g., via a simple mapping). Alternatively, or in addition, the messaging engine  may make processing decisions based on conversation participation status. Conversation participation status may be updated manually (e.g., via a suitable user interface) and\/or in accordance with specified rules. The rules may be stored in a rules datastore  and interpreted by a rules engine . Although the example depicted in  shows the conversation participation status module  incorporated into the messaging engine , each embodiment is not so limited. For example, the conversation participation status module  may be implemented as an external and\/or \u201cplug-in\u201d module that interacts with the messaging engine  utilizing one or more programmatic interfaces such as application programming interfaces (APIs). As with other components of the messaging server , some or all of the functionality of the conversation participation status module  may be distributed to, located and\/or implemented at the messaging clients , ,  ().","User preferences and user status may be stored in a user profile datastore . User profiles may also include security tokens and verifiable permissions data enabling access to conversation participation status modifications and viewing. Any suitable aspect of conversation participation status access may be subject to one or more permissions. Users may be arranged in a hierarchy and\/or groups with permissions configurable at hierarchy nodes and\/or at the group level.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["302","302","212","302","304","306","308","310","312","314","308","306","310","312","314","306","316","318","320","310","312","314"]},"The description now turns to example features in accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention. Aspects of such features may be better understood with reference to . Options and features maybe provided independent of each other and\/or in any suitable combination.","Sideline Feature","This feature may be used in cases such as these:\n\n","Other users may have ability to bring a user back into the conversation.","In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, when the sideline command is invoked, the user's intention may be saved in a database meant for this purpose, and the messages in users Inbox pertaining to the same conversation may be acted upon in one of several ways based on implementation configuration or preference of implementer. E.g. (a) move unread messages pertaining to conversation to a designated sideline folder, (b) move all messages pertaining to this conversation to a designated sideline folder, (c) filter the messages out by default, (d) move them to sideline tab, etc. Any subsequently received messages pertaining to the same conversation may be moved, hidden, tabulated, etc. in a consistent manner as long as user stays on sideline for the conversation.","In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, email clients used by other participants of the conversation may query the shared data store and may display the status of conversation participants being on sideline in multiple ways based on user interface designer's preference. E.g. one way to indicate this is to add B super script next to participant's name who has put the conversation on sideline, the participant address\/name may be struck out (e.g., \u201c\u201d), participant name\/address may have a specific background\/foreground color, may be in different font, and so on. Another way is to provide a command interface, so user can see detail information\u2014e.g., when user clicks on the button, user sees a table with all participants, their status, reasons, etc.","So as to enable participants to have latest information, sideline status may be refreshed responsive to messaging client events, for example, whenever user views or opens a message, whenever user chooses to respond to the message and starts composing it by clicking reply or reply-all, and when the user chooses to send it. If more users have put conversation on sideline between reply and send commands, the client may alert user of such change and ask if user wishes to proceed, or wishes to make any changes to address list\u2014such as include users gone on sideline. Alternatively, or in addition, sideline status may be refreshed periodically.","When a user chooses to go on sideline using appropriate user interface (click, touch, gesture, voice, etc.) a dialog may pop up, or other suitable user interface element may be presented, which may ask the user additional information to enhance functionality further. Such additional information may include:\n\n","System may provide option to place conversations to sideline automatically based on system wide configuration or user specific configuration.","System may put a conversation on sideline based on various configurable filters such as: how long user ignores conversation, how many messages were opened, if message is high priority, if message is not from list of important senders, if user is not on TO line in address list, etc.","For example one user can set up auto sideline filter like this: \u201cplace conversation automatically on sideline if I open just a couple of messages in the conversation in 30 minutes, but I have been opening other messages during this time.\u201d Another user may set up filter like this: \u201cplace conversation automatically on sideline if messages are not flagged important, conversations are not originated by anyone on my VIP list, and I am not on TO-List, and I have opened up to 2 messages in 30 minutes while I was actively using email.\u201d","System may run one or more sideline processes which may monitor user activity and automatically sense conversations that need to be put on backburner.","Messages that are put automatically on sideline may be distinguished from messages intentionally placed on backburner using a different icon, or letter. (e. g. auto sideline can be indicated as \u201c\u201d and intentional backburner may be indicated as \u201c\u201d).","Redirect Conversation Feature","This feature may be used in cases such as this: (a) upon receiving an email, user realizes that sender has picked his\/her email address by mistake, e.g. due to similarity in name, etc. (b) a user\u2014who is recently transferred to another department\u2014gets an email pertaining to his\/her old responsibility and wants to redirect the conversation, i.e., this email, other emails, and any future emails, (c) After a few email exchanges, the user realizes that there is another person more appropriate to handle the issue, and wishes to redirect the conversation to that person.","Upon invocation of command the system may allow user to select or enter one or more email addresses and click redirect. When the redirect command is executed, user's intention may be saved in a database meant for this purpose, and all messages in users Inbox pertaining to the same conversation may be forwarded to the selected email address(es)\u2014provided they are not part of the recipient yet. A standard text such as \u201cThis conversation is redirected to you by, etc.\u201d may be added in the forwarded message. Any messages received after this action may not be forwarded automatically, as senders of future messages may remove other participants intentionally.","Email clients used by other participants of the said conversation may be able to query the shared data store and may display the status of conversation participants who have redirected the message in multiple ways based on his or her preferences. E.g. the redirecting participant may have an R super script next to it, the redirecting participant addresses\/names may be struck out, redirected participant address\/name may have F superscript, (e.g. \u201c\u201d, \u201cuserf1@acme.com\u201d, \u201cuserf2@acme.com\u201d), participant name\/address may have a specific background\/foreground color, may be in different font, and so on.","Also, the client programs may automatically include redirected participants' addresses\/names. The responder may have a choice of controlling new participants by removing their names. Depending on implementation, care must be taken to also remove name of the user who has redirected the message so the message does not rebound to unintended participant. This may be achieved using any suitable technique including flagging the shared data store appropriately to stop rebounding, or by warning the sender of unintended consequence, etc. Furthermore, should another participant include a user who had redirected a conversation and has since been removed from the email conversation, the client software may indicate that the user they just added has opted to redirect the conversation to others. Email addresses\/names of redirected parties may be re-introduced in the list to let the person know who may receive messages.","Participants may be offered ways to bring the users who have redirected the conversation back into conversation (themselves, or others) using appropriate user interface device based on preferred implementation designed by subject matter experts. E.g. user may be able to right click or touch redirected participant name\/address to see a popup menu, and click on a command, an icon, etc. to remove redirection to bring user back into conversation. Such command may remove information from shared data store pertaining to redirection with appropriate information about who removed it.","To enable participants to have the latest information, redirect status may be refreshed responsive to messaging client events, for example, whenever a user opens a message, whenever the user chooses to respond to the message and starts composing it by clicking \u201cReply\u201d or \u201cReply all\u201d, and when the user chooses to send it. If more users have redirected conversation between reply and send commands, the client software may alert user of such change and provide the option to proceed or make any changes to address list. Some implementers may optionally refresh list periodically to increase correctness of address list.","When a user chooses to go on sideline using appropriate user interface (click, touch, gesture, voice, etc.) a dialog may pop up, or other suitable user interface element may be presented, which may ask the user additional information to enhance functionality further. Such additional information may include:\n\n","This feature may be used in cases similar to the ones for redirection need, but the recipient either does not know who to redirect the message, or concludes that all people who he could have redirected the messages to are already included in address list.","Upon invocation of command, user's intention may be saved in a database meant for this purpose, and all messages in users Inbox pertaining to the same conversation may be moved to a folder designated for such purpose. Any messages received after this action may also be moved to the same folder, as long as the user's withdrawn status is not removed by any of the participants from the shared data store.","The message moving part of this feature may be implemented in client software, or middleware software, or email server, or by an independent program, which runs periodically to detect these situations.","Email clients used by other participants of the said conversation may be able to query the shared data store and may display the withdrawn status to other participants in multiple ways based on user interface designer's preference. E.g. the participant may have an W super script next to it, the participant addresses\/names may be struck out, (e.g. \u201c\u201d) participant name\/address may have a specific background\/foreground color, may be in different font, and so on.","Also, the client programs may automatically exclude withdrawn participants' email addresses\/names. Furthermore, should another participant include a user who had withdrawn from the conversation and has since been removed from the email address list, the client software may indicate that the user they just added has opted to withdraw the conversation in a manner consistent as when users name was not removed from address list.","Participants may be offered ways to bring the users who have withdrawn from the conversation back into a conversation (themselves, or others) using appropriate user interface device, based on preferred implementation designed by subject matter experts. Undoing withdrawal needs an \u201cAdd\u201d feature described next, because there may be several email messages not carrying the added user's email address, and the user may miss part of conversation if participants keep using reply all to messages that do not have this user's email address.","So as to enable participants to have the latest information, withdraw status may be refreshed responsive to messaging client events, for example, whenever user opens a message, whenever user chooses to respond to the message and starts composing it by clicking reply or reply-all, and when the user chooses to send it. If more users have withdrawn conversation between reply and send commands, the client software may alert user of such change and ask if user wishes to proceed, or wishes to make any changes to address list. Some implementers may optionally refresh list periodically to increase correctness of address list.","When a user chooses to go on withdraw from a conversation using appropriate user interface (click, touch, gesture, voice, etc.) a dialog may pop up, or other suitable user interface element may be presented, which may ask the user additional information to enhance functionality further. Such additional information may include:\n\n","This feature may be used in cases such as this: (a) upon receiving an email, or after a few email exchanges, a participant realizes that sender has not included some other participants.","In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, this feature works differently than the currently available features of just forwarding an email to the new user, or including a new user in one's reply-all. For example, these conventional techniques can cause new participant to potentially miss future emails in the conversation. This is because other users may reply-all to an old email in the thread, which does not have new participant's address in the address list. With new participant's address added in shared data store, the email client software can include a new user in the address list by referring to shared data store.","Also, with this feature when users are added, they may get an email without other users seeing \u201csharing . . . \u201d type of email reducing emails received by old participants.","Upon invocation of command the system may allow user to select or enter one more email addresses and invoke the add command. Following the execution, user's intention may be saved in a database meant for this purpose, and all messages in users Inbox pertaining to the same conversation may be forwarded to the selected email address(es)\u2014provided the users are already not on the email list for such messages. A standard text such as \u201cYou were added to this conversation, etc.\u201d may be added in the forwarded message.","In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, any messages received after this action are not forwarded automatically, as sender may have intentionally removed these participants.","The shared data store may record particular message ids, and new users who were added to conversation. This may be used by client programs to display who were sent which messages from conversation because of this feature, as assumption cannot be made that all messages from conversation may be sent to the new user as described in discussion about how reply-all should work in accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention.","Email clients used by other participants of said conversation may be able to query the shared data store and\u2014based on designer's preference\u2014may display new users who were added to the conversation, even though the email headers may not have the new user listed. This may let other users who wish to add same new participants know that they have been already added. E.g. newly added participant address\/name may have \u201cA\u201d superscript, (e.g. \u201cusera1@acme.com\u201d, \u201cusera2@acme.com\u201d), participant name\/address may have a specific background\/foreground color, may be in different font, and so on.","In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, when a user invokes reply-all, the newly added users which are not included in the email headers for recipient lists should be included and such inclusion should be high-lighted\u2014so that the sender would have opportunity to remove any users he\/she does not want to send new message to.","So as to enable participants to have latest information, recipient lists may be refreshed responsive to messaging client events, for example, whenever a user opens a message, whenever user chooses to reply-all to the message, and when the user chooses to send it. Some implementers may optionally refresh lists periodically during a long compose time to increase correctness of recipient list.","When a user chooses this action a dialog may pop up, or other suitable user interface element may be presented, which may ask the user additional information to enhance functionality further. Such additional information may include:\n\n","This feature may be used in cases such as this:\n\n","When the \u201cre-invite to conversation\u201d command is invoked, this information may remove or invalidate user's state in the shared data store with regards to the present conversation. Consequently the program modules, which would have filtered or moved any messages related to conversation based on user's state in shared data store.","All participants may be offered ways to bring the users back into conversation (by themselves, or by others) using appropriate user interface device based on preferred implementation designed by subject matter experts. E.g. user may be able to right click or touch sideline participant's address in the recipient list to see a popup menu, and click on a command, an icon, etc. to bring user back into conversation.","When a user chooses to go on sideline using appropriate user interface (click, touch, gesture, voice, etc.) a dialog may pop up, or other suitable user interface element may be presented, which may ask the user additional information to enhance functionality further. Such additional information may include:\n\n","This feature may save time for many users by removing messages related to conversations that are saved from inbox when conversations are closed. Such feature may be of particular help for users who come back to their email after an extended period\u2014say after a couple of days of business trip or a week of vacation\u2014because many of the messages that are no longer relevant may be already moved away, or filtered out from inbox view.","Upon invocation of command by one of the participants, \u201cclose conversation\u201d command is executed and user's intention may be saved in a database meant for this purpose.","The feature can be implemented in multiple manners. Some examples are: An email client program may poll the shared data store every so often to see if any conversations are closed and then move all closed conversations to designated folder. Alternatively, messages may be left in the same folder, but may be hidden from inbox view unless the user asks for them. Instead of implementing in email client, the program may be implemented in middleware\u2014the middleware\u2014when asked to refresh inbox may do moving of messages to designated folder, or filtering of messages. The same may be done in email server program as well.","Additional features may include:\n\n","This feature may allow participants to reopen a conversation, if it is closed by mistake, or if one of the participants does not agree with closing the conversation.","A user may be able to locate the closed conversation list, or look at conversation-closed message and invoke a command to reopen conversation.","The feature may be implemented in multiple manners. Some examples are: An email client program may poll the shared data store every so often to see if any conversations are reopened and if the closed messages are stored in a designated folder, they may be moved back to inbox, or if they were hidden from in box with a filter, they may no longer be hidden, etc. Instead of implementing in email client, the program may be implemented in middleware\u2014the middleware, or email server. The implementation architecture can be decided by the architect experienced in the knowledge of art based on various factors suitable for the implementing team.","Additional features may include:\n\n","Features exist to flag conversations as important for one, or for marking messages as important when one sends an email. The deficiencies noted in these instances are: (a) after message is sent, you cannot change priority\u2014unless you resend message, (b) you cannot selectively make conversation high priority for some of the participants. (c) you cannot assign priority ranking so as to sort conversations.","This feature may allow users to mark messages with priority ranking, so the messages may be sorted by priority order. If messages arrive marked as high priority, but one of the users as one of the participants does not feel it is important for his or her purpose, user may opt to lower priority.","A manager, or triage person may also use this feature to elevate priority of conversations for selected participants.","The feature may also allow rules to define priority. For example, a user may set up rule as: if my manager has decided a conversation is high priority, and if I am on the to-list, make conversation high priority for me, too.","Users may be allowed to invoke command by using suitable user interface such as, touch the addressee in recipient list, or right click on the addressee and then select \u201cset priority\u201d and enter or pick a number. Interface may be defined in multiple other ways based on designer's preference. Upon invoking such command, the priority may be stored in shared data store, and may be available for others to see.","Additional features may include:\n\n","Continuously arriving emails can cause disruption of work. Many people cannot easily ignore emails trickling in their Inbox. Switching between non-urgent email, and other work can waste time unnecessarily. This feature may allow users to setup \u201cQuiet time\u201d for themselves, or system wide Quiet times. This feature may stop any non-urgent emails during this period. Alternatively, or in addition, a user may \u201cfine tune\u201d the types of messages that may be received during a quiet period, for example, utilizing quite period exception rules.","A user may be able to set Quiet time in a manner similar to calendar feature offered by most email clients. The client may not poll email server during the time period marked as Quiet.","Additional features may include:\n\n","Many people are in habit of replying to all without checking the TO and CC lists carefully. In addition, as this invention allows participants to go on sideline, or to withdraw, there is a risk that a sender may not realize the participants they are addressing are not going to receive the message. This feature may provide senders opportunity to review recipient list, their current status and adjust it appropriately.","When a user chooses to send a message, a notification may be presented to the sender\u2014for example a popup window. Notification may have a list of participants, depending on which features are implemented in the embodiment\u2014their current status pertaining to conversation, for example, information about whether they are on sideline, or have withdrawn, redirected it, etc. The information about whether participants are currently in quiet mode may also be presented (if implemented).","The sender may be offered features to re-invite participants who are not participating currently, and selectively mark messages for particular participants, to override participants' status and deliver this particular message in their inbox irrespective of conversation participation status.","Sender's Checklist Feature","Many people are in habit of replying to all without checking the TO and CC lists carefully.
