Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an optical submarine communication system, and more particularly to an optical submarine communication system comprising a terminal apparatus installed on land for transmitting an optical signal and electric power, a land cable connected to the terminal apparatus, an optical submarine cable connected to the land cable and including an optical fiber and a feeder line for respectively transmitting the optical signal and the electric power from the terminal apparatus, and a repeater connected to the optical submarine cable, driven with the transmitted electric power and amplifying the optical signal, wherein a surge generated from the land cable side because of a lightning stroke or an insulation failure, is suppressed to prevent damaging the repeater.","2. Description of the Related Art",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 20","FIGS. 19 and 20"],"b":["1","2","1","3","2","4","1","5","3","6","3"]},"The terminal apparatus  is provided with a surge protective device (not shown) and cable grounding to earth at the terminal apparatus  itself. Such an arrangement protects internal units of the terminal apparatus  against a surge caused when an induction current is generated due to a lightning stroke on a cable and enters the cable. Also, with the above arrangement, a surge generated due to a lightning stroke just on the terminal apparatus  or thereabout or with disconnection or an equipment failure occurred in the terminal apparatus , is suppressed from entering the land cable .","In such a conventional optical submarine communication system, the distance from the seashore to the terminal apparatus  is relatively short (about 2 km) and therefore the length of the land cable  is also short. As a recent tendency, however, a longer-distance optical submarine communication system is installed and the length of a land cable is increased (over 20 km) as practiced, for example, in the Denmark station of the optical submarine cable system TAT-14 installed by KDDI-SCS. The longer distance of the land cable  increases the area in which the land cable  may suffer from the adverse effect of a lightning stroke. This results in more frequent surge entering the land cable .","Further, when the land cable  is relatively short, a surge protective device (not shown) provided in the terminal apparatus  and cable grounding to earth at the terminal apparatus  itself are also effective in suppressing a surge occurring in the land cable . With an increased distance of the land cable , however, it is inevitable that some part of the land cable  exists outside the range over which a surge is suppressive. This raises a problem in that when a surge caused on the long-distance land cable  because of a lightning stroke or disconnection, is going to reach the repeater , the surge cannot be suppressed by the surge protective device and the cable grounding at the terminal apparatus .","Moreover, it has been thought in the past that grounding the land cable  at a portion thereof is effective in suppressing a surge and the object intended by the grounding is sufficiently fulfilled. Such grounding is surely effective in suppressing a surge, but the grounding point also becomes a point through which a surge enters. The reason is that a lightning stroke on the land cable near the grounding point causes a lightning current to flow into the land cable through the grounding point and increases a grounding potential. The increased grounding potential gives rise to a surge voltage in the land cable. Accordingly, this raises a problem in that a satisfactory surge suppressing means cannot be obtained simply by grounding the land cable.","Usually, a surge protective device (not shown) is also provided in the repeater . However, since such a surge protective device is provided to prevent a surge from passing a path including the surge protective device and from reaching a main circuit of the repeater , it does not have the function of attenuating or suppressing the surge. This has raised a problem that a surge is shut off from one repeater, but is allowed to propagate toward another repeater. Although the surge is eventually attenuated with resistance of the cable, there is a possibility that a high-voltage surge may propagate until it is attenuated.","Thus, a problem has been experienced in that a surge generated in the long-distance land cable  because of a lightning stroke or an insulation failure, may propagate to the repeater  on the sea bottom through the feeder lines of the land cable  and the optical submarine cable , and may damage devices inside an amplifier provided in the repeater .","With the view of solving the problem set forth above, it is an object of the present invention to provide an optical submarine communication system in which a surge generated from the land cable side because of a lightning stroke or an insulation failure, can be suppressed from damaging a repeater.","According to the present invention, in an optical submarine communication system comprising a land cable connected to a terminal apparatus, which is installed on land for transmitting an optical signal and electric power, an optical submarine cable including an optical fiber and a feeder line for respectively transmitting the optical signal and the electric power from the terminal apparatus, and a repeater connected to the optical submarine cable, driven with the transmitted electric power and amplifying the optical signal, the system further comprises a surge suppressing unit provided between the terminal apparatus and the repeater and suppressing a surge generated on the terminal apparatus side from reaching the repeater. With such an arrangement, even when a surge is generated in the land cable between the terminal apparatus and the surge suppressing unit because of a lightning stroke or an insulation failure, the surge is attenuated by the surge suppressing unit. As a result, a surge generated in the long-distance land cable because of a lightning stroke or an insulation failure, can be suppressed from propagating to the repeater on the sea bottom through the feeder lines of the land cable and the optical submarine cable, and hence can be avoided from damaging devices inside an amplifier provided in the repeater.","The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["1","2","1","4","2","7"]},"Numeral  denotes an optical submarine cable connected to the land cable  through the beach manhole  and including an optical fiber and a feeder line for respectively transmitting the optical signal and the electric power from the terminal apparatus .

An installation position of the surge suppressor  is optionally selectable. In one case, the surge suppressor  is provided in the land cable  as shown in , whereas in the other case, it is provided in the optical submarine cable  as shown in . In either case, even when a surge due to a lightning stroke or an insulation failure, is generated in the land cable  between the terminal apparatus  and the surge suppressor , the generated surge is attenuated by the surge suppressor . Therefore, the surge generated in the long-distance land cable  because of a lightning stroke or an insulation failure, can be suppressed from propagating to the repeater  on the sea bottom through the feeder lines of the land cable  and the optical submarine cable , and hence can be avoided from damaging devices inside an amplifier provided in the repeater .","Further, in the case of providing the surge suppressor  in the land cable , installation works and inspection\/maintenance operations are easier to carry out than in the case of providing the surge suppressor  in the optical submarine cable . Also, requirements for high reliability of the devices in the surge suppressor  provided on the land are not so strict as compared with the cases of the devices in the surge suppressor  provided in the sea.","Moreover, providing the surge suppressor  in the optical submarine cable  is superior to providing the surge suppressor  in the land cable  in that, while special works are required to obtain satisfactorily small grounding resistance for the surge suppressor  when the latter is provided on the land, works for reducing grounding resistance are not required when the surge suppressor  is submerged, because in such a case the surge suppressor  is surrounded by the seawater.","In addition, since the terminal apparatus  is provided with a surge protective device (not shown) and cable grounding to earth at the terminal apparatus  itself, internal units of the terminal apparatus  are protected against a surge caused when an induction current is generated due to a lightning stroke on a cable and enters the cable. Also, a surge generated due to a lightning stroke just on the terminal apparatus  or thereabout or with disconnection or an equipment failure occurred in the terminal apparatus  is suppressed from entering the land cable .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["4","2","3"]},"By providing the surge suppressor  in the beach manhole  for connection to both the land cable  and the optical submarine cable , even when a surge due to a lightning stroke or an insulation failure, is generated in the land cable  between the terminal apparatus  and the surge suppressor , the generated surge is attenuated by the surge suppressor . Therefore, the surge generated in the long-distance land cable  because of a lightning stroke or an insulation failure, can be suppressed from propagating to the repeater  on the sea bottom through the feeder lines of the land cable  and the optical submarine cable , and hence can be avoided from damaging devices inside an amplifier provided in the repeater .","Also, with the arrangement that the surge suppressor  is connected to both the land cable  and the optical submarine cable  at the beach manhole  that serves as a junction between both the cables, the surge suppressor  can be installed without requiring the land cable  and the optical submarine cable  to be cut at intermediate portions thereof. Accordingly, the surge suppressor  can easily be installed when, for example, it is applied to an existing optical submarine communication system.","Furthermore, when grounding the surge suppressor  at the beach manhole , the ground around the beach manhole  contains a certain amount of seawater because the beach manhole  is provided on the seashore. Thus, the ground has relatively low resistance and hence satisfactory grounding resistance can be obtained with simple grounding works.","Incidentally, when the surge suppressor  is inserted in the land cable , a risk remains that a surge due to a lightning stroke may enter the land cable in its part extending from the installation position of the surge suppressor  to the seashore. For a cable portion extended from the beach manhole , however, since the beach manhole  is provided near the sea, a possibility that the surge may enter the cable is low.","A surge suppressor according to a third preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described below. To enable locating of a cut point in the event of an accidental cutting of a cable, the distance from a measuring point to the cut point is determined by sending a count signal with frequency of not more than 50 Hz and measuring the time required for the count signal to go to and return from the cut point after reflection. The surge suppressor of this embodiment is constructed not to attenuate any signal of not more than 50 Hz so that the count signal is allowed to pass the surge suppressor. The surge suppressor includes a filter for attenuating components with frequencies of not less than 50 Hz, while allowing components with frequencies higher than 50 Hz to pass the filter. By employing a cable system, in which at least a feed current has basic frequency of not more than 50 Hz, in an optical submarine communication system provided with the surge suppressor of this embodiment, a control signal, etc. can be transmitted through a feeder line.","A surge suppressor according to a fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described below. When a surge wave is generated between the terminal apparatus  and the surge suppressor  that is constituted by a low-pass filter using, e.g., a reactor as described later, the generated surge wave propagates in opposite directions toward the terminal apparatus  and the surge suppressor  and is then reflected by the terminal apparatus  and the surge suppressor . The surge wave is attenuated while it is propagating through the land cable .","When the distance between the terminal apparatus  and the surge suppressor  is relatively short, an amount by which the surge wave is attenuated is so small that the surge wave reciprocally propagates with repeated reflections, thus resulting in a standing state. Of frequency components of the surge wave, in particular, a component resonating with the line length becomes a standing wave. Further, the standing waves created by surges propagating in the opposite directions intensify each other in some cases. Depending on the magnitude of those standing waves, a surge wave having a relatively low frequency component, which still has large energy even after being suppressed by the surge suppressor , may propagate to the repeater .","Assuming that the attenuation constant of the land cable  is \u03b1, the surge suppressor  according to the fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention is provided in a position at which a length L of the land cable  between the terminal apparatus  and the surge suppressor  exceeds 1\/\u03b1. Therefore, even when a surge wave is generated between the terminal apparatus  and the surge suppressor , the generated surge wave is attenuated to 1\/e (e is the base of a natural logarithm) while it is propagating. As a result, the magnitude of the standing waves generated by reciprocal propagations with repeated reflections can be reduced to suppress an adverse effect against the repeater  on the sea bottom. In addition, an adverse effect on both the terminal apparatus  and the surge suppressor  caused by the standing waves can also be suppressed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["7","1","5","2","3","7","11","7","2","3"]},"With such an arrangement, a surge generated in the long-distance land cable  because of a lightning stroke or an insulation failure, can be suppressed from propagating to the repeater  on the sea bottom through the feeder lines of the land cable  and the optical submarine cable , and hence can be avoided from damaging devices inside an amplifier provided in the repeater .
