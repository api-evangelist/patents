{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is based on an application No. 2008-001519 filed in Japan, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an image forming device, and particularly relates to the image forming device in which an input of a password is requested to a user when executing a processing, and according to the inputted password, prescribed processing is executed.","2. Description of the Related Art","Along with a development of a network technology of recent years, an image forming device, for example, a digital multifunction peripheral has been utilized in such a manner as being shared by a plurality of users connected by a network in many cases. Here, the digital multifunction peripheral (MultiFunction Peripheral (MFP), Scan Print Copy (SPC), or All In one (AIO)) indicates the image forming device having at least two or more functions of a copier, a printer, a scanner, facsimile equipment, and so forth.","When an instruction of image forming processing is given to the digital multifunction peripheral (called simply multifunction peripheral hereafter), the user inputs the instruction to the multifunction peripheral body first hand and gives the instruction of processing for executing the multifunction peripheral by using an apparatus connected to the multifunction peripheral via the network and located away from the multifunction peripheral body.","Therefore, when a document is printed on a paper medium, etc, by the multifunction peripheral based on the instruction received from the user, a following problem may arise. That is, an outputted printed matter is left on a paper eject tray of the multifunction peripheral and exposed to human eyes. In such a case, there is a possibility that the printed matter is unexpectedly handed to an outsider. Such an event is a problem from a viewpoint of ensuring security of information.","JP 2005-51796 A discloses an image forming device capable of solving the aforementioned problem of ensuring security. By this image forming device, it is possible to realize a security management against leakage and storage of the information accumulated in a storage device.","This image forming device includes a section that sets a password for created image information, and a section that requests an input of the password when the instruction of printing and deleting the image information is inputted.","With this structure, the image forming device prevents the accumulated image information from being leaked and being unintentionally erased.","JP 2003-145889 A also discloses an image forming device. Even when a printout instruction is given by inputting a true password, this image forming device requests the input of the password for starting printout to the user again, in consideration of a waiting time until a resultant matter of this print processing is outputted from the printer. Therefore, when the image information for printout is inputted in the image forming device, this image forming device inhibits the printout of this information, until the password for starting printout is inputted.","This image forming device can be set so that the printout is not started until the password for starting the printout is inputted by the user, thus making it possible to collect a printed matter without allowing an outsider to peek at this printed matter.","Thus, it is a generally performed event to set the password to ensure the security of the printed matter.","However, in the aforementioned conventional image forming device, in order to make this apparatus execute a job such as copying and printing, a user must input a password to the image forming device after giving instruction of executing the job to the image forming device. Further, when a plurality of passwords are set in each page of the document, for example, to execute the job, the image forming device temporarily suspends the execution of the job every time the setting of the password is recognized until this job is completed, and requests input of the password to the user. Then, the user inputs the password every time the request is received. Accordingly, in the aforementioned image forming device, when at least one password is set for the job, the execution of the job is temporarily suspended at least once, and the input of the password by the user is awaited. This suspension duration prolongs duration from giving instruction of executing the job up to completion of this job, compared with a case in which the password is not set at all.","Therefore, duration required for holding the data related to one job in the data storage area of the image forming device is also prolonged. Accordingly, from the viewpoint of designing the image forming device, some measures are necessary, such as making the data storage area of the image forming device larger than prior art.","In addition, in the aforementioned conventional image forming device, for example, when the password is set in each page of the printout document including plural pages, or when the password is set in each one of a plurality of printout documents, the duration from giving instruction of executing the job up to completion of the job is more prolonged as the number of passwords to be inputted is increased. In such a circumstance, from the viewpoint of the user, it is desired that duration from sending a job execution instruction to the image forming device by the user, up to completion of the job is shortened to be similar to that of the case in which the password is not set at all, thus improving productivity of an image forming work in an office, etc.","An object of the present invention is to provide the image forming device capable of suppressing consumption of a hardware resource, particularly capable of suppressing occupancy of the data storage area such as a working memory to minimum, and improving the productivity of the image forming work, while ensuring the security equivalent to that of a conventional image forming device.","First aspect of the present invention is an image forming device that executes a job, being prescribed processing for image data of a document having page divisions, with execution of this job limited by a password set in an arbitrary page of the document. The image forming device includes: an image data input unit that sequentially receives the image data of the document in each page division; a set password acquisition unit that acquires set password information that is information regarding a set password from the image data of each page division received by the image data input unit; an input password receiving unit that starts reception of input of the password for canceling execution limit of the job by set password information acquired by the password acquisition unit, before the reception of the image data of all pages of the document is completed by the image data input unit; a password verification unit that performs verification between the password received by the input password receiving unit and the set password acquired by the set password acquisition unit; and a job execution unit that executes the job by using the image data by canceling the execution limit of the job limited by the set password information based on a verification result of the password verification unit, wherein, when the password is set in an arbitrary one page of the document and execution of the job is limited by the job execution unit, the image data input unit sequentially completes the reception of the image data of the next page of the arbitrary one page of the document even in a state in which the input password receiving unit does not receive the input of the password corresponding to the password set in the arbitrary one page.","Second aspect of the present invention is an image forming method in an image forming device that executes a job, being prescribed processing for image data of a document having page divisions, with execution of this job limited by a password set in an arbitrary page of the document. The image forming method includes: sequentially receiving the image data of the document in each page division; acquiring set password information that is information regarding a set password from the image data of each page division received in the receiving step; starting reception of input of the password for canceling execution limit of the job by the set password information acquired in the acquiring step, before the reception of the image data of all pages of the document is completed in the receiving; performing verification between a password received in the step of receiving the input of the password, and a set password acquired in the acquiring; and executing the job by using the image data by canceling the execution limit of the job limited by the set password information, based on a verification result in the performing verification, wherein, when the password is set in arbitrary one page of the document and the execution of the job is limited by the job execution unit, the reception of the image data of the next page of the arbitrary one page of the document is sequentially completed in the receiving the image data, even in a state in which the input of the password corresponding to the password set in the arbitrary one page is not received in the step of receiving the input of the password.","Third aspect of the present invention is a computer-readable medium storing a program that makes a computer execute image formation, the computer constituting an image forming device that executes a job, being prescribed processing for image data of a document having page divisions, with execution of this job limited by a password set in an arbitrary page of the document. The program includes: code that sequentially receives the image data of the document in each page division, by using an image data input unit; code that acquires set password information that is information regarding a set password, from the image data of each page division received by the image data input unit by using a set password acquisition unit; code that starts reception of input of a password for canceling execution limit of the job by set password information acquired by the password acquisition unit, before the reception of the image data of all pages of the document is completed by the image data input unit; code that performs password verification by using a password verification unit, between the password received by the input password receiving unit and the set password acquired by the password acquisition unit; and code that cancels the execution limit of the job limited by the set password information and executes the job by using the image data based on a verification result of the password verification unit, wherein, when the password is set in the arbitrary one page of the document and the execution of the job by the job execution unit is limited, the reception of the image data of the next page of the arbitrary one page of the document is completed by the image data input unit, even in a state of not receiving the input of the password corresponding to the password set in the arbitrary one page by the input password receiving unit.","In order to ensure the security, the image forming device of the present invention is capable of setting the password for the job such as the printout, and capable of starting the printout or the like after the input of this password is confirmed. Therefore, the image forming device of the present invention is a preferable image forming device from the viewpoint of ensuring the security. Further, it is possible to shorten the duration from the input of the password by the user up to completion of the printout than the above-described prior art image forming device.

This password can be set in each page of the document including this image data or in an entire body of the document. Upon executing the job, the MFP  can interrupt the execution of the job protected by the password as described above, until the password is inputted from the outside.

In this case, the controller  can recognize the time from starting the reception process of the input of the password by the password receiving unit , up to the time when the input of the password is actually received. Then, when a prescribed time is elapsed from starting the reception process of the input of the password, the MFP  can perform processing such as discarding all image data necessary for executing the job, for example all image data received by the image data input unit.","For example, when the job execution instruction such as duplication of a paper medium original including plural pages is received, the MFP  according to the embodiment of the present invention starts to capture the image data of the page constituting this original. The capture of the data is performed by photoelectrically reading each page of the original by the scanner unit , and generating the image data. In parallel to capturing operation of the image data of each page, the MFP  performs operation of acquiring the password set in the image data of each page (set password), reception of the password inputted by the user (input password), and verification between the set password and the input password. In the MFP , generation of the sequentially generated image data is awaited, and then the operation of acquiring the set password is executed, based on this generated image data. However, both operations are simultaneously independently executed without influenced by mutual progress status. Similarly, the acquisition of the set password is awaited, and then the operation of reception of the input password and password verification is executed, based on this acquired set password. However, this operation may be also executed simultaneously independently of the aforementioned two operations. Therefore, in this MFP , irrespective of each progress of the processing of acquiring the set password, the processing of receiving the input password, and the processing of performing verification between the set password and the input password, the capture of all pages of the original constituting a confidential document printed matter can be completed. Accordingly, even when the password (input password) corresponding to the password (set password) set in arbitrary one page of the previously captured confidential document printed matter is not inputted by the user, capture of the successive original pages included in the confidential document printed matter is performed without suspending the capture of the original and the operation of generating the image data, and generation of the image data of all original pages can be completed. In this embodiment, although the capture of the image data is explained, with photoelectrical reading of the paper medium by the scanner unit  given as an example, the present invention is not limited thereto.","With this structure, in the MFP  according to the embodiment of the present invention, even when executing the job whose security is ensured by the password, the time occupied by this job can be suppressed to minimum for the hardware resource such as a memory (for example, RAM  ()). Also, when viewed from a user side, in the MFP  according to the embodiment of the present invention, the password can be inputted during capturing operation, simultaneously with the capture of the image data. This makes it possible to improve usability.","The processing for executing the job by the MFP  will be explained hereafter.","Hereafter, explanation will be given for a flow of the processing (so-called copy job) of the MFP , such as reading the confidential document printed matter protected by the password by the scanner unit , then generating the image data and outputting this image data from the printer unit . In this explanation, the copy job performed to the document of plural pages collectively placed on a document feeder  is regarded as one copy job. Namely, the image of the original including plural pages collectively placed on the document feeder  is the image necessary for executing this one copy job.","First, the confidential document printed matter will be explained. The confidential document printed matter is the document having the form of the printed matter printed on the paper medium, and is the printed matter to which at least one page of the plural pages constituting the document is added (embedded) with the information (confidential document information) for ensuring the security, as additional data. , , and  are example diagrams of such a confidential document printed matter. In the aforementioned , a confidential document printed matter  is shown as if it includes only one page. However, the confidential document printed matter may be the printed matter including plural pages, and in these plural pages, confidential document information may be embedded in arbitrary plural pages.  is an example diagram of the confidential document printed matter  embedded with the confidential document information as a barcode .  is an example diagram of the confidential document printed matter  embedded with the confidential information as a background pattern .  is an example diagram of the confidential document printed matter  embedded with the confidential document information as an IC tag (IC chip) . Thus, the confidential document information can be embedded in the printed matter of the confidential document by means of the barcode , etc. When the confidential document information is embedded in the confidential document printed matter as the barcode  and the background pattern , the scanner unit  can scan the barcode, etc, indicating the confidential document information, by performing a normal photoelectrical image reading. When the confidential document information is embedded in the printed matter of the confidential document as the IC tag , the MFP  may include a sensor capable of electromagnetically reading the data stored in the IC tag , separately from the scanner unit .","Note that the confidential document information itself may be embedded in the printed matter of the confidential document in a method shown in , , and . However, as an alternative method, it is also possible that only the information such as ID number, etc, is converted to data and is embedded in the printed matter of the confidential document as the barcode, etc, and the confidential document information is held in the MFP  or other device, and based on the ID number, the MFP  acquires the confidential document information.","Next, the confidential document information will be explained.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0107"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["95","23","1","95","23"]},"The information (confidential document information) regarding the document can include:","created date indicating the date and time when the document is created;","document creator information indicating who creates the document;","administrator information indicating who manages the MFP ;","password information indicating the password (set password) set in the document;","original location information indicating a location (storage location) of an original data file of the document;","restriction information indicating a limitation such as processing applied to the document; and","disagreement processing information indicating the processing in a case of the password disagreement, and so forth.","The document creator information includes the name and E-mail address of the document creator.

Note that the restriction information may also be held in the MFP .","Disagreement processing information includes the information for designating the processing in a case where the password inputted by the user (input password) is not matched with the password indicated by the password information (set password). This processing can include processing contents such as prompting the re-input of the password, notifying the documents creator or the administrator by the e-mail or log, discarding the job concerning the password disagreement, discarding the page concerning the password disagreement, and performing output of blank paper\/solid paper\/repression characters.","Note that it is also possible that the restriction information and the disagreement processing information are not embedded in the confidential document printed matter but held in the MFP .","Next, based on , brief explanation will be given for a program executed in a computer of the MFP  according to the present invention. As shown in , an image forming program according to the present invention has three routines and for example, is held in the RAM  (or ROM  (both of them are shown in )). This program has an original reading routine , a set password acquisition routine , and a password input and verifying routines .
