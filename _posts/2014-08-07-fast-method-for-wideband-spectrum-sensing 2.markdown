Cognitive radar\/radio systems can be configured dynamically so as to use the best channels in its vicinity to minimize interference. Spectrum sensing is a technique employed by cognitive radio and radar to monitor the RF spectrum for channel availability and the activity of the primary user, i.e. the licensed user. It is a highly valued asset to increase spectrum utilization for cognitive radar and radio. Spectrum utilization is a key issue for radars and radios due to \u201ccluttered\u201d electromagnetic environments (EME), i.e., a growing problem for ground-based and airborne radar systems that need to operate simultaneously without interfering with other radar, communication and electronic warfare systems.","Several known multiband energy detection techniques exist for spectrum sensing include: 1) strategies to reduce computational complexity and minimize spectral leakage; and 2) multiband joint detection techniques that simultaneously detect signal energy over multiple non-overlapping channels. These techniques, however, only consider the energy at a single frequency and do not consider the surrounding energy near a frequency.","This problem is becoming more critical as the frequency spectrum available for radars and radios shrinks due to growing wireless communication device usage and spectrum management regulations And this problem is further exacerbated for radar by the growing number of targets of interest (TOI), whose radar response can vary greatly with frequency; radars thus must adapt to these TOIs while utilizing unoccupied frequency bands.","Embodiments of the present invention relate cognitive radar and RF technologies, and more particularly, to spectrum sensing processing for rapidly monitoring the RF spectrum for channel availability and activity. The goal of the processing is to find and use unoccupied RF channels to broadcast and receive information. This technology addresses current RF and radar system challenges posed by increasingly cluttered EME.","According to one embodiment, a method for analyzing a received RF signal to determine unused channels, or frequencies, therein, comprises: analyzing a received RF signal to determine anchor points that represent high energy frequency locations; calculating distances between the determined anchor points; identifying and eliminating clusters or isolated anchor points defined as a high energy region of interference based on the calculated distances; and selecting at least one remaining unoccupied frequency for transmitting or receiving a RF signal.","The method may be executed such that (i) any unused determined frequency is substantially devoid of noise; and\/or (ii) the surrounding energy of the unused determined frequency is minimal. Prior to determining anchor points, (i) time-domain data of the received RF signal is converted to the frequency domain via the fast Fourier transform (FFT); and (ii) energy estimates are determined for the frequency domain samples. Anchor points may be determined using a binary hypothesis test in some embodiments.","The method may further include performing a quality or risk assessment on remaining frequencies. Risk can be assessed by: defining a guard band to provide a buffer for anticipated sidelode interference from the edge of an adjacent eliminated cluster or isolated anchor points sufficient, and determining if power levels in the guard band are above or below a threshold; determining if power levels at or near the edge of an adjacent eliminated cluster or isolated anchor point is above or below a threshold; determining if the average power level for unoccupied frequencies is above or below a threshold; determining if the bandwidth between adjacent eliminated clusters or isolated anchor points is above or below a threshold; or any combination thereof. Those remaining frequencies with a high risk assessment may be eliminated from consideration. And any remaining frequency having a minimal risk assessment may be preferably selected. The overall computational complexity of the entire method may preferably be of order O(N).","According to another embodiment, a system for analyzing a received RF signal to determine unused channels, or frequencies, therein, has at least one processor and one or more modules executable by the at least one processor, and comprises: a fast spectrum sensing module configured to execute the method for processing a received RF signal to determine unused channels, or frequencies. Additionally, the system may further comprise: a front-end module configured to process a received RF signal; an analog digital converter (ADC) configured to digitize the processed signal; a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) module configured to transform the digitized signal into a set of frequency domain samples; and an estimate power module configured to estimate the power of the signal at various frequencies.","According to yet another embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium having computer-readable instructions, that when executed by a processor, implement the method for analyzing a received RF signal to determine unused channels, or frequencies.","These and other embodiments are further discussed below.","A unique and innovative fast spectrum sensing methodology is disclosed for radar and radio applications. The methodology includes analyzing RF signals and selecting unused channels, or frequencies, within a wide-frequency band of interest. This method quickly determines and eliminates high-power regions from further consideration. Processing requires use of anchor points to identify high power regions for elimination. Then an optional risk assessment may be performed on noisy nearby frequencies for further elimination since high power interference could leak into a potential unused frequency over time. The remaining \u201cunused\u201d frequencies can serve as potential transmission and\/or reception frequencies for RF signals.","Two criteria may be used to select an unused frequency according to the method: 1) the unused frequency should be substantially devoid of noise; and 2) the surrounding power of the unused frequency should be minimal. These criteria are general for both radar and radio applications for suitable operation of the radar\/radio. Actual values for these criteria would be linked to a particular system and method of operation, and are not limiting. The innovative fast spectrum sensing methodology described herein is based on an energy detection paradigm. The first criterion is important since reception by the cognitive radar or radio at frequencies occupied by a primary user or noise\/interference decreases the signal to noise ratio (SNR); receptions at these frequencies must be avoided. The second criterion is important since high power interference from neighboring frequencies may leak into a potential unused frequency over time.","To select unused frequencies within a wide frequency band, the method analyzes one or more RF signals to identify and eliminate regions, or clusters, of high power. The RF signals are received by at least one antenna, which may be any general RF antenna. The computational complexity of this method is significantly less than that of conventional methods thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of spectrum sensing processing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","110","120","130","140","450","400"]},"One or more RF signals are received by one or more antennas (e.g., antenna  illustrated in ). Typically, RF signals originate from multiple sources at different locations and over many frequencies. The system  may use multiple antennas  to receive multiple ambient signals the different sources and then combine the received signals in some way into an input RF signal, such as with a multiplexer or similar device. The input RF signal is an electronic signal or waveform. The antennas  might be directional, omni-directional or some combination thereof. It may be possible to limit the input RF signal to a smaller range or band of frequencies of interest with filtering, for instance.","The generalized approach of method  analyzes the input RF signal by estimating the power spectrum. While the input RF signal is in the time-domain, it preferably is converted to the frequency domain for processing and analyses. The method  analyzes the input RF signal by looking at all the energy\/power in frequency domain to identify areas which likely will represent interference that should be avoided, and find unoccupied regions which do not. The frequency range of interest is chosen based on the intended operational frequency bands where the radio\/radar is to operate. It is expected that interference exists within the intended operational range. Of course, any exemplary operational frequencies mentioned herein are not limiting and others certainly may be received and processed according to the scope of the invention.","Prior to implementing the method , the input RF signal may be pre-processed such that: 1) the sampled time-domain data is converted to the frequency domain via the fast Fourier transform (FFT); and 2) power estimates are determined for the frequency domain samples. Pre-processing of the received RF signal can be implemented by a fast spectrum sensing system as further discussed below. This produces a vector of the power samples X={x, . . . x} corresponding to frequencies f={f, . . . f}. N is the number of frequencies of interest.","The power samples are first processed in step  by conducting a binary hypothesis test to determine anchor points. The anchor points represent high power frequency locations in the RF signal. These may be quantified as amounts above a preset threshold value, although the preset threshold value, will likely vary each application or implementation. And because of their high power, anchor points and their surrounding frequencies are likely to cause interference and thus are candidates for elimination. One way anchor points may be determined is by implementing the following binary hypothesis test:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","j"]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"munder":{"mover":{"mo":"\u2277","msub":{"mi":"H","mn":"1"}},"msub":{"mi":"H","mn":"0"}},"mi":"\u03b3"}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["i ","0 ","j","j ","1 ","j","j","j ","j ","j "],"sup":"th ","b":"110"},"The binary hypothesis test is a well-known detection technique used in statistical analysis for hypothesis testing. It is simply a threshold test. It is also widely-known in the cognitive radio community for detecting frequencies whose energy is over a predetermined threshold. The \u201cnoise,\u201d may be white Gaussian noise approximated by a simple model used to formalize the binary hypothesis test (a very commonly used model). This noise is due to ambient radiation and receiver electronics. The null hypothesis is energy below the threshold; the alternative hypothesis is energy above the threshold.","In step , a search for clusters of anchor points in the input RF signal is performed. Clusters are identified based on the distance between the anchor points. For example, the distance between the anchor points is defined as D={d, d, . . . d}, where d=I\u2212I(i.e. the distance between the frequency bins). A frequency bin represents the resolution of the digitized frequency information. For example, if a band between 1 MHz-11 MHz is being monitored using a 1 MHz frequency resolution, then there would be 10 frequency bins (i.e., the first covering 1-2 MHz, the second covering 2-3 MHz, etc). On the other hand, if the frequency resolution were 1 Hz, there would be 10 million frequency bins.","A cluster contains frequency bin indices in fcorresponding to zeros in addition to the anchor point indices in I. More particularly, a cluster is defined as a sequence of anchor points, {I, I, . . . I}\u2282I, whose distances satisfy {d\u2266\u03b5, d\u2266\u03b5, . . . d\u2266\u03b5}, where is the maximum distance needed to form a cluster, and V<L. A cluster of size (I\u2212I) is then defined as\n\n+1, . . . ,+1, . . . ,\u22121,}.\u2003\u2003(2)\n","Next, in step , clusters and isolated anchor points are eliminated from the input RF signal. A cluster contains frequency bin indices in fcorresponding to zeros in addition to the anchor point indices in I. All clusters, and isolated anchor points, are then eliminated from f. These represent high energy regions of interference. The advantage of this technique is that multiple frequency bins (including the zeros not included in I) are eliminated based only on the analysis of anchor point distances; not on the analysis of the power estimates that would require additional processing. This results in a low computationally complex process of order O(L).","In some embodiments, it may be is possible to simply eliminate these frequency bins and end the method after step . This may be suitable for some applications. However, for many applications, power leakage from nearby clusters and anchor points which are eliminated from the processing may present a problem. Thus, it is preferred that a quality or risk assessment be performed for most embodiments.","In step , a quality or risk assessment of remaining frequencies in the input RF signal is conducted, and high risk frequencies are eliminated. Risk can be assessed in a variety of ways. For example, a risk analysis may be executed with output ranging from 0 to 1, with a value of 1 corresponding to 100% risk and a value of 0 corresponding to 0% risk. High risk and low risk may be defined for a given application. The exact risk function is application dependent, but should be chosen such that its computational complexity does not exceed O(N). Thus, the overall computational complexity for the entire fast spectrum sensing method  becomes O(N).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-C","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"sub":["j","j","1","L","bin","bin"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"]},"As illustrated in , the remaining frequency bins in fform natural groups within the input RF signal.
