No. 61\/103,719, filed Oct. 8, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. This application is a continuation in part of and claims priority to pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/476,895 filed on Jun. 29, 2006, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention generally relates to systems, methods, and computer program products for providing real-time information to a user of a securities trading system. More particularly, aspects of the invention relate to providing one or more widgets that can display real-time graphical representations of analytics including real-time market information and intraday analysis of trade executions.","2. Description of the Background","Pre-trade planning has often been overlooked by portfolio managers and traders in the past, but in recent years it has become an important component of a superior investment process. The pre-trade planning phase can serve as a link between portfolio managers and traders where traders can share their insight and knowledge of the complicated trading environment with portfolio managers while portfolio managers can incorporate this additional insight and knowledge into their investment decisions. Additional information about the trading environment can be advantageous for an institutional trader or an investment manager, because execution costs can be large when compared against gross returns. A significant portion of these execution costs can be the price impact of trading (i.e., the effect of trades on the price of securities). For example, large \u201cbuy\u201d orders can cause the price of the stock to rise, making the completion of these orders more costly to the investor. Similarly, large \u201csell\u201d orders can cause the price of a stock to fall, making the completion of these orders less profitable to the trader. This realization as well as additional fragmentation in the markets and changes in regulation have increased the popularity of pre-trade models amongst traders to minimize or avoid the price impact of trading.","Once a portfolio manager has made the assumptions and analysis necessary to determine asset allocations and create a portfolio of securities, it is important that he or she convey those underlying assumptions to the trading desk or the trader who is about to execute the orders. Making clear the time frame in which the portfolio manager expects to accomplish the program and the cost estimates the manager expects can save all parties significant expense.","Even after gathering the underlying assumptions, traders still have substantial leeway in planning their execution strategies. With careful pre-trade strategy planning, a trader's benchmark, in many ways, becomes the cost profile a portfolio manager expects to achieve. The trader can then consider different trading strategies that will fit or \u201cbeat\u201d the estimated cost benchmark that was agreed.","When planning an execution strategy, traders typically consider the relationship between price impact and opportunity cost (the risk that an advantageous opportunity will be lost by delaying a trade). An aggressive strategy (i.e., executing more of the trade in a shorter time frame) will typically increase price impact and lower opportunity cost. A passive strategy (i.e., delaying the execution of a greater portion of the trade), by contrast, will reduce price impact but increase opportunity cost. A selected execution strategy will often take into account both the estimated costs of a portfolio manager's investment strategy and the price impact and opportunity costs of executing that strategy.","Current pre-trade analysis services typically provide a static view of estimated transaction costs. For example, traditional pre-trade reporting focuses on delivering an abundance of information, typically in a PDF or HTML \u201creport\u201d format, that can be used to help with strategy selection and ex-post trading performance analysis. However, the relatively static nature of the reports limits their usefulness during actual trading. Because these services are external to the portfolio manager's workflow, there can be a substantial delay between submitting the trade list and performing the recommended executions.","In addition, current systems typically omit what the inventors consider to be a critical piece of monitoring information: deviations from history and expectations as the reality of the trading day evolves. Performance will only match expectations if all the assumptions underlying a certain strategy hold true over the course of the entire trading day. Unforeseen events that occur in the course of the trading day can significantly alter the overall performance of execution. A volume-distribution strategy, for example, will be sensitive to news that alters the expected volume distribution underlying the automated strategy. News released in the midst of the trading day that produces a sudden spike in volume could cause disastrous results if the trader fails to modify the strategy to adapt to events as they happen. Once the trading day begins, traders need to work dynamically, changing strategy \u201con the fly\u201d to meet events (e.g., to quickly identify underperforming orders, to determine what mid-course corrections are possible, etc.).","It is an object of the present invention to provide new and improved systems and methods for providing dynamic, real-time analytics and monitoring capabilities to portfolio managers and traders without interrupting trading workflow.","According to an aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for providing real time analytics to a user of a securities trading system. In some embodiments, the method includes steps of receiving from the securities trading system one or more records corresponding to list of one or more securities (e.g., a plurality of securities) and a request for an analytic (e.g., selected from a menu of available analytics) for the one or more securities, receiving real-time market data for the securities (e.g. via a digital communication network), obtaining the requested analytic metric (e.g., based on the records and the real-time market data), and sending information corresponding to the analytic to a widget engine so that the widget engine may display a graphical representation of the analytic metric in a predetermined display area (e.g., a pop up window or a portion of a display area of the securities trading system). In some embodiments, the method also includes steps of detecting an update to at least one of the records and the market data and sending corresponding information to the widget engine so that the widget engine may update the graphical representation of the analytic. In some embodiments, the steps of detecting an update and sending the updated information are set to recur at a predetermined interval.","In some embodiments, the method further includes the steps of receiving a user interface coupled to the graphical representation of the requested analytic a request to modify a record in the securities trading system and sending to the securities trading system describing the requested modification.","In some embodiments, the method further includes receiving historical data for the list of securities. In some embodiments, the requested analytic is based at least in part on the received historical data.","In some embodiments, the market data includes transaction data related to the list of securities. In some embodiments, the step of detecting an update in the market data includes detecting an update in the transaction data.","In some embodiments, the step of obtaining the analytic includes obtaining (e.g., from the real-time market data) a real-time value of a specified variable for a security, obtaining an empirical distribution of other values of the specified variable, and comparing the real-time value with the empirical distribution of values to determine whether the condition of the security is abnormal. In some embodiments, the empirical distribution is a distribution of real-time values for the specified variable for a peer group of the security. In some embodiments, the empirical distribution is a distribution of historical values for the specified variable for the security over a specified period of time. In some embodiments, the specified variable is a relation between an estimated value of an attribute for a security and a real-time value of the attribute for the security.","According to an aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for providing real time analytics to a user of a securities trading system. In some embodiments, the method includes steps of displaying in a first predetermined display area a user interface for the securities trading system, sending to a widget engine a list of securities selected from the securities trading system and a request for an analytic (e.g., selected from a menu of available analytics) for the securities, receiving from the widget engine information (e.g., based on one or more records from the securities trading system and real-time market data) corresponding to the requested analytic, and displaying in a second pre-determined display area a graphical representation of the requested analytic. In some embodiments, the method also includes steps of receiving updated information (e.g., based on updated records or market data) from the widget engine, and displaying updated graphical representation of the requested analytic.","In some embodiments, interactions with the user interface for the securities trading system and the updates to the graphical representation do not interfere with each other.","According to an aspect of the present invention, a system is provided for providing real time analytics to a user of a securities trading system. In some embodiments, the system includes a computer and a widget engine module. In some embodiments, the computer is operable to display in a first predetermined display area a user interface of the securities trading system, and to display a menu for requesting an analytic from among a predetermined set of one or more analytics. In some embodiments, the widget engine module is operable to obtain an analytic (e.g., an analytic requested from the menu) for the one or more securities based on one or more records stored in the securities trading system and based on real-time market data, and to display in a second predetermined display area of the client computer a graphical representation of the requested analytic. In some embodiments, the widget engine module is also operable to update the requested analytic based on an update to at least one of the records and the market data, and to update the display of the graphical representation based on updates to the analytic.","According to an aspect of the present invention, a computer program product is provided for providing real time analytics to a user of a securities trading system. In some embodiments, the computer program product comprises a digital storage media and a set of machine readable instructions stored on the digital storage media. In some embodiments, the machine readable instructions are executable by a computer to receive from the securities trading system one or more records corresponding to a list of one or more securities and a request for an analytic (e.g., selected from a menu of available analytics) for the one or more securities, receiving real-time market data for the one or more securities (e.g., via a digital communication network), obtain the requested analytic (e.g., based on the records and the real-time market data, and sending information corresponding to the analytic to a widget engine so that the widget engine may display a graphical representation of the analytic metric in a predetermined display area (e.g., a pop up window or a portion of a display area of the securities trading system). In some embodiments, the computer program product also includes machine readable instructions executable by a computer to detect an update to the record or the market data and to send corresponding information to the widget engine so that the widget engine may update the graphical representation of the analytic.","According to an aspect of the present invention, a computer program product is provided for providing real time analytics to a user of a securities trading system. In some embodiments, the computer program product comprises a digital storage media and a set of machine readable instructions stored on the digital storage media. In some embodiments, the machine readable instructions are executable by a computer to display in a first predetermined display area a user interface for the securities trading system, send to a widget engine a list of one or more securities selected from the securities trading system and a request for an analytic (e.g., selected from a menu of available analytics) for the one or more securities, receive from the widget engine information (e.g., based on one or more records from the securities trading system and real-time market data) corresponding to the requested analytic, and display in a second predetermined display area a graphical representation of the requested analytic. In some embodiments, the computer program product also includes machine readable instructions executable by a computer to receive updated information corresponding to the requested analytic (e.g., based on updated records or updated market data) from the widget engine, and to an updated graphical representation of the requested analytic.","The methods, systems, and computer program product of the present invention help traders efficiently and quickly monitor trading progress by delivering real-time analytics and monitoring to a trading blotter in a securities trading system or other type of display. The present invention also enables real-time market data and trade lists to be combined so as to provide immediate and continuing feedback to traders. In some embodiments, such data can also be combined with real-time transaction data to allow traders to monitor transaction costs in real time without interrupting the trading workflow. The widgets of the present invention can present information in a graphical format that is easy to understand and use in a dynamically changing trading environment. In some embodiments, the analytic widgets can be implemented as an independent module or application that can be included in the trading workflow without requiring a change in the securities trading system.","The real-time monitoring tools of the present invention can help a trader identify abnormalities that can become significant cost drivers during the trading day. Many current automated strategies rely on volume, volatility, spread, and limit order book data as well. These factors and their forward projections are usually based on historical figures combined with a statistical method for predicting future movements. Most of the current pre-trade cost estimation models assume a normalized behavior; that is, most of the current models assume that volume, volatility and spread will be only slightly different in the future than their behavior over the preceding period. Quickly identifying behavior that diverges from this norm can help traders to respond in time with a change in strategy that will compensate for new trading patterns and thus reduce the risk of incurring higher costs as a result of such real-time factors. From simple volume signals to more sophisticated real-time models that predict movements of the best bid and ask, real-time monitoring tools can help traders respond in a timely fashion to news throughout the day.","By graphically displaying the trade prices, market prices and cost benchmarks, users can receive immediate feedback on how to adapt their trading to meet specific benchmarks. As new trades are executed and as new market data is processed, target prices can be immediately updated, allowing traders to make important decisions on how to continue trading securities in the list.","By using dynamic display areas (e.g., pop-up windows), the graphical representations of one or more analytics can be added, removed or configured as the user sees fit. This allows the analytics to be included in the trading workflow without interrupting the user's workflow.","Logging and standardizing these real-time events generated by a real-time monitoring system can also provide additional transparency and can be very useful in shedding light on an over- or under-performing strategy or trading period. In an era when traders are compensated by performance, a record of these events can become very important. Incorporating this information into the post-trade analysis sheds yet more light on performance and cost estimates going forward.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art upon review of the detailed description of the preferred embodiments below and the accompanying drawings.","While the present invention may be embodied in many different forms, a number of illustrative embodiments are described herein, with the understanding that the present disclosure is considered as providing examples of the invention, and such examples are not intended to limit the invention to any specific preferred embodiment described and\/or illustrated herein.","It will be readily understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention, as described herein, includes systems, processes, and components that may be implemented using one or more general purpose computers, microprocessors, or the like, programmed according to the teachings of the present specification. Appropriate software may be available that may be customized or used off-the-shelf to provide one or more components or steps of the present invention.

In computer software, a widget engine is a software service available to users for running and displaying widgets in a display area (e.g., a computer \u201cdesktop\u201d). Desktop widgets, as understood by those of skill in the art, can be small applications (i.e., \u201capplets\u201d) that give access to information and frequently used functions such as clocks, calendars, news aggregators, etc.","Also, the term \u201cwidget engine\u201d is not to be confused with that of a widget toolkit. Widget toolkits are used by designers of GUIs, who combine several widgets to form a single application. A widget in a widget toolkit provides a single, low level interaction (e.g., a single interface \u201cbutton\u201d), and is prepared to communicate with other widgets in the toolkit. By contrast, the widget engines of the present invention are intended for end users and each widget is a stand-alone, task-oriented application which can be composed of several related interactions on its own to display analytics relating to securities trading within a trading system.","The use of widgets to display analytics in the present invention is advantageous for several reasons, including ease of development. Most of these widgets can be created with a few images and about 10 to several hundred lines of XML\/JavaScript\/VBScript source code. A single host software system, such as a web browser, runs all the loaded widgets. This allows several desktop widgets to be built sharing resources and code.","In an embodiment, the widget module  includes a controller form module  that generates or otherwise provides user interface controls (e.g., one or more drop down menus, toolbar buttons, panels, icons, etc.) to the user for requesting one or more real-time analytics.

In an embodiment, the widget module  also includes a widget engine module .","In the embodiment illustrated in , the widget engine module  is configured to access one or more data sources  (e.g., STS database storing order information, market data sources , analytic engine modules for providing investment analysis and recommendations, etc.). In an embodiment, the widget engine module  accesses the one or more data sources  via an electronic data network (e.g., LAN, WAN, fiber, the Internet, etc.). In an embodiment, the widget engine module  can access the data sources  independently of the securities trading system (e.g., the widget engine may access the data sources  via one or more communication channels that are physically or logically distinct from the communication channels utilized by the securities trading system).","In an embodiment, the widget engine module  accesses one or more of the data sources  (e.g., the STS database ) via one or more integration modules . As illustrated in , the widget engine module  utilizes a trading system interface module and an OMS adapter to access the STS database . In some embodiments, the trading system interface module provides a common widget interface for communicating with the widget engine module , and the OMS adapter can be configured to translate data transmissions between the common widget interface and an interface specific to the STS database . The integration modules  enable the widget engine module  to be reconfigured to communicate with a different STS database types by only adjusting one or more of the integration modules  (e.g., by substituting an appropriate OMS adapter ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["122","122","104","104","202","202","102","204","205","206","208","210","204","208","204","212","214","104","104"]},"In the embodiment illustrated in , the controller form  includes a menu of analytic widgets available to a user  of the system .

The process  is similar to the process  with some additional steps.","At step , the widget engine  determines whether a command to update a record in the STS database has been received from the analytic widget . For example, in some embodiments a user can select from a menu of trade strategies displayed in an analytic widget  or select data from the graphical representation of the analytic to update the records stored in the STS database (e.g., to adjust a target price or share value).","At step , the widget engine  sends the update indicated by the command to the STS database . In some embodiments, the command is sent to the STS database via the widget engine module . In other embodiments, the update is sent via the trading system management interface . In some embodiment, the update is sent to the STS database directly or via an OMS integration module.","In response to receiving the request, at step , the analytic widget  sends the update indicated by the command to the STS database . In some embodiments, the command is sent to the STS database via the trading system management interface . In some embodiments, the update is sent to the STS database directly or via an OMS integration module.","In embodiments of the present invention, one or more of the following widgets may be provided to a user of a securities trading system:","Pre-Trade Widget\u2014The Pre-Trade widget  can be configured to provide a simple presentation of the tradeoffs between cost estimates and cost standard deviations among various trade execution strategies using analytics such as those provided by ITG Logic\u00ae. In the embodiment illustrated in , the Pre-Trade widget  is configured to utilize real-time market data and historical market data for the list of securities to calculate a predicted transaction cost  and standard deviation  for a plurality of pre-selected trade strategies . The Pre-Trade widget  illustrated in  can also be configured to display icons  that provide an overview of how each trading strategy  will allocate trades throughout the trading day.","The preselected strategies can include:\n\n","As illustrated in , in response to a user  selecting an individual strategy  (e.g., \u201cACE Aggressive\u201d), the Pre-Trade widget  can be configured to display a detailed illustration of the intraday trade distributions  of the strategy. In some embodiments, a day is divided into a number of predetermined time bins, and a portion of the total orders (e.g., a portion of the target execution size) is allocated to each time bin.","In the embodiment illustrated in , the Pre-Trade widget  is configured to display the trade-offs between expected costs and opportunity cost across various strategies with different urgencies and participation rates. The graphical representation in  depicts the apparent trade-offs between the predetermined strategies , with opportunity cost (i.e., risk) along the X-axis (lower is better), and expected costs along the Y axis (lower is better). Every dot on the graph represents one of the predetermined strategies . In some embodiments, the graphical representation can include a curve  representing the \u201cefficient frontier\u201d for the trade. The efficient frontier illustrated in  represents the lowest possible expected cost for a given risk value, or alternatively the lowest available risk value for a given expected cost. In some embodiments, the graphical representation can also include points representing the expected costs and risks of the predetermined strategies . For example, in  the dot  represents the most passive strategy (e.g., ACE Passive) and therefore indicates the lowest expected cost, but the highest risk. On the other hand, the dot  represents the most aggressive strategy (e.g., ACE Very Aggressive) and hence will have a high expected cost, but a relatively low risk. A switch from a passive strategy to an aggressive strategy will result a significant increase in expected costs while the opportunity cost will be significantly reduced. Furthermore, in  the dots  on the represent strategies that are inferior to the strategies on the efficient frontier. Instead of picking one of the strategies corresponding to the dots , a user can simply pick a strategy that have the same cost estimate but with a lower opportunity cost or a strategy on the efficient frontier that has the same opportunity cost but a lower cost estimate.","Furthermore, in some embodiments, the Pre-Trade widget  can be configured to provide more detailed reports  that identify outliers from the list of one or more securities (e.g., orders that need special attention because their characteristics will cause them to have a higher probability of incurring greater transaction costs). An example report  is illustrated in .","Recommended Strategy\u2014The Recommended Strategy widget  can be configured to provide a comparison of expected costs and opportunity costs across various trading horizons. In the embodiment illustrated in , the Recommended Strategy widget  is configured to display the marginal contribution to expected cost  relative to the marginal contribution to opportunity cost  (a standard deviation of the expected cost) by extending the trade horizon. The Recommended Strategy widget can be configured to recommend a trading strategy that will minimize risk adjusted cost  (e.g., expected cost+opportunity costs). It can also be configured to chart how costs differ by varying trading horizon. As illustrated in , the risk adjusted cost can be calculated for a set number of time intervals (e.g., every 30 minutes throughout the remainder of the trading day). In , the first set of points  on the left represent the expected costs, the opportunity costs, and the risk adjusted cost of trading the order in 30 minutes, the second set of points  represent the costs of trading the order in 60 minutes, etc. Preferably, the Recommended Strategy widget  can recommend a trading horizon at an \u201coptimal point\u201d of the strategy i.e., a point at which marginal contribution to expected cost equals to marginal contribution to opportunity cost (e.g., a trading horizon corresponding to the set of points at ).","In some embodiments, the Recommended Strategy Widget may be configured to calculate ACE costs (e.g., expected ACE costs and ACE cost standard deviations) for a plurality of ACE strategies (e.g., ACE Passive, ACE Neutral, ACE Aggressive, and ACE Very Aggressive), and, for each ACE strategy, identify the trading horizon at which marginal contribution to expected cost equals to marginal contribution to opportunity cost. Preferably, the Recommended Strategy widget can select the ACE strategy for which the optimal point has the lowest risk adjusted cost.","Intraday PnL\u2014As illustrated in , an Intraday PnL widget  can be configured to provide intraday real-time aggregate performance information for the list of one or more securities. In the embodiment of , the Intraday PnL widget  is configured to display a \u201cbubble\u201d chart  on which the performance of trades in each of the securities in the selected list of securities is plotted in relation to a selected benchmark . Available benchmarks  can include:\n\n","In the embodiment of , the y-axis position of each security represents the performance of trades in that security (e.g., bubbles  above the x axis represent trades that have performed better than the selected benchmark , while bubbles  below the x axis represent trades that have performed worse than the selected benchmark). The size of each bubble can be adjusted to indicate the value of the transaction.","Furthermore, the Intraday PnL widget  can be configured to display real-time numerical representation  for the aggregate performance of the list against each benchmark  (e.g., in a currency such as USD), and to display graph icons  that illustrate the aggregate performance of the list over a predetermined period of time.","In the embodiment illustrated in , the Intraday PnL widget  is configured to enable a user  to filter the display of the bubble chart  to only display information for a predetermined number of securities from the list (e.g., the ten transactions  with the best performance relative to the selected benchmark , and the ten transactions  with the worst performance relative to the selected benchmark ).","In the embodiment illustrated in , the Intraday PnL widget  is further configured to provide aggregate performance of the entire list in relation to one or more of the selected benchmarks  over a predetermined period of time. As illustrated in , the Intraday PnL Widget can display the aggregate performance of all buy orders in the list , all sell orders in the list , and the total performance of the list  over a portion of a trading day.","In some embodiments, the Intraday PnL widget  is further configured to enable a user  to select an individual bubble from the bubble chart to view detailed single-trade intraday progress of the selected security. In the embodiment illustrated in  the Intraday PnL widget  is configured to include options  for displaying the price  of the stock, the volume weighted average price (\u201cVWAP\u201d), the selected benchmark , the average execution price , individual trades (e.g., based on records from the STS database ), the creation VWAP, and creation time benchmark. The selected data can be plotted over a predetermined period of time in the chart area .","The Intraday PnL widget  illustrated in  is also configured to include a ticker symbol, target execution size, filled and residual shares, and an average execution price based on a record from the securities trading system. The Intraday PnL widget  can be further configured to include a drop down menu for selecting from one or more available benchmarks , and a recommended limit price for matching the selected benchmark. In some embodiments, the Intraday PnL widget  is configured to enable a user  can select the suggested limit price and update the records corresponding to the selected security in the STS database ","Using the Intraday PnL widget , a use  can view trades  in real-time relative to one or more benchmarks  and the stock's price movements . This capability enables a user  to observe how an automated strategy that is being executed behaves as the automated executions for the strategy will be displayed in updates to the graph. In some embodiments, the Intraday PnL Widget can be configured to automatically refresh real-time market data and trade information, providing the user  with a continuous, up-to-date view of trade progress and outliers.","Summary PnL\u2014As illustrated in , the Summary PnL widget  can be configured to display performance information (e.g., number of shares, PnL in USD, PnL in basis points) for a list of one or more securities in relation to a selected benchmark , aggregated by a selected category  (e.g., List, Trader, Destination, etc.).","Volume Monitor\u2014The Volume Monitor widget  helps a user  monitor the average historical market volume, the current volume market, and their own volume simultaneously. In the embodiment illustrated in  the Volume Monitoring widget is configured to divide a trading day into a predetermined number of time bins. For each time bin, the Volume Monitoring widget can be configured to display the historical market volume  (i.e., the average market volume for that time bin over a predetermined period of time (e.g., over the past month)), the current market volume  (i.e., the market volume of that time bin for the current trading day), and the volume  traded by the user  during that time bin.","As further illustrated in , in some embodiments the Volume Monitor Widget is configured to display a relative portion  (i.e., participation rate) of the security traded by the user  (e.g., the portion of the target execution size transacted during that time bin). In some embodiments, the participation rate may be based on market volume from the opening of the market day to the current time bin, market volume from the time when the order was created in the STS database until the order is completed, market volume from the time when the order was created in the STS database until the current time, or other suitable bases understood to persons having skill in the art.","Volume statistics are embedded in many automated trading strategies so for example, lack of intraday volume might suggest switching to a more opportunistic strategy as opposed to a structured strategy, while high intraday volume relative to historical levels might support a more structured strategy.","Trade Distribution\u2014The Trade Distribution widget  can be configured to compare the actual trade distribution for the selected entry against the selected pre-trade strategy. In the embodiment illustrated in , the Trade Distribution widget  is configured to display the selected strategy as a number of shares per predetermined time interval as a first bar graph , and display the actual amount of shares executed during each time interval as a second bar graph .","Smart Indicator\u2014The Smart Indicator widget  can be configured to provide indications of abnormality in one or more securities by comparing current attribute of the security (e.g., volume, bid ask spread, volatility, etc.) with an empirical distributing of such values. In some embodiments, the current attribute may be based on the behavior of the security over a predetermined period (e.g., over the entire trading day so far, over the last 30 minutes, etc.). As illustrated in , the Smart Indicators Widget can be configured to display the result of this comparison as a numerical percentile rank , a bar graph , a qualitative description  (e.g., \u201cBelow-Normal,\u201d \u201cNormal,\u201d \u201cAbove-Normal,\u201d etc.) or other representations understood by those having skill in the art (e.g., standard deviations, etc.).","As illustrated in , in some embodiments, the Smart Indicator widget  can be configured to generate the empirical distribution based of historical data for the list of one or more securities. For example, the empirical distribution may be a distribution of values of the attribute for the list of one or more securities over a predetermined time period. Thus the Smart Indicator Widget can be configured to display the degree to which the attribute of list of one or more securities differs from historical behavior.","In some embodiments, Smart Indicator widget  can be configured to generate the empirical distribution of values over a peer group of the list of securities. As used herein, a peer group of the list of securities can be a plurality of other securities that share common attributes with the list (e.g., industry sector, average volume, etc.). Thus the Smart Indicator Widget can be configured to display the degree to which the attribute of list of one or more securities differs from the attributes of the peer group by identifying where in the empirical distribution the list of securities fall.","The Smart Indicator widget  can be further configured to utilize an analytic metric for the attribute of the security. As used herein, an analytic metric comprises a relation between an expected value of an attribute (e.g., a value predicted by a model) and the value actually observed (e.g., a value obtained by real-time market data).","Other aspects of Smart Indicators in accordance with some aspects of the invention are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/476,895, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Risk Monitor\u2014The Risk Monitor widget  can be configured to chart the residual risk trajectory for the list of one or more securities. In some embodiments, the Risk Monitor Widget is configured to monitor the residuals of list of one or more securities and, on a pre-defined time interval, to calculate the Total Risk, tracking error of the buy positions, and tracking error of the sell positions. As illustrated in , in some embodiments the Risk Monitor widget  is configured to enable a user  to view the residual risk in comparison to:\n\n","The Risk Monitor Widget  can be further configured to enable a user  to view the residual trade value by industry sector (for buy orders and sell orders) or a total distribution of buy and sell orders over time.","While various embodiments of the present invention have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation. For example, while widget menus and analytics have been described as preferably being displayed in a predetermined area on a user display, the system may be configured to allow the menus and\/or analytics to be resized, moved and\/or minimized by the user.
