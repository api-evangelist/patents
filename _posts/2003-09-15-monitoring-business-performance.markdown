title: Monitoring business performance
abstract: A performance monitoring system receives data from one or more data sources. It transforms the received data into the performance information relating to predefined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs); and stores it into a KPI store. The system also calculates scores based on the received data and the performance information stored in the KPI store. Thus, the system can indicate changes in the KPIs through an information presentation unit.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This invention relates to a system and method for monitoring business performance.","In order to manage a business, it is important to understand how the business is performing. Many organizations store various performance data, such as sales amounts, revenues and account receivables. Organizations use those data to evaluate their business performance.","There exist monitoring tools available for assisting users to monitor some performance data. Those traditional monitoring tools are rigid in their presentation of data. Presentation is driven by an author's view on the business, rather than the performance metrics and their status. Those tools display only pre-set views of specific items as determined by an author of the tool at the time of implementation. Analysis of displayed values may be possible, but it is limited to the pre-set views of specific items. Also, in many organizations, each department has its own store of performance related data and its own definitions of metrics. Those tools may be sufficient for department heads to monitor the performance within the departments. However, those tools are often not sufficient for users who need to see a common, aligned view of business performance of the entire organization. Furthermore, traditional performance monitoring tools do not adapt well to changes in business priorities, initiatives and processes. An authored, rigid display of performance data must be frequently edited to keep up to date with business changes. Editing is cumbersome and requires special skills.","Some existing comprehensive systems provide functions for analysing problems, but those systems are too difficult to use without special training.","Also, in order to provide better views of business performance, scorecard systems are proposed. Scorecard systems give scores to values to indicate values are good or bad. This improves intuitive understanding of values. However, existing scorecard systems are suitable for a department scale analysis and do not give overall views or more in-depth view of the performance of their business.","It is therefore desirable to provide an improved mechanism to allow users to easily monitor and analyse performance of their business.","It is an object of the invention to provide a novel system and method for monitoring business performance that obviates or mitigates at least one of the disadvantages of existing systems.","The invention uses scores calculated for various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to present business performance information to users. In an aspect, the invention can monitor changes in KPIs. In another aspect, the invention allows flexible sorting and\/or filtering of KPIs driven by viewers during the monitoring operation.","In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a performance monitoring system comprising a staging area, a KPI store, a loader and an information presentation unit. The staging area is provided for receiving data from one or more data sources. The KPI store is provided for storing performance information relating to predefined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The loader is provided for transforming the received data into the performance information relating to the KPIs, calculating scores based on the received data and the performance information stored in the KPI store to indicate changes in the KPIs, and loading the performance information including the scores into the KPI store. The information presentation unit is provided for presenting the performance information to a user.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is provided a performance monitoring system comprising a staging area, a KPI store, a loader and an information presentation unit.

The loader is provided for transforming the received data into the performance information relating to the KPIs, and loading the performance information including the scores into the KPI store. The information presentation unit is provided for presenting the performance information to a viewer, the information presentation unit having a viewer driven sorter for allowing the viewer to sort the performance information using the scores stored in the KPI store.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for monitoring business performance. The method comprises steps of receiving data from one or more data sources; transforming the received data into performance information relating to predefined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs); storing the performance information into a KPI store; calculating scores based on the received data and the performance information stored in the KPI store to indicate changes in the KPIs; loading the performance information including the scores into the KPI store; and presenting the performance information to a user.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for monitoring performance comprising the steps of receiving data from one or more data sources; storing in a KPI store performance information relating to predefined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs); transforming the received data into the performance information relating to the KPIs; loading the performance information including the scores into the KPI store; and presenting the performance information to a viewer, allowing the viewer to sort the performance information using the scores stored in the KPI store.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is provided a computer readable medium storing the instructions and\/or statements for use in the execution in a computer of either of the above methods for monitoring business performance.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is provided electronic signals for use in the execution in a computer of either of the above methods for monitoring business performance.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is provided a computer program product for use in the execution in a computer of a method for monitoring business performance. The computer program product comprises a module for receiving data from one or more data sources; a module for transforming the received data into performance information relating to predefined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs); a module for storing the performance information into a KPI store; a module for calculating scores based on the received data and the performance information stored in the KPI store to indicate changes in the KPIs; a module for loading the performance information including the scores into the KPI store; and a module for presenting the performance information to a user.","Other aspects and features of the present invention will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art from a review of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Referring to , a performance monitoring system  according to an embodiment of the present invention is described. The performance monitoring system  is suitably used to monitor business performances of an organization. The business of the organization may or may not be of profitable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","50","120","50","50","100","100","160"]},"The performance related data repository  stores performance related data that describes topics such as the strategy of the organization, indicators that are important to understand the business performance, i.e., Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and to whom the KPIs are important, accountability for aspects of organizational performance, actual and target values of indicators over time, the history of values and any annotations including comments that users make about performance.","The performance related data repository  also covers usage and impact analysis. For example, the performance related data repository  can be used to analyse which users using which indicators, and which indicators are cross references to which other objects in the repository .","The performance monitoring system  provides users with information  about the performance of their organization by taking data  and transforms it into the performance related data repository . For example, the performance monitoring system  provides users with relevant performance metrics of things that are relevant to the users. The metrics gives the users at-a-glance monitoring of the relevant things, e.g., what business activities are on track, what are not on track, which are getting better and which are getting worse. The performance monitoring system  provides the at-a-glance monitoring in a way that allows users different ways of monitoring. The users can monitor in ways that are conducive to their own style of management. The performance monitoring system  not only allows users to follow pre-defined navigation paths and structures that they have set up, but also allows users to be guided by what has been happening in the data.","The performance monitoring system  also uses the performance related data repository  to link performance related data to other sources of information that assist users to have a thorough understanding of what is going on, and to analyse and find the causes of any performance anomaly. The performance monitoring system  also encourages sharing of human insights on performance related data by allowing users to feedback () their comments into the performance monitoring system  which are then available for other users to view.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","100","210","220","230","260","260","240","250"]},"The performance monitoring system  takes data from one or more data sources  that stores data relating to business performance. Examples of potential data sources  include typical data sources that organizations generally use, such as, Multidimensional OnLine Analytical Processing (MOLAP) cubes , relational data warehouses , other relational data source , such as Enterprise Resource Planning systems (ERPs) or custom developed systems, and other data source  such as legacy systems or textural data, e.g., Exel. All of these are potential data sources for business performance data.","The performance monitoring system  accesses data sources  through a data load mechanism. For example, the performance monitoring system  may use a utility PPXO  uses for Cognos Power Cube or MOLAP Cube . The utility PPXO  automatically extracts data from the cube  and loads it into the staging area . For relational data warehouse , other relational data source  or other data source , the performance monitoring system  uses custom load scripts or Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process  to extract the data from the source and move it into the staging area .","The staging area  receives data from data sources . Loads of the staging area do not impact performance of the system. This, it is possible to load the staging area at any time of day. . The staging area  is used primarily for bulk loading of data and metadata. It is desirable that the staging area  contains the data that has changed since the last run, rather than the entire data including unchanged data. The performance monitoring system  does not have to rebuild the entire staging area  for each load of data The staging area  is read by the loader . The loader  has a load function and a calculation function. The loader  reads the staging area  and moves data into the KPI store  at the same time transforming and scoring the data to output performance information which is in a form suitable for the use by the performance monitoring system . The loader  also calculates scores for numeric KPIs. A score is a numeric indication of the performance of a particular KPI.","KPIs to be stored in the KPI store  are preselected by a system administrator to reflect the business performance. For example, if 90% of the revenue in North America come from the sales of top  products, the system administrator selects the sales of these ten products as KPIs to monitor as well as the revenue in North America as another KPI. The performance monitoring system  provides users with performance information of the revenue in North America as represented by the ten products, while allowing users to drill down for each product. Thus, the users can understand the overall tendency of the performance at glance, as well as the performance of each product by drilling down to each product. In existing monitoring tools, the designer of tools could select only a relatively small number of KPIs in order to fit the monitor results within pre-set views. In the performance monitoring system , large number of KPIs can be selected because the KPIs can be sorted and\/or filtered as viewer's selection to display desired results, as further described below.","The KPI store  stores the performance information including values of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and other relevant data. Once the performance information is in the KPI store , the information is made available to users through the information presentation unit .","The user information presentation unit  typically uses a web application server  and a web based front-end interface . The front-end interface  provides users with business performance information, e.g., insight as to what is going on in their business, allowing the users to manage any problems found in the business performance. The front-end interface  presents the performance information in a way to guide users' monitoring sessions and their exploration of performance.","Examples and details of each element of the performance monitoring system  are further described referring to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","210","210"]},"The data structure  contains a series of data columns - relating to the time under which any particular row of staging area data is registered. The data structure  shows year , month , and day  to which the data applies. The staging area data structure  also contains columns relating to reference , value type , value , source , and date . The reference  is the method of describing what KPI the row indicates. The data structure  can contain not only actual values, but also target values or any other user defined values such as forecast values, or benchmark values. The value type  indicates which value  is stored in the relevant row. The source  indicates a data source from which the data comes. The date  indicates when the data reached the staging area .","For example, the first row indicates that for the full month of May 2002 a target value defined for Revenue in North America on May 21, 2002 is $5,000,000 according to SAP. The second row shows that a forecast value for the full month of May 2002 that was gathered on May 21, 2002 from Excels Force Automation system (SFA) is $5,120,350.","The staging area  receives daily actual values in a more detailed level than target and forecast values. For example, the third low in the data structure  shows that, on the first of May, the staging area  received actual values from three different systems for Revenue in North America: $54,742 from a Point-Of-Sale (POS) system, $28,353 from a web system and $10,843 from a contracts cube.","It is desirable that the staging in the staging area  is incremental, i.e., the staging area  stages only new values that have changed or added since the last stage because the full data set does not have to be provided for the KPI store  each time, in corporation with the loader  as described below. The staging area  may be configured in two ways for each KPI: for a new value received during a selected time period, replace the new value for an existing value in the KPI store , or add the new value to the KPI store . For example, the staging area  shown in  received new actual values of $54,742, $28,353 and $10,843. If the KPI store  already stores a value of $2,500,000 for Revenue in North America, the staging area  may be configured to replace the $2,500,000 with the sum of the actual values, or to add the sum of the actual values to the $2,500,000.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","220","400","440","420","420","220"]},"Examples of events  include new data added to the staging area  (), changes to user entered actual or target values (), changes in definition or calculation methods (), new KPIs registered in the performance monitoring system  () and update of data sources ().","When new data is added to the staging area  (), the new date is processed by the loader  if the new data affects one or more KPI value, e.g., a target value, actual value or other value.","The loader  preferably has a function to determine which value is a new value by comparing the received value and a corresponding value stored in the KPI store . The loader  loads only new values to the KPI store . Thus, not all of the data is loaded into the performance monitoring system  from data sources . Certain values are not available in data sources , such as some of target values and actual values that need assessment by users. Those values are captured inside of the performance monitoring system , i.e., users enter those values into the performance monitoring system . Users may change those user-entered values (). An example of a change in a target value is that when a target for Revenue for a particular year was originally set as $5 million, the performance monitoring system  has automatically prorated the $5 million target over the 12 months. In half way through the year, the user revises the target value to $5.5 million. The loader  recalculates the prorating based on the new target value, and also recalculates the performance related data and any scores or status that have been calculated based on those target values, as further described below.","Users may also change the definition of KPIs or calculation methods (). An example is that a change is made in a calculation method of a Customer Satisfaction Index. Initially the Customer Satisfaction Index was calculated as a result of two other KPIs, one of them being Survey Results and another one being Returns. The new calculation method also uses Repeat Purchases as another KPI to calculate the Customer Satisfaction Index. The new calculation method means that the values of the calculated KPI are redefined.","When a new KPI is added and registered into the performance monitoring system  (), the performance monitoring system  now has a KPI that has never been reported before where the performance monitoring system  has been in production on the system data for a year already. For example, when a Maintenance Renewal Rate is added to the performance monitoring system , the loader  attempts to source historical data for that Maintenance Renewal Rate, not just from the day when it is added, but also from the prior history as far back as the other KPIs are loaded or as far back as the user indicates.","When a data source is updated (), some actions of the loader  are also triggered. In the example shown in , three data sources are used to obtain actual values. If the contracts cube was last updated on May 15, SAP was last updated on May 30, and the POS system was last updated on May 22, the data displayed by the performance monitoring system  mean differently among those actual values. The data shown for the contracts cube on May 30 that the performance monitoring system  is able to display to a user was updated on May 15. This means that even though the data is viewed at May 30, the last time the performance monitoring system  loaded the data was May 15 and accordingly, the value looks low. Also, it is relevant to the performance monitoring system  to know which data was updated on which date. If the contracts cube is to be updated, for example on May 25, there may be some KPIs for which the performance monitoring system  receives no data. In order to reflect the fact that the data source  has been updated even though the performance monitoring system  have received no data in the staging area , that the performance monitoring system  prorates the target value so that the user can know that the data is as of May 25 and the target value should have increased. If no data was received, while the data sources are updated, it means that the business is doing worse than the performance on May 15, even though the actual value displayed is unchanged. Thus, the loader  processes when the data sources are updated to provide correct views of the business to the user.","Now referring to the flowchart , examples of actions  that are performed on these events  are described. The actions  are described in the order of the flowchart , but all actions may not be taken every time or additional steps may be taken as needed. Also, these actions may be taken in a different order.","The loader  looks at whether any new KPIs exist for publishing (). The loader  determines the net effect of any new data added to the staging area , changes entered to actual values or other values, or changes in calculation methods (). Thus, the performance monitoring system  determines differences or changes for KPIs. For example, the original Revenue before new data added to the staging area  was $5,000,000. The performance monitoring system  received at the staging area  a new value of $500,000. The net affect is $500,000. The loader  is preset to add the $500,000 to the original $5,000,000, and calculates a new updated set of KPI values reflecting the new value of $5,500,000. The loader  updates the KPI values according to the calculated new values ().","The next step is prorating target values (). For example, the performance monitoring system  has a target value for the month of $50,000,000 for a particular KPI and the actual value achieved is $40,000,000 for the KPI. According to the non-prorated target of $50,000,000, it seems that the business is not doing too well as the actual value is below the target. However, the actual value was as of the middle of the month. Looking at the prorated target for the middle of the month is $25,000,000, the actual value of $40,000,000 at the middle of the month when the target is $50 million probably means that the business is doing well. Thus, using the prorated target values provides more accurate view of the performance.","The performance monitoring system  scores to monitor KPIs. There are different types of scores, including \u201cgood or bad\u201d and \u201cbetter or worse\u201d.","The performance monitoring system  scores to evaluate how good or bad particular KPIs are, based on these prorated target values (). Also, the performance monitoring system  may use tolerance values to calculate scores. This score indicates how good or bad the particular KPI is. The numeric scores may be converted into colour or pattern coded status for display to the user in the front-end interface . For example, the scores may be presented as red (bad), yellow (neutral) and green (good).","The performance monitoring system  can also compare values from period to period to know whether the KPI has improved or worsen. If a score changes from 100 to 110, the performance monitoring system  knows that the KPI has been improved relative to another KPI. KPIs may have different units. For example, one KPI may be monitory and another one may be a percentage. Both KPIs are scored to have a common unit. The scores allow the performance monitoring system  to compare different KPIs based on which one of KPIs is better or worse or which one of KPIs has improved the most or got worse in the time period at which the user is looking.","The ability with prorating target values and calculating scores supports the monitoring functions that the performance monitoring system  can perform, such as letting users to change target values and guiding users through changes in the values. Thus, the performance monitoring system  allows the user to manage problems in the performance. The performance monitoring system  provides users with monitoring means which functions more than simply looking at predefined structures of data that the user has set up to manage.","Continuing with the loader action process , the last step shown in  is that the performance monitoring system  calculates computed KPIs (). Thee computed KPIs are any calculated KPIs which do not exist in the base data. For example, the performance monitoring system  calculates the customer satisfaction index that described above because the performance monitoring system  cannot obtain a customer satisfaction index from any data source. The user calculates this index based on what the value of survey results and returns to the performance monitoring system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["230","230","510","520","530"]},"The KPI values  include the actual values, target values and scores over time. These values are stored by monthly  and daily . Each value is associated with the time , e.g., when the value is received, and a KPI  for which the value is received.","The business metadata and annotations  drive the exploration and ability to highlight related information for KPIs. Examples of the business metadata  that is used by the performance monitoring system  include what objections of the company are, what initiatives they have on the go, with which projects does the user work, and what critical success factors of the company are. The business metadata  also include scorecards, cause\/effect relationships that exist between different KPIs, diagrams, reports which present value related information about a KPI, other documents and external links, such as web pages or policy documents that is available on line. The business metadata  may also contain any annotations that are entered by users describing the business performance. These business metadata and annotations  describe the strategy and allow the company to map back their performance to their strategy.","The technical metadata . drives the technical working of the performance monitoring system . The technical metadata  describes the data sources from which that the performance monitoring system  extracts data, the dimensionality, information of the data sources, the measures which are the building blocks of KPIs that exist in the data sources, metadata that drives the actual user interface and metadata which defines what currencies and languages are available to users of the performance monitoring system .","The KPI store  also has security  and language translations . The data and metadata in the database  is secured through an access control list by the security . This means that the database  stores which classes of users are allowed access to which data. The database  may also store language translations  of textual data so that the interface can be displaced in different languages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["510","500","600","600"]},"The cube  has two dimensions : time and KPIs themselves. Both time and KPIs support multiple roll-ups or break downs. For example, in time, users can roll-up and view data for a month or users can roll-up and view numbers view-to-date. For KPIs, users can roll-up KPIs into a number organizing them into a number of different ways. For example, users may ask questions such as \u201cshow me all KPIs of a particular type\u201d, \u201cshow me KPIs that belong to a particular scorecard\u201d or, \u201cshow me KPIs that support a particular strategic objective\u201d.","The cube  has measures . The measures  of the cube  shown in  are the actual values, the target values, the prorated target values, the tolerance values, the scores that the loader  calculated to allow the performance monitoring system  to relatively assess good or bad and improved or degraded in performance. The cube  also supports user defined measures. Different KPIs can have different user defined measures. Users may have forecasts that they want to have displayed in the performance monitoring system  or they use the forecasts for benchmarks. For example, if a newspaper states that inventory turns for a particular industry should be 10, users may store this value as a benchmark value in this cube as a user defined attribute. Other measures may be a score change amount and value change amount. The score change amount is used to drive the reporting of improvement and degradation.","The KPI values  may also include cubes pre-aggregated by the loader process . The cube  contains a value for a predefined period. For example, if a user is looking at a year to date value, the performance monitoring system  does a direct read of that year to date value, rather than calculating the sum of values to date from the component months.","Referring to , the business metadata  is now further described.  shows a logical depiction  of the business metadata  and a physical representation  of how that would be stored in the database .","In the logical depiction , for example, there are three Indicators -. Indicators - can be associated with various other objects in the database , such as Critical Success Factors , . Critical Success Factor  is measured by Indicators  and , and Critical Success Factor  is measured by Indicators  and . Indicator  is associated with both Critical Success Factors  and . Thus, the objects in the database  are stored in a loosely defined network , rather than a strict parent-child hierarchy.","The network  contains not just Indicators - and Critical Success Factors -, it may contain other different types of objects to enable exploring Indicators by various angles of business. For example, in , the network  also contains Initiative  which is measured by Indicators  and , and Initiative  which is measured by Indicators  and . Also, Objectives - are included in the network . Objective  has Indicators  and  associated therewith. Objectives - have their own associations: Objective  is associated with Objective  which is a parent of Objective .","The physical representation  is a relational data model  which describes this logical network . The model  comprises three tables -. In the centre, there is a content link table . Each content link in the content link table  describes a particular content object in the content object table  to which it is related. There is a row in the content object table  for each line in the content link table  and each line between each object.","The link type table  describes the type of relationship that exists between those objects. In certain cases it is possible to have a relationship between the same types of objects, but there may be a different type of relationship. An example of a different type of relationship is the cause and effect relationship. For example, a relationship exists between a KPI and a KPI that is a cause relationship, and another relationship exists between a KPI and a KPI which is an effect relationship.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","240","800","250","230","800","810","811","813","814","816","817","820"]},"When the web front-end interface  requests some data or a page of information, the request is fired off to the web server . The web server  is running the servlet engine . The generators - generate servlets . The generated servlets  perform the work for getting data and building web pages.","The servlets  access data from the database  of the KPI store  via the data access API . The data access API  calls stored procedures and functions  in the database  to get data  out of the database . Not all the data for the performance monitoring system  may be stored within the relational database  of the KPI store . Other web service  may be used to obtain data from other data sources, e.g., embedded link to data in other data sources. A servlet  extracts data from the web service  in a similar way to extract data from the relational database . It is desirable that all the data and pages requests are authenticated by the authentication layer , and the performance monitoring system  ensures that the requester is a valid user and also checks the data that the user is asking for to ensure that the user is authorized to view the data.

The consumer interface  provides users answers to different types of business performance questions, such as what is going on in their business, which processes are performing well or badly, and which products are getting better or worse. The consumer front-end interface  presents a structured view of those processes. Not only does the consumer front-end interface  gives a high level indication as to for which processes organizations are doing better, well or badly, the consumer front-end interface  also gives the users further information to do some analysis to try and understand the root cause of any anomalies. The consumer front-end interface  also provides the facility for users to capture annotations to describe any performance anomalies, and share insights into performance and insights into what actions they have taken to improve the performance.","Another aspect of the consumer front-end interface  is that it allows business users to create and maintain their own scorecards. Based on KPIs that are already existing, other new scorecards can be assembled. Also the users can use KPIs from cubes or other data sources. If a KPI exists in a data source, such as Cognos Power Cube, users can point to that KPI and specify it so that the KPI is included in the performance monitoring system . The consumer front-end interface  also allows users to register their own reports and external content that are relevant to KPIs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["960","910","960","962","964","966"]},"The viewer driven sorter  allows business users, i.e., viewers who are monitoring the performance information, to sort the performance information during the monitoring operation. Similarly, the viewer driven filter  allows viewers to filter the performance information during the monitoring operation. By providing the viewer driven sorter  and filter , all of the performance information in the KPI store  can be made available for the monitoring as they can be sorted and\/or filtered by the viewer to display the monitoring results of the desired information.","Furthermore, the metric selector  provides viewers options of several types of view formats or metrics, for presenting monitoring results. The metric selector  allows the viewer to select a preferred view metric type so that sorted and\/or filtered performance information can be displayed in the selected view metric  in an intuitive manner.
