The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present application is a national phase entry under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7371 of International Application No. PCT\/US2011\/067632, filed Dec. 28, 2011, entitled \u201cRESILIENT REGISTER FILE CIRCUIT FOR DYNAMIC VARIATION TOLERANCE AND METHOD OF OPERATING THE SAME,\u201d which designates, among the various States, the United States of America, and the entire contents and disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.","This disclosure is generally related to memory cells, and in particular but not exclusively relates to circuitry for register files to enable error detection and correction.","A register file (RF) is an array of registers, e.g., memory cells, in a central processing unit (CPU). The register file can be positioned between an instruction-generation portion of the CPU and an instruction-execution portion of the CPU to temporarily store operands, e.g., instructions and memory locations. Because of the role of the register file, an erroneous transfer of data from the register file can result in the CPU executing incorrect instructions or can result in the CPU writing data to unintended memory locations.","The registers in the CPU are typically random access memory (RAM) cells. Register files are generally used as low level caches, due to fast read and write operates as compared to last level caches. The registers include write ports and read ports through which data may be written to and read from individual registers, respectively.","Conventional techniques are provided that attempt to reduce erroneous operation of register files and related circuitry. For example, to ensure that various transistors in the related circuitry operate correctly and transfer signals adequately, manufacturers provide a guardband for CPU supply voltages, e.g., Vdd or Vcc, on a chip. However, guardband use in supply voltages decreases the energy efficiency.","Embodiments of a register file read path and related circuitry and methods are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are given to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments. The embodiments can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the embodiments.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. Thus, the appearances of the phrases \u201cin one embodiment\u201d or \u201cin an embodiment\u201d in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.","Disclosed herein is one or more embodiments of a resilient register file system which enables detection and correction of register file read path errors that may arise as a result of lowering guardbands on central processing unit (CPU) supply voltages. Several factors, such as Vcc droops, temperature changes, and transistor aging, have led CPU manufacturers to increase supply voltage levels by 10-15% above the minimum operating supply voltage (Vmin), so as to provide a guardband against dynamic variations in supply voltages. Often, the guardband ensures proper operation of the register file memory arrays against rarely occurring errors and is therefore a substantial contributing factor to processor energy inefficiency. The minimum operating supply voltage Vmin determines the processor energy efficiency because leakage currents through transistors are proportional to voltage across current conducting terminals of the transistors. Accordingly, operating the CPU at a 10-15% lower operating voltage could correspond to an operating power reduction of 20-30%.","According to one embodiment, the disclosed system converts sensing failures within the register file read path into sampling failures so that the failures are monitor-able from the register file read path. The sensing failures are converted to sampling failures by delaying the precharge of a local bitline during a local bitline evaluation time. By being able to monitor for the errors and then react to or correct the errors, one embodiment is able to eliminate or otherwise reduce the size of the guardband(s).","According to another embodiment, the disclosed system includes an error detection sequence useful for providing notification of detected errors in the register file read path. The notification of the detected errors is subsequently used to facilitate corrective action, such as flushing the instruction pipeline, refetching the value stored in a bitcell, raising the supply voltage, lowering the operation frequency, and\/or other action.","According to yet another embodiment, a performance monitoring sequence monitors the ability of the register file read path to operate at faster frequencies and lower operating voltages. The performance monitoring sequence provides information that is indicative of the performance of the register file read path.","One embodiment provides an apparatus that includes: at least one bit

path subsystem , or register file circuit, includes a local bitline (LBL) stage  and a global bitline (GBL) stage . The read path subsystem  of one embodiment is configured to convert a sensing failure to a sampling failure that is detectable by error detection circuitry discussed below.","The local bitline stage  includes bitcells , (collectively ), a local bitline charge equalizer , and a bitline voltage sense circuit . Each bitcell includes a local bitline , one or more discharge transistors , a precharge transistor , and one or more local bitline keeper transistors . While, only two bitcells  are shown, it is within the scope of the disclosure to have more or less bitcells  within the local bitline stage . Additionally, while a single bitcell may be referenced herein, the disclosure may apply to cells that are not specifically referenced.","Each bitcell includes the local bitline that may be selectively discharged with discharge transistors . According to one embodiment, the discharge transistors may include N-type metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) that selectively couple the bitline to a ground reference. The discharge transistors may selectively couple the bitline to the ground reference in response to one or more signals, such as a read wordline (RWL) signal and\/or a bitnode selection (Bit) signal.","The signal timing diagram  of  illustrates an example discharge of the local bitline in response to the read wordline (RWL) signal, according to one embodiment. In particular, during clock cycle H the read wordline signal transitions from LOW to HIGH, thereby turning on one or more discharge transistors and discharging the local bitline (LBL).","Referring back to , the local bitline may be selectively charged with the precharge transistor . The precharge transistor selectively couples the local bitline to a voltage reference, e.g., Vcc, in response to a delayed local bitline precharge signal (DEL-LBL-PCH). The delayed local bitline precharge signal may be configured to precharge the local bitline and may additionally be configured to selectively delay precharging the local bitline . According to one embodiment, the delayed local bitline precharge signal delays precharging the local bitline if a dynamic variation, such as a voltage droop, affects the supply voltage, such as Vcc.","The signal timing diagram  of  illustrates an example of charging the local bitline in response to the delayed local bitline precharge (DEL-LBL-PCH) signal. In particular, during clock cycle L the delayed local bitline precharge signal transitions from HIGH to LOW, thereby turning on precharge transistor and charging the local bitline (LBL) . A time shift of the falling edge of the delayed local bitline precharge signal is illustrated in timing cycle L and will be addressed in more detail below.","The one or more local bitline keeper transistors are configured to selectively pull the voltage level of the local bitline up to the level of the supply voltage. The keeper transistors improve the noise immunity of dynamic nodes, such as the local bitline . The one or more local bitline keeper transistors may include P-type MOSFETs, according to one embodiment.","The local bitline charge equalizer  is configured to selectively equalize the charge across at least two bitlines  included in the local bitline stage . The local bitline charge equalizer  includes a signal selector  and a charge equalizer switch .","The signal selector  includes a control terminal, first and second input terminals, and the output terminal. According to one embodiment, the signal selector  may be a 2-input multiplexer. The control terminal is communicatively coupled to the bitline voltage sense circuitry  to receive a control signal NAOUT from an output terminal  of the bitline voltage sense circuitry . The first and second input terminals of the signal selector  are coupled to receive the delayed local bitline precharge signal (DEL-LBL-PCH) and the clock CLK signal, respectively. The signal selector  electrically couples the first input terminal to the output terminal while the control signal NAOUT is LOW and electrically couples the second input terminal to the output terminal while the control signal NAOUT is HIGH.","The charge equalizer switch  is configured to be controlled by the signal selector . The charge equalizer switch  includes a control terminal and two current conduction terminals. According to one embodiment, the charge equalizer switch  may include a P-type MOSFET transistor. The control terminal of the charge equalizer switch  is coupled to receive the output of the signal selector . The two current conduction terminals of the charge equalizer switch  are coupled to local bitlines , , and the charge equalizer switch  selectively creates a low resistance path between the bitlines .","In operation, according to one embodiment, the local bitline charge equalizer  maintains a low resistance connection between the local bitlines  while all local bitlines  are charged, or are charging. For example, if the control signal NAOUT is LOW and the delayed local bitline precharge signal (DEL-LBL-PCH) is LOW, then the local bitline charge equalizer  maintains a low resistance connection between the local bitlines . If, however, the control signal NAOUT is HIGH then the electrical coupling of the local bitlines  will depend on the clock CLK. According to one embodiment, the clock CLK is selectively transitioned from HIGH to LOW by the core of the CPU to decrease the charging time of one or more of the local bitlines  that has been discharged and read out.","The bitline voltage sense circuitry  is configured to sense the voltage level of the local bitlines . The bitline voltage sense circuitry  includes one or more input terminals coupled to respective local bitlines  and includes the output terminal  from which the control signal NAOUT is provided. The bitline voltage sense circuitry  is configured to determine if one or more local bitlines  discharges below a threshold voltage. The bitline voltage sense circuitry  transitions the control signal NAOUT from LOW to HIGH at the output terminal , in response to one or more local bitlines  discharges below the threshold voltage. According to one embodiment, the bitline voltage sense circuitry  is a NAND gate and the threshold voltage is a threshold voltage of a P-type MOSFET within the NAND gate.","The global bitline (GBL) stage  receives the control signal NAOUT from the local bitline stage  and provides notification of data sampling errors. The global bitline stage  includes a set dominant latch (SDL) , a global bitline charge equalizer , global bitline precharge transistors , , global bitline discharge transistors , , and an error detection sequence .","The set dominant latch  is responsive to global bitlines , (collectively ) and clock signals , . If one or more of the global bitlines  are discharged, the set dominant latch  transitions an output signal SDLOUT from a first voltage level to a second voltage level on an output terminal . According to one embodiment, the first voltage level is LOW and the second voltage level is HIGH. According to another embodiment, the set dominant latch  resets the output signal SDLOUT to LOW on a subsequent rising or falling edge of at least one of the clock signals .","The global bitlines  are discharged by the global bitline discharge transistors  and are charged by the global bitline precharge transistors . The global bitline discharge transistors  selectively couple the global bitlines  to ground in response to the control signal NAOUT that is received from the local bitline stage . The global bitline precharge transistors  charge the global bitlines  in response to a delayed global bitline precharge signal (DEL-GBL-PCH). Selectively charging and discharging the global bitlines  in response to the control signal NAOUT propagates LOW and HIGH voltage levels, e.g., data, stored on local bitlines  to the set dominant latch .","The global bitline charge equalizer  selectively equalizes the global bitlines . The global bitline charge equalizer  includes a signal selector  and a charge equalizer switch . The global bitline charge equalizer  operates in a manner similar to the local bitline charge equalizer . Accordingly, further explanation of the global bitline charge equalizer  will not be provided herein.","The error detection sequence  receives the output signal SDLOUT from the set dominant latch  and uses clock-responsive devices to generate notification of sampling errors, according to one embodiment. The error detection sequence  includes a first clock-responsive device , a second clock-responsive device , and a signal differentiator .","The first clock-responsive device  and the second clock-responsive device  are communicatively coupled to the output terminal  of the set dominant latch  to receive the output signal SDLOUT. The first clock-responsive device  and the second clock-responsive device  also receive a clock input signal CLK. The first clock-responsive device  transfers the output signal SDLOUT to a first clock-responsive device output terminal  on each rising clock edge of the clock input signal CLK, as a first clock-responsive device output signal DOUTFF. The second clock-responsive device  transfers the output signal SDLOUT to a second clock-responsive device output terminal  while the input signal CLK is HIGH, as a second clock-responsive device output signal DOUT. According to one embodiment, the first clock-responsive device may be a positive edge-triggered D flip-flop, and the second clock-responsive device may be a positive level-triggered D latch.","The signal differentiator  is configured to provide a notification of differences between the output signals DOUTFF and DOUT. Inputs of the signal differentiator  are communicatively coupled to the first clock-responsive device output terminal  and the second clock-responsive device output terminal . The signal differentiator  outputs an error signal ERROR while the output signals DOUTFF and DOUT are different voltage levels. According to one embodiment, the signal differentiator  transitions the error signal ERROR from LOW to HIGH to indicate that a sampling error has occurred. According to another embodiment, the signal differentiator  is an XOR gate. In sum, the signal differentiator  provides notification that one clock-responsive device has captured or sampled data differently than the other clock-responsive device.","The signal timing diagram  of  will be used to describe how a sensing error is converted to a sampling error and various other features, according to one embodiment.","As a result of reducing or removing the guardband from the minimum operating supply voltage Vmin, dynamic variations to the operating supply voltage may cause the read wordline signal (RWL) and\/or the bitline selection signal (Bit) to have a limited capacity for discharging the local bitline . Due to process variations, the small geometry bitcell transistors, such as discharge transistors and precharge transistors , experience significant threshold voltage (Vt) variation. At reduced supply voltages, such as if the guardband voltage is reduced to 0%-5% of the minimum supply voltage, the sensitivity of circuit parameters, such as read path delay, to the threshold voltage variation increases. Such sensitivity may limit successful register file read operation at low voltages. According to one embodiment, the guardband voltage is reduced to 0-1 V.","Within the signal timing diagram , a first period Tcycle-EDS illustrates an example of a sense error. The voltage level of the local bitline is discharged during clock cycle H in response to a HIGH read wordline signal (RWL). However, the output signal NAOUT of the bitline sense circuit  has failed to sense, detect, or respond to voltage level change of the local bitline . At the end of clock cycle H, the read wordline signal (RWL) transitions from HIGH to LOW, turning off the one or more discharge transistors ","Shortly after time T in clock cycle L, the delayed local bitline precharge (DEL-LBL-PCH) signal normally electrically couples the local bitline to the supply voltage at transition . However, by delaying the delayed local bitline precharge signal until transition  in the clock cycle L, as indicated by arrow , the bitline sense circuit  receives more time to sense, detect, or respond to the voltage level of the local bitline . As a result, the bitline sense circuit  senses, detects, or responds to the voltage level change on the local bitline later in the clock cycle L, indicated by transition , rather than missing the change entirely. According to one embodiment, the dynamic variation in the operating supply voltage causes the voltage level of the local bitline to operate the bitline sense circuit  in a MOSFET weak inversion or subthreshold mode. According to another embodiment, the core of the CPU selectively delays the delayed local bitline precharge signal (DEL-LBL-PCH) if or while the core detects a dynamic variation in the operating supply voltage to increase the likelihood of sensing level changes to the local bitline signal.","The delayed transition  of the output signal NAOUT propagates through the global bitline stage  to produce notification of a sampling error. The transition  of the output signal NAOUT causes transition  of the voltage level of the global bitline (GBL) . The delayed global bitline precharge signal (DEL-GBL-PCH) is delayed from transition  to transition  by, for example, the core of the CPU so that both the discharge transistor and the global bitline precharge transistor are not simultaneously turned on. Transition  of the output signal SDLOUT occurs in clock cycle H after time T rather than during clock cycle L, as would occur during a non-error transition. As a result, the positive edge-triggered first clock-responsive device  transfers a LOW signal to the first clock-responsive output signal DOUTFF, and the level-triggered second clock-responsive device  transfers a HIGH signal to the second clock-responsive output signal DOUT.","The signal differentiator  receives the LOW output signal DOUTFF, receives the HIGH output signal DOUT, and generates a notification of a sampling error at transition . The notification of the sampling error at transition  indicates that the first clock-responsive device  has generated an output that is dissimilar to the second clock-responsive device . Consequently, the register file read path subsystem  has converted a sense error into a sampling error.","Converting a sense error into a sampling error, in addition to providing sampling error notification, enables other portions of the CPU to initiate corrective action. For example, in response to receiving notification of a sampling error in the register file read path subsystem , the core of the CPU of one embodiment may repeatedly re-fetch the same instruction until the re-fetched instruction is read without a sampling error. In another embodiment, the core may reissue the same instruction until the sampling error ceases, may reduce the operating frequency, may raise the supply voltage, and\/or may take some other action(s) in an effort to eliminate the error. Accordingly, the register file read path subsystem  enables read path error detection and correction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["500","500","502","504","502","300"]},"The global bitline stage  includes a performance monitoring sequence . The performance monitoring sequence  is configured to monitor two or more time-delayed phases of the output signal SDLOUT. The performance monitoring sequence  then provides one or more indications that correspond to how much more quickly the read path subsystem  may be operated.","The performance monitoring sequence  includes a first clock-responsive device , a second clock-responsive device , delay devices , and a signal differentiator . The first clock-responsive device  operates in a manner similar to that described above in connection with the first clock-responsive device . The second clock-responsive devices  and the delay devices  generate a time-delayed version of the output of the first clock-responsive device . By comparing the outputs of the first clock-responsive device  and the second clock-responsive device  with the signal differentiator , the performance monitoring sequence  generates an indication of how much faster the output signal SDLOUT may be sampled before generating a sampling error. According to one embodiment, the performance monitoring sequence  includes a plurality of second clock-responsive devices  that are communicatively coupled to a respective plurality of delay devices . Thus, the performance monitoring sequence  may characterize how much more quickly the output signal SDLOUT may be sampled.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["600","500","600","602","604"]},"The normal scenario  shows that an output signal DOUT of the first clock-responsive device  and an output signal DEL-DOUT of the second clock-responsive device  are the same. Because the output signal DOUT and the output signal DEL-DOUT are the same, the signal differentiator  does not generate a pre-error output PRE-ERROR. Accordingly, the core of the CPU may increase the operating frequency or decrease the supply voltage because a time margin, based on the duration of the delay devices , exists on the output signal SDLOUT.","The pre-error scenario  shows the response of the performance monitoring sequence  if the output signal DOUT of the first clock-responsive device  and the output signal DEL-DOUT of the second clock-responsive device  are different. Because the output signal SDLOUT did not have a time margin that is equal to or greater than the delay of delay device , the output signal DEL-DOUT fails to sample the output signal DEL-DOUT at time T, and the signal differentiator  generates a pre-error output PRE-ERROR. Accordingly, the core of the CPU may maintain or decrease performance characteristics of the read path subsystem  based on the limited sampling margin of the output signal SDLOUT. According to one embodiment, the CPU increases performance characteristics in response to the normal scenario, and the CPU maintains performance characteristics in response to the pre-error scenario.","Embodiments of the register file read paths  and  described herein may be used in a number of implementations and applications.
