title: Method of remotely controlling a user interface
abstract: A method of remotely controlling a user interface which includes peer-peer client/server software modules that allow the user interface on a host computer to be displayed by a remote terminal. The method includes the steps of sending a request to a host application of a first computer to establish a remote control session by a second computer over a network connection between the first and second computers, establishing a communication session between a user interface server of the first computer and a user interface client of the second computer, sending a current presentation of the host application rendered by a user interface engine to the user interface client by the user interface server, wherein the presentation includes visual display information displayed on a display of the first computer, rendering the presentation by a user interface engine of the second computer, sending user interface events from the user interface client to the user interface server, and calling the user interface engine of the first computer by the user interface server to report the user interface events.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention relates to self-service kiosks and more specifically to a method of remotely controlling a user interface.","Self-service checkout operators need the ability to intervene with transactions at the self-service checkout lane from time to time. Such conditions include security alerts, customer help requests, and special transaction requirements, such as discounts or markdowns. The problem presented stems from the fact that the operator must either walk to the lane to assist the customer, or take an action at the remote attendant station.","Typical remote control software is directed to display and input information only. Such software relies on the operating system display services of a host computer and a remote computer. Also, display settings must typically be the same for the host and remote computers. Such software causes a pixel-by-pixel representation of the host computer's user interface to be displayed on the remote computer.","Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a method of remotely controlling a user interface of a computer without the limitations of known remote control software.","In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, a method of remotely controlling a user interface is provided.","The method includes the steps of sending a request to a host application of a first computer to establish a remote control session by the second computer over a network connection between the first and second computers, establishing a communication session between a user interface server of the first computer and a user interface client of the second computer, sending a current presentation of the host application rendered by a user interface engine of the first computer to the user interface client of the second computer by the user interface server of the first computer, wherein the presentation includes visual display information displayed on a display of the first computer, rendering the presentation of the host application by a user interface engine of the second computer, sending user interface events from the user interface client of the second computer to the user interface server of the first computer, and calling the user interface engine of the first computer by the user interface server to report the user interface events.","It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a method of remotely controlling a user interface.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of remotely controlling a user interface that allow a host application's user interface to be remotely presented and controlled by an application running on a remote computer via a network connection.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of remotely controlling a user interface that presents audio and other information besides the current state of display information and input information from the host computer.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of remotely controlling a user interface that do not rely on operating system display services of the host and the remote computer.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of remotely controlling a user interface that do not require like resolutions or a pixel-by-pixel representation of the host's user interface to be displayed on the remote user interface.","Turning now to , system  includes host computer system  and remote computer system . Host computer system  may include a self-service checkout terminal and remote computer system  may include an attendant terminal for monitoring self-service checkout terminals.","Host computer system  and remote computer system  are preferably connected via network .","Host computer system  includes processor , display , input device , and speaker .","Processor  executes host application , user interface engine , user interface server , and network transport agent .","Host application  is a primary checkout application, such as a self-service checkout application. Host application  facilitates scanning, bagging weighing, and purchasing of products by a customer. Host application  also performs remote control functions on host computer system .","User interface engine  is a software module that controls a presentation on host computer system  and sends the presentation to remote computer system  under control of host application . User interface engine  causes display information from host application  to be displayed by display  via operating system services. The display information is in terms of content and context rather than in terms of display attributes and rendering. User interface engine  is responsible for ensuring that the display information is rendered and displayed properly, in a format compatible with host computer system .","The concept of a \u201cpresentation\u201d is important to the uniqueness of the invention since it represents an abstract view of user interface information at a specific point in time. The way the user interface information is displayed to the user of remote computer system  is important to remote computer system , not host computer system . Remote computer system  may display user interface information differently than host computer system , i.e., different fonts, colors, size, position); however, remote computer system  displays the same text. Existing display subsystems support creation of a presentation.","In a first example implementation, presentation information is expressed in terms of \u201celement\u201d objects, each of which represents a user interface artifact.","A second implementation uses a more conventional \u201cUser Interface Control\u201d implementation for presentation services.","Besides the state of a visual display, the presentation may include as well the state of playback of audio, video, or other media, as appropriate to whatever user interface information is currently being provided to a user of remote computer system .","User interface server  is a software module capable of sending a current presentation from host computer system  to user interface client  in remote computer system  over network , and accepting user interface events from user interface client  over network  and providing them to user interface engine  in host computer system .","An example of the type of user interface event accepted by user interface server  from user interface client  includes input operations completed by an attendant using input device , which may include a keyboard, pointing device, or both.","From a client\/server perspective, user interface server  and user interface client  are peers to each other, such that user interface client  acts as a consumer of presentations from user interface engine , and user interface server  acts as a consumer of user interface events from user interface engine .","As the corollary, user interface client  acts as a provider of user interface events from user interface engine , and user interface server  acts as a provider of presentations from user interface engine .","User interface server  implements each interface required to allow user interface engine  to send its abstract state to user interface engine . User interface client  implements each interface required to allow user interface client  to send user interface events to user interface engine . A typical implementation would involve an API (application programming interface) set that allows events to travel in both directions. User interface display data travels in one direction and user input data travels in the other. Any API implementation that allows user interface display data to be transmitted between user interface server  and network transport  may be used on the host side, and any implementation that allows user input data to be transmitted between user interface engine  and user interface client  on the client side.","Network transport agent  is a software module capable of sending and receiving user interface information, in the form of presentations and user interface events, between user interface server  and user interface client .","Remote computer system  includes processor , display , input device , and speaker .","Processor  executes remote application , user interface engine , user interface server , and network transport agent .","Remote application  performs remote control functions on host computer system . Specifically, remote application  renders a current presentation from host application  and remotely controls host computer  by sending user interface events (e.g., inputs made by an attendant) to host computer .","User interface engine  is a software module that presents user interface information to the user of remote computer system  at the request of remote application . The display portions of user interface engines  and  are the same or functionally compatible display.","For example, user interface engine  causes display information from remote application  to be displayed by display  via operating system services. User interface engine  also causes display information from host application  to be displayed. User interface engine  is responsible for ensuring that both types of display information are rendered and displayed properly, in a format compatible with remote computer system .","While user interface engines  and  are required in host computer system  and remote computer system  respectively, user interface engines  and  need not be the same. Each merely needs to implement adequately similar presentation capabilities such that user interface information (e.g., display information and sound information) expressed to a user by host computer system  may also be expressed to another user by remote computer system . For example, if the presentation requires the display of a sentence of text, then user interface client  must be able to display the sentence of text in its entirety. If the presentation requires the rendering of a sound, user interface client  must have audio capabilities that allow the sound (or a functionally equivalent sound) to be rendered.","User interface engines  and  share enough of the same presentation concepts such that the data important to the user can be transmitted without regard to specific display position, resolution, size or other physical attributes. For example, if displays  and  are different in size or operate at different resolutions, user interface engine  is still able to display the same display information on display  as user interface engine  displays on display . In current implementations, this is accomplished by the understanding that there is a \u201cframe\u201d. A frame is a user interface context within which the same presentation layout is used, regardless of content. User interface server  passes frame information to user interface client  which passes and possibly translates or adapts the frame information from user interface engine  into a format understood by user interface client .","As explained above in connection with the operation of user interface server , user interface client  is a software module capable of accepting user interface information from user interface engine  of host computer system , and sending user interface information from user interface engine  of remote computer system . User interface client  is responsible for providing the user interface information from user interface server  to user interface engine  in such a way that user interface engine  will present the user interface data correctly to the remote user.","Similar to network transport agent , network transport agent  is a software module capable of sending and receiving user interface information between user interface server  and user interface client .","Turning now to , the method of the present invention is illustrated beginning with START .","In step , remote application  sends a request to host application  to establish a remote control session.","In step , host application  initiates a request to user interface server  to establish a connection to user interface client .","In step , user interface server  and user interface client  establish a communication session.","In step , user interface server  sends a current presentation on host computer system  to user interface client .","In step , user interface client  makes calls to user interface engine  to render the presentation sent from the remote host.","In step , user interface client  sends any waiting user interface events to user interface server .","In step , user interface server  makes calls to user interface engine  to report the user interface events.","In step , the method continues with steps - repeating until the session is closed.","In step , operation ends.","The addition of a software layer including user interface server  and user interface client  provides advantages not found in other systems. This software layer provides remote control over a user interface with minimal impact on network bandwidth. It eliminates dependence upon a particular display scheme. New features of host application  can be presented to a remote user without changes to remote application .","The invention differs from standard remote control software in that it does not rely on operating system display services of both host computer system  and remote computer system .","The invention further differs in that it allows the actual display presentation of remote computer system  to differ significantly from the presentation of host computer system , as in the case where the display resolution is higher or lower at one side or the other. It does not require a pixel-by-pixel representation of the user interface of host computer system  to be displayed by remote computer system .","Although the present invention has been described with particular reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, variations and modifications of the present invention can be effected within the spirit and scope of the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Additional benefits and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which this invention relates from the subsequent description of the preferred embodiments and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
