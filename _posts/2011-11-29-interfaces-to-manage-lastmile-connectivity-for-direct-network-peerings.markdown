{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS","CONCLUSION"],"p":["Many companies and other organizations operate computer networks that interconnect numerous computing systems to support their operations and the services they provide to their end customers distributed worldwide. For example, data centers housing significant numbers of interconnected computing systems have become commonplace, such as private data centers that are operated by and on behalf of a single organization, and public data centers that are operated by entities as businesses to provide computing resources to customers. In many cases providers set up large networks that may logically span several regions or even countries, and may include numerous data centers with varying levels of services and facilities available, utilized together to provide a unified set of services to their end customers.","In some data centers that have been set up to provide computing and\/or storage facilities to remote clients, the set of computational resources at the data center may be dynamically divided into resource pools, with each pool being made available for exclusive use by a given client for designated periods of time. There are a number of alternatives available for how the consumers of these facilities establish network connectivity to the resource pools that have been designated for their use. The customer requests may originate from a wide variety of devices\u2014desktop personal computers, laptops, client-office servers, tablets, smart phones and the like. These devices may use either long-lasting network links (e.g., using a client office network with a T1 connection) to communicate with their proximate private network and\/or the public Internet, or they may have transient connectivity (e.g., in the case where the customer uses a mobile smart phone). The proximate networks to which the customer devices are directly connected may in turn route request traffic to the provider network's data centers over a wide variety of paths. Such paths in many cases may have somewhat unpredictable performance, reliability and security characteristics.","For some casual types of service requests, such as a request from a customer to read a recent news article from a web-based news provider, a reasonable variation in responsiveness and an occasional dropped connection may be acceptable. However, for many business-related data transmissions, such as stock quote services and stock purchase order services provided by online stock traders, or for high-bandwidth software package deployments originating at a software development center, more stringent performance, reliability and security needs may exist. In such environments, a customer of the provider network may need a greater level of network isolation and control than is generally available over the public Internet. For example, the customer may wish to establish, if possible, dedicated physical network links between the customer's own network and the provider network, such that the only traffic transmitted over those links is traffic generated on behalf of the customer and in accordance with policies established by the customer. Furthermore, to meet quickly changing business needs, customers may want the ability to enable and disable such dedicated links dynamically and with a minimum of effort and delay.","While embodiments are described herein by way of example for several embodiments and illustrative drawings, those skilled in the art will recognize that embodiments are not limited to the embodiments or drawings described. It should be understood, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit embodiments to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope as defined by the appended claims. The headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not meant to be used to limit the scope of the description or the claims. As used throughout this application, the word \u201cmay\u201d is used in a permissive sense (i.e., meaning having the potential to), rather than the mandatory sense (i.e., meaning must). Similarly, the words \u201cinclude,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d and \u201cincludes\u201d mean including, but not limited to.","Various embodiments of methods and apparatus for using interfaces such as application programming interfaces (APIs) to manage dedicated network connectivity between customer networks and provider networks are described. Networks set up by an entity such as a company or a public sector organization to provide one or more services accessible via the Internet (such as various types of cloud-based computing or storage) to a distributed set of clients may be termed provider networks in this document. Such a provider network may include numerous data centers hosting various resource pools, such as collections of computer servers, storage devices, networking equipment and the like, needed to implement and distribute the services offered by the provider.","In order to extend the geographical areas over which its services can be accessed with desired levels of performance, reliability and security, an operator of a provider network may establish dedicated private network paths between its data centers and one or more routers that are physically located at a facility remote from the data centers. The facilities at which these routers are housed are termed \u201crouter co-location facilities\u201d in this document, as they may sometimes house routers and other network equipment owned and\/or managed by business entities other than the provider network's operator, such as by independent network service providers or by the clients themselves. Routers owned or managed by, or on behalf of, the provider network operator at the router co-location facilities are called \u201cendpoint\u201d routers in this document, as they may represent the furthest points to which the provider network's control or ownership of network equipment extends. For example, only traffic that has passed through a device owned or managed by the provider network operator, and therefore complies with policies set by the provider network operator, may be allowed on the private paths between the endpoint routers and other components of the provider network. In some embodiments one or more other routers at the router co-location facilities may be part of a client network\u2014i.e., such routers may owned and\/or managed by or on behalf of the clients, or the other routers may have private connectivity to the systems at which clients of the provider network generate service requests for the provider network. These other routers are termed \u201cclient-side\u201d routers in this document.","In order to facilitate the management of network connectivity between the client networks and the provider network, in some embodiments a connectivity coordinator responsible for implementing one or more programmatic interfaces through which connectivity-related requests from clients are handled may be set up. A variety of different kinds of connectivity-related requests, such as requests to discover the types of connectivity options that may be accessible, requests to select a particular connectivity option or service, requests to set up or dismantle a physical link, and the like may be made available through the interface in different implementations. The interface may be exposed to the client in many different ways in various embodiments: for example, as an API, through a graphical user interface, a web page or web site, or even as a collection of commands that can be issued from a computer system's command-line prompt.","In one embodiment, one or more collections or pools of resources at a data center may be allocated for use by a particular client, i.e., to implement functionality needed to satisfy services requested from devices of the client network. In such an embodiment, a connectivity coordinator may be operable to receive a request to establish dedicated connectivity from a client to one or more of the resource pools. The connectivity request may be generated or formatted to conform to the interface implemented by the connectivity coordinator\u2014for example, it may be received via a web-based form submission in a case where the interface is presented to the client as a set of web pages. In response to the request for dedicated connectivity, the connectivity coordinator may select a particular endpoint router from among the set of endpoint routers of the provider network as the target router from which dedicated connectivity is to be provided to the requesting client. For example, the target router may be selected from the available endpoint routers at a router co-location facility geographically closest to the client's premises, at which the client has access to an existing client-side router. In some implementations the interface may allow the client to specify various details in the request that may help the connectivity coordinator choose an appropriate target endpoint router, such as one or more names and\/or addresses of router co-location facilities, a desired bandwidth, desired price ranges, and the like.","Having selected the target endpoint router, the connectivity coordinator may generate configuration instructions for one or more physical network links to be established to provide the desired dedicated connectivity, and transmit the instructions back to the client in reply to the client's request. The reply may also be generated to conform to the interface implemented by the connectivity provider: e.g., in a case where a web page with a form was used for the client request, the configuration instructions may also be specified as one or more web pages, or as links to documents accessible from the web site. The configuration instructions may, for example, identify a physical location of the endpoint router, a physical port of the target endpoint router, the rack in which the target router is housed, the kind of connector required for the physical link, and so on. After the client sets up the physical network link in accordance with the instructions, the connectivity provider in some embodiments may verify that the link has been set up correctly and send a confirmation message to the client indicating that the requested dedicated connectivity has been established.","Example System Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","105","110","110","120","120","120","112","120","112","120","100","114","115","132","132","132","120","170","170","170","170","170","170","170"]},"In the illustrated embodiment, two example client networks A and B representing respective clients of the provider network  are shown. Each client network comprises a plurality of client devices  (e.g., A and B) from which requests that are ultimately serviced at resource collections  may be generated. Such client devices  may include a variety of systems such as desktop or racked computer systems, laptops, notebooks, tablets, smart phones and the like. Some client devices  may be housed at client data office premises, client data centers, or client home premises in various embodiments, and others may be mobile devices with no fixed physical location. In the illustrated environment, the client devices  of a particular client have access to a client-side router\u2014e.g., client devices A of client network A are connected to client-side router A via path A, and client devices B of client network B are connected to client-side router B via path B.","Client-side router A in the example shown in  is housed at a router co-location facility A, where endpoint router A is also present, and client-side router B is housed at a router co-location facility B where endpoint router B is located. In general, a number of different types of paths to various components of data center , such as connectivity coordinator  and resource collections , may be available from client networks A in various embodiments. For example, a path  that does not include endpoint router A is shown in  between client devices A of client network A and connectivity provider ; such a path  may include various routers, gateways and devices of the public Internet, for example, which may or may not provide desired levels of performance, availability, reliability or other service characteristics required for some of the services provided by the provider network . Other paths similar to , but not illustrated in , may also be available to the resource collections  from client devices A and\/or B.","The connectivity service provided by connectivity coordinator  may include a number of techniques implemented to help clients of the provider network establish and manage dedicated network paths from the client networks  to the resource collections  in various embodiments. For example, a cross-network connection  including a physical link or cable between client-side router B and endpoint router B may have been established with the help of some of the features of the connectivity service provided by connectivity coordinator . The term cross-network connection, as used herein, refers to a physical network connection set up between two autonomous networks. For example, within the Internet, an autonomous network may be identified by a unique Autonomous System (AS) identifier\u2014a collection of connected Internet Protocol (IP) routing prefixes under the control of one or more network operators that presents a common, clearly defined routing policy to the Internet. In the illustrated embodiment, the connectivity coordinator  may be operable to implement an interface defining various connectivity operations available to clients, including establishment of cross-network connections such as connection , and establishment of logically isolated connections or paths using such cross-network links. The interface may be implemented using a variety of approaches: e.g., as an application programming interface (API), a web-based interface, other graphical user interfaces, or command-line interfaces, in different embodiments. Connectivity coordinator  may also make the interface known to clients using various mechanisms\u2014e.g., a notification detailing the interface may be published on one or more corporate web sites in one embodiment. Connectivity coordinator  may itself be resident outside provider network  in some embodiments, and in other embodiments it may be incorporated within the provider network .","Using the interface implemented by connectivity coordinator , a client may generate a request for dedicated connectivity. The client may, by making such a request, wish to indicate that a physical network link (similar to cross-network connection  shown in ) be established exclusively for a client network A to communicate with one or more resource pools , for any of a number of reasons such as better performance, higher reliability, enhanced security, or lower or more predictable cost. The exclusivity requirement may indicate that only traffic to or from a specified set or sets of network addresses in the client's network should be allowed over the requested dedicated physical network link. The set or sets of physical addresses may be identified and\/or modified by the client after the physical link has been set up in some implementations, i.e., they may not have to be specified prior to the initial establishment of the physical link. The request may provide any combination of a number of different details that may be of use to connectivity provider  in various embodiments\u2014for example, the physical location of one or more client-side routers that could be used, a desired bandwidth and, or other service requirements. In some implementations specific service requirements may be provided in subsequent requests after the initial request to establish dedicated physical connectivity has been sent.","In response to receiving such a request, connectivity coordinator  may select a particular endpoint router  that may be appropriate to meet the requirements of the client. For example, the endpoint router that is physically closest to one or more client premises where the majority of client requests may be expected to originate may be chosen in one implementation. Having selected the target endpoint router to provide the dedicated connectivity, the connectivity coordinator  may generate a reply or notification comprising configuration instructions for a physical network link to be established to the target endpoint router  to provide at least a portion of the desired dedicated connectivity. The instructions may include a variety of elements in various embodiments, including for example a port number, rack identifier and the like to identify the target endpoint router. The instructions may also be generated in accordance with the interface\u2014for example, as the contents of a web page in an implementation where the request was received as a web-based form submission. In some cases multiple responses may be sent by the connectivity coordinator\u2014for example, a combination of one or more web responses to the requester, and one or more email messages, some of which may be sent to entities other than the client, such as the operator of the router co-location facility . The response or responses from the connectivity coordinator  may be used to set up the physical link needed. The time taken to establish the physical link may vary widely, depending on the responsiveness of the client, the responsiveness of the operator of the router co-location facility , and various procedures that may have to be completed for security, authorization and the like. After the physical network link has been set up, the connectivity coordinator  may in some embodiments transmit a confirmation message to the client indicating that the desired dedicated connectivity has been established. Various connectivity related information, including for example data identifying details of physical links such as cross-network connection , data identifying the clients for which such links have been established, the dates or times of establishment of dedicated connectivity, and the like, may be stored in connectivity database  in some embodiments.","In addition to the network paths illustrated in , in many environments there may be several other alternative network paths available between the client networks  and various components of the system . For example, some connectivity requests may be transmitted to the connectivity provider  over a path that includes public or shared links, and various services provided at resource collections  may be accessed over public or shared links as well. In some cases the alternative paths may serve as backups in case connectivity over the desired dedicated paths is interrupted.","Physical and Logical Connectivity Establishment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["114","162","120","201","114","105","114","114","114"]},"In one embodiment, the connectivity coordinator may provide a \u201cGetting Started Guide\u201d or some other similar documentation that may provide examples of how the interface may be used. The following list, with entries labeled API-1 through API-18, is a set of API call invocation examples that may be provided in such documentation for a subset of connectivity services provided by connectivity coordinator .","[API-1] CustomerId customerId=createNewCustomer(CustomerInfo customerInfo);","The createNewCustomer API may be used to create a customer account at the connectivity provider. It may take customer information (e.g., name, address, payment-related details) as input, and return a customer identifier.","[API-2] ConnectionRequestId requestId=requestDirectConnection(CustomerId

obtain an identifier for that connection object.\n\n[API-5] ConnectionInfo connectionInfo=getConnectionInfo(ConnectionId connectionId);\n\nThe getConnectionInfo API may be used to obtain the properties of the connection object, including such properties as the physical location of a router, a port number, traffic usage metrics, etc.\n\n[API-6] PhysicalConnectionInfo

to request that a logical connection be removed permanently.","Turning again to , the next high-level step illustrated at  is the establishment of a client account, which may be used for example for billing purposes. In some embodiments the interface provided by connectivity coordinator  may be used (such as via an invocation of a createNewCustomer API or via a web interface that in turn invokes a similar API) to set up the customer account. In other embodiments the connectivity coordinator  may not be involved in account creation directly, and some other mechanism (such as interactions with an account manager component not shown in ) may be used to set up customer accounts.","A customer that has an account set up may use the interface implemented by connectivity coordinator  to first establish a physical link for the desired dedicated connectivity (entry  in ), and then establish one or more logically-isolated network paths that use that physical link (entry ). Finally, the functionality of the dedicated connectivity may be verified or validated (entry ), e.g., in some embodiments the client and\/or the connectivity coordinator  may perform one or more verification operations and confirm that the client's request has been satisfactorily implemented. Each of the high-level steps illustrated in entries ,  and  of  may involve several interactions and\/or operations at the client end and at connectivity provider , and further details of each high-level step are provided below.","Example Requests and Responses for Connectivity Establishment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["351","148","114","360","361","363","365","367","368"]},"The location information  may include details of a physical location at which the dedicated connectivity is desired: for example a street address where a client-side router  currently exists or where such a client-side router may need to be set up, e.g., with the help of a third-party network service provider. In some cases the client may simply list one or more cities or even states where portions of the client network  are located and request the connectivity coordinator  to provide a set of possible sites where a physical connection could be set up to serve the client network.","In some implementations the client may specify a desired bandwidth for the dedicated connectivity via bandwidth requirement . The interface provided to the client by connectivity provider may, for example, allow the client to choose among a discrete set of bandwidth choices such as 500 Megabits\/second, 1 Gigabit\/second or 10 Gigabits\/second, where the choices may be derived from the details of the specific networking hardware available for establishing a physical link to an endpoint router . For example, at some router co-location facilities, the choices for physical links may include 1 Gbps 1000BASE-LX (1310 nm) single-mode fiber connections over single-mode fiber, and 10 Gbps 10GBASE-LR (1310 nm) single-mode fiber connections over single-mode fiber, and the connectivity coordinator  may allow the client to choose between the 1 Gbps option and the 10 Gbps option. In other cases the client may be allowed to request any arbitrary bandwidth and the connectivity coordinator  may respond to the request by indicating the bandwidth it is able or willing to provide. In one implementation the connectivity coordinator may not provide any guarantees of bandwidth availability and instead, for example, indicate to the client that a best-effort approach will be used\u2014i.e., the connectivity coordinator will try to provide as much bandwidth (up to the customer's desired limit) as possible. In another implementation, the connectivity coordinator may indicate that more than one physical link may be needed\u2014e.g., if the customer requests 20 Gbps and the maximum bandwidth available over a single cable is 10 Gbps. It may also be possible to set up multiple physical links distributed over different router co-location facilities  in response to a single request for dedicated connectivity\u2014e.g., if a particular client has access to client-side routers A and B at respective facilities A and B, one or more physical links may be set up at each facility if needed or requested. The interface provided by connectivity coordinator  may allow clients to specify whether distinct physical locations should be used to provide the desired connectivity, and if so, how many locations should be used.","The client may in some embodiments also provide an availability requirement  and\/or a multi-path requirement . The availability requirement may be expressible in any of various metrics such as desired maximum network outage limits (e.g., one hour per year maximum outage time) or mean time between outages. A multi-path requirement  may indicate the number of physical links that should be set up between a client-side router  and an endpoint router . Multiple physical links may for example be requested for performance (e.g., so that traffic from the client network  may be load-balanced or otherwise distributed over multiple physical paths, thereby reducing network congestion), for higher availability (e.g., by providing multiple paths, an alternate path may be available as a backup path in case of a failure at one of the physical links), or a combination of performance and availability reasons. In addition to specifying how many physical links are needed, a client may also specify the manner in which traffic is to be distributed among them. In a case where two paths are requested, for example, the client may specify whether they should be established in an active\/active mode (e.g., where Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Multipathing is used to balance load across the two links, and in case of a failure, one link takes over the other's traffic), or in active\/standby mode where only one of the links is in use at a time, and the second link is activated only in the event of a failure at the first link. Default choices (e.g., active\/active) may be indicated via the interface to the client in some implementations, so that the client need not explicitly specify the type of multi-path setup if the client does not wish to do so. In some cases, indicating a multi-path requirement  may negate the need for (or contradict) an availability requirement , so the client may be allowed to specify only one of these two types of options.","In one embodiment, in order for example to further simplify the tasks that the client may need to do to establish connectivity at their end, or to optimize performance, the connectivity coordinator  may also be able to provide configuration instructions, suggestions, and\/or preferred settings for the specific type of networking equipment that the client may have. In such an environment, a client may provide client network equipment information  to connectivity coordinator , which may for example consult a database of configuration data (e.g., database ) to look up configuration instructions for the equipment, and provide configuration suggestions or instructions to the client. If a client indicates via information  that they wish to use a particular type or class of router from a particular vendor (e.g., a Cisco router, a Juniper router, or a Yamaha router), for example, the connectivity coordinator may be able to provide vendor-specific configuration hints for the particular type of router or for a particular version of software running on that particular router. Such hints may include examples of how to configure or verify BGP settings, tunneling-related settings, IKE (Internet Key Exchange) settings, and may also include instructions on how to test that the particular vendor's device is operating effectively. Troubleshooting hints and\/or tuning hints such as preferred buffer sizes and the like that may be vendor-specific and\/or device-specific may also be provided by connectivity coordinator  in some embodiments. Since at least in some environments the provider network  may have a large number of clients using a wide variety of networking equipment, the connectivity coordinator  may be able to build up a knowledge base covering a wide variety of networking equipment configurations, the kinds of client-side settings that work best with the provider network's own equipment, and so on, which may be very helpful clients that are embarking on the process of linking their client networks  to the provider network . In some implementations, additional specifications  for the desired connectivity may also be included in a client request\u2014e.g., specifications of a desired start time or end time for the dedicated connectivity, or an acknowledgement that a particular BGP version and\/or Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) are supported in the client network .","In various embodiments information similar to that shown in  may be communicated in multiple steps to the connectivity coordinator \u2014e.g., first location information and desired bandwidth may be communicated, then the connectivity coordinator may provide a response with a list of possible options, and then from among the possible options the client may choose one option and provide additional specifications in subsequent messages. The information may be transmitted to the connectivity coordinator  from the client (or from a third party on behalf of the client) using any available network path\u2014for example a path  that may include portions of the public internet. Some or all of the interactions between the client and the connectivity coordinator  may be encrypted in various embodiments. In some cases where the client does not currently have a client-side router already available at an appropriate router co-location facility , further interactions may be required between the client and the connectivity coordinator , wherein for example the connectivity coordinator provides suggestions for third-party network service providers that the client may be able to use to obtain access to a suitable router.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["114","451","148","452","150","114","132","132","150","162","451","471","482","482","483","471","142","467","3","461","463","465"]},"In many cases networking equipment such as routers  and  are housed in secure environments where not everyone may have physical access. In such cases, authorization information , which may for example comprise a legally-binding agreement to allow a technician to access the endpoint router A may be provided to the client. In some environments a document similar to or derived from a commonly-used standard authorization communication format called \u201cLOA-CFA\u201d (Letter Of Authority and Customer Facility Assignment) may be used for authorization information . Authorization information  may itself include the physical link coordinates such as port identifier , cage identifier , rack identifier , and patch panel identifier  in some cases. The response  may also include a connection identifier  corresponding to the requested dedicated connectivity, which may be used in further communications from the client to the connectivity coordinator , such as a request for establishment of logically-isolated paths via the setUpLogicalConnection API described earlier and discussed further in conjunction with the description of  below.","In some embodiments the connectivity coordinator  may also provide configuration instructions  for client-side network equipment. Such instructions may be provided in cases where client network equipment information  was earlier provided to the connectivity coordinator , and may also be provided for a default set of devices (e.g., the most commonly used types of routers) even the client did not previously provide details of the client-side equipment in some implementations. Depending on the specifics of the endpoint router  selected for the physical connection, different sets of client-side configuration settings may in general be appropriate even for a given piece of client-side networking equipment, and the connectivity coordinator may consult its configuration knowledge base to choose the appropriate instructions after the endpoint router  has been selected.","As described earlier, authorization may be required to set up physical connectivity to an endpoint router  in some environments. In some embodiments, authorization information  may also (or instead) be sent to an operator  of the router co-location facility  by connectivity coordinator.

A unique ASN is typically allocated to each AS for use in BGP routing. ASN  may be public (i.e. may be exposed to various routers of the public Internet) or private (exposed only to routers of the provider network  and the client network ), depending on the type of logical connectivity the client wishes to establish in various embodiments. The client may also provide a set of network prefixes  to be advertised for the logically isolated network, e.g., in accordance with BGP or another routing protocol. Pairing information , indicating for example whether the desired logically-isolated path is to be paired in an active\/active or active\/standby mode with any other path, may also be included in request  in some embodiments. In some implementations the provider network may support establishment of virtual private gateways to support VPN (virtual private network) functionality between a client network  and resource collections , and request  may also include an identification of such a virtual private gateway to be used for the logically-isolated network path. In some embodiments Multiple Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) techniques may be used to implement logical network isolation. While the exemplary elements illustrated in  may be applicable in environments where BGP and related protocols are in use, in other embodiments other network isolation mechanisms (e.g. any other techniques usable for connecting to virtual private clouds or VPNs) may be supplied by the client and used by connectivity provider for logical network isolation.

In the embodiment illustrated in , connectivity coordinator  may be operable to implement an interface defining a variety of connectivity-related services, which may allow clients to easily determine which LMCPs  can be used to connect to provider network . Such an interface may further allow the clients to establish desired dedicated connectivity (e.g., over a direct path ) to resource collections  with the help of selected last-mile connectivity providers.

In other implementations the available LMCPs may be sorted according to any of a variety of criteria based on details of the client's request and on the connectivity coordinator's LMCP knowledge base.
