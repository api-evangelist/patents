title: Mounting bracket for GPS antenna
abstract: A bracket is provided for mounting an antenna onto a well disposed on a gun turret. The antenna (for receiving GPS signals) has an exposed dome and a connector extending underneath the dome. The bracket includes a substantially cylindrical housing that contains an internal chamber. The housing has proximal and distal ends along a longitudinal axis. The distal end has a first surface for attaching to the well. A flange disposed at the proximal end provides a surface onto which the antenna mounts. The connector can be inserted into the chamber. A male-threaded boss extends from the distal end to insert into a female-threaded well disposed on the turret.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy, and thus, the invention herein may be manufactured, used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates generally to mounting brackets. In particular, this invention relates to mechanisms for attaching a global positioning antenna to a tank turret.","The United States Navy has commissioned two class prototypes for a Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) intended for close shore fire support. In particular, the lead ships for these classes are the steel planing monohull U.S.S. Freedom (LCS-1) designed by Lockheed Martin, and the aluminum trimaran U.S.S. Independence (LCS-2) designed by General Dynamics. The Navy also deploys amphibious transport docks with the lead ship U.S.S. San Antonio (LPD-17). These classes can be reconfigured with interchangeable weapons modules for select plug-and-fight missions.","The Gun Mission Module (GMM) represents an exemplary surface warfare module package and includes two turret-mounted, axis-stabilized chain guns that can fire up to 200 rounds per minute of 30\u00d7173 mm ammunition. The GMM includes an Mk 46 weapons system having a gun turret.","Firing control for the GMM requires accurate and current information on relative global position. Such information can be provided by the global positioning system (GPS) that employs orbiting satellites for this purpose. The GPS information can be obtained from the satellite network using a receiver equipped with the appropriate antenna.","Conventional mounting devices for securing a GPS receiver antenna onto a GMM yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, various exemplary embodiments provide a bracket for mounting a GPS-receiving antenna onto a well disposed on a gun turret. The antenna has an exposed dome and a connector extending underneath the dome.","The bracket includes a substantially cylindrical housing containing an internal chamber. The housing has proximal and distal ends along a longitudinal axis. The distal end has a first surface for attaching to the well. A flange disposed at the proximal end provides a surface onto which the antenna mounts. The connector can be inserted into the chamber. A male-threaded boss extends from the distal end to insert into a female-threaded well disposed on the turret.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","120","210","220","110","210","230","210","210","240","245","210","250"]},"The dome antenna , with an outer diameter of 3.5 inches and a dome height of 0.70 inch, is available from Sensor Systems Inc. in Chatsworth, Calif., as described at http:\/\/www.sensorantennas.com\/antenna_pdf\/GPS\/1575-14,76,86,96.pdf. The dome antenna  weighs 7 oz and is composed of 6060-T6 aluminum and thermoset plastic, and covered with Skydrol-resistant enamel for protection from external weather exposure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["210","310","315","310","320","325","320","240","210"]},"The bracket  has an exemplary total length of 3.869 inches, including the flange  and the boss . The antenna  secures to the flange  by a corresponding series of through-holes  co-axial with the flange holes . These holes  and  can be arranged, as shown, in a cruciform pattern with opposing centerlines separated by 2.686 inches.","A threaded Neill Concelman (TNC) connector  protrudes beneath the antenna . The TNC connector  has an impedance of 50\u03a9 for connecting a coaxial cable to the GPS antenna . A plurality of #10 threaded bolts  (four shown in the exemplary cruciform configuration) pass through the holes  and  to be secured by corresponding nylon lock nuts , each nut  being separated from directly contacting the surface  by a corresponding washer . An opposing pair of flat surfaces  chamfers 0.375 inch from opposing sides of the outer diameter of the bracket  near its distal end for alignment to the turret . An o-ring  provides a water-tight seal between the bracket's distal end and the threaded boss .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","120","230","320","210","340","315","410","340","315"]},"The turret  includes a cover  for protecting the GMM interior . The cover  includes at least one opening in which an insert  can be attached. At the surface , the bracket  attaches to a female-threaded well  within the insert . The boss  threadably inserts into the well . The cable  passes through the chamber  and emerges through the cavity  into the interior  for communication with the GMM's guidance and control equipment. The cable  also passes through a longitudinal opening of the insert  into the turret's interior.","Various exemplary embodiments provide techniques to mount a Sensor Systems S67-1575-76 GPS Antenna onto the General Dynamics Mk 46 turret for the GMM. This device was designed to provide a mounting platform for a GPS antenna  onto the Mk46 turret . This process enables direct passage of the coaxial cable  attached to the antenna  into the turret  through the bracket . Such direct connection of the cable  to the TPC connector  on the antenna  eliminates the hazard of cable twist that can impose signal loss. There is no known GPS antenna bracket for the Mk 46 turret that allows for the GPS coaxial cable to be passed directly into the turret through the bracket.","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is, therefore, to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and various other features and aspects of various exemplary embodiments will be readily understood with reference to the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like or similar numbers are used throughout, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
