title: Computer system and method of controlling standby mode thereof
abstract: A computer system has a normal mode for performing its work in a normal and regular manner and a standby mode which progresses to a power saving mode after storing information about the state of the work in process in a memory. The computer system comprises: a power management controller generating a control signal with respect to the normal mode and the standby mode, and storing the power mode information about the respective modes; a power supply part supplying normal power in the normal mode and standby power in the standby mode depending upon the control signal of the power management controller; a standby mode storing portion storing information identifying the standby mode when the mode of the system is shifted to the standby mode; and a controller determining whether the standby mode identification information exists in the standby mode storing portion when the power mode information of the power management controller indicates the standby mode during the re-booting operation, and performing normal booting when no standby mode identification information exists in the standby mode storing portion. With this configuration, when power is cut-off from and then re-supplied to a computer system, a stable booting operation can be performed.

Technical Field","The present invention relates to a computer system, and more particularly, to a computer system which is capable of performing a stable booting operation when power is cut-off and then re-supplied to the computer system, and a method of controlling a standby mode thereof.","2. Related Art","As computer systems have increasingly been used, power consumption has increased accordingly. In this regard, a power management function has been employed in the computer system in order to minimize power consumption. For reduction of power consumption of the computer system and efficient power management, a display operation of a displaying apparatus is in suspension (idle) if no data is input from an input unit for a certain period of time, or a drive operation of a hard disc drive is in suspension (idle) if the hard disc drive makes no access to the computer system for a certain period of time.","A power management function called advanced configuration and power interface (ACPI) specification for managing power of a computer system has been recently proposed, in which the state of the whole computer system is classified into six states.","According to the ACPI, a power management state in a computer system is roughly classified into six steps of sleeping states S0 through S5. The state S0 denotes a normal state (full power on), the states S1 through S4 denote standby states where power consumption of the computer system is stepwise reduced, and the state S5 denotes a soft-off state in which power of the whole system is cut off (full power off). A power supply device for the computer system having the above-described power management function supports an ATX specification including a power supply mechanism comprised of a main power and a standby power. The power supply device supporting the ATX specification always outputs the standby power under the condition that external power is supplied to the computer system. The standby power is supplied to a power management controller of the computer system.","Here, the S3 state of the ACPI is employed to re-use the computer system promptly. In the S3 state, power is not supplied to computer hardware devices except for a system memory and a power management controller composed of volatile memories. The process in which the system proceeds to the S3 state is called a \u2018suspend-to-ram\u2019 process during which data in process is stored in the system memory, and the S3 state of the ACPI is stored in the power management controller.","Since a general booting operation is not implemented when the computer system is switched from the S3 state to the normal state, it is possible to re-use the system promptly. However, if power supply to the system memory is cut-off in the ACPI S3 state due to power failure, standby power for maintaining data within the system memory is not supplied to the system memory, thereby causing the data in the volatile system memory to be lost.","If power is re-applied to drive the system again in that state, the basic input output system (BIOS) checks the state S3 in the ACPI of the power management controller, and sends to the system memory a signal requesting data that was being processed. The BIOS is a program for managing data flow between peripheral devices (such as a hard disc, a keyboard, and a mouse) and a computer operating system.","Although the data stored in the system memory is lost due to the cut-off of the power supply, the BIOS continuously requests the data in process from the memory. As a result, the computer system enters a \u2018Halt\u2019 state and the ACPI S3 state information in the power management controller is maintained by a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) battery, even though the computer system is powered off and on, so that the computer system is unable to operate.","Thus, in order to escape from the \u2018Halt\u2019 state, after the computer system is turned off and its body is dismantled, the CMOS battery installed in the main board of the body should be removed to reset the power management controller. This procedure is extremely inconvenient, and it makes it inconvenient to use the computer system.","I have found that the \u2018Halt\u2019 state can be extremely inconvenient. Efforts have been made to improve control of systems.","Exemplars of recent efforts in the art include: U.S. Pat.

Other advantages and features will become apparent from the following description and from the claims.","While the present invention will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the present invention are shown, it is to be understood at the outset of the description which follows that persons of skill in the appropriate arts may modify the invention here described while still achieving the favorable results of this invention. Accordingly, the description which follows is to be understood as being a broad, teaching disclosure directed to persons of skill in the appropriate arts, and not as limiting upon the present invention.","Illustrative embodiments of the invention are described below. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail. It will be appreciated that in the development of any actual embodiment numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. As shown in  which is a block diagram used to explain a method of controlling a standby mode of a computer system according to the present invention, the computer system includes a power supply  for supplying a normal voltage of 3.3 volts (V) and a standby voltage of 5 volts, a memory  for temporarily storing data therein, and a power management controller  for controlling the power supply  and storing power mode information therein. The memory  is also known as second memory .","The computer system includes a basic input output system read only memory (BIOS ROM)  storing therein a program for identifying through a central processing unit (CPU)  whether various devices in a main body of the computer system are in place and are ready to operate, and then reading out an operating system from a hard disc so as to load it in the memory  when the computer system is booted, a flag memory or power mode storing portion  storing therein an S3 identification flag indicating the state of ACPI S3 mode (standby mode) at the time when the computer system is switched to the standby mode, and a controller  for controlling a booting operation in standby mode. The flag memory  is a volatile memory in which data is deleted if power is cut-off. The flag memory  may also be referred to as power mode storing portion  or as first memory . The BIOS ROM  is also known as BIOS .","A power management controller  stores the S3 identification flag in the flag memory  when a mode of the computer system is switched from the normal mode to the standby mode. The computer system according to the present invention checks the power mode information of the power management controller  when power is cut off and then re-supplied to the computer system. When the computer system is in the S3 state, that is, in the standby mode, the computer system re-checks the flag memory  to detect whether or not the S3 identification flag exists therein. Depending upon the detection result of the S3 identification flag in the flag memory , the computer system displays a warning message in the display part , or reads out data from the memory  during its operation to display that data in the display part .","Specifically, if the S3 identification flag is present in the flag memory  when power is re-supplied to the system after the power supply was interrupted, the computer system implements the standby mode booting operation. On the other hand, if the S3 identification flag is not present in the flag memory , this means that the S3 identification flag is erased due to certain problems, for example, power saving in the ACPI S3 mode. Thus, in this case, the computer system switches the power mode information of the power management controller  from the ACPI S3 mode to the ACPI S0 mode and implements the normal booting operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["30","2"]},"In , at step S, if the power mode of the system is switched from the normal mode to the ACPI S3 (standby mode), then the BIOS  switches the power mode information of the power management controller  to ACPI S3 mode. At step S, the power management controller  stores the S3 identification flag in the flag memory . At step S, the operating system stores data in process in the memory , and sends the switched standby mode signal (ACPI S3 mode signal) to the BIOS .","If power is cut-off, the standby voltage of 5V is not supplied to the volatile flag memory . Accordingly, the S3 identification flag stored in the flag memory  is lost. At step S, power is re-supplied to the computer system to re-drive the system. At step S, the BIOS  is driven in order to detect power mode information within the power management controller , to thereby determine whether the detected power mode is the standby mode. At step S, if the power mode information of the power management controller  is the ACPI S3 mode, the flag memory  is checked so as to detect the S3 identification flag.","Here, if the S3 identification flag exists in the flag memory , the BIOS does not implement the power on self test (POST) routine, and stores the operating system of the computer system in the memory. Then, at step S, the operating system wakes up the standby mode. At step S, the operating system reads out from the memory  data in process immediately before the system was terminated and displays that data in the monitor .","At step S, if the S3 identification flag does not exist in the flag memory , the BIOS  changes the power mode information from the S3 state to the S0 state. At step S, a warning message is displayed in the monitor  as shown in FIG. . At step S, the BIOS  proceeds with the power on self test (POST) routine, to perform a normal booting process.","With this configuration, the computer system is provided with the flag memory  indicating the state of ACPI S3 mode according to the present invention. When power is cut-off, for example, due to power failure, and then re-supplied to drive the computer system in the ACPI S3 mode, the computer system checks the flag memory  and then deletes the power mode information of the power management controller , to thereby prevent the system from being in the \u2018Halt\u2019 state, and accordingly, to enable the computer system to be booted in a safe and stable manner.","The above embodiment of the present invention, has been described as applied to a desktop computer. However, the present invention can be used for a desktop computer, a personal computer, or a portable computer. A portable computer can be a notebook computer, laptop computer, palm-sized computer, hand-held computer, wearable computer, or other type of computer. The wearable computer can be a computer that can be worn on a user's body or attached to a user's clothing. The display unit  can be a cathode ray tube, a liquid crystal display, a gas-plasma display, a light emitting diode display, an electro-luminescent display, a field emission display, or any other type of display unit for displaying varying visual information to a user.","As described above, the present invention provides a computer system capable of performing a stable booting operation even when power is interrupted due to power failure and then re-supplied to the computer system.","While the present invention has been illustrated by the description of embodiments thereof, and while the embodiments have been described in considerable detail, it is not the intention of the inventor to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail.
