title: Implementing a middleware component using factory patterns
abstract: In one aspect, a method to use a middleware component includes receiving a request from an application to interact with a platform using a service and using an abstract factory pattern corresponding to the service. The abstract factory pattern is associated with a first factory pattern stored in the middleware component. The method also includes determining if the first factory pattern is associated with the platform and invoking the service with the platform using the first factory pattern if the first factory pattern is associated with the platform.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A middleware component is typically disposed between an operating system and applications. The middleware component allows one application to interoperate with another application. The middleware component can also allow software components or applications running on different operating systems to communicate with one another.","In one aspect, a method to use a middleware component includes receiving a request from an application to interact with a platform using a service and using an abstract factory pattern corresponding to the service. The abstract factory pattern is associated with a first factory pattern stored in the middleware component. The method also includes determining if the first factory pattern is associated with the platform and invoking the service with the platform using the first factory pattern if the first factory pattern is associated with the platform.","In another aspect, an article includes a machine-readable medium that stores executable instructions to invoke a service on a platform. The instructions cause a machine to receive a request from an application to interact with the platform using the service and use an abstract factory pattern corresponding to the service. The abstract factory pattern is associated with a first factory pattern stored in a middleware component. The instruction also cause the machine to determine if the first factory pattern is associated with the platform and invoke the service with the platform using the first factory pattern if the first factory pattern is associated with the platform.","In a further aspect, an apparatus to invoke a service on a platform includes circuitry to receive a request from an application to interact with the platform using the service and to use an abstract factory pattern corresponding to the service. The abstract factory pattern is associated with a first factory pattern stored in a middleware component. The apparatus also includes circuitry to determine if the first factory pattern is associated with the platform and to invoke the service with the platform using the first factory pattern if the first factory pattern is associated with the platform.","A middleware component is used to isolate services (e.g., invocation, messaging, data persistence, logging and so forth) from platforms having different operating systems (e.g., a JAVA\u00ae2, Enterprise Edition (J2EE\u00ae) platform, a MICROSOFT\u00ae WINDOWS\u00ae platform, a Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA\u00ae) platform and so forth). However, there is a need for the middleware component to have easy flexibility and easy retargetability to allow applications to run on an arbitrary platform without any effects on the applications. Middleware tools currently exist but these middleware tools are not pattern based and do not have any flexibility. Also, existing middleware components are reimplemented to support additional platforms.","A middleware architecture described herein is a pattern-based middleware component that allows for easy retargetability to various platforms all while maintaining the isolation required by the services and applications. In particular, the middleware architecture described herein may be used in messaging services, data persistence services, service invocation services, logging services and so forth.","As will be shown herein, in an attempt to allow the middleware component to operate with an arbitrary platform, factory patterns were implemented. The factory patterns were not just implemented for a single platform, but for multiple platforms. Moreover, the factory patterns were implemented for each service for each platform thereby allowing the services to be isolated from one another. Thus, the middleware component easily maps to any platform. The middleware component with factory patterns allows for the ease of extension to newly developed or emerging platforms without a loss of access to existing platforms. As a result any service implemented through the middleware component will work on the emerging platforms as well as the existing platforms without modifying the services and\/or applications.","Referring to , in one example, a middleware architecture environment  includes applications  (e.g., an application and an application ) (sometimes referred to as business components), a middleware component , platforms  (e.g., a J2EE\u00ae platform and WINDOWS\u00ae platform ) and persistent data stores  (e.g., persistent data store and persistent data store ) fabricated by different vendors. In one example, the J2EE\u00ae platform includes a service locator component  (e.g., a JAVA\u00ae Naming and Directory Interface), a messaging services component  (e.g., a J2EE\u00ae JAVA\u00ae Messaging Service) and a logger component  (e.g., a JAVA\u00ae Logger Application Programming Interface).","In prior art approaches, each of the applications  would have to been rewritten for each new platform (e.g., to accommodate the different operating systems). As will be shown below, in the middleware architecture , the applications  themselves do not have to be rewritten for each platform ; but rather, additional instructions are added to the middleware component  in the form of factory patterns for each platform.","A factory pattern is a design pattern used in software development to encapsulate the processes used in the formation of objects that interface to the platforms. Thus, a factory pattern is associated with a particular platform. An abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of and invoke individual factory patterns. As will be shown herein each abstract factory pattern is associated with one of the services.","The middleware component  includes components used to facilitate services. For example, an invocation service component is used to facilitate invocation services, a messaging service component is used to facilitate messaging services, a logging service component is used to facilitate logging services and a data persistence service component is used to facilitate data persistence services.","The invocation service component includes an application delegate , an abstract factory pattern , factory patterns , , intercepting filters , and a fa\u00e7ade . The application delegate (sometimes referred to as a business delegate) is an agreed upon or industry interface between the applications  and the invocation services component for data received from the applications. The application delegate receives a request for a platform for invocation services and invokes the abstract factory pattern ","The abstract factory pattern is used for invocation services and is associated with the factory patterns , each tied to a specific platform used in invocation services. For example, for invocation services, the factory pattern establishes the interface to the J2EE\u00ae platform and the factory pattern establishes the interface to the WINDOWS\u00ae platform . The abstract factory pattern determines the appropriate factory pattern , corresponding to the requested platform.","The factory patterns , establish an interface with a corresponding component in the platforms . For example, the factory pattern establishes an interface with the service locator component .","The intercepting filters , provide compression and\/or encryption to data sent to a respective platform , . For example, the intercepting filter compresses and\/or encrypts data sent to the J2EE\u00ae platform and the intercepting filter compresses and\/or encrypts data sent to the WINDOWS\u00ae platform . The fa\u00e7ade  is an interface to the applications  for data received from the platforms  and is linked (e.g., directly) to the factory patterns (e.g., factory pattern and factory pattern ).","The messaging service component includes a messaging delegate , an abstract factory pattern and factory patterns , . The messaging delegate is an interface between the messaging service component and the applications . The messaging delegate receives a request for a platform for messaging services and invokes the abstract factory pattern ","The abstract factory pattern is used for messaging services and is associated with the factory patterns , each tied to a specific platform used in messaging services. For example, for messaging services, the factory pattern establishes the interface to the J2EE\u00ae platform and the factory pattern establishes the interface to the WINDOWS\u00ae platform . The abstract factory pattern determines the appropriate factory pattern , corresponding to the requested platform.","The factory patterns , establish an interface with a corresponding component in the platforms . For example, the factory pattern establishes an interface with the messaging services component .","The logging service component includes a logging delegate , an abstract factory pattern and factory patterns , . The logging delegate is an interface between the logging services component and the applications . The logging delegate receives a request for a platform for logging services and invokes the abstract factory pattern ","The abstract factory pattern is used for logging services and is associated with the factory patterns , each tied to a specific platform used in logging services. For example, for logging services, the factory pattern establishes the interface to the J2EE\u00ae platform and the factory pattern establishes the interface to the WINDOWS\u00ae platform . The abstract factory pattern determines the appropriate factory pattern , corresponding to the requested platform.","The factory patterns , establishes an interface with a corresponding component in the platforms . For example, the factory pattern establishes an interface with the logger component .","The data persistence service component includes a data access object (DAO) , an abstract factory pattern and factory patterns , . The DAO is an interface between the data persistence component and the applications . The DAO receives a request for a platform for invocation of data persistence services and invokes the abstract factory pattern ","The abstract factory pattern is used for data persistence services and is associated with the factory patterns , each tied to a specific persistent data store , used in data persistence services. For example, for data persistence services, the factory pattern establishes the interface to the persistent data store and the factory pattern establishes the interface to the persistent data store . The abstract factory pattern determines the appropriate factory pattern , corresponding to the requested persistent data store , ","The abstract factory patterns -, at runtime, load into memory the interfaces to the required platforms from the appropriate factory patterns -. By using the abstract factory patterns -in the middleware component, a defined platform at runtime is incorporated. Thus, if a system has three platforms to choose from, only the required middleware components (e.g.; factory patterns) are loaded into memory at runtime. To add additional platforms, one would only need to generate additional factory pattern code.","The following is an example of an abstract factory pattern:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"301pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"public class AbstractFactory"},{"entry":"{"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"287pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"private Hashtable<String, String> daTable = null;"]},{"entry":[{},"private static AbstractFactory instance;"]},{"entry":[{},"private boolean useJ2EEPlatform = false;"]},{"entry":[{},"private boolean useWindowsPlatform = false;"]},{"entry":[{},"private boolean useCORBAPlatform = false;"]},{"entry":[{},"\/**"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2009* AbstractFactory constructor."]},{"entry":[{},"\u2009*\/"]},{"entry":[{},"private AbstractFactory( )"]},{"entry":[{},"{"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"245pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"\/\/ Determine Platform to use.
