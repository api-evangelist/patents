{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This Patent application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/312,690 with an international filing date of May 21, 2009 now U.S. Pat. No. 8,114,358. The parent application is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and is made a part hereof, including but not limited to those portions which specifically appear hereinafter.","This invention was made with government support under DOD Contract Numbers W911QY-07-C-0005 and W911QY-07-CO117, respectively. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention as provided in the respective contracts.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to materials, apparatuses, assemblies and methods for treating air such as by removing one or more impurities from the air.","In one aspect, the invention relates to a material and\/or air cleaning apparatus and a method for removing impurities from the air, resulting in air that has been deodorized, dried, sanitized, treated, modified, improved and\/or otherwise cleaned of undesired contaminants. More specifically, such aspect may relate to an apparatus and a method that uses UV light to generate ozone, uses the ozone to destroy impurities in the air, and then uses UV light to destroy ozone so that damaging ozone does not contact the sensitive materials or surfaces being cleaned.","In another aspect, the invention relates to methods and assemblies for treating an atmosphere that has been exposed to a material within an enclosed space so as to remove impurities from the atmosphere. Such impurity removal may involve one or more of a treatment to sanitize, decontaminate, deodorize, condition and\/or dry the atmosphere, for example. Such methods and assemblies may employ UV light to generate ozone, the ozone in conjunction with UV light to destroy impurities in the air, and then uses a catalytic decomposer to destroy ozone so that damaging ozone does not contact the sensitive materials or surfaces being cleaned. In one aspect, the invention employs an integral ozone fuse to help ensure the treated atmosphere does not contain levels of ozone above desired limits.","2. Discussion of Related Art","A wide range of sports equipment is designed and used to protect the human body from injury. Equipment pieces are relatively large, bulky, oddly shaped, fitted with straps, and difficult to wash and dry. In soccer, a player wears shin guards and ankle guards to protect the lower leg. In hockey, a player wears knee pads, a chest protector, elbow pads, gloves, a helmet and hockey pants. In football, a player wears shoulder pads, leg and hip pads, a helmet, a neck roll, elbow pads and gloves. Bicyclists and roller blade skaters use helmets. Many sports require general or specialized footwear, such as cleats, sneakers, spikes, skates, roller blades and the like. Workers can wear similar equipment.","Protective equipment can be worn with direct contact against a skin or a head surface. Whether the equipment directly contacts the human body or is separated by clothing or a piece of cloth, sweat soaks into materials, such as pads, elastic material, straps, foam, and other materials. If not properly dried or cleaned, the sweat-soaked equipment becomes a site for growth of bacteria, mold, mildew, fungus, and other microorganisms that can spread disease, cause odor and\/or damage or discolor the equipment. The equipment and the bag, bin or other storage container can become malodorous. Odors from the equipment can emanate from or through the container and make unpleasant the corresponding room, such as a vehicle compartment. Merely blowing air across the equipment to dry the equipment can more broadly release odors from the evaporated sweat and moisture into the room, house or other compartment. It is desirable to have an apparatus and\/or method for drying, deodorizing, and\/or sanitizing equipment and\/or its surrounding air or atmosphere, quickly and conveniently.","Known products in the marketplace have addressed this need. Dhaemers, U.S. Pat. No. 6,134,806 describes a portable sport equipment bag having an air distributor connected with a hose to a blower and an ozone generator operable to move pressurized air and ozone into the air distributor. The air distributor moves the air and ozone into the bag to dry the sports equipment contained within the bag, to destroy bacteria, molds and fungus in the bag. The ozone directly contacts the sports equipment, which can be a serious problem because ozone can destroy many equipment materials, such as when the ozone exists in air at concentrations that are high enough to kill undesirable microorganisms. When well mixed with contaminated air, ozone can more effectively and efficiently oxidize contaminants. Also, ozone is a lung irritant and can leak out of the equipment bag and dangerously be inhaled, such as when the user opens the sports equipment bag. These safety issues can be serious enough to warrant alternative approaches.","Dhaemers, U.S. Pat. No. 5,369,892 describes a dryer in the form of an armoire with an internal drying chamber for housing articles that are subjected to heated circulating air, to remove moisture from the articles. Ultraviolet lamps within the drying chamber destroy contaminants in the air and on the air conditioning coils, in the drying chamber. A similar configuration is taught by Liang, U.S. Pat. No. 5,152,077, which is limited because contaminated materials must be in a direct line of sight of a UV light source, in order to be sanitized. The clothes alone can restrict exposure between the material and the UV light. Air that circulates in the armoire cannot be deodorized.","There is a need for a convenient, efficient, cost effective and efficient method and apparatus for drying, deodorizing and\/or sanitizing air and equipment, particularly without damaging the equipment.","Many other types of products can benefit from being dried, sanitized and deodorized, such as toys used at home or in commercial or institutional settings, including health care facilities, day care centers and\/or schools. The materials used in toys and stuffed animals make it difficult to clean them quickly and conveniently. Many toys need to be individually wiped with disinfectant to clean their surfaces. Disinfectants and wipes can be used to clean toys. These cleaning procedures are time consuming and burdensome.","There is a need for a method and apparatus for drying, deodorizing, and\/or sanitizing a variety of products, quickly, safely and\/or effectively, with minimal physical or chemical impact to the products.","Ethylene gas (CH) accumulates during the transport and storage of fresh fruits and vegetables and thus causes a problem for commercial agriculture and consumers. Small amounts of ethylene, sometimes less than 1 ppm, can induce fruit ripening, and can produce undesirable flavors such as bitterness, colors, such as yellowing or browning, and textures, such as softening, and thus can increase susceptibility to disease. Certain fruits and vegetables naturally generate ethylene during a ripening cycle. Other fruits and vegetables are highly sensitive to the presence of ethylene, but may or may not actually produce ethylene. The table in  lists some fruits and vegetables and known ethylene production rates and sensitivities.","The amount of ethylene that produces undesirable amounts or characteristics varies with different fruits and vegetables, but ethylene concentrations in the range of 0.1-10 ppm can produce a significant effect. There is a need for a system that removes ethylene from the air within a fruit or vegetable storage container while not damaging the fruits or vegetables.","Because there is significant industry value in maintaining fresh fruits and vegetables during transportation and storage, some technologies have been researched, developed and commercialized to control ethylene. These conventional methods and their limitations are shown in the table of .","There is a need for an alternative approach to ethylene control that would be less expensive, consume less power, and require less space.","It is an object of the invention to provide an improved method and\/or apparatus for treating an atmosphere exposed to a material within an enclosed space.","In one aspect there is provided an apparatus and method for oxidizing ethylene to carbon dioxide and water using UV-generated ozone.","In another aspect there is provided an apparatus and method for oxidizing ethylene to carbon dioxide and water using UV-generated ozone in conjunction with UV light.","It is another object of an aspect of the invention to produce ozone to destroy ethylene and then to dissociate the excess ozone back to oxygen, to maintain acceptable levels of ozone within a shipping or storage container, for example that carries fresh fruits and vegetables. According to one embodiment, at least a portion of the ethylene can be destroyed in each pass through a cleaning unit or apparatus in accordance with the invention so that the atmosphere in the storage container is cleaned by repeated circulation through the cleaning apparatus. As long as the rate of destruction of ethylene is higher than the rate of generation of ethylene in the storage container, the cleaning apparatus will reduce the ethylene levels to a desired steady-state level. By designing the cleaning apparatus to partially clean the atmosphere, and relying on recirculation of the atmosphere to reduce the contaminants to desired levels, the balance between system performance, volume and cost can be better optimized.","It is another object of an aspect of the invention to provide cost effective assemblies and\/or methods for better ensuring that ozone is not released into the ambient air in unsafe levels or amounts such as through an automatic shutdown of the assembly if the ozone level in the exhaust reaches a preselected threshold level or sums to a specified, integrated level over a particular period of time.","According to one embodiment, ethylene can be oxidized in an ethylene control unit and\/or in ambient air of the storage container, such as at a lower ozone concentration. This dual approach can maximize ethylene removal from the container air and\/or the produce packages. This dual approach can also minimize negative effects of ozone concentrations in an air handling system or in the produce itself. UV-generated ozone can also be used to remove additional pathogens that can degrade produce quality, such as with certain fungus or mold spores. Such an apparatus and method can meet application requirements of a wide range of container sizes and refrigeration or other environmental control systems.","Such a method and system can generate, use, and destroy ozone, for example to remove ethylene and\/or other impurities in the air or atmosphere within fresh fruit and vegetable containers. In one embodiment, ozone is both generated and destroyed by UV light rays. The ethylene removal apparatus and\/or method can be accomplished with a wide variety of known configurations of storage containers, air flow patterns and\/or refrigeration units.","According to such aspect of the invention, it is possible to dry, deodorize and sanitize materials and\/or the air or atmosphere that surrounds the materials. The materials can be sports equipment stored in a sports bag or an equipment bin, toys stored in a toy box and\/or fruits or vegetables stored in a refrigerator or produce storage container.","It is possible to clean, deodorize, and sanitize materials by circulating cleaned and conditioned air across the materials. The contaminants that are transferred from the materials to the air are treated in an air cleaning unit. The cleaned air is circulated back across the materials, such as in a convective manner. Air flow and\/or heat can be used to drive the contaminants from the materials into the air. The contaminants can be, for example, moisture, volatile matter, such as odors, bacteria, spores, dirt, or other gases, liquids and\/or microorganisms.","The contaminants that are driven into an air stream can be drawn into a compact, low-cost, effective cleaning unit where the contaminants are destroyed. The cleaned air can be re-circulated back to the storage container.","Also provided are a method and device to generate, use, and ultimately at least partially destroy the generated ozone for decontamination, deodorization, and\/or conditioning of the air and\/or the materials. The air cleaning unit can be positioned inside a chamber of various suitable configurations or designs. Air that requires treatment is drawn from the chamber into the cleaning unit, passes across an ozone generator, such as a UV bulb that emits light rays in the UV wavelength that generates ozone. In one embodiment it has been found that the combination of ozone and UV light serve to rapidly destroy contaminates within the cleaning unit. The clean air is then drawn across a second UV bulb that emits in the UV wavelength that destroys ozone. Alternatively, the treated air can be drawn across a catalyst to dissociate ozone to molecule oxygen. Clean, ozone-free air is then reintroduced to the storage chamber.","One or more additional treatment devices may be placed in the chamber to heat, dry, cool or dilute the air stream that circulates through the air cleaning unit.","There is also provided a method for at least one of sanitizing, decontaminating, deodorizing, conditioning and drying an atmosphere exposed to a material within an enclosed space. In accordance with one embodiment, such method involves circulating the atmosphere through an atmosphere treating unit. Ozone is generated within the atmosphere treating unit. The generated ozone mixes with the atmosphere in the atmosphere treating unit. The mixture of atmosphere and ozone is exposed to UV light in the atmosphere treating unit to remove at least a portion of the contaminants in the atmosphere. At least a portion of the ozone is removed from the UV light-exposed mixture of atmosphere and ozone to form an ozone-depleted containing an amount of ozone below a preselected threshold amount. The ozone-depleted mixture can then be appropriately exhausted into the enclosed space. At least a portion of the ozone-depleted mixture can be desirably recirculated through the atmosphere treating unit to remove at least a portion of the contaminants remaining in the ozone-depleted mixture. The exhausting and recirculating steps can be repeated until the ozone-depleted mixture exhausted into the enclosed space contains an amount of the contaminants below a preselected threshold amount.","The system of this invention, which includes the apparatus and\/or the method, can produce ozone to destroy contaminants and then used to dissociate the excess ozone back to oxygen in order to maintain appropriate levels of ozone within the storage container. The system of this invention provides a number of significant benefits compared to existing technology.","Circulation of air and ozone in the presence of UV light through a well designed unit can be more efficient at cleaning the air as compared to injecting gaseous ozone, at non-hazardous levels, into still or calm air or other ambient conditions. It appears that at low concentrations of ozone, random encounters with contaminants results in too slow of a process of contaminant removal. The reaction of ozone with ethylene or other organic gases is greatly enhanced in the presence of UV light. However, there can be significant benefits to combining both of these methods to maximize benefits obtained from the use of ozone.","This invention provides two opportunities to oxidize the odors and the microorganisms, one in an air cleaning unit, and the second, such as at a lower ozone concentration, in the ambient air of the storage container. This dual approach can better remove impurities from the air in the storage container and from surfaces of the materials. Ozone concentrations are relatively high in the air cleaning unit and the mixing rates between the ozone and the air is relatively high, and thus the oxidation rates of the impurities is relatively high. The air in the storage container can be quickly deodorized and sanitized. The concentration of ozone at the exit of the air cleaning unit can be precisely established. A very low concentration of ozone can be established in the storage container in order to sanitize surfaces of the materials, such as over a longer period of time. This dual approach can minimize negative effects of ozone concentrations in the air handling system or the surface of the sports or other equipment.","Throughout this specification and in the claims, the terms air cleaning unit and atmosphere treating unit are intended to relate to an apparatus for sanitizing, decontaminating, deodorizing, conditioning, drying and\/or otherwise treating, cleaning, modifying and\/or improving an atmosphere within a container.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["40","40","32","40","32"]},"As shown in , air cleaning unit  has structure , such as a housing, that forms zone , zone  and zone .

An experiment was conducted in which UV bulbs were used to generate ozone. In one test, the ethylene was added to the system upstream of the UV lights so that the ethylene would mix with the ozone laden air in the presence of the UV bulbs. In a second test, the ethylene was added to the system downstream of the UV bulbs so that there was no view factor of the reacting gases and the UV light itself. This experiment was conducted twice: once with one UV bulb energized and again with two UV bulbs energized.  shows the difference in ethylene destruction rate between these two test conditions. With one UV bulb energized, the fraction of ethylene destroyed was over 25% in the presence of UV light and almost 0% without the light present. With two UV bulbs energized, the fraction of ethylene destroyed was about 60% in the presence of UV light and less than 20% without the UV light enhancing the reaction rate. This experiment demonstrates that the presence of UV light significantly enhances the reaction rate of ozone and ethylene.","As shown in , for example, an outlet of structure  which forms air cleaning unit  is in communication with zone  and atmosphere  or the space of container . As shown in , material  is mounted, positioned or otherwise housed within container  so that material  is exposed to atmosphere .","Also shown in , air mover  can be used to circulate atmosphere . Any suitable fan or other air moving device can be used to create flow of atmosphere  through air cleaning unit . As shown in , air conditioner , such as an evaporator or any other suitable air conditioning device, is mounted within atmosphere  of container .","Container  can comprise any suitable structure that defines a chamber or other suitable space for accommodating material . Container  can be formed by a transportation trailer, a storage trailer, a storage bin, a bag, a shipping container, an equipment bin and\/or an expandable structure.","In certain embodiments according to this invention, the method for sanitizing, decontaminating, deodorizing, conditioning, drying or otherwise treating atmosphere  begins with generating ozone within atmosphere  passing through zone . Within zone , the generated ozone is mixed with the atmosphere  to enhance removal of undesirable contaminates or other elements of atmosphere . At least a portion and possibly the entire amount of generated ozone is removed from the mixed atmosphere  as it passes through zone .","It is possible to mix atmosphere  with the generated ozone within zone  and\/or zone . It is possible to continue to mix atmosphere  with the generated ozone as it passes through zone .","The apparatus of this invention can comprise a control unit, for example located at the exit of the evaporator. The control unit can comprise three sections, including a UV-light (187 nm) ozone generation chamber for generating a relatively high ozone concentration, a mixing zone for removing ethylene with ozone, and a UV-light (254 nm) ozone dissociation chamber for destroying ozone to a level desired for the atmosphere in the container.","The apparatus and\/or the method of this invention can comprise a controller or other suitable control system for managing or controlling ozone generation, mixing and\/or ozone removal.","In some embodiments of this invention, a controller, such as control  as shown in , can communicate or transmit signals through a wired and\/or a wireless connection to control any operating parameter and\/or function of air cleaning unit . In some embodiments of this invention, control parameters are based on timing functions of one or more UV sources . It is possible to control the apparatus and\/or the method to achieve desired results without requiring, for example, a relatively expensive ethylene sensor and\/or a feedback loop. Any control based on timing functions of UV source , according to this invention, can be relatively inexpensive and will require reduced maintenance and reduced replacement parts, particularly as compared to a sensor-based control system.","In certain embodiments of this invention, the controller can comprise a transport and storage mode and\/or a cleaning mode. In the transport and storage mode, air cleaning unit  can cycle with an evaporator. When an evaporator air handler operates, two sets of UV sources  can be energized to remove any residual ethylene from atmosphere . An override mode can start air mover  or any other suitable air handler, for example to begin moving air through the evaporator and\/or air cleaning unit , for a defined or chosen time period. The controller can then trigger the air handler to start and begin passing fluid through air cleaning unit , even if a thermostat or other sensor does not request or call for the evaporator to start.","In certain embodiments of this invention, during the cleaning mode, container  can be closed, with or without a lock and\/or an alarm, during a cleaning cycle. During the cleaning cycle, UV source  or another suitable ozone generator can be energized while fluid passes through air cleaning unit , such as for any preset and\/or calculated time period. After a defined or calculated time period for generating ozone is reached, UV source  can be stopped or not operated while air is circulated through air cleaning unit , for example for a time that is sufficient to expose atmosphere  and thus kill or remove molds, fungus, spores and\/or any other undesired contaminate. Any necessary time period can be calculated from a program of the controller and\/or from known data. After the defined and\/or calculated time period, UV source  can be started within zone  to remove ozone from the fluid flowing through air cleaning unit . This same function can be achieved with the use of a catalytic decomposer as an alternative to the UV source  in zone . With the use of a catalytic decomposer to destroy the ozone in zone , the cleaning cycle would utilize a bypass of zone  during the cleaning mode that would allow ozone build-up in the storage container. After the defined and\/or calculated cleaning period, the bypass would be closed and UV light  in zone  would be turned off. The circulation of atmosphere through the catalytic decomposer in zone  would clean the atmosphere in storage container of ozone.","After the cleaning cycle time period expires, the controller can signal and\/or activate to open any lock and\/or to deactivate any alarm. The controller can also be used to communicate with and learn information from any suitable sensor that detects a desired parameter or when the ozone concentration is at a certain level, such as when the ozone concentration falls below a level defined by any government agency and\/or other guideline recommendation.","According to this invention, a test facility to conduct ozone generation, ethylene removal and ozone destruction testing can include the following components: instrumentation, including a Thermo Fisher 49i ozone analyzer, a storage control systems electro-chemical ethylene analyzer, voltage and\/or current meters to monitor a power draw of lamps or UV source ; an ozone generator, including a UV lamp G24T6VH\/U ozone generator (180 nm wavelength, 25 Watts, 2.3 grams\/hour output); an ozone remover, including a UV lamp G24T6\/U germicidal lamp (254 nm wavelength, 25 Watts, 8.5 Watts UV output); and a stainless steel model container and flow system, including a container sized at \u215b scale, flow rates scaled to achieve up to 1 air change per minute, an axial fan positioned in a duct to move air through zones ,  and , and high vacuum stainless steel weld fittings to provide leak-free operation.","Turning now to  there is illustrated assembly  and, in particular, atmosphere treating unit structure  in accordance with one aspect of the invention. Atmosphere treating unit structure  includes: air inlet ; light baffles  (to ensure that no viewing angle would result in external exposure to UV light); UV light bulbs  that generate ozone; catalytic ozone destruction bed ; a set of flow baffles  and fan  to pull air through structure ; and various control elements useful in the operation of assembly , including bulb ballasts , on-off switch , system operation indicator , microprocessor  and safety switch , for example. Assembly  also includes suitable mounting elements or features such as shock absorbing mounts .","Thus, atmosphere treating unit structure  includes first zone  in which ozone is generated within the atmosphere and exposed to UV light, and second zone  in which at least a portion of the generated ozone is removed from the mixed atmosphere to form an ozone-depleted mixture. First zone  and second zone  are generally represented by respective zone boxes, shown via phantom lines in . Those skilled in the art and guided by the teachings herein provided will understand and appreciate that such depiction of the zones is not intended to necessarily limit the size, shape or dimensions of the zones or the placement or positioning of the zones. Furthermore, as for example herein described, such zones relative to each other, may be separated, adjacent or overlap, in whole or in part, as may be appropriate or desired for a particular application.","In such structure, UV light bulbs , used to generate ozone and to irradiate ozone mixed with the atmosphere, are oriented perpendicularly to atmosphere flow through the structure.","In particular embodiments, it can be desirable to expose the mixture of atmosphere and ozone to UV light of either 185 or 254 nm wavelength at an input rate of 0.5 watt per cfm to 10 watts per cfm, where such input rates or ratios reflect power into the UV bulb(s) divided by the total flow rate through the system\/unit.","Assembly  may include one or more shut-off devices  in operational communication with structure  to shut-off atmosphere treatment assembly  when a selected ozone level parameter exceeds a preselected amount. One or more shut-off devices  can be variously located within or about assembly . For example,  illustrates a first possible location, designated by reference , in air inlet region  and a second possible location, designated by reference  downstream of catalytic ozone destruction bed . , in addition to location  also shows possible location  within catalytic ozone removal bed  and location , downstream of catalytic ozone removal bed . The arrows in  show flow direction  along which fluid passes through the unit assembly .","Suitable such shut-off devices may be in the form or nature of a fuse, e.g., an integral ozone fuse such as can automatically shut down assembly operation if and when the fuse is blown. For example, a chemical input such as a level or amount of ozone triggers an electrical switch or fuse such as to shut down operation of the assembly such as by turning off the UV light bulbs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0099"},"figref":"FIGS. 23 and 24","b":["200","202"]},"Enclosed space  can be normally used to carry or convey one or more products (not shown), with atmosphere treatment assembly  used to treat the atmosphere held or otherwise contained within the enclosed space.","Enclosed space  also houses or contains evaporator  such as may be utilized to control the humidity or moisture level within the enclosed space .","Those skilled in the art and guided by the teachings herein provided will appreciate that, in accordance with one embodiment, the atmosphere in a storage container can desirably be cleaned via repeated circulation through a treatment or cleaning unit, such as herein described. For example, in the case of desired removal of ethylene from a selected atmosphere, at least a portion of the ethylene can be destroyed in each pass through the unit. As long as the rate of destruction of ethylene is higher than the rate of generation of ethylene in the storage container, the cleaning apparatus will reduce the ethylene levels to a desired steady-state level. By designing the cleaning apparatus to partially clean the atmosphere on a per pass basis, and relying on recirculation of the atmosphere to reduce the contaminants to desired levels, the balance between system performance, volume and cost can be better optimized. For example, by utilizing such recirculation, the amount of power or energy required for proper operation of the unit can be significantly reduced or minimized such as by reducing the number of UV lights required to be energized in any particular pass of atmosphere to be treated through the unit.","While in the foregoing detailed description this invention has been described in relation to certain preferred embodiments thereof, and many details have been set forth for purposes of illustration, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that this invention is susceptible to additional embodiments and that certain of the details described herein can be varied considerably without departing from the basic principles of this invention."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above and other features and objects of this invention are better understood from the following detailed description taken in view of the drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 17"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 23"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
