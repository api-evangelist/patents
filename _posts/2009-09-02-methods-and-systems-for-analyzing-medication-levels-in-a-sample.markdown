title: Methods and systems for analyzing medication levels in a sample
abstract: Methods and systems for assessing patient compliance with opioid drug therapy are provided. A liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS) can be used to simultaneously detect a set of measurements including an amount of at least ten opioids (and their metabolites) in a body fluids sample from a patient. The set of at least ten opioids can include at least oxymorphone and fentanyl. The amounts of opioids and their metabolites are analyzed. For example, the ratios of opioids and their respective metabolites can be used to determine which opioids a patient has been administered. A report of patient compliance is generated based on the set of measurements.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION","EXAMPLE 1","EXAMPLE 2","EXAMPLE 3","EXAMPLE 4"],"p":["This application claims priority to Application Ser. No. 61\/093,888 filed Sep. 3, 2008, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to methods and systems for analyzing medication levels in a sample. In particular, the invention relates to methods and systems for analyzing opioid\/opiate in a body fluids sample.","Promoting pain relief and preventing the abuse of pain medications can be difficult for health professionals to balance. Patients who use drugs of abuse are more likely to abuse pain medications and more likely to divert medication either for financial gain or to fund an addition to legal or illegal drugs. Patients who use drugs of abuse are also at higher risk of combining such use with the legal drugs that are prescribed to them, which puts them at risk for overdoses and accidents. Patients who take legally prescribed controlled medications may also be knowingly or unknowingly combining prescriptions from multiple prescribers, which can put them at risk for overdoses and accidents. The ingestion of multiple opioid\/opiates can result in respiratory depression and\/or fatal respiratory failure. Moreover, death rates from prescription opioid\/opiate use are increasing, and the abuse of prescription opioid\/opiate use is also increasing.","However, the interpretation of pain management opioid\/opiate toxicology test data is complex. Physicians may lack the time and\/or expertise to interpret pain management opioid\/opiate toxicology data. In addition, opioid\/opiate drug metabolism is complex, and some opioid\/opiate drug metabolites are also available as prescription drugs, which makes the source of the opioid\/opiate drug difficult to determine.","Embodiments according to the present invention include methods and systems for assessing patient compliance with opioid drug therapy. A liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer (LC\/MS\/MS) can be used to simultaneously detect a set of measurements including an amount of at least ten opioids (and their metabolites) in a body fluids sample from a patient. The set of at least ten opioids can include at least oxymorphone and fentanyl. The amounts of opioids and their metabolites can be analyzed, and\/or the ratios of opioids and their respective metabolites can be used to determine which opioids a patient has ingested. A report of patient compliance can be generated based on the set of measurements.","In some embodiments, the at least ten opioids that are simultaneously detected include the following: hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, oxymorphone, codeine, morphine, 6-monoacetylmorphine, meperidine, fentanyl and\/or nor-fentanyl. In particular embodiments, the detection threshold can be as low as 2-5 ng\/mL. In addition, drugs of abuse can also be detected, such as alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, marijuana, methadone, phencyclidine and\/or propoxyphene.","In some embodiments, the report of patient compliance can be generated using data related to prescription information. The report can identify a set of discrepant and consistent results for the clinician. Accordingly, patient compliance with prescribed opioids can be assessed and\/or additional prescription medications or other substances (e.g., drugs of abuse) can be detected and identified to the prescriber.","The present invention now will be described hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings and examples, in which embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.","Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.

Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention may take the form of a computer program product on a computer-usable or computer-readable storage medium having computer-usable or computer-readable program code embodied in the medium for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system.","Embodiments according to the present invention include methods and systems for assessing patient compliance with opioid drug therapy. As shown in , a system  for assessing patient compliance includes a sample extraction device  and a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer (LC\/MS\/MS) . The sample extraction device  can be a Hamilton MICROLAB\u00ae Starlet automated extraction device and can be configured to prepare or partially purify a sample for the LC\/MS\/MS . The LC\/MS\/MS  can be used to simultaneously detect a set of measurements including an amount of at least ten opioids (and their metabolites) in a body fluids sample  from a patient. The set of at least ten opioids can include at least oxymorphone and fentanyl. The amounts of opioids and their metabolites are analyzed by an opioid\/metabolite analyzer . For example, the ratios of opioids and their respective metabolites can be used to determine which opioids a patient has taken or administered. A report generator  generates a report of patient compliance based on the set of measurements.","In some embodiments, the at least ten opioids that are simultaneously detected include the following: hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, oxymorphone, codeine, morphine, 6-monoacetylmorphine, meperidine, fentanyl and\/or nor-fentanyl. In particular embodiments, additional drugs (e.g., drugs of abuse) can be detected, such as alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, marijuana, methadone, phencyclidine and\/or propoxyphene. In some embodiments, drugs of abuse can be detected using immunoassays for a screen. If the screen is positive, it is confirmed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry.","The report of patient compliance can be generated based on the ratios of the concentrations of the opioid drugs and their metabolites to determine the opioid drug taken by or administered to the patient. In some embodiments, a set of discrepant and\/or consistent results for a plurality of opioid drugs is determined by comparing the set of measurements with data relating to prescription information for the patient. The discrepant and consistent results can indicate whether a patient is taking opioid drugs being prescribed or taking additional drugs. As used herein, the terms \u201cconsistent\u201d refers to a report result that is consistent with a probable opioid source, a safety standard and\/or an expected result, such as an expected result based on patient prescription information. The terms \u201cnon-consistent\u201d or \u201cdiscrepant\u201d refer to a report result that is not consistent with a probable opiod source, a safety standard and\/or an expected result.","Although embodiments according to the present invention are described herein with respect to assessing patient compliance, for example, with a prescription, it should be understood that reports of probable opioid source(s) can be generated according to some embodiments for subjects for which prescription information is not provided or is unknown, including forensic sample tests or screening tests for patient safety before an opioid prescription is provided. An opioid source is an originally administered or ingested compound that manifests itself as a detected amount of opioid or opioid metabolite.","In some embodiments, the LC-MS-MS can detect threshold cutoff amounts of opioids or opioid metabolites below 10 ng\/ml and as low as 2-5 ng\/ml. For example, in some embodiments, oxymorphone, morphine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, oxymorphone, codeine, morphine, 6-monoacetylmorphine and meperidine are detected to threshold cutoff amounts of 5 ng\/ml, and fentanyl and nor-fentanyl are detected to threshold cutoff amounts of 2 ng\/ml. By detecting opioid levels as low as 2-5 ng\/ml, the occurrences of false negatives can be reduced, the time during which the test reliably detects a positive result can be increased, and the \u201cfast metabolizers\u201d of certain opioids can be detected.","LC\/MS\/MS is described, for example, in Coles et al. Journal of Analytical Toxicology, Vol. 31, January\/February 2007 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,940,065 to Graber et al., the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. LC\/MS\/MS can allow for testing for the free (non-conjugated) drug, which can avoid a hydrolysis step typically required for sample preparation in less sensitive methods, e.g., gas chromagraphy\u2014mass spectrometry. In addition, 6-monoacetylmorphine, a metabolite of heroin, can be isolated with LC\/MS\/MS, which is definitive proof of heroin use. Hydrolysis will hydrolyze 6-monoacetylmorphine, which will prevent detection of this heroin metabolite.","In some embodiments, when a clinician receives a result that indicates the patient is taking a medication that was not prescribed, the patient is questioned about the source of the medication. In some cases, this may result in the patient's removal from the practice.","The interpretation of opiate\/opioid results can be difficult because several commonly prescribed opiates (codeine) and opioids (hydrocodone and oxycodone) metabolize to active opiate\/opioid drugs (codeine\u2192morphine; hydrocodone\u2192hydromorphone; and oxycodone\u2192oxymorphone) which are also available by prescription.","In addition to the major metabolism that occurs in standard doses of opiate\/opioids, when high doses of codeine or morphine are used in tolerant patients, alternative metabolism can occur to commonly prescribed opioids (codeine\u2192hydrocodone; and morphine\u2192hydromorphone). A summary of the major and minor metabolism of opiate\/opioids is provided in , and an opiate\/opioid metabolism diagram is shown in .","For example, in heroin detection, the detection of 6-monoacetylmorphine is proof of heroin use. However, the absence of 6-monoacetylmorphine does not rule out heroin use when morphine is present. Common reasons for the presence of morphine include a morphine prescription, codeine prescription (because codeine metabolizes to morphine), dietary poppy seeds and heroin use. Therefore, determining whether a detected opiate\/opioid is from a legitimate use or illicit use can be difficult.","In addition, patients may not have a drug present that was prescribed for a variety of reasons, including non-compliance with the prescription, diversion, fast metabolism, drug induced metabolism (e.g., rifampin), poor drug absorption (e.g., celiac disease) and\/or dilute urine. Patients may also have a drug present that was not prescribed for various reasons, such as normal opiate\/opioid metabolites from a legitimate prescription, opiate\/opioid metabolite found when high doses of codeine or morphine are used (high dose codeine can metabolize to hydrocodone and high dose morphine can metabolize to hydromorphone), a prescription may have been obtained from another physician, the medication can be obtained from a spouse or friend, or\/or there may be illicit use of a drug obtained without a prescription.","Methods and systems according to some embodiments of the

As can be seen in , positive results for a drug are highlighted with an arrow indicating positive results. It should be understood that other techniques for visually drawing a viewer's attention to the positive results can be used, for example, by using all capital letters and\/or color to indicate positive results. As can be seen in , positive results are also printed at the beginning of the report with an interpretive comment, i.e., the hydrocodone positive result is consistent with a hydrocodone prescription, and the oxycodone positive result is discrepant because oxycodone should be negative. Accordingly, medical health professionals can quickly interpret the test results.","As shown in , a requisition form can be used for ordering the test in which the ordering physician or other medical health professional identifies the drugs that the patient is currently taking, e.g., based on patient interviews, patient history, medical record(s), etc.). A box is checked next to each identified drug, and next to each box is a barcode for each specific prescription medication or class of prescription drug (e.g., in the case of non-opioids such as benzodiazepine). In particular embodiments, the practitioner can select barcodes (e.g., barcode stickers) corresponding to the prescriptions taken by the patient and affix the barcodes to the patient sample. In some embodiments, a barcode can be provided to indicate that prescription information is not known. Accordingly, the barcodes affixed to the patient sample (or provided with the patient sample) can be used to quickly and automatically enter patient information, such as prescription information, into an opioid\/metabolite analyzer (such as the analyzer  in ). Although  illustrates barcodes, it should be understood that other machine-readable codes can also be used, such as radio-frequency identification tags. For example, a barcode reader or other suitable automated reader can be used to receive the prescription information, and this reader can be included as part of the system  of . The prescription information can then be cross-checked, for example, using the bar coded patient record information for each specific drug or drug class and the flowcharts provided in . Accordingly, the report generation and cross-checking techniques described herein for comparing actual drug test results with prescribed medication can be fully or nearly fully automated.","Flowcharts for generating reports as shown in  are provided in . Where ratio percentages are provided, it should be understood that the ratios are between \u00b15%. For example, if a ratio is provided as less than 40%, the value should be understood to be less than about 35%-45%. The information derived from the flow charts provided in  can be presented in any suitable form, including the exemplary patient report provided in . For example, discrepant results can be highlighted and\/or results that indicate the use of drugs of abuse or the use of drugs for which the patient does not have a prescription can be presented.","For example,  illustrates a pain management or medication\/drug interpretation flow chart for codeine , in which prescription information has been considered. If the test for codeine is positive at Block , and patient records indicate that codeine is prescribed at Block , then the result is considered consistent with codeine prescription at Block . If the test for codeine is positive at Block , and patient records indicate that codeine is not prescribed at Block , then it is determined whether 6-monoacetylmorphine is present at Block . If 6-monoacetylmorphine is positive at Block , then it is determined that there is either a discrepant result because the codeine test should be negative or the codeine is a contaminant of heroine (Block ). If 6-monoacetylmorphine is negative at Block , then it is determined that there is a discrepant result because the codeine test should be negative (Block ). If the test for codeine is negative at Block , and patient records indicate that codeine is prescribed at Block , then it is determined that there is a discrepant result because the codeine test should be positive (Block ), which can indicate, e.g., patient non-compliance with a prescription. In contrast, there is no comment at Block  if patient records indicate that codeine is not prescribed (Block ).","Similarly,  illustrates a medication\/drug interpretation flow chart for fentanyl , in which prescription information has been considered.

If the test for fentanyl is negative at Block  and patient records indicate that fentanyl is prescribed at Block , then it is determined whether nor-fentanyl is present. If the test for nor-fentanyl is positive at Block , then the result is considered consistent with fentanyl prescription at Block  because nor-fentanyl is a metabolite of fentanyl. If, however, the nor-fentanyl test is negative at Block , then it is determined that there is a discrepant result because fentanyl and\/or nor-fentanyl should be positive (Block ).

The flowcharts in  were used to generate patient reports of consistent or discrepant results as compared with likely opioid sources. Discussions by clinical toxicology experts with practicing physicians providing pain management services to patients indicated the misinterpretation of conventional pain management opioid\/opiate toxicology report data occurred frequently. The misinterpretation of opioid\/opiate toxicology reports put patients and physicians at risk. The unique pain management interpretation techniques were developed to provide physicians with concise, accurate interpretative information based on published opioid\/opiate pharmacologic and metabolic information, specimen analysis providing quantitative metabolite to parent drug ratios, combined with or without opiate\/opioid prescription information provided by the ordering physician. The interpretations indicate the likely source of an opioid\/opiate drug (s) found positive on the pain management panel, either that was prescribed or not prescribed, and whether it is consistent or discrepant with the prescribed drug (s). Prescribed drugs allegedly taken in the last three days and found to be negative on the pain management panel are flagged as discrepant. Testing for 6-monoacetylmorphine, a metabolite of heroin, on every urine specimen, in addition to codeine, morphine and a poppy seed evaluation, allows a comprehensive determination for the probable source of a positive morphine.

In some embodiments, simultaneous identification and quantitation in urine of codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, oxymorphone, meperidine, 6-monoacetyl morphine (6-MAM), morphine and norfentanyl as the \u201cfree\u201d non-conjugated drug is performed by LC\/MS\/MS.","The analysis of the opioid-opiate drugs uses deuterium labeled internal standard analogues in batch calibrators, controls and urine aliquots. Tubes containing each urine batch specimen are placed on the MICROLAB\u00ae Hamilton Starlet liquid handling instrument from Hamilton Robotics, Reno, Nev. (USA). where 1% hydrochloric acid and internal standard are added and mixed with the urine. Solid phase extraction (SPE) columns containing sodium bisulfite are conditioned with methanol before each sample is passed through its SPE column. The columns are washed prior to the drugs and internal standard being eluted from the SPE columns with ammoniated elution solvent. After the solvent is evaporated, the residue in each tube is reconstituted with 5% acetonitrile in water. The extract is placed in autosampler vials for LC\/MS\/MS analysis.","An AGILENT\u00ae 6410 Triple Quadrupole LC\/MS\/MS from Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif. (USA) with electrospray ionization (positive ion mode) interfaced with an Agilent 1200 series binary pump SL is programmed to select and allow the positive precursor ion of each opioid-opiate drug and its respective deuterium internal standard to pass through the first quadrupole. In the second quadrupole, collision-induced dissociation (CID) is achieved to produce product ions monitored in the third quadrupole. Quantitative concentrations of the drugs are determined by calculating peak area ratios for the product ions of each drug and its deuterium internal standard.","Pharmacokinetic Information:","Opiates are pharmacologically active agents derived naturally from opium, the dried juice of the unripe seed pod of the opium poppy . Morphine and codeine belong to this class of natural occurring opiate alkaloids as are thebaine, noscapine and papaverine. Heroin (diacetyl-morphine) is a synthetic opiate and a more potent derivative of morphine; heroin is not legally available in the United States. Opioids are generally synthetic narcotic analgesics that have varying degrees of opiate-like pharmacological effects; some share similarity in chemical structure with morphine. The opioid drugs detected by this test method are listed alphabetically:","Codeine (Tylenol\u00ae 3, Robitussin\u00ae AC, Phenergan\u00ae VC, Many Others)","Codeine is an opiate used for its analgesic, antitussive and antidiarrheal properties. Codeine is a synthesis by-product of illicit heroin production. Codeine is naturally found in opium and opium poppy seeds used for dietary purposes. Codeine is rapidly absorbed after oral dose, with the time to peak plasma concentration estimated at one hour after ingestion. Codeine is extensively metabolized, mostly to codeine glucuronide, while 10-15% of a dose is excreted as morphine and norcodeine conjugates. Therefore codeine (free and conjugated), norcodeine, and morphine (free and conjugated) appear in urine after codeine ingestion. Morphine is not metabolized to codeine in humans. Codeine (free) is detected by LC\/MS\/MS for up to 3 days after it's administered. Also see the pharmacokinetic information regarding \u201cMorphine\u201d (below).","Fentanyl and Norfentanyl (Duragesic\u00ae, Actiq\u00ae, Fentanest\u00ae, Fentora\u00ae, Others)","Fentanyl is an opioid analgesic with a potency about 80 times that of morphine and a short duration of efficacy. Norfentanyl is a metabolite of the drug fentanyl. Fentanyl is administered by injection as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia and with the use of transdermal patches for management of chronic pain. An oral transmucosal dosage form, buccal pellets and lozenges are also available. Illicit fentanyl has been substituted for heroin sold on the black market. Fentanyl and norfentanyl are excreted in urine following fentanyl administration. Norfentanyl was detected in urine for up to 72 hours and fentanyl for less than 24 hours following a single fentanyl dose (50 to 100 ug). In chronic pain patients treated with fentanyl transdermal patches (25 to 100 ug\/hr), urine fentanyl concentrations were less than 1080 ng\/mL and urine norfentanyl concentrations were less than 5730 ng\/mL.","Hydrocodone (Vicodin\u00ae, Hycodan\u00ae, Lortab\u00ae, Others)","Pharmacological effects of hydrocodone as an analgesic and antitussive are similar to codeine; it is available for oral administration. Hydrocodone is metabolized by the liver to hydromorphone and other metabolites. Hydrocodone can be a metabolite of codeine when codeine is used in high doses; following codeine administration the ratio of hydrocodone to codeine concentrations is less than 0.40 without another hydrocodone source. Dihydrocodeine metabolism has been shown to produce urine hydrocodone in very low concentrations. Some oxycodone pharmaceutical preparations have small amounts of hydrocodone as an impurity. An oral dose of hydrocodone may produce hydrocodone (free) for 3 days and hydromorphone for up to 4 days by LC\/MS\/MS analysis.","Hydromorphone (Dilaudid\u00ae)","Hydromorphone is similar to morphine but more potent and has a high abuse liability; it is available for oral, injection and suppository administration. Hydromorphone can be observed in urine as a morphine metabolite after high-dose morphine use; hydromorphone is also a metabolite of hydrocodone. About 6% of a hydromorphone dose is eliminated as free and 36% as conjugated hydromorphone. Hydromorphone use is detected as hydromorphone (free) in urine by LC\/MS\/MS for up to 4 days.","Oxycodone (Oxycotin\u00ae, Percodan\u00ae, Percocet\u00ae, Tylox\u00ae, Others)","Oxycodone is a semi-synthetic narcotic analgesic derived from thebaine; it is similar to but more effective than morphine when administered orally. Oxycodone is metabolized by the liver to oxymorphone and other metabolites. Within 24 hours, approximately 60% of an oral dose of oxycodone is eliminated in urine as total oxycodone and about 14% as oxymorphone. LC\/MS\/MS can detect oxycodone (free) for up to 3 days after an immediate release dose preparation; following a slow-release dosage form oxycodone (free) can be detected for up to 4 days.","Oxymorphone (Numorphan\u00ae, Opana\u00ae)","Oxymorphone is a semi-synthetic narcotic analgesic derived from thebaine; it is available for injection use, as a suppository (NUMORPHAN\u00ae) and as an oral preparation (OPANA\u00ae). Oxymorphone pharmaceutical material may contain 1% oxycodone as an impurity. Oxymorphone is also observed in urine as a metabolite of oxycodone use. Recent studies confirm oxymorphone is not a metabolite of morphine or hydromorphone. About 49% of an oxymorphone dose is excreted in urine, mostly as conjugated oxymorphone and a smaller amount of free oxymorphone. LC\/MS\/MS can detect oxymorphone (free) for up to 3 days after an immediate release dose preparation and up to 4 days following a slow-release dosage.","Meperidine (Demerol\u00ae)","Meperidine is a synthetic opioid analgesic that has pharmacological effects similar to morphine but does not emulate the general chemical structure of opiates. Excessive doses of meperidine may cause CNS excitation (tremors, seizures) largely due to the active metabolite normeperidine. Normeperidine has a longer plasma half-life than meperidine, 20 hours compared with 3 hours, but half the analgesic effect. Following a single dose of meperidine, normeperidine is usually not found in plasma but may accumulate with further administrations to exceed the parent drug concentration and contribute to toxicity.","About 7% of a dose of meperidine is eliminated as unchanged meperidine, and about 17% as normeperidine. Under conditions of acid urine, these values increase to 27% and 23%, respectively, while during alkaline conditions they decline to 0.6% and 3.6%, respectively. The detection time of meperidine in urine after administration will be greatly influenced by urine pH.","6-Monoacetylmorphine (\u201c6-Mam\u201d)","Heroin (diacetyl morphine), an illicit opiate narcotic, is a potent analgesic with strong addiction liability. Clandestine synthesis of heroin from morphine or naturally occurring alkaloids found in opium, the dried juice of the unripe seed pod of the opium poppy , may produce a product having other alkaloid contaminants including small amounts of codeine. Heroin is administered intravenously or smoked. Heroin is rapidly metabolized in tissues to 6-monoacetylmorphine, and subsequently metabolized in the liver to morphine. Morphine is extensively metabolized, with only 2-12% excreted in the urine as unchanged (\u201cfree\u201d) morphine and up to 80% excreted as conjugated morphine glucuronides. Five to 14% of the morphine produced from heroin is excreted in the feces. Approximately 42% of a heroin dose is excreted as morphine-3-glucuronide over about 40 hours. Because a relatively small amount of codeine may be found in heroin as a synthesis impurity, the urine of a heroin user may contain some codeine; neither morphine nor heroin is metabolized to codeine in humans.","The presence of 6-MAM in urine is a specific marker for recent heroin use. 6-MAM is not present in urine from the use of codeine, morphine or poppy seed ingestion. After a heroin dose, 6-MAM is detected in urine for less than 3 days by LC\/MS\/MS. 6-MAM is stable in urine.","Morphine (MS Contin\u00ae, Roxanol\u00ae, Kadian\u00ae)","Morphine and codeine belong to the class of drugs called opiates. Other synthetic narcotic analgesics (\u201copioids\u201d) have some degree of opiate pharmacological effects and share some chemical structure similarity to the opiates. Both morphine and codeine are naturally occurring alkaloids from opium, the dried juice of the unripe seed pod of the opium poppy ","Morphine is rapidly absorbed from oral use but has low bioavailability (0.27) due to first pass metabolism. Morphine may also be smoked or administered by injection. Morphine is extensively metabolized with only 2-12% excreted in the urine as unchanged (free) morphine and up to 80% excreted as conjugated metabolites (glucuronides). A small amount (5-14%) of an administered morphine dose is excreted in the feces. The principle metabolite of morphine in urine is morphine-3-glucuronide which is excreted to the extent of 70% of the dose in 48 hours.","Heroin, after injection or smoking, is rapidly metabolized to 6-mono-acetylmorphine (6-MAM, 6-acetylmorphine) which is subsequently metabolized to morphine. Both heroin and 6-MAM disappear rapidly from the blood due to metabolism and tissue distribution, while morphine levels initially rise and then decline more slowly.","The pattern of urinary excretion of heroin is similar to that of morphine: unchanged morphine (7%) and conjugated morphine (50-60%) with only trace amounts of 6-MAM detectable in urine. The urine of a heroin user may have some codeine present because of concurrently administered codeine or because small amounts of codeine are produced in heroin illicit manufacture as a synthesis by-product.","Some varieties of poppy seeds contain varying amounts of opium resin containing concentrations of morphine and codeine approximately at a 10:1 ratio. Following ingestion, poppy seeds may cause detectable amounts of morphine and (less) codeine in the urine due to the opium resin. 6-MAM has not been found in poppy seeds or in urine after ingestion of poppy seeds.","Exemplary Testing Protocol","The following is a non-limiting, exemplary testing protocol. Although the following example is provided, it should be understood that any suitable protocol can be used. For example, different volumes of materials, solvents, types of materials, calibration standards, equipment and the like may be selected by one of skill in the art without departing from the invention.","Specimen Specifications:","Opiate-Opioid drugs are stable in urine specimens stored at ambient temperature for at least 48 hours; specimens should be refrigerated when transport to the testing laboratory is delayed. The effect of urine preservatives on this assay has not been currently determined; therefore, preservatives may be avoided pending further testing. It is acceptable to centrifuge an aliquot of urine when the specimen displays unusually high turbidity. The standard volume for this test is 30 mL of urine; 15 mL is considered a minimum acceptable volume. The Hamilton pipettes 1.0 mL of urine specimen during the extraction.","Reagents for Solid Phase Extraction:","Opioid Internal Standard","One of each vial listed below (100 ug\/mL, 1 mL each from Cerilliant Corporation, Round Rock, Tex.
