For example, viewers of television are provided with programming that may provide current weather conditions and weather forecasts for those geographic areas selected by the creator of the programming. Consumers of newspapers similarly are provided with weather conditions and weather forecasts for those geographic areas that are selected by the publisher of the newspapers.","Applicant discloses new systems and methods for providing weather data. In an exemplary embodiment, the systems and methods are adapted to receive requests specifying a free-form input, such as a text input, specifying a geographic area. In an exemplary embodiment, the system is adapted to identify geographic areas likely corresponding to the free-form input and retrieve weather data corresponding to those identified geographic areas.","In an exemplary embodiment, a system comprises a server system that is adapted to receive requests for weather data from user devices such as, for example, phones, personal digital assistants, laptop computers, or any other device that may be adapted to forward a request. The server system is communicatively coupled to data stores of geographic data. The server system is likewise communicatively coupled to data stores of weather data including, for example, observed weather conditions and forecast weather conditions.","In an exemplary embodiment, the system receives a request for weather data. In an embodiment, the request comprises a text input meant to identify a particular place or location. For example, the text input may identify at least any of the following: City Name; City and State; City and Country; Postal Code; State Name (Pulls the most populated cities in the state); County Name; County and State Names; Airport Code; Street Name; Street Address (or portion of address, such as, street and city); and Point of Interest (such as, for example, a national park, monument, oil rig, school, golf course, lake, bridge, mountain name, et cetera). In an exemplary embodiment, the server system may process the text input to identify phonetically misspelled place names. For example, the server system may access a thesaurus database to identify a place name corresponding to the text input.","In an exemplary embodiment, the server system searches one or more databases comprising geographic locations for those database entries that may match the received place name. The system compares the results of the database search, e.g., the place names from the databases, to the text of the received input and identifies (perhaps, by ranking) the results that exhibit a likelihood of matching the text of the received input.","In an exemplary embodiment, the server system further processes those results identified as likely matching the received input text to identify the results that are within a predefined distance, e.g., within 20 miles, of a particular location. In an exemplary embodiment, the locations within a defined proximity of the closest weather observation station are identified. In other embodiments, those locations closest to a stored home location for a user or global positioning reading may be identified.","In an exemplary embodiment, for those locations that have been identified, the server system identifies the weather observation stations in the vicinity, e.g., within 20 miles, and selects the one closest to each of the search results.","In an exemplary embodiment, the server system then queries the weather data store to retrieve weather data for the identified weather observation stations. The retrieved weather data and identifying geographic information are transmitted to the requesting device.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

The text input may comprise a single line of text. For example, the text input may identify at least any of the following: City Name; City and State; City and Country; Postal Code; State Name (Pulls the most populated cities in the state); County Name; County and State Names; Airport Code; Street Name; Street Address (or portion of address, such as, street and city); Point of Interest (such as, for example, a national park, monument, oil rig, school, golf course, lake, bridge, mountain name, et cetera); and latitude\/longitude pair (i.e., a global positioning reading).","At step , server  may process the search input to identify the search criteria or text. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, server system  may process the input to identify phonetically misspelled place names. The server system may access a thesaurus database to identify a place name corresponding to the text input.","At step , server  causes geographic data system  to search one or more of geographic databases , , , , and  for those database entries that may match the received search criteria, i.e. input text. For example, data system  may search its databases for names of cities, counties, states, points of interest, etc. that bear a resemblance to the text received from the user.","At step , server  may compare the user input search text with the information stored in the database for those entries that the search identified as resembling the input text. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, server  may perform a Bayesian test on the names returned from the database search with the input search text.","At step , server  identifies those results that show a likelihood of possibly matching the user input search text (\u201ccandidate\u201d results). For example, server  may compares the results of the database search (i.e., the results of steps  and\/or ), and in particular, the place names from the databases, to the text of the received input. Server  may rank the results that exhibit a likelihood of matching the text of the received input.","At step , server  may rank or otherwise identify those locations that were previously identified as possibly being a match based upon the distance of the location from a particular location. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, those locations from the database that bear a resemblance to the input text (i.e., those identified at step ) may be ranked based upon proximity (e.g., within 20 miles) to the nearest weather observation location. In an exemplary embodiment, the top 50 matches from step  are ranked based on proximity to the nearest weather observation location. Alternatively, the locations may be ranked based upon the proximity to the global positioning reading received from the input device. In yet another embodiment, the locations may be ranked based upon the proximity to a stored \u201chome\u201d location corresponding to the user or device from which the request was received.","At step , server  communicates with weather data system  and geographic data system  to identify the weather observation locations within the vicinity of the locations that have been identified as likely candidates for matching the user input text (i.e., locations identified at step ). In an exemplary embodiment, weather observation locations within 20 miles may be identified. In an exemplary embodiment, the top ranked locations from step  may be processed to identify closest weather observation stations. This processing may be performed by comparing the latitude\/longitude pairs of the identified locations with the latitude\/longitude pairs of the weather observation stations.","At step , server  cooperates with weather data system  to retrieve weather data corresponding to the locations believed to possibly correspond to the user input text. In an exemplary embodiment, weather data is retrieved for the weather observation locations identified at step . The weather information that is retrieved may be any and all weather data that may be available including that available in databases  and . Furthermore, in an exemplary embodiment, map data may be retrieved corresponding to the identified locations. The map data may be stored in system  or any other system such as, for example, systems provided by Google, Inc.","At step , server  communicates the locations that have been identified as possibly corresponding to the input text to the user device from which the request was received. The communication may comprise a listing of potential locations with a corresponding rank as to the likelihood the location corresponds to the input text. Further, the communicated data may comprise weather data for each of the locations. The weather data may comprise observed weather data and forecasted weather data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","116","126","138","300","140","150","160","170","300","305","305","305","330","335","345","305","305","305"]},"The computing system  may also include a peripheral . The peripheral  may be an external and\/or internal device optionally connected to the electronic device  such as a printer, an external and\/or internal CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, CD Writer, DVD Writer, a Flash drive, an external media drive, or the like.","The electronic device  may include hardware components such as a processor, a graphics card, a storage component, a memory component, an antenna, a communication port, or the like. The electronic device  may also include software components such as an operating system  and\/or any other suitable application that may control the hardware components and\/or may instruct the electronic device  to perform any necessary tasks including those described above. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the operating system  and any other software applications thereon may be stored in the memory and execute on the processor of device .","The operating system  may be a software component or application executing on the electronic device  that may be responsible for managing the resources such as the hardware components, input devices, output devices, peripherals, or the like connected to or integrated into the electronic device . According to example embodiments, the operating system  may provide services to applications executing on the electronic device  through application programming interfaces (APIs) such that the applications may access function calls of the operating system . The operating system  may also include a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that may be provided to a user via, for example, the display device  such that the user may interact with graphical elements provided by the GUI to perform actions using the operating system  or other applications executing on the electronic device .

An illustrative system provides user-friendly way to request and receive weather data. The system receives a free-form user input meant to reflect a geographic location. The system searches a geographic database to identify locations likely corresponding to the free-from input. The system then identifies for the identified locations the weather observation locations in proximity to the identified locations. The system retrieves weather data for the weather observation locations and communicates that weather information to the user.","Thus, the disclosed systems and methods enable a very user friendly way of searching weather current conditions or forecast data using simple single line text input. Once the single line of text is entered, the system uses a collection of databases to obtain geographical information that is then cross referenced to a collection of weather observation databases. Once the search is completed, any or all of the locations returned have current condition and forecast data associated with them. The system may be implemented on mobile devices as a standalone search engine as well as on backend servers.","Thus, using a single text line of input, such as a street address, street name, city name, county name, point of interest (national parks, golf course, oil rigs, state name, airport code, postal code or latitude\/longitude) a user may retrieve weather observation locations in order of relevance or distance to a user's current location or stored \u201chome\u201d location.","While example embodiments of a various methods for providing an interactive computing interface have been described, the underlying concepts may be performed in a variety of systems including for example, personal computers, set-top boxes, servers, personal digital assistants, or the like. Additionally, the underlying concepts may be embodied in the form of computer executable instruction (i.e., program code) stored on a computer-readable storage medium which instructions, when executed by a machine, such as a computer, perform and\/or implement the methods and systems described above. Specifically, any of the steps, operations or functions described above may be implemented in the form of such computer executable instructions. Computer readable storage media include both volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information. Computer readable storage media include, but are not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CDROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by a computer."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
