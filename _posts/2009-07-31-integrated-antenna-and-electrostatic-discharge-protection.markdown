{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present application generally relates to an antenna and, in particular, to an antenna integrated with an electrostatic discharge protection shield and devices that include an antenna integrated with an electrostatic discharge protection shield.","As consumer electronics devices become more compact and achieve greater functionality, it has become increasingly difficult to arrange the interior components to realize higher density. This is especially so with wireless communications devices, including handheld devices, personal digital assistants, mobile smartphones, etc., where the devices are increasingly compact, yet include a greater number of components and features than ever before. Many such devices now include keyboards, cameras, trackballs, display screens (ordinary or touchscreen), memory cards, speakers, microphones, I\/O jacks, and multiple antennas, for cellular, IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth\u00ae, GPS, and other radio frequency communications. This has made the configuration of the components challenging and puts circuit board space at a premium.","It would be advantageous to provide for an electronic device having a new configuration of components that permits greater density.","Similar reference numerals may have been used in different figures to denote similar components.","The present application describes an antenna partly formed from the electrostatic discharge shield covering a microphone in an electronic device. By exploiting the presence of the electrostatic discharge shield and using it as the shorting element in the antenna, space is saved. Moreover, to the extent the microphone employs an acoustic tube to form an acoustic pathway between the device casing and the microphone, the radiator arm of the antenna integrally formed with the electrostatic discharge shield may be arranged over the acoustic tube, which results in an efficient arrangement of elements.","In one aspect, the present application describes a handheld electronic device. The device includes a substrate having a ground plane and an antenna signal trace; a microphone mounted to the substrate; a metallic shield disposed over the microphone and being connected to the ground plane; and a radio frequency antenna formed in part from the metallic shield and having at least one radiator arm connected to the metallic shield. The antenna includes a feed point connected to the antenna signal trace.","In another aspect, the present application describes a mobile communications device. The device includes a device casing having an acoustic microphone opening; a substrate within the device casing, the substrate having an electrical ground and a signal trace; a microphone mounted to the substrate; an electrostatic discharge shield disposed over the microphone and connected to the electrical ground, the electrostatic discharge shield defining an acoustic port; and an antenna having a radiator arm and a feed element both connected to the electrostatic discharge shield, and wherein the feed element is further connected to the signal trace.","Many electronics devices include an antenna for radio frequency communications, including mobile devices, laptop computers, desktop computers, smartphones, personal digital assistants, and many other such devices. Many of these devices also include a microphone that functions to receive audio input and convert the audio to electrical signals that are processed by the device. In many cases, the microphone serves to permit voice communications, such as in a mobile telephone and other devices configured for wireless communications.","Microphones are transducers that require exposure to the environment in order to receive acoustic signals. The environment can also have a detrimental impact on microphones, as they become exposed to environmental hazards such as human liquids or oils. Accordingly, in some cases microphones are encased in a sealed rubber covering, except for an opening (i.e. a port or hole) through which acoustic waves are to be received. A gasket or \u201crubber boots\u201d may be used to seal the port or hole to the exterior casing of the electronic device.","Microphones and their associated coder\/decoder (CODEC) integrated circuits (ICs) are also vulnerable to electrostatic discharge (ESD). Techniques that have been developed for protecting microphones from electrostatic discharge include covering the microphone (except the acoustic opening\/port) with a grounded casing or shield. Alternatively or additionally, transient voltage suppressor (TVS) diodes may be added to the microphone circuit to absorb ESD events. Adding TVS diodes can be costly and may negatively impact the performance of the audio circuits.","Reference is now made to , which shows a side view of one embodiment of an antenna  integrated with ESD protection. The antenna  is formed partly with an ESD shield (generally ) over a microphone . The microphone  is illustrated in phantom lines. The microphone  is mounted or connected to a printed circuit board  or other substrate. In this application, the term \u201csubstrate\u201d is intended to encompass printed circuit boards and any other such substrate on which electrical components may be assembled and interconnected to form an electronic device. The printed circuit board  includes a ground connection or plane (not illustrated). The microphone  is connected to suitable audio circuitry and a CODEC IC for receiving and processing signals from the microphone . In one embodiment, the microphone  is an Electret Condenser Microphone (ECM), however in other embodiments other types of microphones may be used.","A top plan view of the antenna  is shown in .  shows a front view of the antenna , and  shows a perspective view.","The microphone  is protected from ESD events by the ESD shield . The ESD shield  is a metal covering or casing connected to a ground plane or trace on the circuit board . In  the microphone  is shown as a cylindrical element for ease of illustration. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the microphone  is not necessarily cylindrical and is not necessarily arranged on the circuit board  in the manner illustrated in .","The ESD shield  generally covers the microphone , and, in the illustrated embodiment, has a top section , and side sections , . At the front of the ESD shield , the side sections ,  are separated to define an acoustic opening or port  through which the microphone  may receive acoustic waves. The interior of the ESD shield  creates an acoustic cavity. At least one of the side sections ,  is connected to electrical ground. For example, one or both of the side sections ,  may be directly connected to a ground plane on or within the printed circuit board  or substrate to which the microphone  is mounted. Because the ESD shield  is grounded, it protects the microphone  from spurious ESD events and from electromagnetic interference. In many embodiments, this may eliminate the need for TVS diode protection, which may reduce the cost associated with the microphone .","Reference is now made to , which shows a perspective view of an example embodiment of an acoustic shield  for use with the microphone . The acoustic shield  is intended to shield the microphone  from unwanted acoustic interference and\/or reflections but permit desired voice range acoustic waves to be received through the acoustic port .","The acoustic shield  includes a non-metal acoustic tube  for connecting the acoustic port  to the casing of the electronic device (not shown). The acoustic tube  is formed from rubber or other suitable material. The acoustic tube  provides a pathway  for acoustic waves to travel from a port or opening in the exterior casing of the device to the acoustic port  in the ESD shield . Although the tube  is straight in many embodiments, in some embodiments it may be possible for the tube  to have bends or curves provided that its interior dimensions and angles permit a reasonably efficient transfer of sound in the voice range down the pathway  of the tube . The end of the tube  at the casing may be sealed to the casing.","In some embodiments the acoustic shield  includes a cavity portion  sized to fit within the ESD shield  and substantially surround the microphone . It will be appreciated that the cavity portion  does not pass underneath the microphone  where the microphone  is attached to the circuit board , but rather fits on top of the microphone . The interior of the cavity portion  is dimensioned so that the tube resonance is above the audio band used in telephony.","The interior of the cavity portion  is in sealed communication with the pathway  of the tube  to permit sound transfer down the pathway  to the interior of the cavity portion  and, thus, the microphone . The cavity portion  may otherwise have a sidewall  and top wall  that substantially surrounds the microphone .","Those ordinarily skilled in the art will appreciate the range of suitable materials that may be employed to create the acoustic shield .","Referring still to , the antenna  includes a radiator arm  and a feed element . The radiator arm  is, in this embodiment, a metal planar element. The radiator arm  may, in some embodiments, be formed integrally with the ESD shield . In this particular embodiment, the radiator arm  lies in the same plane as the top section  of the ESD shield . The feed element  is a metal element connected to approximately the opposite side of the top section  from the radiator arm . The feed element  extends down to the circuit board  or other substrate where it connects to a signal trace or other circuit element through which it may electrically conduct received or transmitted signals. In the embodiment shown in , the feed element  extends downwards at an acute angle; however, in other embodiments it may extend downwards perpendicular to the top section .","The radiator arm  may be arranged to extend partly or wholly above the acoustic tube  (). In some embodiments the radiator arm  may be wider, thinner or the same width as the acoustic tube . In some embodiments the radiator arm  is the same or shorter than the length of the acoustic tube . The length and width of the radiator arm  are selected in conjunction with the dimensions of the top section  and the feed element  to give the antenna  the desired RF properties. The length and width of the radiator arm  may be selected so as to frequency tune the antenna .","The radiator arm , ESD shield , and feed element  are, in one embodiment, formed from a metal stamping process.","Reference is now also made to , which shows a block diagram of the antenna . The antenna  is formed from the radiator arm , the grounded ESD shield , and feed element . The ESD shield , in particular the top section , serves as a shorted element of the antenna . Either one of the sides ,  of the ESD shield  or both sides ,  may be connected to ground. The feed element  is connected to a signal trace or circuit element connected to a matching block . The matching circuit  is configured to impedance match with the antenna , as will be understood by those skilled in the art. The matching circuit  may, in some embodiments, be implemented using integrated passive devices (IPDs).","The feed element  is coupled to a signal source  through the matching circuit . The signal source  is configured to drive the antenna  at one or more frequencies to which the antenna  is tuned. Those ordinarily skilled in the art will appreciate the range of circuit elements and variations on configuration for using an RF antenna such as the antenna  for sending or receiving RF signals.","It will be appreciated that the antenna  shown in  and in  is configured as an Inverted-F antenna. In other embodiments other microstrip antennas may be implemented. It will be understood that the antenna  discussed herein is an example only. Other embodiments of antennas integrated with the ESD shield of a microphone may include multiple feed points, multiple shorting elements, slots, or parasitic elements. It will also be understood that the radiator arm  may, in some embodiments, be folded and\/or non-planar. For example, the radiator arm  may be arranged as a folded three-dimensional structure. In one embodiment, the radiator arm  may have elements arranged along one or more of the sides of the acoustic tube .","Reference will now be made to , which illustrate other example embodiments of the antenna .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["10","114","114","114"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["10","314","50","320","314","322","324","314","320","326","314"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIGS. 1-4"],"b":["10","14","152","20","154","156","152","14","152"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIGS. 1-4","FIG. 5"],"b":["10","32","32","52","32","32"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["10","32","150","50","32","32"]},"In the foregoing embodiments, the radiator arm  is shown lying in the same plane as the top section  of the ESD shield . In other embodiments, the radiator arm  may extend in a different plane from the top section . As noted in connection with , the radiator arm  may have a three-dimensional shape. In addition, although the top section  is illustrated as being planar in many of the embodiments, in some embodiments the top section  may not be planar.","Those ordinarily skilled in the art will appreciated that the foregoing embodiments are examples only and that many other configurations or shapes may be used to form the ESD shield, radiator arm, and\/or feed element of the antenna, depending on the application desired.","Reference is now made to , which shows an example embodiment of a mobile communication device  which may incorporate the antenna  described herein. The mobile communication device  is a two-way communication device having voice and possibly data communication capabilities; for example, the capability to communicate with other computer systems, e.g., via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile communication device , in various embodiments the device may be a multiple-mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication, a smartphone, a mobile telephone or a PDA (personal digital assistant) enabled for wireless communication, or a computer system with a wireless modem.","The mobile communication device  includes a controller comprising at least one processor  such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the mobile communication device , and a wireless communication subsystem  for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network . The processor  interacts with the communication subsystem  which performs communication functions. The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems. In some embodiments, the device  may include a touchscreen display  which includes a display (screen) , such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, with a touch-sensitive input surface or overlay  connected to an electronic controller . The touch-sensitive overlay  and the electronic controller  provide a touch-sensitive input device and the processor  interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay  via the electronic controller . In other embodiments, the display  may not be a touchscreen display. Instead, the device  may simply include a non-touch display and one or more input mechanisms, such as, for example, a depressible scroll wheel.","The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems including flash memory , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , data port  such as serial data port, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port, speaker , microphone , input mechanism , switch , short-range communication subsystem , and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions.","The communication subsystem  may include a receiver, a transmitter, and associated components, such as one or more antenna elements , local oscillators (LOs), and a processing module such as a digital signal processor (DSP). The antenna  may be embedded or internal to the mobile communication device  and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter, as is known in the art. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication, the particular design of the communication subsystem  depends on the wireless network  in which the mobile communication device  is intended to operate. As described above, the antenna  may be formed integral with the microphone  ESD protection.","The mobile communication device  may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of a wireless network  within its geographic coverage area. The mobile communication device  may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after a network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver, which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., as well as analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP. In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP. These DSP-processed signals are input to the transmitter for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification, and transmission to the wireless network  via the antenna .","The processor  operates under stored program control and executes software modules  stored in memory such as persistent memory, for example, in the flash memory . As illustrated in , the software modules  comprise operating system software  and software applications .","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules  or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM  is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory, this is merely one example, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.","The software applications  may include a range of other applications, including, for example, a messaging application, a calendar application, and\/or a notepad application. In some embodiments, the software applications  include an email message application, a push content viewing application, a voice communication (i.e. telephony) application, a map application, and a media player application. Each of the software applications  may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements (e.g. text fields, input fields, icons, etc.) in the user interface (i.e. the display device ) according to the application.","In some embodiments, the auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems  may comprise an external communication link or interface, for example, an Ethernet connection. The mobile communication device  may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks, for example, a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network or a GPS transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network (not shown). The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may comprise a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the mobile communication device  such as receipt of an electronic communication or incoming phone call, or for other purposes such as haptic feedback (touch feedback).","In some embodiments, the mobile communication device  also includes a removable memory card  (typically comprising flash memory) and a memory card interface . Network access may be associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile communication device  via the memory card , which may be a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory card  is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface  of the mobile communication device  in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .","The mobile communication device  stores data  in an erasable persistent memory, which in one example embodiment is the flash memory .

The data  may also include user application data such as email messages, address book and contact information, calendar and schedule information, notepad documents, image files, and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile communication device  by its user, and other data. The data  stored in the persistent memory (e.g. flash memory ) of the mobile communication device  may be organized, at least partially, into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application.","The serial data port  may be used for synchronization with a user's host computer system (not shown). The serial data port  enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the mobile communication device  by providing for information or software downloads to the mobile communication device  other than through the wireless network . The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the mobile communication device  through a direct, reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.","In some embodiments, the mobile communication device  is provided with a service routing application programming interface (API) which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data (i.e., USB) or Bluetooth\u00ae (Bluetooth\u00ae is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG, Inc.) connection to the host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their mobile communication device  to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection, traffic that was destined for the wireless network  is automatically routed to the mobile communication device  using the USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection. Similarly, any traffic destined for the wireless network  is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth\u00ae connection to the host computer system for processing.","The mobile communication device  also includes a battery  as a power source, which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged, for example, through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery  provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile communication device , and the battery interface  provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+ to the circuitry of the mobile communication device .","The short-range communication subsystem  is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile communication device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth\u00ae communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.","A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile communication device  during or after manufacture. Additional applications and\/or upgrades to the operating system  or software applications  may also be loaded onto the mobile communication device  through the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the serial port , the short-range communication subsystem , or other suitable subsystem  other wireless communication interfaces. The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed, for example, written into the program memory (i.e. the flash memory ), or written into and executed from the RAM  for execution by the processor  at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile communication device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile communication device .","Although in this embodiment, it is the communication subsystem  that employs the antenna  integrated with the microphone  ESD protection, in other embodiments a different communication system within the mobile device  may use an antenna integrated with the microphone  ESD protection, such as a GPS system, or the short-range communication subsystem .","The wireless network  may comprise one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN) and a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) or other suitable network arrangements. In some embodiments, the mobile communication device  is configured to communicate over both the WWAN and WLAN, and to roam between these networks. In some embodiments, the wireless network  may comprise multiple WWANs and WLANs. In some embodiments, the mobile device  includes the communication subsystem  for WWAN communications and a separate communication subsystem for WLAN communications. In most embodiments, communications with the WLAN employ a different antenna than communications with the WWAN. Accordingly, the antenna  may be configured for WWAN communications or WLAN communications depending on the embodiment and desired application.","In some embodiments, the WWAN conforms to one or more of the following wireless network types: Mobitex Radio Network, DataTAC, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), GPRS (General Packet Radio System), TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data), iDEN (integrated Digital Enhanced Network), EvDO (Evolution-Data Optimized) CDMA2000, EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution), UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems), HSPDA (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access), IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX), or various other networks. Although WWAN is described as a \u201cWide-Area\u201d network, that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMAN) and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.","The WLAN comprises a wireless network which, in some embodiments, conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards (sometimes referred to as Wi-Fi) such as, for example, the IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b and\/or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN in other embodiments such as, for example, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX\u201d), or IEEE 802.20 (also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access).
