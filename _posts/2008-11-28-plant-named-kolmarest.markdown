The objective of the breeding program is to create new pot-type cultivars with strong foliage and numerous attractive fruits.","The new plant originated from a cross-pollination in 2000 in Heelsum, The Netherlands of \u2018Pinky Flair\u2019, not patented, as the female, or seed parent with a proprietary selection of identified as code number H-27, not patented, as the male, or pollen, parent. The new was discovered and selected by the Inventor as a single flowering plant within the progeny of the stated cross-pollination in a controlled greenhouse environment in Heelsum, The Netherlands in 2003.","Asexual reproduction of the new plant by vegetative cuttings in Boskoop, The Netherlands since 2004 has shown that the unique features of this new plant are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations.","Plants of the new have not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature and light intensity without, however, any variance in genotype.","The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of \u2018Kolmarest\u2019.

No. 13,554. In side-by-side comparisons, conducted in Boskoop, The Netherlands, plants of the new differed primarily from plants of \u2018Kolmred\u2019 in the following characteristics:\n\n","Plants used for the aforementioned photographs and following description were grown for two years under conditions which closely approximate commercial production conditions in containers in an outdoor nursery in Boskoop, The Netherlands. During the production of the plants, day temperatures ranged from 12\u00b0 C. to 30\u00b0 C. and night temperatures ranged from 4\u00b0 C. to averaged 14\u00b0 C.
