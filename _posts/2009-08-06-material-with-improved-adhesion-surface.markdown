title: Material with improved adhesion surface
abstract: An apparatus for improving and increasing sustainable shear force capabilities at an interfacing surface between a rigid material and a flexible material is disclosed. The interface includes at least two superimposed components having different surface roughnesses. A coarse surface roughness component has a surface roughness about 3 orders of magnitude greater than that of a fine surface roughness component. The interface is useful for all types of devices with a rigid-to-flexible interface that needs to resist shear, tension, torsion, compression, or any disturbing steady-state or variable force or forces.

No. 11\/229,424 filed on 12 Sep. 2005 and claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7121 of the prior application's filing date.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a method of improving and increasing sustainable shear force capabilities at an interfacing surface between a rigid material and a flexible material.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","It is well known to utilize a resilient bushing having a pair of concentric rigid, typically metal sleeves.  is a prior art example of a typical fastening arrangement  utilizing adhesion at rigid-to-flexible interfacing surfaces. The inner sleeve  is secured to one structural component  (for example an input shaft) while the outer sleeve  is secured to another structural component  (for example a propeller shaft). An annular elastomeric insert  is concentrically positioned between the rigid sleeves , . The interface between the interfacing surfaces needs to transmit high shear and torque loads. Previous designs would fail locally in shear due the high torque applied during the functional application, and due to the comparatively low shear which these devices could sustain. Higher torque, shear, adhesion was needed at the rigid-to-flexible material interfaces. The adhesion resistance to shear failure at the surface interface  and  is what supports the full torque during operation.","In the past, most interfacing surfaces  and  were relatively smooth; that is, their surface roughness was generally less than 170 RMS as measured by SAE Standard J448a. A method of increasing adhesion resistance to shear failure was the addition of a phosphate coating of various thicknesses. However, the surface roughness did not exceed roughly 170 RMS.","A method and apparatus for improving resistance to adhesion failure between two interfacing surfaces utilizing by producing a particular shape and roughness is disclosed. The present invention utilizes both coarse and fine surface roughness producing techniques. The surface, to be treated, has a coarse (large scale) surface roughness component on the order of about three to four orders of magnitude greater than the fine (small scale) surface roughness component. The invention uses a plurality of superimposed roughnesses rather than one range of roughness, as seen in prior art. The appropriate surfaces of the rigid part are roughened (e.g., by machining, casting, molding, sandblasting) to yield surfaces having both small (fine) and large (coarse) scale roughness components. The large-scale roughness component is about three orders of magnitude greater than the small scale roughness component.","The object of this invention is to improve and increase sustainable shear force capabilities at an interfacing surface between a rigid material (for example: a structural metal) and a flexible material (for example: an elastomeric dampening material).","Another object of the present invention is to improve and increase the sustainable shear force capabilities at an interfacing surface without internal or external fastening devices such as bolts, screws, washers, and the like.","Yet another object of the present invention is to improve and increase the sustainable shear force capabilities at an interfacing surface in a smaller, more compact volume than previous methods.","Yet another object of the present invention is to improve and increase the sustainable shear force capabilities at an interfacing surface with a simplistic (that is without a large number of parts) and economy.","A method and apparatus for improving resistance to adhesion failure between two interfacing surfaces utilizing by producing a particular shape and roughness is disclosed. The present invention utilizes both coarse and fine surface roughness producing techniques. The surface, to be treated, has a coarse (large scale) surface roughness component on the order of about three to four orders of magnitude greater than the fine (small scale) surface roughness component. The invention uses a plurality of superimposed roughnesses rather than one range of roughness, as seen in prior art. The appropriate surfaces of the rigid part are roughened (e.g., by machining, casting, molding, soundblasting) to yield surfaces having both small (fine) and large (coarse) scale roughness components. The large-scale roughness component is about three orders of magnitude greater than the small scale roughness component.","Referring to , one embodiment of a bushing \u2032 according to the present invention is shown utilizing a generally an elastomeric material , an outer rigid member , and an inner rigid member . The elastomeric material  can be any well-known elastomeric material and would be selected based upon the desired dampening and isolation properties, all of which is well within the knowledge of those skilled in the art. The elastomeric material is moldingly bonded to the rigid member ,  at confronting interfacing surfaces , .","In a preferred embodiment, a 50 durometer fluorosilicone elastomer was used. However, 40, 50, 60, and 70 durometer elastomers have also been tested. It should be stressed, however, that the choice of the elastomeric material  will depend on the circumstances of its intended use and is not limited in any way to these stated durometer values or to fluorosilicone elastomers.","The inner and outer rigid members  and  may also be selected from any material. The material chosen will again depend upon the circumstances in which it is intended to be used. Typically, the inner and outer rigid members  and  are made from metal (e.g., aluminum); however, the material can be any material having the necessary rigidity such as steel, plastic, laminates, composites, ceramics, biological material (bones, teeth, tusks), etc. Optionally, the inner and outer rigid members  and  may be anodized. The decision to anodize the inner and outer rigid members  and  will depend on a combination of the material chosen and the operating conditions.","The inner rigid member  has an outer surface  while the outer rigid member  has an inner surface . The outer surface  and the inner surface  are machined, or otherwise created, to have a coarse surface roughness component. In one preferred embodiment, the coarse surface roughness component was created first, using a standard industrial milling machine, and the fine roughness component was produced afterwards, by sandblasting. The outer surface  and\/or inner surface  are sandblasted or otherwise created using standard industrial techniques.","Most typically, the dual coarse-fine roughness is produced on the rigid material surface by two separate operations; e.g., a machining operation followed by a blasting operation. However, alternatively, both course and fine roughness components may be produced at the same time; e.g., by a casting operating for metals, or by a molding operation for rigid plastics. This invention uses a plurality of roughness components working cooperatively. In one embodiment, the coarse roughness component was created using a milling operation. In another embodiment, the coarse roughness component was created using an elox operation. In one embodiment, the fine roughness component was created by grit blasting with aluminum oxide.","The coarse roughness component would generally be within the range of 50,000 to 1,000,000 micro-inches. Coarse roughness components may center around any coarse roughness (e.g., 50,000, 200,000, etc.) within this 50,000 to 1,000,000 micro-inch range. The fine roughness component would generally be within the range of 100 to 2,000 micro-inches. Fine roughness components may center around any fine roughness (e.g., 200, 550, 1,000, etc.) within this 100 to 2,000 micro-inch range. In one particular successful embodiment, a fine roughness component of 550 micro-inches was specified with a tolerance of \u00b1150 micro-inches producing an actual measured fine roughness component between 400 to 700 micro-inches.","The coarse roughness component is three orders of magnitude greater than the fine roughness component; i.e., the ratio of coarse roughness component to fine roughness component will, in one embodiment, be 1,000. Examples of various embodiments of this invention, which demonstrate the relationship between the coarse roughness component and the fine roughness component, are presented.","The outer surface  and\/or inner surface  are characterized by having surface roughness components that include both coarse , (large scale), , and fine  (small scale),  roughness surfaces relative to each other. It should be noted that any surface which needs to improve and increase sustainable adhesives force capabilities at an interfacing surface where a flexible material confronts a rigid material could utilize the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["55","50","51","50","51","50","51","51"]},"The coarse surface roughness component  is of the order of three orders of magnitude greater than the roughness of the fine surface roughness component .

The interface  having both coarse  and fine  surface roughness components allows the interface to sustain greater shear and other forces than surfaces having only fine or coarse roughness surfaces.","The coarse and fine surface  can be applied to any device with a rigid-to-flexible interface that needs to resist shear, tension, torsion, compression, or any disturbing steady-state or variable force or forces.
