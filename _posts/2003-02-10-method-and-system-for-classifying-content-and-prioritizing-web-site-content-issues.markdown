{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention relates generally to computers and communications, and more specifically, to a method and system for managing Web sites and similar data constructions.","In recent years there has been tremendous growth in data communication networks such as the Internet, Intranets, Wide Area Networks (WANs) and Metro Area Networks (MANs). These data communication networks offer tremendously efficient means of organizing and distributing computerized data, which has resulted in their widespread use for both business and personal applications. For example, the Internet is now a common medium for operating online auctions, academic and public forums, distributing publications such as newspapers and magazines, supporting business communications, performing electronic commerce and electronic mail transactions, and offering government services.","However, the tools needed to offer and support such services have not kept pace with the growth and demand. The Internet is now pervasive in industrialized countries, and it is a necessity for any large organization to have an Internet presence. Some large corporate and government agencies, for example, maintain Web sites with millions of Web pages, whose content changes daily; yet they do not have the tools to efficiently manage this massive data system.","Before discussing the specific nature of these problems, it is necessary to set up the framework for discussion.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["30","32","34","36","38","40","42","32","44","50","52","54","52"]},"Web sites are maintained on Web servers  also connected to the Internet  which provide content and applications to the User's computers . Communications between user's computers  and the rest of the network  are standardized by means of defined communication protocols.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"While the Internet is a communication network, the World Wide Web (www or simply \u201cthe Web\u201d), is a way of accessing information over the Internet. The Web uses the HTTP protocol (one of several standard Internet protocols), to communicate data, allowing end users to employ their Web browsers to access Web pages.","A Web browser is an application program that runs on the end user's computer  and provides a way to look at and interact with all the information on the World Wide Web. A Web browser uses HTTP to request Web pages from Web servers throughout the Internet, or on an Intranet. Currently most Web browsers are implemented as graphical user interfaces. Thus, they know how to interpret the set of HTML tags within the Web page in order to display the page on the end user's screen as the page's creator intended it to be viewed.","A Web page is a data file that generally contains not only text, but also a set of HTML (hyper text markup language) tags that describe how text and images should be formatted when a Web browser displays it on a computer screen. The HTML tags include instructions that tell the Web browser what font size or colour should be used for certain contents, or where to locate text or images on the Web page.","The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the set of rules for exchanging files on the World Wide Web, including text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files. HTTP also allows files to contain references to other files whose selection will elicit additional transfer requests (hypertext links). Typically, the HTTP software on a Web server machine is designed to wait for HTTP requests and handle them when they arrive.","Thus, when a visitor to a Web site requests a Web page by typing in a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or clicking on a hypertext link, the Web browser builds an HTTP request and sends it to the Internet Protocol address corresponding to the URL. The HTTP software in the destination Web server receives the request and, after any necessary processing, the requested file or Web page is returned to the Web browser via the Internet or Intranet.","The Web is just one of the ways that information can be disseminated over the Internet. The Internet also supports other communication services such as e-mail, Usenet news groups, instant messaging and FTP (file transfer protocol).","A Web site is a collection of Web pages that are organized (and usually interconnected via hyperlinks) to serve a particular purpose. An exemplary Web site  is presented in the block diagram of . In this example, the Web site includes a main page , which is usually the main point of entry for visitors to the Web site . Accordingly, it usually contains introductory text to greet visitors, and an explanation of the purpose and organization of the Web site . It will also generally contain links to other Web pages in the Web site .","In this example, the main page  contains hypertext links pointing to three other Web pages. That is, there are icons or HTML text targets on the main page , which the visitor can click on to request one of the other three Web pages , , . When the visitor clicks on one of these hypertext links, his Web browser sends a request to the Internet for a new Web page corresponding to the URL of the linked Web page.","Note that the main Web page  also includes a \u201cbroken link\u201d , that is, a hypertext link which points to a Web page which does not exist. Clicking on this broken link will typically produce an error, or cause the Web browser to time out because the target Web page cannot be found.","Web page  includes hypertext links which advance the visitor to other parts within the same Web page . These links are referred to as \u201canchors\u201d. Accordingly, a hypertext link to an anchor which does not exist would be referred to as a \u201cbroken anchor\u201d.","Web page  includes links to data files. These data files are shown symbolically as being stored on external hard devices ,  but of course they could be stored in any computer or server storage medium, in any location. These data files could, for example, contain code and data for software applications, Java applets, Flash animations, music files, images, or text.","There is no limit to the number of interconnections that can be made in a Web site. Web page , for example, includes links to four other Web pages , , , , but it could be linked to any number of other Web pages. As well, chains of Web pages could also be linked together successively, the only limit to the number of interconnections and levels in the hierarchy being the practical considerations of the resources to store and communicate all of the data in the Web pages.","As noted above, Web sites may have many, many pages. A large corporation or government, for example, may have to administer millions of Web pages which are almost constantly changing. This makes it extremely difficult for the Web site administrator to ensure that there are no content issues in the Web site, such as broken links. Tools do exist for analysing Web sites and locating such content issues (referred to herein as \u201ccontent scanning\u201d) but in a very large Web site, the amount of data with content issues may still be unmanageable.","Suppose for example, that an error caused approximately one thousand Web pages on a particular Web site to fail. Running a content scan would identify the one thousand Web pages with content issues, but this would be of little assistance to the Web administrator. It would still take a tremendous amount of human resources to investigate each reported content issue and correct each Web page. In the meantime, visitors would not be able to find the Web pages they are looking for, and the Web site would operate in an unpredictable and ineffective manner. These content issues on a corporation's Web site could cause material losses, either due to liability incurred or lost business. Thus, while the content scan would help identify the problems, it would be of little assistance in resolving them; it would still take a long time before the Web site would be effective at all.","There is therefore a need for a means of making the analysis and correction of data distribution systems over the Internet and similar networks, much more practical and effective. Such a system should be provided with consideration for the problems outlined above.","It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a method and system which obviates or mitigates at least one of the disadvantages described above.","One aspect of the invention is broadly defined as a method of A method of analysing a Web page comprising the steps of analysing the Web page and identifying content issues; obtaining traffic data for the Web page; correlating the content issues with the traffic data; and producing a report on the correlated data.","Another aspect of the invention is defined as a method of analysing a Web site comprising the steps of: analysing the Web site and identifying content issues for each Web page of the Web site; obtaining traffic data for each the Web page of the Web site; correlating the content issues with the traffic data; and producing reports on the correlated data.","A further aspect of the invention is defined as a system for analysing a Web site, the system comprising: a Web server; a Content Analysis server; a Traffic Data server; and a communication network for interconnecting the Web server, the Content Analysis server and the Traffic Data server; the Web server supporting the Web site, and being operable to: accumulate traffic data for the Web site; the Traffic Data server being operable to: aggregate the traffic data; and the Content Analysis server being operable to: analyse the Web site and compile a list of content issues for each page of the Web site, the content issues being indexed by Web page; obtain traffic data for the Web pages from the Traffic Data Server; correlate the list of content issues with the Traffic Data; and produce reports on the correlated data.","As noted above, Web sites are becoming larger and larger, and the rate at Which their content is being changed is ever increasing. Rather than the simple Web sites which contained little more than background and content information, consisting of 6-10 pages that changed on a monthly or annual basis, it is now quite common for Web sites to have hundreds of thousands of Web pages that change on almost a daily basis such as newspaper Web sites. Other Web sites, such as those operated by governments or large corporations, may even have millions of Web pages. Software tools simply do not exist to manage such Web sites in an effective and efficient way.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"This methodology begins with an analysis of the targeted Web page at step , so that content issues can be identified. This can be done before, after, or at the same time as step , the step of obtaining real-world traffic data for the Web page. The traffic data and identified content issues are then correlated with one another at step , and reports to the Web administrator produced at step .","As will be described hereinafter, this methodology will generally be applied to Web sites with large numbers of Web pages, but could be applied to Web sites of any size. Hence,  refers to the analysis of a single Web page.","Most of the tools needed to effect this methodology are known in the art. Content issue reporting tools used in step , for example, are commonly available; exemplary products include Watchfire WebXM\u2122, Coast WebMaster\u2122, Keynote NetMechanic\u2122, Maxamine Knowledge Platform\u2122, SSB InFocus\u2122, HiSoftware AccVerify\u2122 and Crunchy Page Screamer Central\u2122. These tools can report on many Web page content issues, including: broken links, broken anchors, slow pages, missing Alt text, spelling errors, forms, compliance with accessibility guidelines, cookie handling, third-party links and P3P compact policies (a more comprehensive list is given hereinafter).","Similarly, traffic data collection software required for step  is also widely available (suppliers including NetGenesis, Mach5 and WebTrends). These tools typically record each visit that is made to a Web site either by analysing Web site logs or by directly interacting with the visitor, recording all of the data in a database. Thus, the traffic database is easily accessed, and since the data is in a rawform (i.e. one record per hit), it is easily manipulated.","An implementation of the invention simply requires that the content issue analysis and traffic tools be integrated, or just output data from these two packages, and report production tools developed.","The actual work that would be required to integrate the content issue analysis tools and traffic data tools would depend on the tools being used, and the design philosophy. In the preferred embodiment described hereinafter, the traffic analysis tools themselves are not integrated at all\u2014the software of the invention simply accesses traffic data which is stored in a file of its own. Similarly, software could be written that accesses files containing content issue data that has been produced by an independent run of a content issue analysis tool. Implementing the invention in this way, the developer only needs to know the format of the traffic and content issue databases, and he can write code to collect the data he requires\u2014no knowledge of how the tools operate themselves is necessary because there is no interaction with the tools.","Conversely, the software of the invention could be integrated with either or both of the traffic and content issue tools.","Traffic data can be understood from a number of perspectives. The basic unit of traffic measurement is a \u201chit\u201d, which represents a single request of a web-based resource (for instance, a Web page). Hits are generally recorded with a timestamp and the Internet protocol (IP) address from which the request to access the web-based resource originated (the \u201cvisitor\u201d). Since hit data can be noisy (as one IP address may request the same web-based resource frequently over a short period of time), a more abstract unit of traffic measurement is the \u201cvisit\u201d. A visit begins the first time a web-based resource is requested by a visitor, and remains open over multiple requests by the same visitor for that resource as long as some specified time (the \u201ctimeout\u201d) between requests does not elapse. The invention can be implemented using either form of traffic data, though \u201cvisit\u201d data would generally be more useful.","The collection of real-world traffic data is usually done over an extended period of time, so that the data are relevant. Thus, step  will generally be effected on an ongoing basis. This is not essential however; traffic collection could easily be performed only for specific periods of time.","Once the traffic and content issue data are obtained, the data are correlated so that reports can be produced. These steps, of course could be effected in many ways. Content issue data would generally be collected and indexed by Web page, and indeed, reporting by Web page is generally the most logical way to report. However, content issue data could also be sorted by the nature of the content issue. Certain content issues, for example, might be considered \u201cfatal\u201d content issues, such as pages which contain errors which might cause browsers to crash, or pages which are not linked to any other page. Other content issues might be considered to be less significant (such as Web pages which contain large images which are slow to download), or (such as Web pages which link to outside Web pages which have become outdated).","In the preferred embodiment described hereinafter, the two sets of data (traffic and content issue data) are merged into a single database. Many GUI-based (graphic user interface-based) data management and reporting tools east, so it is quite straightforward to merge this data and produce the desired reports. Reports may simply be presented to the Web administrator on a display screen, printed out, or stored for future reference.","Many different reports could be produced. Four categories of Web site content issues that can be reported on include the following:\n\n","Thus, the invention of  addresses the problems in the art. Given large, complex Web sites and a possibly large number of issues with the content of those Web sites, the invention provides an effective way of classifying and presenting the content of the Web sites and the issues that the Web sites contain. Web pages with errors can be identified by issue type, and listed or ranked in order of the number of hits that they receive. In this way, Web pages with the greatest number of hits are the highest priority to correct. Web pages with comparatively few hits are clearly having less an impact on the viability of the Web site, so they can be corrected later.","While software tools do exist which identify content issues in Web sites, they do not consider the magnitude of the effect the content issues have on the Web site. Organizations are looking for ways to analyse content issues on their Web sites in order to take effective action. Integrating traffic data with content issue data allows you to prioritize content issues by high traffic areas, so you can identify and fix the most visible problems first.","Further advantages will become clear from the description of other embodiments of the invention which follow.","Prioritizing content issues by high traffic areas allows you to fix your most visible problems first, thus optimizing web resources and lowering web operational costs. The method of the invention helps you apply customer information back into your web design and content management to improve your Web site Return on Investment (ROI).","The invention automates Web site testing and analysis, producing detailed, actionable reports to help organizations detect and manage content quality, privacy, and accessibility issues on large enterprise Web sites. These reports include the following:\n\n","The invention can be implemented in many different ways. For example, it could be deployed in a centralized service bureau configuration, or as a decentralized hosted service. Many options and alternatives are described hereinafter, but it would be clear to one skilled in the art that many other variants follow from the teachings herein.","A comprehensive application of the invention with respect to a Web site, is presented in the flow chart of . The general principles for the design of the software were as follows:\n\n","The process begins by soliciting the Web administrator to establish the parameters and preferences for the analysis at step . The general application of the invention is intended to be very flexible, thus the Web administrator can associate traffic data with a specific domain on the target Web site, and configure the traffic settings for the domain. These settings differ, depending on the type of traffic data source that is being used. The software can support as many traffic connections as required to perform the analysis; preferably these connections are recorded in a table describing each of the dialog box elements, so that they can be confirmed by the Web administrator and stored for future information.","The parameters that have to be defined will vary with the particular application and design philosophy, but in general, the following must be established:\n\n","Once the parameters have been established an analysis of the Web site or Web pages can now be performed at step . Clearly, this step flows logically from the parameters set at step  and the nature of the analysis tools being used. The identified content issues will typically be stored locally in a database, so that it can be accessed as required. This data could also be identified by the parameters used to produce it, so that it can be used for historical analysis. Typically, this will be performed via a Content Analysis server interconnected with the Web site in some manner. For example, Content Analysis software will typically reside on a server that has access to the Web site via the Internet, an Intranet, or local network.","The desirable traffic data is then requested from the traffic data server at step . In the preferred method of the invention, the traffic data is collected in an ongoing manner by an external service, and is stored on a remote serer. There are many kinds of traffic data files depending on Web server supporting the targeted Web site, such as IIS (IIS stands for \u201cInternet Information Server\u201d), Apache, NCSA, Netscape and O'Reilly. Each of these Web servers typically has a different format for writing traffic information.","Each time a file is hit or requested by a visitor, the Web server records information about the hit to a traffic data file. One traffic data file generally records a day's worth of hits. A Web server is hit for each file necessary to build the Web page; not only is a hit registered for the html file, but hits also may be registered for any graphics within the HTML page. Similarly, hits on Java applets, ActiveX controls, and executable files are recorded in the log file.","Different Web servers record different information, but the following information is almost always found in Web server log files:\n\n","In addition, some Web servers log the following information:\n\n","Traffic data files can easily grow to be very, very large. A relatively small Web site that has several thousand visitors a month will have approximately 25 megabytes of traffic data files. While traffic data vendors collect records of each individual hit, they generally make this data available in an \u201caggregate form\u201d, that is, condensing the traffic records by visitor. This makes the downloading and processing of these records far more efficient.","There are two ways to pass the request data from the software of the invention to the traffic application at step :\n\n","The traffic server will then interpret the request and return the desired traffic data at step . This will be done in the manner which the traffic server was designed to, as traffic servers are designed to supply such information.","The traffic data is then received by the software of the invention at step  and is stored in a local database, giving the software the flexibility needed to perform the desired analyses and production of reports. It may also be necessary to rationalize the format of the traffic data to match the format that is used by the software of the invention as part of this step.","At this point, the software of the invention has produced two sets of data: the data for the targeted Web pages, and traffic data corresponding to the same set of Web pages. URL normalization is now performed at step , if desired. Because of the length of the discussion, URL normalization is addressed under a separate heading below.","The analysis and report generation steps  and  may now be performed. These two steps will be discussed together because one follows from the other, and they are both driven by the output desired by the Web administrator. In fact, commonly available database management systems essentially perform both steps together as a single set of query code directs both the analysis that is performed and the output of the data. The reports may be printed out, stored in data files, or presented to the Web administrator graphically, for example, using HTML, ASP or XML documents. (HTML and XML are markup languages which are well known. ASP or \u201cActive Server Pages\u201d, is a script-based, server-side Microsoft technology for dynamically created Web pages).","Note that there are now two local database tables, one containing Web page content issues, and one containing traffic data. These two database tables are interrelated via the URLs of the Web pages.","Reports can be produced to detail a very large number of content issues and Web page characteristics. The content issues and Web page characteristics include the following:\n\n","In addition, Web administrators may configure custom rules (that correspond, for instance, to a corporate content or \u201clook and feel\u201d standard) and report on pages that are not in compliance with these rules; reports can be produced that detail the aggregate issues on a page; and, searches for content by issue or characteristic can be performed.","Other analyses which can be performed and reported upon in conjunction with the above, include the following:\n\n","The priority of these measurements may vary from one Web administrator to another, or even from one analysis to another.","Several exemplary reports are described hereinafter.","URL Normalization","\u201cNormalizing\u201d a URL is the process of modifying a URL to its lowest denominator. As noted above, it may be desirable to normalize URLs in the traffic data by removing distinctions made by:\n\n","The rules that govern the URL normalization process are established during the parameter setup step , and apply to all URLs within that analysis.","The individual transformations that consist of the concept of normalizing may change over time as new concepts are added but the underlyng meaning of it will be consistent. Each URL encountered is processed through a set of transformations to reduce it to its normal form. The content issues and characteristics for multiple URLs whose normal forms are identical will be reckoned only once; traffic for multiple URLs whose normal forms are identical will be summed across each non-normal URL to achieve a total traffic number for that normal URL.","To maintain optimal performance the software should be designed to store the current optimization preferences rather than having to access the preference data every time a new URL is processed.","Exemplary URL normalization transformations include the following:\n\n","Currently the session id is searched for within the entire URL so if the session id variable happens to be in the path then the URL will be stripped early. If the Web administrator had an option to identify a character that identified the beginning of any session variables then they could define where search started. In most sites this would be defaulted to the \u201c?\u201d character. To implement this the session id could be searched in the URL from anything following this character.","Traffic Vendors","There are many existing traffic data vendors and as the invention is not limited by the nature of the traffic vendor, it could be applied to any such vendor. The systems used by three exemplary traffic vendors are described hereinafter. Generally, each of these traffic data vendors produces data records for each hit on a targeted Web site, these data records containing: URL, user ID, data and time. Other specific design considerations for integrating the invention with each of these traffic vendors are as follows:","1. NetGenesis","NetGenesis provides access to e-customer analytics and e-metrics via a flexible, fully integrated Web-based thin client interface:\n\n","FastStats provides similar traffic data reporting to that of Netgenesis, such as the pages visitors access most, what links they click, and from what pages they leave. It also records other non-traffic data that is helpful in the implementation of the invention, such as what browsers and computer visitors use, and the amount of data transferred per page. Other data that FastStats reports on include:\n\n","FastStats Analyser can analyse the log files at speeds between 80-100 megabytes per minute. FastStats Analyser does not have a developer's kit, but does support the export of reports to Word or HTML formats.","3. WebTrends","The WebTrends Enterprise Suite is a Web site management solution for single or clustered servers, combining cartridges for Web server traffic analysis, streaming media server analysis, proxy server analysis, link analysis and quality control and monitoring, alerting and recovery of Internet servers.","WebTrends records data and produces reports much like the others in the art, including: general statistics, most requested pages, least requested pages, most downloaded files, activity level by day of week, activity level by hour, bandwidth, page not found (404) errors, server errors, and the like. It also records data of particular interest in the implementation of the invention, such as: referring sites, referring URLs, search engines, search phrases, browsers and platforms, visiting spiders, most-used platforms and operating systems.","WebTrends can analyse the log files at speeds between 15-20 megabytes per minute, which is slower than others. However WebTrends has an API interface to integrate with the system of the invention and has a large number of standard reports.","Exemplary Reporting Formats",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0219"},"figref":"FIGS. 5 through 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0220"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"110","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0037","list-style":"none"},"li":["1. an index frame  which lists headings for each Web page in the software package of the invention;","2. a \u201creport properties frame\u201d  which lists the properties of the current report, the \u201cPages with Broken Links\u201d report;","3. an \u201coverview frame\u201d  which summarizes the results of the report; and","4. a \u201cdetails frame\u201d  which breaks down the results of the report for each Web page in the analysis."]}},"The index frame  is common to all of the reports.
