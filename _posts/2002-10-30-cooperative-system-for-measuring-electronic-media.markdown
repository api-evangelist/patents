title: Cooperative system for measuring electronic media
abstract: A cooperative electronic media measurement system is disclosed that measures the electronic media usage of one or more individuals by a media research entity. The media research entity defines at least one specialized task useful to the media research entity. The at least one specialized task is performed by a media handler provided by another entity and concerns a handling of electronic media by the media handler. The individual is tracked with at least one software agent of the media research entity. At least one software agent obtains a product of the specialized task performed by the media handler via at least one defined interface that provides interoperability between the media handler and the at least one software agent. Cooperative media handlers automatically obtain information from, or otherwise obtain information about, presented media objects including identification tags, if present, and other information, for collection by the research data collection agents.

No. 10\/026,872, filed Dec. 21, 2001, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/880,371, filed Jun. 23, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,353,929, each incorporated by reference herein.","The present invention relates generally to a system for measuring a population's exposure to and interactions with electronic media (hereinafter, \u201celectronic media measurement systems\u201d), and more particularly, to a cooperative electronic media measurement system using media handlers to extract information from, or otherwise obtain information about, presented media objects, including identification tags, if present, for collection by software agents on behalf of a centralized media research facility.","The success of any advertising campaign depends on the accurate placement of advertisements within media, and the verification that specific advertising messages were presented in accord with a predefined media plan. Generally, an advertising campaign is targeted for one or more segments of a population, with media planners determining the best media vehicles to reach the target audience. In this manner, the advertiser seeks to find the most efficient media to minimize the cost to deliver a desired audience.","Thus, prior to executing a given advertising campaign, media planners use syndicated research, such as Nielsen ratings, to determine the best media vehicles to reach a target audience. In addition, media planners utilize other information sources to research and compare the costs associated with reaching an audience through each available media vehicle. During a given advertising campaign, it is helpful to measure the target audience's exposure to the advertising messages, since media planners might make corrections in order to optimize the execution of the media plan. Likewise, after a given advertising campaign, media planners often analyze the execution of the campaign to confirm that the advertising messages reached the targeted audience to determine the accuracy of the campaign's messages in reaching the targeted audience.","As audiences have fragmented, due to the increasing number of available channels and online options, it has become increasingly challenging for media planners to determine which media vehicles provide the best avenue to a given audience. The Internet, in particular, provides advertisers with many media options and is becoming ubiquitously available in an expanding variety of personal electronic devices, far beyond its initial limited availability to users via computer terminals and desktop computers. As with other media, advertising has become an important part of Internet revenue models. Much of the Internet's value to the advertising community is due to its enormous and evolving diversity of advertising formats, including the banner ad and Java applets, and its capability to deliver customized and relevant advertising to end users. For a more detailed discussion of advertising media, see D. Jugenheimer et al., Advertising Media Strategy and Tactics (W.C.B. Brown & Benchmark, 1992), incorporated by reference herein.","Thus, the Internet provides an efficient mechanism for matching the advertising message to the appropriate segment of the audience. Such diverse advertising formats, however, present challenges for measuring a population's exposure to and interactions with such advertisements. While the success of the Internet can be attributed, in large part, to its open media standards that permit the creation and delivery of content having diverse formats across many platforms, there is currently no user-centric system capable of adequately measuring the diverse media formats across the growing variety of Internet-enabled consumer platforms, consistent with the needs of the advertising community.","Generally, a given population's exposure to and interactions with media is measured by knowing the television channels and other information sources that the members of the population select. This can be performed either as a census, where the choices of the entire population are collected, or as a sample, where a statistically valid sub-population or panel is chosen to represent the entire population. Nielsen Media Research, for example, uses a panel of households, known as \u201cNielsen Families,\u201d for measuring television viewing. Such panels enable research companies to correlate demographics, such as age, gender, income and education, with choice of content.","Conventional content frequently contains, or is associated with, metadata that provides information about the content. For example, many broadcasters transmit information with conventional programming to help identify the content, for example, by program and episode. Nielsen, for example, extracts such accompanying information for measurement purposes to track the programs viewed by certain members of a panel. In addition, smart electronic program guides use such accompanying information to help individuals or their agents find content of interest.","Similarly, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), has endorsed the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS), which is an open standard for tagging information and coding content on the Internet. The PICS standard is designed to allow software to automatically filter content that individuals choose not to receive, such as violent content, according to a ratings system. The PICS standard provides parents and other individuals with the ability to select categories of content that can be automatically blocked, in a similar manner to V-chip technology, for conventional programming. While the PICS standard allows an entire web site or static pages to be rated, the PICS standard does not permit tagging content on an object level.","In addition, traditional electronic advertising, such as television and radio advertisements, have unique identification codes, or Industry Standard Commercial Identification (ISCI) codes, which are used for handling, broadcasting, storing and retrieving commercials. Under the ISCI standard, an ISCI alpha prefix and an ISCI numeric code identify each commercial. An ISCI prefix is assigned by ISCI to national and regional advertisers and advertising agencies. The ISCI code may be used in any manner, at the discretion of the prefix owner, provided the code consists of four letters followed by four numbers. Although ISCI codes are not presently encoded as computer readable data with each advertisement, they might evolve to do so for Internet advertising, to better manage advertising on the Internet.","There exists both \u201cpull\u201d and \u201cpush\u201d models for delivering Internet content. On traditional web sites, individuals \u201cpull\u201d content by browsing. These web sites can use tools to analyze the \u201chits\u201d to their sites in real-time. Additionally, there exist \u201cpush\u201d models of content delivery, such as provided by PointCast\u2122. PointCast\u2122 is a webcasting service that \u201cpushes\u201d or streams a variety of information, including editorial and advertising content, to a receiving software component, such as their proprietary screensaver, or Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, version 4.0. Presently, each PointCast\u2122 subscriber self-reports demographic information. Therefore, PointCast\u2122 can provide advertisers with user-centric information about advertising exposure. Self-monitoring, however, is contrary to advertising industry guidelines, which express a preference for measurement by a disinterested third party. In addition, the PointCast\u2122 system is limited to measuring only electronic media distributed by PointCast\u2122.","Even assuming that an independent auditor verified such site-centric measurements, the measurements often do not accurately reflect the activity of individuals. For example, many of the \u201chits\u201d on a web site are associated with electronic agents that perform functions on the Internet on behalf of individuals. Examples of such electronic agents include web robots, issued by search engines such as those provided by Infoseek Corp. to index the contents of the Internet, and personal agents that automatically retrieve information from the Internet that matches the specified preferences of an individual. Thus, such electronic agents increase the traffic count of the respective web site, as they are not necessarily representative of an individual viewing Internet content. For example, an agent might download the entire contents of a site, while the user only views a single article. Proxy servers, on the other hand, which cache or copy Internet content to a local server or hard disk drive for subsequent access, can decrease the traffic count of a given web site. Proxy servers are used to reduce access time by storing a copy of information that was recently downloaded from a site. Thus, upon a subsequent request, the information can be delivered from the local server rather than the Internet without the knowledge of the web site traffic counter.","While conventional electronic media measurement systems, such as Nielsen Media Research's PeopleMeter\u2122, have successfully measured traditional media, such as television and radio, such systems are not easily extendable to the Internet environment. In addition, the site-centric measurement approaches discussed above have proven unsatisfactory. In order to accurately measure a population's exposure to and interactions with such electronic media, a user-centric measurement approach is needed which is based on a panel chosen to be statistically representative of the total population of interest. Current user-centric Internet measurement systems, however, such as the NPD Group's PC Meter\u2122, are based on interception and interpretation of electronic media presented to members of a panel. Such interception techniques, however, rely on observing calls by software applications to the operating system and require privileged access into operating system internals. Furthermore, PC Meter\u2122 is currently limited to household users of the Windows\u2122 operating system, which may not be statistically representative of the total population of interest. For a more detailed discussion of the PC Meter\u2122 system, see PCT Published Application Number WO 96\/41495.","It is believed that observing operating system internals will become increasingly challenging, if not impossible, with the trend towards more secure operating systems and communication security. Windows NT\u2122 from Microsoft\u2122, for example, implements a concentric ring structure of ascending privilege with an outermost ring of lowest privilege and an innermost ring of highest privilege, from which applications are excluded, based on the processor ring architecture specified by Intel Corporation. As security services become more available to Internet applications, both for computer-to-computer communications and application-to-application communications, much of this internal traffic will be encrypted. In addition, such operating system monitoring techniques will be challenging to implement within the many proprietary implementations of Internet-enabled devices, such as WebTV\u2122. Even assuming that such user-centric measurement systems are successful in obtaining access to these communications, it is very challenging to understand what the intercepted messages mean.","A recent industry article indicates that a new company, Relevant Knowledge Inc., of Atlanta, Ga., has developed a real-time approach to compete with the PC Meter\u2122 system. Although Relevant Knowledge Inc. did not comment publicly for the article, it does not appear that Relevant Knowledge Inc. is using a cooperative approach. Rather, it appears that Relevant Knowledge Inc. is monitoring information, using interception and interpretation, and leveraging the communication capabilities of the Internet to distribute their monitoring software to their panel members and to collect data in real-time.","As apparent from the above-described deficiencies with conventional electronic media measurement systems, a need exists for a universal system for measuring electronic media having diverse formats, including television, radio, Internet, and online services, across a plurality of platforms. A further need exists for a cooperating system that extends the open media standards of the Internet to measure a population's exposure to and interactions with such electronic media. Yet another need exists for a system to measure traditional television, radio, cable television, digital satellite programming and advertising delivered to households that use Internet-enabled computers and appliances for viewing, listening and interacting with such content.","Generally, a method and apparatus are disclosed for measuring the electronic media usage of one or more individuals by a media research entity. The media research entity defines at least one specialized task useful to the media research entity. The at least one specialized task is performed by a media handler provided by another entity and concerns a handling of electronic media by the media handler. The individual is tracked with at least one software agent of the media research entity. At least one software agent obtains a product of the specialized task performed by the media handler via at least one defined interface that provides interoperability between the media handler and the at least one software agent.","The media research entity can assign one or more software agents, hereinafter referred to as research data collection (RDC) agents, to measure an individual's exposure to and interactions with electronic media. Thus, each research data collection agent serves as an intermediary between the local environment of an individual and the central media research entity. In one embodiment, a research data collection agent is associated with each computing device utilized by a given individual. Thus, an individual might be assigned multiple research data collection agents, if required, to measure the individual's use of electronic media across multiple devices. Furthermore, a single research data collection agent may serve a plurality of individuals utilizing the same computing device.","According to a further aspect of the invention, cooperative media handlers are utilized by the computing device of an individual to present media to an individual and to extract information from, or otherwise obtain information about, the media objects, including identification tags, if present, for collection by the research data collection agents. As used herein, the term cooperating system means a system that relies on the media handler software which presents the media to cooperate by gathering and developing information about media activities of end users, and transmitting such activity information to the media research controller, either directly or indirectly via the research data collection agents, in effect acting as agents of the media research controller, as opposed to conventional approaches of intercepting and interpreting the media activities of end users.","As used herein, the term media handler includes persistent software components which extend the capabilities of a software application or operating system to present media objects of a particular media type to an individual and autonomous software components, such as Java applets, which may only temporarily extend the capabilities of the host to present media. In addition, the term media handler includes software applications that generate media experiences in real-time, such as video games, and resident software components, such as the PointCast\u2122 agent, which present media to end users. In addition, the term media handler includes those portions of an Internet browser, also called \u201cviewers\u201d and \u201cplug-ins\u201d, that are capable and responsible for decoding specific media types, such as JPEG images, and using the resources of their host to present the media to the end user. The media handlers may be mobile, moving from one host computer to another, or stable, anchored to one host.","Thus, in addition to their primary function of presenting media, the cooperative media handlers also serve as software agents for the research data collection agents, by gathering and deriving relevant information about the media presentation on behalf of the research data collection agents and then sending this information to the research data collection agents. The media handlers are in the best position to provide information about the media objects presented to the individuals, since the media handler can decode the particular media type, and determine what is presented to the individual, when it is presented and how the individual interacts with the object. In this manner, the media handler can report on an individual's exposure to and interactions with a media object, such as zooming in on a particular feature of a media object or rotating the object, and the source of the control signals, such as a specific individual or process. In the case of stable, installed media handlers, such as video games or screensaver clients; or in the case of mobile, transient media handlers, such as a Java applet advertisement, they become cooperative through the implementation of an application programming interface (API), and communicate to the research data collection agents via their host. In all of these instances, the media handler's host might contribute contextual information, such as the web site of origin, to the media handler along with the media object.","The research data collection agents and the cooperative media handlers (the hosted processes) can communicate using at least one defined interface, such as an application programming interface (API) to define the function calls which the hosted processes and their hosts use to communicate and share resources and services, or a communication protocol. In this manner, different companies can develop interoperable research data collection agents, cooperative media handlers and hosts.","When electronic media is received by a cooperative media handler, the media handler automatically extracts information from, or otherwise obtains information about, the media, including an identification tag, if present, for transmission to a research data collection agent. In addition to the extracted identification tag, if present, the cooperative media handler preferably transmits any content metadata associated with the media object, including program, episode and version for television and radio programming; identifiers of the media handler and the host of the media handler; timestamps related to the presentation; any contextual information which has been made available to the media handler, such as an indication of the media source for television and radio programming, or a source computer's domain name or IP address for a web site, or the context in which it was presented; presentation information; user interaction information; and content rating information, such as PICS, if available.","A more complete understanding of the present invention, as well as further features and advantages of the present invention, will be obtained by reference to the following detailed description and drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["110","120","205","400","130","400","400","300","150","300"]},"The external networks  shown in  include the Internet, the Public Switched Telephone Network (\u201cPSTN\u201d) and networks for the delivery of radio and television programming, such as the Digital Satellite Service (\u201cDSS\u2122\u201d), cable television (\u201cCATV\u201d) and other over-the-air transmission networks for broadcast television, radio and satellite communications. The PSTN, as used herein, includes the combination of local and long distance wire or wireless facilities and switches, as well as cellular network systems. The Internet, as used herein, includes the World Wide Web (the \u201cWeb\u201d) and other systems for storing and retrieving information using the Internet.","According to a feature of the present invention, the media research controller  registers advertisements and other media for subsequent measurement and provides a unique identification tag that may be added to, or associated with, the existing media object for identification purposes. In addition, the present invention extracts information from, or otherwise obtains information about, presented media objects, including metadata or other information associated with a given media object, for later collection by the media research controller  even when the media object has not been previously registered and tagged by the media research controller . In this manner, the present invention measures a panel member's exposure to and interactions with all electronic media, regardless of whether the media has been previously registered or tagged for identification purposes. The panel members are preferably chosen for their demographics and have agreed to participate in a research panel to have their electronic media measured. The panel is preferably constructed so that it is representative of and projectable to the entire population. It is noted that if a census is desired, as opposed to a panel, the panel simply consists of the entire population of interest.","As shown conceptually in , the present invention preferably consists of a number of cooperating entities to measure electronic media presented to a panel member  by means of the panel member-computing device , namely, a centralized media research controller , a research data collection agent  and a cooperative media handler . As previously indicated, the media research controller  measures a panel's exposure to and interactions with electronic media for subsequent reporting to one or more research customers . As used herein, the term cooperating system means a system that relies on the media handler software which presents the media to cooperate, by gathering and developing information about media activities of end users, and transmitting such activity information to the media research controller, either directly or indirectly via the research data collection agents, in effect acting as agents of the media research controller, as opposed to conventional approaches of intercepting and interpreting the media activities of end users.","To this end, the media research controller  preferably assigns one or more software agents, referred to as research data collection agents , discussed further below in conjunction with , to measure each panel member's exposure to and interactions with electronic media. Thus, each research data collection agent  serves as an intermediary between the local environment of a panel member  and the central media research controller . In one embodiment, a research data collection agent  is associated with each computing device  utilized by a given panel member . Thus, a single panel member might be assigned multiple research data collection agents, if required to measure the panel member's use of electronic media across multiple devices. Furthermore, a single research data collection agent  may serve a plurality of panel members utilizing the same computing device . It is not necessary for the research data collection agent  to be proximal to the associated panel member or the panel member's physical environment. Since the research data collection agent  is user-centric, the agent  might be a component of the person's net-centric environment and be activated as a side effect of the person obtaining access to network resources, or the agent  may reside on a smartcard carried by the individual.","In addition, the cooperative media handlers , discussed below in conjunction with , are utilized by the panel member-computing device  to present media to the panel member  and to extract information from, or otherwise obtain information about, presented media objects, including identification tags, if present, for collection by the research data collection agents . Thus, in addition to their primary function of presenting media, the cooperative media handlers  also serve as software agents for the research data collection agents , by gathering and deriving relevant information about the media presentation on behalf of the research data collection agents and then sending this information to the research data collection agents. It is noted that while some of the media handlers might be implemented as cooperative media handlers , as described herein, the present invention is not dependent upon all of the media handlers being implemented in a cooperative manner. However, the extent of research data collection agent's  ability to measure a panel member's exposure to and interactions with electronic media is limited to media presented by means of a cooperative media handler .","As used herein, a software agent is a software component that has the ability and authority to act on behalf of a controlling entity, generally instantiated as a process on a host computer. Each agent's controlling entity provides the agent with resources, such as encryption keys and a digital certificate for identification, and delegates specific tasks to the agent. The software agents manage these tasks, and operate in an autonomous or semi-autonomous mode with respect to its controlling entity. The software agents may be mobile, moving from one host computer to another, or stable, anchored at one host.","The software agent's host preferably provides the software agent with necessary computational resources, such as processor cycles, memory and communication. In the illustrative embodiment, discussed further below, an Internet browser software product, such as Netscape Navigator\u2122 or Microsoft Internet Explorer\u2122, resident on the panel member-computing device , serves as the host  for the research data collection agent  and the host \u2032 for the cooperative media handler  and provides them with the required computational resources. In alternate embodiments, the host for one or both of the research data collection agent and the cooperative media handlers may be embodied as an operating system or a virtual machine, such as the Java virtual machine. The research data collection agent  preferably communicates with the media research controller  by means of the host's secure communication capabilities, such as SSL or S\/MIME. In addition, the research data collection agent  relies on its host  to pass through data sent by the cooperative media handler  for collection by a research data collection agent .","The communications between the various entities are preferably sufficiently encrypted to protect the privacy of the panel members , the proprietary information and competitive interests of the media research controller  and the validity of the collected data, as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill. Furthermore, to protect the privacy of non-panel members, the cooperative features of the hosts , \u2032, as described herein, are preferably initially disabled when distributed to end-users, and are only subsequently enabled when specifically authorized by a panel member who has agreed to participate in a research panel.","In some embodiments, the research data collection agent  is not proximal to the panel member(s) it tracks, or the panel member's physical environment. For example, the research data collection agent might be hosted by the central computer of an online service. In other embodiments, the research data collection agent is hosted separately from the cooperative media handlers. For example, the research data collection agent  might be located in a wristwatch worn by the panel member. Thus, the host services and resources may reside locally or be accessed by means of a network connection, or a combination thereof, as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill. It is noted that the research data collection agents  and the cooperative media handlers  might typically share the same host or might be hosted separately, for example, in an embodiment where the media research data collection agent  associated with a panel member  is resident on a smartcard or wristwatch carried by an individual.","As illustrated in , the present invention relies on a number of cooperative interfaces between the various entities. A media object is presented to a panel member  by the cooperative media handler  using a conventional bi-directional user interface . The cooperative media handler  transmits identification tags and other information extracted from, or otherwise obtained about, media objects for collection by a research data collection agent , by means of a cooperative interface . Upon receipt of an extracted identification tag or other obtained information from a media handler , the research data collection agent  sends a message to the media research controller , preferably over an external network , containing the extracted identification tag and other obtained information.","In addition, as previously indicated, the research data collection agents  and the cooperative media handlers  also require interfaces to their respective hosts , \u2032. In a preferred embodiment, the research data collection agents  and the cooperative media handlers  (the hosted processes) use an application programming interface (API) to define the function calls which the hosted processes and their hosts, such as the host , use to communicate and share resources and services. In this manner, different companies can develop interoperable research data collection agents, cooperative media handlers and hosts.","As previously indicated, when electronic media is received by a cooperative media handler  for presentation, the media handler  automatically extracts information from, or otherwise obtains information about, presented media object, including an identification tag, if present, and other relevant information, as available, for transmission to a research data collection agent . In addition to the extracted identification tag, if present, the cooperative media handler  preferably transmits any content metadata included in or associated with the media object, including program and episode information; an identification of media handler and its host; any contextual information which has been made available to the media handler , such as an indication of the media source for television and radio programming, or a source computer's domain name or IP address for a web site; any presentation information or user interaction information, and content rating information, such as PICS, if available. Each of these information types is discussed further below in conjunction with .","A research data collection agent  preferably commences tracking of a panel member, and begins collecting such transmissions from the cooperative media handlers , when a panel member enters the scope of the research data collection agent  and has been identified and authenticated, for example, following a log on procedure. Similarly, the research data collection agent  suspends tracking of a panel member  when the person leaves the scope of the remote media research agent , such as following a log off procedure. The research data collection agent (i) creates log entry objects from transmissions received from the cooperative media handlers and places the log entry objects into an unfiltered media queue, (ii) confirms the integrity of the messages and filters out unnecessary log entry objects from the unfiltered media queue to create a filtered media queue, (iii) creates dispatch objects using objects from the filtered media queue and places created dispatch objects into a dispatch queue, and (iv) transmits dispatch objects from the dispatch queue to the media research controller, when resources are available.","The cooperative media handlers  preferably are not aware of whether or not a research data collection agent  is present and measuring the content presented to a panel member, for the same reason that the identities of Nielsen families are carefully concealed from the media sources that Nielsen measures, to prevent manipulation of the content presented to the panel members. Thus, the cooperative media handlers  preferably transmit information extracted from, or otherwise obtained about, presented media objects, for collection by a research data collection agent , whether or not a research data collection agent  is present. For efficiency purposes, however, when the same host  is hosting both the research data collection agent  and media handler , the host may inhibit the cooperative media handler  from transmitting information extracted from or obtained about media objects when a research data collection agent  is not present, is not in a tracking mode or the panel members are not in scope.","According to a feature of the present invention, the media handlers  thus cooperate with the research data collection agents  by gathering and deriving relevant information about the media presentation on behalf of the research data collection agents and then sending this information to the research data collection agents. The media handlers  are in the best position to provide information about the media objects presented to the panel members , since the media handler is responsible for decoding or generating specific media objects, they determine what is presented, how it is presented, when it is presented and how the panel member  interacts with the presented media. Additionally, the media handlers  can extract metadata from the media object and glean contextual information about the media object from the media handler's host. Through their cooperation and assistance, the research data collection agent can gain access to information that might not be available in any other way.","Since the media research controller  can measure a panel's exposure to and interactions with the cooperative media handlers  themselves, in addition to exposure to and interactions with the underlying media objects of interest, providers of media handlers are motivated to develop media handlers which cooperate with the software processes of the present invention, and thereby ensure that the media handlers provide the required functionality. In this manner, media handler developers can receive custom research reports to analyze the panel's exposure to and interactions with such media handlers.","A media type is a means to represent media information, such as an image or a sound. For example, the PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file format is a media type for representing computer images. As used herein, a media object is an item or instance of a media type. Currently, there are hundreds of media types in use. Typically, media types are implemented as files, and increasingly as objects, and allow for some means of attaching metadata, or information about the data. In some cases, the metadata is implemented as a text field that resides in a header preceding the content data and can be extracted prior to decoding the content data. Generally, extraction of the header data is not computationally intensive, and can take place prior to or during the decoding and display or playback of the content.","Every media type must have a corresponding media handler, located at the end-user's client side to present a given media object to an individual. As used herein, the term media handler includes persistent software components which extend the capabilities of a software application or an operating system to present media objects of a particular media type to an individual and autonomous software components, such as Java applets, which may only temporarily extend the capabilities of the host to present media. In addition, the term media handler includes software applications that generate media experiences in real-time, such as video games, and resident software components, such as the PointCast\u2122 agent, which present media to end users. In addition, the term media handler includes those portions of an Internet browser, also called \u201cviewers\u201d and \u201cplug-ins\u201d, that are capable and responsible for decoding specific media types, such as JPEG images, and using the resources of their host to present the media to the end user. The media handlers may be mobile, moving from one host computer to another, or stable, anchored to one host.","Typically, an Internet browser software product has a collection of internal media handlers, such as JPEG and GIF decoders. When a browser encounters a media object of a given media type, the browser transfers the media object to the appropriate media handler for decoding. In addition, most browsers incorporate \u201cplug-in\u201d architecture, which allows third parties to develop new media types and distribute corresponding media handlers as \u201cplug-ins.\u201d For example, Netscape Navigator\u2122 currently has over two hundred compatible plug-ins available.","It is noted that for continuous media, such as audio and video, identification tags are preferably placed at periodic intervals throughout the duration of the media or on an associated data channel. Since the identification tags might be utilized by hostile software to automatically remove advertising, the identification tags are preferably placed in both the advertising, as well as the associated advertising-supported media objects to discourage such automatic removal. In one preferred embodiment, discussed below in conjunction with , real identification tags are placed in media that is to be measured (and a fraction that is not), and dummy identification tags are placed in other content. As discussed further below, in order to permit the research data collection agents  to be tasked by the media research controller  to report only registered media, the research data collection agent  can preferably distinguish real identification tags from dummy identification tags, and, if desired, return only real identification tags to the media research controller .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","310","320","330","340","350","360","310"]},"The CPU  may be embodied as a single commercially available processor, such as Intel's Pentium 100 MHz P54C microprocessor, Motorola's 120 MHz PowerPC 604 microprocessor or Sun Microsystem's 166 MHz UltraSPARC-I microprocessor. Alternatively, the CPU  may be embodied as a number of such processors operating in parallel, on one or more distributed processing nodes. The data storage device  and\/or ROM  are operable to store one or more instructions, as discussed below in conjunction with , which the CPU  is operable to retrieve, interpret and execute.

As illustrated in , the media research controller  begins the processes embodying the principles of the present invention during step  upon receipt of a request to register a particular media object.","Thereafter, the media research controller  assigns a media identification key, M, during step  and creates a record of the media object in the registered media database table . In one embodiment, the identification tags are based on an extended version of the ISCI standard. In a preferred embodiment, the media research controller  utilizes a doubly encrypted identification tag to protect the security of the media identification key, which is preferably never made available outside the media research controller . Thus, the assigned media identification key, M, is preferably strongly encrypted with a private key, K, during step  to produce a payload, C. Thereafter, the payload, C, is digitally signed with a private key, K, to create a digital signature, DS, during step  and then the digital signature, DS, is prepended to the payload, C, during step  to produce a new message, M, shown in . It is noted that the new message, M, may optionally include bit padding to increase Cto a predefined length. Finally, the new message, M, is encrypted with a private key, K, during step  to produce a real tag, C. For a more detailed discussion of suitable encryption and security techniques, see B. Schneier, Applied Cryptography (2d ed. 1997), incorporated by reference herein.","Thereafter, the real tag, C, is placed in the media object during step , or on a simultaneous channel, and also placed in field  of the registered media database . The identification tag can be bound to the content in a variety of ways. Preferably, the advertisement or other media is represented as an object, and has been designed to implement the cooperative approach associated with the present invention by reserving a field or sub-object for storing the identification tag. It is important that the identification tag does not interfere in any way with the normal use of the media by any media handler or media handler host that has not implemented the cooperative API described herein. Binding can be generally achieved since the most prevalent media file formats and datatypes support extension through user-defined chunks or objects. As a last resort, the identification tag might be stored within an embedded comment field, into its URL, or even through steganography (hidden codes).","Finally, the media object is released for distribution during step , before program control ends during step .","As discussed above, dummy identification tags may be utilized in some content to prevent hostile software from automatically removing advertising media objects. To promote the use of dummy identification tags, they are preferably constructed simply as a random sequence of n bits, as shown in . In an alternate embodiment, the functionality for generating both real and dummy identification tags and encoding the identification tags into the media objects can be performed by third parties, such as advertising agencies or commercial producers, including edit houses or production facilities.","As discussed above, the media research controller  preferably executes a data importing process , shown in , to receive log dispatches from the remote media research agents , verify the authenticity and integrity of the received messages and place confirmed entries in the log entry table . As illustrated in , the media research controller  executes the data importing process upon receipt of a log dispatch from a research data collection agent during step .","Thereafter, the data importing process verifies the authenticity and integrity of the dispatch during step  and then decrypts the dispatch during step . Finally, the data importing process places all confirmed entries from the dispatch in the log entry database table  during step  before program control terminates during step .","As previously indicated, the media research controller  preferably executes a real-time reporting process , or a non-real-time reporting process \u2032, to generate reports suited to the needs of a particular research customer . As shown in , the data importing process , discussed above, will create records of data received from the research data collection agents  in a central database , from which the reports will be generated. The reports will be formatted to present available data, in a conventional manner, according to the needs one or more research customers . The customers  can access the reports over the external networks , or the reports can be printed off-line and provided to the customer , as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill.","As shown in , the research data collection agent  preferably includes a logging process , a filter process , a create-dispatch object process  and a dispatch process , discussed further below in conjunction with , , and , respectively. The logging process  is executed by the research data collection agent  to receive messages from cooperative media handlers  and create entry objects in an unfiltered media queue . The filter process  is executed to filter out dummy tags and other unnecessary information from the unfiltered media queue  to create a filtered media queue . Finally, the research data collection agent  executes the create-dispatch object process  to place the entries from the filtered media queue  into a dispatch queue  for transmission to the media research controller , by the dispatch process  when resources are available. It is noted that the research data collection agent  may also receive information regarding specific transactions made by an associated panel member, from a cooperative financial or end-user transaction process, as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill, based on the disclosure herein.","As previously indicated, the research data collection agent  executes a logging process , shown in , to receive messages from the cooperative media handler  and to create entries in the unfiltered media queue . Thus, the logging process  is entered during step  upon receipt by the research data collection agent  of a message from a cooperative media handler  by means of the host  of the media handler , containing an extracted identification tag, C\u2032, if available, and other information. Thereafter, the logging process  creates a log entry object  with the identification tag and other received information in the unfiltered media queue  during step , which is added to the tail of the unfiltered media queue  during step  before program control terminates during step .","As discussed above, the research data collection agent  periodically executes a filter process , shown in , to filter out dummy tags and other unnecessary information from the unfiltered media queue  to create a filtered media queue . As shown in , the filter process  performs a test during step  to determine if the unfiltered media queue  is empty. If it is determined during step  that the unfiltered media queue  is empty, then program control ends during step . If, however, it is determined during step  that the unfiltered media queue  is not empty, then a log entry object  is retrieved from the head of the unfiltered media queue  during step .\n\n","After the subroutine  executes, a test is performed during step  to determine if the received tag, C\u2032, stored in the current log entry object , contains a real identification tag. If it is determined during step  that the received tag, C\u2032, stored in the current log entry object , does not contain a real identification tag, then program control returns directly to step  to process additional log entry objects , if any. If, however, it is determined during step  that the received tag, C\u2032, stored in the log entry object , does contain a real identification tag, then the current log entry object  is placed in the filtered media queue  during step . Thereafter, program control returns to step  to process additional log entry objects , if any, in the manner described above.","In this manner, for efficiency purposes, if the research data collection agent  is tasked by the media research controller to report only registered media, then the research data collection agent  preferably only returns log entry objects  containing real identification tags to the media research controller . The research data collection agent  preferably does not know, however, whether or not the media object containing a real identification tag is an advertisement. As previously indicated, real identification tags are preferably placed in a small percentage of the advertising-subsidized media objects as a countermeasure against hostile advertising filtering software. Thus, if the research data collection agent's local encryption keys Kand Kare compromised and obtained by advertising filtering software, the advertising filtering software erroneously filters out some non-advertising media objects. It is noted that advertising filtering software is further discouraged by the preferred selection of challenging encryption techniques, since the research data collection agent  can evaluate the authenticity of a received tag hours after the media is presented, while the advertising filtering software typically would need to decrypt the identification tags in real-time.","As previously indicated, the filter process  executes a decoding subroutine , shown in , during step  to determine if the received tag, C\u2032, stored in the current record of the unfiltered media log , contains a real identification tag. The decoding subroutine  is entered during step , where the received tag, C\u2032, is decrypted to create a message, M\u2032, using the value of the public key, K, stored in the local encryption keys database table . The decoding subroutine  then creates a digital signature, DS\u2032, from the first m bits of the message, M\u2032, and creates C\u2032 from the remainder during step .","Thereafter, a test is performed during step  to determine if the digital signature, DS\u2032, is a valid digital signature of C\u2032. If it is determined during step  that the digital signature, DS\u2032, is a valid digital signature of C\u2032 then the decoding subroutine returns an indication during step  to the filter process  that the received tag is a real identification tag. If, however, it is determined during step  that the digital signature, DS\u2032, is not a valid digital signature of C\u2032 then the decoding subroutine returns an indication during step  to the filter process  that the received tag is an invalid or dummy identification tag. In order to implement the security algorithms discussed in , the research data collection agent  preferably has access to the necessary cryptographic services through its host, and has received the required public keys, Kand K, by means of a secure distribution method from the media research controller .","As discussed above, the research data collection agent  executes a create-dispatch object process , shown in , to place entries from the filtered media queue  into a dispatch queue  for transmission by the dispatch process , shown in , to the media research controller , when resources are available. Initially, the create-dispatch object process  performs a test during step  to determine if the filtered media queue  is empty. If it is determined during step  that the filtered media queue  is empty, then program control ends during step .","If, however, it is determined during step  that the filtered media queue  is not empty, then a further test is performed during step  to determine if a dispatch object  already exists. If it is determined during step  that a dispatch object  already exists, then program control proceeds directly to step . If, however, it is determined during step  that a dispatch object  does not already exist, then a new dispatch object  is created during step .","Thereafter, a log entry object  is retrieved from the head of the filtered media queue  during step , and placed in the dispatch object . Thereafter, a test is performed during step  to determine if the filtered media queue  is empty or if the dispatch object  is full. If it is determined during step  that the filtered media queue  is not empty and that the dispatch object  is not full, then program control returns to step  to continue processing additional log entry objects  from the filtered media queue , if any.","If, however, it is determined during step  that the filtered media queue  is empty or that the dispatch object  is full, then the dispatch object  will be compressed and digitally signed during step . Thereafter, the compressed dispatch object  will preferably be encrypted during step  using the public key, K, of the media research controller . Finally, the compressed and encrypted dispatch object  will be added to the tail of the dispatch queue  during step  and program control returns to step  and continues in the manner discussed above.","As previously indicated, a dispatch process , shown in , transmits dispatch objects  from the dispatch queue  to the media research controller , when resources are available. Thus, a test is initially performed during step  to determine if the dispatch queue  is empty. If it is determined during step  that the dispatch queue  is empty, then program control terminates during step . If, however, it is determined during step  that the dispatch queue  is not empty, then a dispatch object  is removed from the head of the dispatch queue  during step  and sent to the media research controller  during step . Thereafter, program control returns to step  to process additional dispatch objects , if any, in the manner described above.","As previously indicated, the RDC\/cooperative media handler host  preferably executes a tracking process , shown in , to notify the hosted research data collection agents  when a panel member enters or exits the agent's scope. In addition, as discussed above, the research data collection agents  and the cooperative media handlers  preferably rely on services and resources provided by the host processes for processing, security, storage and communication. In the illustrative embodiment discussed herein, an Internet browser software product, such as Netscape Navigator\u2122 or Microsoft Internet Explorer\u2122, resident on the panel member-computing device , serves as the host for both the research data collection agent  and the cooperative media handler  and provides them with computational resources.","Thus, as shown in , an illustrative tracking process  continuously reports when a panel member enters or exits its scope during step . Once the tracking process  determines that a panel member has entered the scope of a research data collection agent, a message is sent to the hosted research data collection agent  during step  monitoring the panel member indicating that a panel member has entered the agent's scope.","Thereafter, the tracking process  continuously monitors the panel member during step  until the panel member leaves the scope of the hosted research data collection agent . If it is determined during step  that the panelist has left the scope of the hosted research data collection agent , then a message is sent to the hosted research data collection agent  during step  indicating that a panel member has left the agent's scope. A test is then performed during step  to determine if tracking should be suspended. If it is determined during step  that tracking should not be suspended, then program control returns to step  to continue tracking, in the manner described above. If, however, it is determined during step  that tracking should be suspended, then program control terminates during step .","As discussed above, the cooperative media handler process , shown in , preferably presents media objects and extracts information from, or otherwise obtains information about, presented media objects, including identification tags, if present, for collection by research data collection agents , whether or not a research data collection agent  is actually present. In an alternate implementation, the cooperative media handler  can transmit all information obtained about a media object directly to the media research controller  and perform all other tasks associated with the research data collection agents . In other words, the cooperative media handler  can directly serve as the software agent of the media research controller , without the need of an intermediary research data collection agent , as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill.","In one embodiment, the media handler  is provided with one or more remotely configurable settings which may be dynamically specified by the research data collection agent  or the media research controller  to help filter out information which is not of interest to the research data collection agent . Alternatively, the media handler  can query its host to identify the information of interest to the research data collection agent . If, however, the host does not want to inform the media handler  that no research data collection agent  is present, the host might have the media handler  pass everything. Thus, the media handler  preferably reports information according to instructions received from the research data collection agent  via its host.","As shown in , a cooperative media handler  is initiated by its host \u2032, such as the illustrative Internet browser, upon receipt of a media object having a media type that is compatible with the media handler. Thereafter, the media handler process  decodes and parses the media object during step , in a known manner. A test is then performed during step  to determine if there is media object information associated with the media object, such as an identification tag, metadata or contextual information. As previously indicated, metadata may include program identification information and the corresponding media type and contextual information may include the URL and other information indicating the source of the corresponding media object, or the context in which it was presented to the end user. If it is determined during step  that there is media object information associated with the media object, then a test is performed during step  to determine if a message has already been created for the research data collection agent . If it is determined during step  that a message has already been created for the research data collection agent , then program control proceeds directly to step . If, however, it is determined during step  that a message has not yet been created for the research data collection agent , then a message is created during step .","Thereafter, the media object information identified during step  is added to the agent message during step . Thereafter, a further test is performed during step  to determine if there is media to present to a user. If it is determined during step  that there is no media to present to a user, then program control proceeds directly to step . If, however, it is determined during step  that there is media to present to a user, then a conventional presentation process is performed during step  to present the media. A test is then performed during step  to determine if there is presentation information to report to the research data collection agent . As previously indicated, presentation information may include the language and format in which the media object was presented to the panel member, or other information indicating how the object was presented to the panel member, when alternative presentations are possible. If it is determined during step  that there is no presentation information to report to the research data collection agent , then program control proceeds directly to step . If, however, it is determined during step  that there is presentation information to report to the research data collection agent , then the presentation information identified during step  is added to the message during step .","A test is performed during step  to determine if user interactions are received during the presentation of the media object. If it is determined during step  that user interactions are received during the presentation of the media object, then program control proceeds directly to step . If, however, it is determined during step  that user interactions are received during the presentation of the media object, then the user interactions are received and processed during step . A test is then performed during step  to determine if there is user interaction information to report to the research data collection agent . As previously indicated, user interaction information may specify how the panel member interacted with the object, including whether the panel member zoomed in on portions of the media object, or rotated the object, as well as the size of the media object and any user inputs.","If it is determined during step  that there is no user interaction information to report to the research data collection agent , then program control proceeds directly to step . If, however, it is determined during step  that there is user interaction information to report to the research data collection agent , then the user interaction information identified during step  is added to the message during step .","A test is performed during step  to determine if the presentation of the media object is finished. If it is determined during step  that the presentation of the media object is not finished, then program control will return to step  to continue processing in the manner described above. If, however, it is determined during step  that the presentation of the media object is finished, then a test is performed during step  to determine if there is a message to be sent to the research data collection agent . If it is determined during step  that there is a message to be sent to the research data collection agent , then the message is completed during step , for example, by adding media handler identifying information, and a final time and date stamp. Thereafter, the completed message is sent to the research data collection agent . Program control will then terminate during step .","It is to be understood that the embodiments and variations shown and described herein are merely illustrative of the principles of this invention and that various modifications may be implemented by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 1"],"b":["3","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 2","FIG. 8","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 3"],"i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIGS. 12","i":["b ","c "],"b":"12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIGS. 15","FIG. 4"],"i":["a ","b ","f "],"b":"15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 4"],"i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 4"],"i":"c "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 4"],"i":"d "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 4"],"i":"e "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 4"],"i":"f "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 4"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
