title: Apparatus for spreading liquid liner in rocket tube
abstract: An apparatus for spreading liquid liner in the interior of a rocket motor tube, the rocket motor tube having masks attached at both ends of the rocket motor tube, the apparatus including a generally vertical support plate with an opening there through; a flange with a center opening attached to the support plate; a support tube inserted into the center opening of the flange; a stop disposed in the support tube, the stop abutting the support plate and engaging a mask on one end of the rocket motor tube; a retaining funnel that engages a mask on the other end of the rocket motor tube; a retaining ring that threadingly engages the retaining funnel; and at least two clamps attached to the support tube and engaging the retaining ring.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for government purposes without the payment of any royalties thereof.","The invention relates in general to devices for spreading liquid liner on the interior of rocket tubes and in particular to a device for spreading liquid liner in a rocket tube that has deposited therein a continuous bead of liner. After the liner is spread, another apparatus, such as a spinner, further distributes the liner in the rocket tube.","Rocket motor tubes are lined with a fire retardant liner to prevent the propellant from burning through the tube wall. The rocket tubes are, for example, about three feet long and two to three inches in diameter. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/927,647, filed on Aug. 25, 2004, entitled \u201cApparatus For Applying Liquid Liner To Rocket Tube,\u201d having the same inventor as the present application, discloses an apparatus for dispensing a continuous bead of liner into a rocket motor tube. The contents of the above noted previous application are hereby expressly incorporated by reference.","After depositing the continuous bead of liner in the rocket tube, the liner must be spread around to cover the interior of the rocket tube. The present invention uses a powered brush and a rocket tube support or holder to accomplish the spreading operation. After the brushing operation, another apparatus (not part of the present invention) is used to spin the tubes to further uniformly apply the liner to the interior of the tube.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIGS. 1 and 2","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["10","10","10","12","13","12","14","24","14","16","12","14","12"]},"By way of example,  show two support tubes , however, the apparatus may use a single support tube or multiple support tubes. The structure associated with each support tube is identical, therefore, only a single support tube will be described. See  for an enlarged view of a single support tube . Apparatus  further includes a flange  attached to the support plate  using fasteners . Flange  has a center opening . A support tube  threadingly engages the center opening  of the flange . Retaining ring  is disposed on support tube  on an end opposite flange . At least two clamps  are attached to the support tube  and engage the retaining ring . Additional clamps  may be used, if desired.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["36","10","36","38","40","46","22","46","12","40","36","50","38","36","36","42","42","44","48","48","42","36"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 8","FIGS. 6 and 7","FIGS. 5 and 8"],"b":["38","36","56","38","58","50","60","58","38","60","58","50","52","42","36","50","28","27","29","30","22","31","33","61","30","70","28","28","63","50","40","26"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3","FIGS. 9 and 10"],"b":["40","36","62","40","66","46","68","66","40","68","66","46","64","13","12","46","32","64","46","34","32","46","22"]},"In operation, a rocket tube  has previously had a substantially continuous bead of liner deposited therein. The bead of liner must now be spread as evenly as possible on the interior of the rocket motor tube. Rocket motor tube  with masks ,  is inserted in support tube . Angled portion  of mask  will engage angled portion  of stop . Retaining funnel  is inserted in rocket tube  so that angled portion  of retaining funnel  engages angled portion  of mask . Retaining funnel  threadingly engages retainer ring . Clamps  are inserted in groove  of retaining ring . Retaining funnel  threadingly engages retainer ring  to tighten funnel and secure the rocket motor tube  in the support tube  by pressing against mask . Brush  is primed with liquid liner and inserted into funnel  and thence into rocket tube . Brush  is rotated by power tool  and manually moved axially back and forth inside tube  to evenly spread the previously deposited liner.","To inspect the coverage of the tube interior by the liner, the brush  is removed and the flashlight  is turned on. Light from flashlight  shines through stop  inspection hole  and illuminates the interior of rocket motor tube . One may then visually inspect the interior of the tube by looking into the end of the tube opposite the flashlight. If additional spreading is required, the operation is repeated. When used in conjunction with U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/927,647, filed on Aug. 25, 2004, entitled \u201cApparatus For Applying Liquid Liner To Rocket Tube,\u201d mask  and mask  have equal outside diameters so that liner may be added or removed as and where required. After any such correction, the present invention is again used to spread the liner as previously described until the desired liner weight is achieved.","While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments, numerous changes, alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims, and equivalents thereof."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, like or corresponding parts are denoted by like or corresponding reference numerals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
