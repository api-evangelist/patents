title: Conductance valve and pressure-to-conductance transducer method and apparatus
abstract: A device for interrupting or throttling undesired ionic transport through a fluid network is disclosed. The device acts as a fluid valve by reversibly generating a fixed “bubble” in the conducting solvent solution carried by the network. The device comprises a porous hydrophobic structure filling a portion of a connecting channel within the network and optionally incorporates flow restrictor elements at either end of the porous structure that function as pressure isolation barriers, and a fluid reservoir connected to the region of the channel containing the porous structure. Also included is a pressure pump connected to the fluid reservoir. The device operates by causing the pump to vary the hydraulic pressure to a quantity of solvent solution held within the reservoir and porous structure. At high pressures, most or all of the pores of the structure are filled with conducting liquid so the ionic conductance is high. At lower pressures, only a fraction of the pores are filled with liquid, so ionic conductivity is lower. Below a threshold pressure, the porous structure contains only vapor, so there is no liquid conduction path. The device therefore effectively throttles ionic transport through the porous structure and acts as a “conductance valve” or “pressure-to-conductance” transducer within the network.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a method for controlling undesirable flow of charged species across, or between, regions of a fluid network such as a separation network. Such systems typically comprise multiple separation channels connected by a common manifold and in those systems where separation is driven by an electrical gradient (electrokinetic pumping), a means for uncoupling species transport between channels is desirable.","Integrated microfluidic networks used for analytical microseparations generally rely on electrokinetic phenomena for control of material transport through the channels. A recurring network topology consists of a distribution manifold connected to many parallel channels. This arrangement, shown schematically in  for the case of two channels, enables a common buffer solution or sample to be distributed to all channels, but then allows individual channels to perform different functions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00006","num":"00006"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["1","2","3","4","5","5","6","12","2","3","5","5","6","4","2","3","9","10","13","14","4","6"],"sub":["L ","R ","L ","R"]},"In , the electrical potentials of sample reservoirs  and waste reservoirs  and  are allowed to float, and voltage gradients are applied along each of channels  and . (Here, different polarities of voltage gradients are shown to emphasize the fact that the separations in channels  and  may be different from one another.) Block arrows  and  now show the desired direction of transport of the sample species \u201cof interest\u201d down the length of the separation channels  and  respectively. For example, if there were no electro-osmotic flow in the separation channels, positively charged species that have a negative electrokinetic mobility would separate in channel , and negatively charged species in channel , while oppositely charged species would move to respective waste reservoirs  and  at the top of channels  and , and neutral species would remain stationary.","However, it is apparent is that the arrangement illustrated in  can produce unwanted electrical \u201ccross-talk\u201d between the two separation channels, creating a current indicated by line arrows . Therefore, in addition to the desired transport of species through a particular channel, this \u201ccross-talk\u201d can transport ionic species between the coupled channels through the manifold.","2. Prior Art","A solution to the problem of this spurious ionic flow is the subject of the present invention. The simplest conceptual scheme would be a mechanical valve, where a solid element is slid across, or is rotated into and out of, the channel, thereby greatly reducing the cross sectional area of the separation channel. Although miniature valves are common, all examples known to the Applicants have dead volumes that are one or more orders of magnitude too large for use in the proposed microfluidic network. Numerous problems with tolerances, stiction, and limitations of micromachining materials and methods make the use of a mechanical valve extremely challenging for microfabricated microfluidic networks.","An alternate approach to providing a reversible barrier would be to generate a gas bubble along the flow path (channel) since, clearly, a channel whose cross section contains such a bubble has a lower ionic conductance than an unobstructed channel containing only the conducting solvent medium. However, given the dangers of gas bubbles becoming entrained in the solution and\/or migrating uncontrollably, localization and reversibly of bubble formation is absolutely essential. That is, the need for an independently controllable means for both generating and eliminating localized gas bubbles is critical to the proper operation of this invention. In the specific case of an electrokinetic switch (\u201cEK switch\u201d) relying on a gas bubble, if the bubble escapes from confinement in the switch region and blocks conductance through a channel, there may be no means to reestablish ionic conduction and fluid transport through that channel.","Numerous references to the use of in situ generated bubbles exist in the prior art. In particular, various U.S. patents contained in class 347, and particularly U.S. Pat. Ser. No. 6,062,681 to Field, et al., describe the use of bubbles as elements to control ink flow in print heads of ink-jet printer cartridges. Furthermore, Field, et al, refer to a publication by Thomas K. Jun and Chang-Jin Kim entitled \u201cMicroscale Pumping with Traversing Bubbles In Microchannels\u201d (SOLID-STATE SENSOR AND ACTUATOR WORKSHOP, HILTON HEAD, SOUTH CAROLINA, 144-147, Jun., 2-6, 1996) that suggest that a stationary vapor bubble formed by boiling a liquid flowing through a channel could serve as an obstruction against flow in the channel and therefore function as a valve. However, such a valve is impractical in a typical liquid that includes dissolved gas because flow of liquid cannot easily be restored.","Field, et al. also refer to the dissertation of Liwei Lin, entitled \u201cSelective Encapsulations of [Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems]: Micro-Channels, Needles, Resonators and Electro-mechanical Filters\u201d, University of California at Berkeley, 1993, also describes forming and moving bubbles within microchannels. The bubbles were formed by using micro-heaters to heat the liquid to a temperature close to its critical temperature. This reference also describes the effect of the shape of the flow channel on the preferred direction of movement of the bubble","Finally, U.S. Pat. No. 5,699,462 of Fouquet et al., describes using gas or vapor bubbles as switching elements for controlling the passage of optical communication signals through waveguides. This patent also describes forming the bubbles by using micro-heaters to heat the liquid. Bubble formation is enhanced by use of a gas dissolved in the fluid. The bubble is moved by creating a second bubble to force the first from its location.","The use of a bubble as a control element in a fluid channel, therefore, has been described. However, to limit the position of the bubble to a specific location within a fluid network, has not been described. That is, the prior art provides no teaching for how a gas bubble could be reversibly created and extinguished nor how its position could be maintained to provide process localization. Furthermore, the means taught by these references for creating and elimination bubbles is limited to the use of a heater element.","Other methods for eliminating gas bubbles such as by venting, dissolving, or reacting or condensing the gas, or by applying high pressure to reduce the size of the bubble are possible. Venting bubbles controllably, in the sorts of structures needed for microfluidic networks, however, requires the ability to pressure-flush the bubble into a micro-machined purgeable bubble trap. Although such an approach may be possible, the complexities of such a micro-machined design are considerable. Rapid injection or electrolytic generation of a highly soluble gas could be used to create a bubble that has a finite lifetime. However, this creates a danger of outgassing at some other point in the network, and highly soluble gasses (e.g., ammonia) may greatly disrupt the pH or other properties of the solution. Reacting (chemically scrubbing) the gas bubble appears to raise many of the same complexities.","To solve the problem of a suitable valve we have created a microfluidic element that can be interposed in the manifold to disrupt or throttle the electrokinetic transport through the manifold reversibly. Furthermore, this element also has a range of uses not confined to the sorts of topologies displayed here, but could be used to reversibly couple and uncouple channels electrically in a large variety of applications and configurations. The disclosed element, hereinafter referred to as an EK valve, is constructed by creating a region in a channel in which the connectivity of the fluid path can be reversibly disrupted partially or completely. Limiting or breaking the contiguity of the fluid filling the channels throttles or blocks both current flow and electrokinetic transport through the channel (assuming the interior walls of the microfluidic network are non-conducting; it they are conductive, the EK valve may only disrupt electrokinetic transport).","For the EK valve to be a controllable element in a network that employs electrokinetic fluid transport, localization of the disruption in ionic conductivity is crucial. In the specific case of a EK valve relying on a gas bubble, there may be no means to reestablish ionic conduction and fluid transport through that channel if the bubble escapes from confinement in the valve region and blocks conductance through a channel. One way in which bubbles may be definitively localized is to create conditions such that the bubble can only exist within a certain localized region, and will spontaneously change back to the liquid phase, dissolve, or react to form a liquid or dissolved material immediately upon leaving that region. For example, one could create a localized heated area, and thereby generate a steam bubble. Outside the localized area, the bubble would recondense. However, the need for providing high temperatures severely limits the range of applications for which this approach is suitable.","It is, therefore, an object of this invention to provide a valve means for controlling the flow of ionic species in a microfluidic network comprising a localized bubble wherein the bubble can be reversibly nucleated and enlarged, and eliminated.","It is still another object of this invention to provide a means for localizing a bubble within a microfluidic network.","It is yet another object of this invention to provide an electrokinetic pump for hydrostatically acting on a bubble.","It is a therefore a further object of this invention to providing a hydrophobic matrix comprising a packed bead of TEFLON\u00ae microspheres within whose pores a reversibly solvent bubble valve is generated and controlled by hydrostatic pressure.","These and other objects will now become apparent to those having ordinary skill in these arts as the description of the invention and its appended claims are recited in detail below.","An EK valve is described that is based on controllably vaporizing and recondensing a solvent material contained in a microchannel in order to create reversible \u201cbubbles\u201d by competing forced pressurization with spontaneous de-wetting or wetting by surface-tension effects. The forced pressurization is a controlled raising or lowering of the local hydrostatic pressure by the use of an auxiliary pump, such as an electrokinetic pump, described in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,277,257 herein incorporated by reference, acting on a carrier fluid. The de-wetting or wetting behavior of the device is adjusted by using bulk materials or surface coatings having specific interfacial properties to create regions in the channel in which a vapor can be easily created and recondensed by applying or releasing modest amounts of pressure. Alternatively, the vaporization and recondensation of a solvent could be caused by reversibly changing the interfacial properties of the material. In a porous hydrophobic medium having pores below a critical size, capillary forces may cause water (or other non-wetting solvents, such as for example acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, cyclohexane, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, and propylene carbonate) in the pores to vaporize spontaneously at room temperature and pressure. This phenomenon of spontaneous de-wetting is well-known to practitioners of reverse-phase chromatography as \u201ccolumn drying;\u201d and it occurs rapidly in chromatography column \u201cbeds\u201d packed with hydrophobic beads if a minimum applied hydrostatic pressure within the column is not continuously maintained on the solvent medium in the bed. Failure to maintain this minimum pressure gives rise to an un-wetted, or \u201cdry,\u201d region along the length of column bed.","In a local region of porous hydrophobic material, therefore, conditions may be created wherein bubbles of solvent vapor are stable, but recondense in adjacent regions. In the case of column drying, bubbles are generally removed by pumping liquid through the column under high pressure to flush out bubbles occurring in the dry section. The pressure required to force liquid back into the pores is related to the porosity and contact angle. As described below, so long as the solvent vapor has not been replaced by air or some other gas, the vapor can be recondensed by applying pressure, thereby reestablishing significant levels of ionic conductivity in the fluid material.","THEORY","To illustrate the present invention, an idealized network is described in which changes in ionic conductance in a material may be reversibly generated. Consider a sealed chamber filled with a porous, non-conductive, hydrophobic material that is connected to a constant-pressure reservoir of an aqueous solvent capable of conducting ionic currents (e.g., pure water, water\/organic mixtures, etc.). Assume that the thermodynamic state of the fluid in the reservoir is initially set so that the combination of the temperature and pressure are just sufficient to ensure all the pores of the hydrophobic material are filled with the conducting solution. If an electric potential is applied between distal electrodes in the container, the porous material will display a degree of ionic conductance that depends on solution properties such as the bulk conductivity of the aqueous solvent and the electrical formation factor of the material. This is the peak conductance of the material, since current can flow through all pores. If the pressure in the reservoir is lowered or the temperature is raised, or some combination of these changes, the liquid solvent will spontaneously boil or de-wet all pores having characteristic dimensions smaller than a threshold value. The ionic conductance of the medium is now reduced, since the electrical formation factor now excludes all pores below this threshold size. Further reducing the pressure and\/or increasing the temperature increases the de-wetting threshold size, de-wetting a larger fraction of the pores, and further lowers the material conductance. At a sufficiently low reservoir pressure and\/or high reservoir temperature, the solution will boil until all the solvent in the medium is in the vapor phase. As such, the ionic conductivity of this \u201cdry\u201d porous material, is reduced to negligible levels compared to the situation in which the porous material is filled with liquid. The hydrophobicity and pore size of the system can be tuned to set this low-pressure\/high-temperature limit, which can be below, at, or above atmospheric pressure and temperature.","Finally, it should be understood that the device of the foregoing description is sensitive to its thermodynamic state. That is, in general operation the device is sensitive to both pressure and temperature. At constant temperature, it acts as a pressure transducer, and at constant pressure, it acts as a temperature transducer. As such, everywhere we explicitly recite \u201cpressure\u201d, we also implicitly mean temperature; everywhere we recite pressure rising, we also imply the same effect for manifested by temperature falling.","Consider now what happens if the pressure in the reservoir is raised. The liquid vapor in the un-wetted pores will progressively recondense and liquid will flow from the reservoir into the material until, at equilibrium, all pores larger than a threshold size are filled and a finite material conductance is restored. At a sufficiently high pressure, the entire material is filled with solution and the conductance return to its peak value. Subsequent cycles of depressurization and repressurization, therefore, lead to large, cyclical changes in the conductivity of the porous matrix.","Due to surface tension or capillarity, curved surfaces, such as those in small pores, can be used to raise or lower the pressure at which a solvent boils in hydrophobic or hydrophilic porous materials, respectively. Moreover, this phenomenon is not restricted to porous matrices but occurs in any channel that induces a sufficiently large curvature in the liquid in at least one dimension. This condition includes cylindrical capillaries, as well as the interface of curved structures within a channel or the interface between two parallel planes separated by a small gap, etc. By the use of microfabricated structures such as obstacles (localized regions of a channel where the depth changes), posts (localized regions of a channel where a structure substantially spans the depth of the channel such as are described in commonly-owned U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 09\/886,165 and 10\/176,322, herein incorporated by reference), or shelves (regions where the depth of a channel changes), the distribution of these interfaces and, therefore, the pressure-bias points and conductance vs. pressure curves of devices can be readily engineered for specific applications. With a somewhat lower degree of engineering control, conducting solutions and porous media having tailored pore-size distributions and hydrophobicity\/hydrophilicity can be selected to meet specific requirements. The prototype valves of the present invention employ porous packings.","The Young-Laplace equation relates the pressure in liquid and gas phases at equilibrium, to the shape of the interface between the phases, \n\n\nwhere pand pare the liquid-phase and vapor phase pressures, respectively, y is the surface tension between the two phases and r is the effective radius of curvature of the interface. When body forces are negligible, e.g., in small capillaries, a liquid-vapor interface inside a channel with cylindrical walls will assume a constant radius of curvature equal to, \n\n\nwhere d is the cylinder diameter and \u03b8 is the contact angle of the liquid on the surface of the cylinder interior wall.\n","Since the effect of the vapor or gas phase on the contact angle is usually insignificant the pressure difference between liquid and vapor phases in a circular channel or pore is, therefore, just, \n\n","If the contact angle is greater than 90\u00b0, i.e., for a non-wetting system, the vapor phase pressure is lower than the liquid-phase pressure. At a critical diameter, the equilibrium Young-Laplace equation states the liquid-phase pressure will drop below zero. In fact, the vapor region grows in a non-equilibrium manner as the liquid-phase rapidly evaporates. The rate of this growth depends upon thermophysical properties of the liquid and the thermal properties of the channel.","While the dynamics of bubble nucleation and growth are too involved for this discussion, the phenomenon of spontaneous de-wetting can be understood by an analysis of the stability of the final de-wetted state. If the equilibrium pressure in the vapor phase given by the Young-Laplace equation is less than or equal to zero, the rate of release of surface energy by a retreating meniscus exceeds the pressure work done pushing against the full ambient pressure. In this case, even a complete vacuum behind the meniscus is incapable of halting its retreat. Consequently, fluids spontaneously de-wet in pores smaller than a critical size \n\n\nwhere pis the absolute pressure applied to the liquid.\n","For pure water on TEFLON\u00ae, at one atmosphere the critical pore size is about 1 \u03bcm in diameter. Increasing the applied pressure, however, reduces the critical pore size meaning that for a given pore geometry the entrained fluid will de-wet below a critical applied pressure and re-wet above a critical applied pressure. This phenomenon is the physical basis the EK switch design of the present invention. If the liquid phase is conductive, the presence of the vapor bubble breaks the liquid conduction path. Because of the absence of any residual film of liquid on the un-wetted surface and, in the absence of contaminants or surface-acting agents, the break in conduction is complete. Hence such devices can achieve a very high on\/off current ratio.","Note, for spontaneous de-wetting, is not necessary for a bubble to be able to advance in a stable manner against the full applied pressure. Bubbles will form spontaneously when the pressure in the vapor phase drops below the vapor pressure of the liquid. For water at room temperature, this correction to the critical diameter is small. Because the dynamics of the bubble growth is uncertain, the temperature local to the meniscus, and hence the bubble vapor pressure is uncertain. When the system has returned to thermal equilibrium following de-wetting, the fluid will remain de-wetted until the (weaker) condition illustrated by Equation 3, with Pequal to the vapor pressure, is satisfied.","Best Mode of the Device","We have created a device that comprises small packed regions of a porous hydrophobic material that can be reversibly wetted and \u201cdried\u201d by applying and releasing small amounts of hydrostatic pressure to a column of solvent media in contact with the hydrophobic material thereby cycling the solvent medium into and out of the interstitial void spaces comprising the packed regions. We have shown also that current flow though such a device can be interrupted and restored in a controllable and repeatable manner by applying and releasing pressure.","The valve of the present invention is intended only to control the conductance of a channel within a network of channels but requires pressure isolation from the fluidic network to minimize the effect of pressures applied to the switch. Moreover, without this isolation means, it may not be possible to create a low enough pressure in the valve to allow de-wetting the packed porous region when the pathway into which the valve is inserted is under an applied hydrostatic pressure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00052","num":"00052"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A and 2B","b":["20","30","20","25","25","25","22","25","30","23","22","30","21","24","21","23","20","25","21"],"i":["a ","b"]},"In the case of the present invention the actuator mechanism is an electrokinetic pump similar to the device described in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,277,257. The purpose of the pump is to reversibly pressurize and de-pressurize portions of the solvent media contained within the valve, particularly within the zone comprising hydrophobic matrix . This function, however, need not be provided only by an EK pump. Alternately, a variety of means, including a conventional pump or pressure source, a thermally activated pressure pump such as, for example, a small heater element placed over the valve for causing vaporization and de-wetting in the hydrophobic valve material could be used to actuate valve . Hydrophobic matrix  is itself comprised of very finely divided spheres of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), particularly 4 \u03bcm \u00d8 PTFE powder (DuPont Zonyl MP 1200).","The present embodiment, valve  is shown isolated between two flow restrictors or two salt bridges . As noted earlier, it is necessary to isolate valve  from the network into which it is inserted such that when pressure changes generated by actuator  are largely isolated to the region of valve  so that their effects on the rest of the network are minimized. The resistance to hydraulic flow of flow restrictors  determines the degree to which the valve is (or can be) isolated from pressures in the network channel  and how well the channel is isolated from the pressures necessary to actuate the valve. Sufficiently high pressures in channel  can overwhelm the valve actuator pressures, causing re-wetting and defeating the efficacy of valve . In the present case, the flow restrictors comprise a quantity of silica beads (\u02dc5 \u03bcm \u00d8) packed into flow channel  on either side of hydrophobic matrix  and running for a length of several millimeters.

Again, if the packing material is sufficiently hydrophobic, it may de-wet spontaneously at ambient pressures, so that the pump need only be turned off rather than to be actively reversed in order to open the EK valve.","Finally,  illustrates how the device of the present invention might be deployed in a typical microfluidic network.

(A second switch, a quantity of flow restrictor media  to occupy the opposite arm of the manifold in order to balance the resistance to injection flow on either side of the network manifold.)","Before describing specific experimental results, it is useful to describe some of the considerations concerning the use of such a device in an electrokinetic microfluidic network, and the materials from which such a device can be made. Although the device could be demonstrated with a large variety of different media or materials for providing a matrix of hydrophobic pores, the device of the present invention was constructed using packed beads of PTFE resin (DuPont TEFLON\u00ae) as the porous matrix. (Also useful are acetal resins, such as DuPont DELRIN\u00ae, and polytrifluorochloroethylene resins, such as 3M Kel-F\u00ae.) PTFE is chosen, however, because it has the following properties that are generally desirable for a device of this type, i.e., a conductivity switch, so that it may be interposed in a microfluidic network without otherwise disrupting its performance:","PTFE provides a matrix through which molecules can be pumped (hydraulically or electrokinetically) without excessive retention or surface adsorption that would occur if the usual hydrocarbon-based hydrophobic phases were used (e.g., packed silica microspheres coated with C)","PTFE may allow vapor formation with both aqueous and certain non-aqueous solvents such as acetonitrile that wet perfluorocarbons poorly but would wet hydrocarbon surfaces.","The operation of the EK valve was demonstrated using the experimental arrangement  shown schematically in FIG. . Device  consisted of a 250 \u03bcm ID silica capillary  with a terminal frit . Frit  is formed by tamping at least a 1 mm thick (long) layer of diol-coated 5 \u03bcm silica beads into the end of capillary , and then repeatedly dipping this end into a tetramethyl orthosilane sol-gel solution and letting it dry. The frit retains in the capillary lumen a layer 1 mm or greater thickness (length) of PTFE beads  (nominally 4 \u03bcm diameter DuPont Zonyl\u00ae MP 1200 PTFE powder). In the present example PTFE layer  was 14 mm long and was formed by slurry-packing in methanol. On top of PTFE layer  is a second frit layer  of diol-coated silica beads, about 5-10 mm thick (long), in which the frit was thermally formed.","For preliminary demonstration, the open end of the capillary column was connected to a 1 mL syringe  containing 10 mM tris buffer at a pH of 8.3 and the column filled with fluid contained in the syringe by injecting it under pressure. The distal end of the column was placed into a buffer reservoir (not shown) into which was inserted ground electrode . High voltage platinum electrode  was inserted into the barrel of syringe , so that pressure could be applied or released using the syringe while current was flowing through the device. Current was monitored via picoammeter  by measuring voltage across a 10 k\u03a9 resistor (not shown) interposed between the cathode and Bertan HV power supply  set at 1 kV. Pressure was manually induced with syringe  and monitored via pressure transducer . Both current and applied pressure were monitored simultaneously via a computer running LabView\u00ae software.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00064","num":"00064"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"40"},"Alternative Embodiments","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the EK valve described herein is readily adapted to many additional configurations. In particular it will be appreciated that while the embodiment described above can be operated as a binary, or digital, switch it can and does operate as an analog device as well. The EK valve of the present invention can be operated as a to throttle to fluid conductance by controlling the fraction of wetted pores by adjusting the pressure or temperature of the valve. Active control by conductance sensing may be employed to minimize sensitivity to fabrication, ambient conditions, drift, etc.","Furthermore, the valve can be used as a pressure-to-conductance transducer by connecting the valve pressurization port to the system to be sensed.","In addition, the various parts of the EK valve described herein can be rearranged so that each is widely separated from the others or from some combination of each. For instance, instead of the present arrangement of pump-valve-restrictor-channel (i.e., p-v-r-c) illustrated in , the pump (p), valve(v), and restrictor(r) portions can be arranged along any of the fluid channels(c), as pump-channel-valve-restrictor, as is shown schematically in , or as pump-channel-valve-restrictor-channel, and as pump-restrictor-channel-valve-channel-restrictor (not shown). Moreover, by arranging these elements across a manifold, such as is shown in , it is possible to provide greater flexibility and control of distribution\/pathways of charged species propagating through the manifold. (In both  the dashed arrows indicate an extension of the channel\/network.)","Finally, the valve may be deployed as a means for sensing pressure rather than a means for controlling ionic conductance through the manifold. A simple embodiment is shown in  wherein a branch, or gate , is placed in one of the flow channels  of a network manifold such that it is open to the channel and either closed at an opposite end or open to a second channel (FIG. C). The gate contains a length of the porous matrix or a set of the tailored obstructions  described earlier. Also included are an arrangement of electrodes, for example,  and , on either side of the porous matrix that establish an electrical current flow through the porous matrix. The device operates as follows: the pressure in the porous matrix equilibrates with pressure in the manifold. The conductance of the porous matrix depends on the pressure and thermodynamic state of the liquid as previously described. This pressure or state can thus be sensed by measuring the ionic conductance of the porous matrix. The conductance of the porous matrix can be measured by measuring the current flow through the porous matrix as, for example, a change in potential across a standard resistor. Since the electrode  is in direct electrical communication with the manifold, it can be common to several pressure transducers channels connected to the manifold.","A preferred embodiment of this conductance measurement is to capacitively couple a time-varying electric waveform to the electrode , capacitively or directly ground electrode , and measure the magnitude of the time-varying current through either electrode  or  by standard, well-known means, for example, envelope or phase-sensitive detection. The time-varying field can be made uniquely attributable to the sensor electrode  by for example applying a sensor-unique sinusoidal frequency or a sensor-unique spread-spectrum code sequence, allowing different sensors to be multiplexed to a common electrode . Capacitive coupling blocks any direct current, helping to prevent bubble generation at the electrodes, and allows the current and consequently pressure measurement to be made independently from other applied potentials, including, for example, fields applied to drive electrokinesis.","Alternatively, as shown in , the same general components may be arranged as a passive flow-rate sensitive device by eliminating the porous matrix in the branching channel , such that it now only contains electrode  and the solvent fluid, and by placing the channel branch adjacent to the porous matrix  of the valve of the present invention. The device can then operate to sense the pressure in the manifold channel by measuring the electrical current developed by the flow of ionic species through the porous matrix of the valve. The device is also sensitive to flow rate, through accompanying pressure drop in the porous plug.  shows a similar device having enhanced sensitivity to flow rate by the addition of flow-restrictor elements.","While the particular EK valve, as shown and described herein, is fully capable of attaining the above-described objects of the invention, it is to be understood that it is the presently preferred embodiment of the present invention and is thus representative of the subject matter which is broadly contemplated by the present invention, that the scope of the present invention fully encompasses other embodiments which may become obvious to those skilled in the art, and that the scope of the present invention is accordingly to be limited by nothing other than the appended claims. Furthermore, no element, component, or method step in the present disclosure is intended to be dedicated to the public regardless of whether the element, component, or method step is explicitly recited in the claims.
