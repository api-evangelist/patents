The government has certain rights in the present invention.","The present invention is directed to domino logic circuits and in particular to domino logic circuits with reduced power consumption during sleep (standby) mode.","The power consumed in high performance microprocessors has increased to levels that impose a fundamental limitation on continuing the historical trends of increasing performance and functionality. If the current trend in the increase in the power levels continues, high performance microprocessors will consume thousands of watts in the near future. The power density of a high performance microprocessor will exceed the power density levels encountered in typical rocket nozzles within the next decade. The generation, distribution, and dissipation of power are now at the forefront of the current problems faced by the integrated circuit industry.","Dynamic switching power, the dominant component of the total power consumed in current CMOS technologies, is quadratically reduced by lowering the supply voltage. Lowering the supply voltage, however, also degrades the circuit speed due to the reduced transistor currents. The threshold voltages are scaled in order to reduce the degradation in speed caused by supply voltage scaling while maintaining the dynamic power consumption within acceptable levels. At reduced threshold voltages, however, subthreshold leakage currents increase exponentially. The subthreshold leakage power is expected to dominate the total power consumption of a CMOS circuit in the near future. Energy efficient circuit techniques aimed at lowering the leakage currents are, therefore, highly desirable.","Domino logic circuit techniques are extensively applied in high performance microprocessors due to the superior speed and area characteristics of domino CMOS circuits as compared to static CMOS circuits. A dual threshold voltage (dual-V) circuit technique was proposed in J. Kao, \u201cDual Threshold Voltage Domino Logic,\u201d -, pp. 118-121, September 1999 (hereafter cited as \u201cKao\u201d) for reducing the subthreshold leakage of domino logic circuits. The technique proposed by Kao utilizes a mix of high and low threshold voltage transistors. High threshold voltage (high-V) transistors are employed on the non-critical precharge paths. Alternatively, low threshold voltage (low-V) transistors are employed on speed critical evaluation paths. Gating all of the inputs of the first stage domino circuits in a domino pipeline is proposed to force the idle domino gates into a low leakage state.","The energy and delay overheads for entering and leaving the sleep mode with the proposed technique, however, have not been addressed by Kao. Significant dynamic switching energy is consumed for activating the sleep mode with the technique proposed by Kao (due to the additional gates at the inputs). Additional energy is dissipated to precharge all of the dynamic nodes while reactivating a domino logic circuit at the end of an idle period. In order to justify the use of additional circuitry to place a dual-Vcircuit into a low leakage state, the total energy consumed for entering and leaving the standby mode must be significantly less than the savings in the standby leakage. Gating all of the inputs of the first stage of a domino circuit in a domino pipeline also increases the circuit area and active mode power. Furthermore, circuit performance during the active mode is degraded due to the additional gates at the inputs. A circuit technique with low delay and energy overheads for placing a dual-Vdomino logic circuit into a low leakage state is, therefore, desirable.","Employing dual threshold voltage (dual-V) transistors for leakage reduction in domino logic circuits was first proposed by Kao. Low-Vand dual-Vcarry propagator (P) and generator (G) circuits of a domino carry look ahead adder are shown in . The low-Vdomino generator (G)  of , the dual-Vdomino generator (G)  of , the low-Vdomino carry propagator (P)  of FIG. C and the dual-Vdomino carry propagator (P)  of  each include a clock signal input , a foot  connected to ground, a pulldown transistor network section  or , a pullup  or  connected to a voltage source (VDD) , a keeper  or  connected to a dynamic node , and a two-transistor output section  or .","The high-Vtransistors are represented in  (and throughout the drawings) by a bold line in the channel region. The critical signal transitions that determine the delay of a domino logic circuit occur along the evaluation path. Therefore, in a dual-Vdomino circuit, all of the transistors that can switch during the evaluation phase (other than the keeper) have a low-V. Alternatively, the precharge phase transitions are not critical for the performance of a domino logic circuit. Therefore, those transistors that are active during the precharge phase have a high-V.","If all of the high-Vtransistors are cutoff in a dual-Vdomino logic circuit, the leakage current is significantly reduced as compared to a low-Vcircuit. The clock is gated high, cutting off the high-Vpullup transistors when a domino logic circuit is idle. In a standard dual-Vdomino logic circuit, the modes of operation of the remaining portion of the high-Vtransistors (other than the pullup transistor) are determined by the input vectors applied after the clock is gated high.","Subthreshold leakage current exponentially decreases with increasing threshold voltage. The leakage current of a cutoff high-Vtransistor is significantly lower as compared to a low-Vtransistor. The leakage currents in a dual-Vcircuit can be reduced by employing a greater number of high-Vtransistors. Unless all of the high-Vtransistors are strongly cutoff, the potential savings in energy by a dual-Vdomino circuit technique cannot be fully exploited (as compared to a low-Vdomino circuit). Circuit techniques to place a domino logic circuit into a low leakage state regardless of the input vectors and the initial voltage states of the circuit nodes (before the gating of the clock) are desirable. Dual-Vdomino logic circuit techniques with different standby control mechanisms have been proposed in the literature.","A dual-Vcircuit technique was proposed by Kao for reducing the leakage current in domino pipelines. The dual-Vcircuit technique described by Kao requires the input signal of the first stage in each domino pipeline to be gated. After forcing the first stage of the domino gates to evaluate, the domino gates of the following stages in the pipeline also evaluate in a domino fashion. The technique proposed by Kao, however, is ineffective to place a circuit into a low leakage state if some of the domino gates in a cascaded domino logic circuit requires inverted signals (such as an XOR domino gate generating a sum bit at the output stage of a domino adder). Most domino logic circuits cannot be placed into a minimum leakage state (in which all of the high-Vtransistors are strongly cutoff) simply by gating the input vectors of the first stage gates of a domino circuit. The technique proposed by Kao also requires significant dynamic switching energy overhead for activating the sleep mode (due to the additional gates at the inputs). The dual-Vdomino circuit proposed by Kao, therefore, offers energy savings only if the circuit stays idle for a long time. Furthermore, gating all of the inputs of the first stage of a domino circuit in a domino pipeline increases the circuit area and active mode power. Circuit performance during the active mode is also degraded due to the additional gates at the inputs.","An alternative dual-Vtechnique has been proposed (M. W. Allam, M. H. Anis, and M. I. Elmasry, \u201cHigh-Speed Dynamic Logic Styles for Scaled-Down CMOS and MTCMOS Technologies,\u201d , pp. 155-160, July, 2000) to reduce the dynamic power, delay, and area overhead as compared to the technique proposed in Kao. Although the delay and area overhead is reduced, standby leakage energy is higher as compared to the circuit proposed in Kao. This increased leakage energy is primarily because the NMOS transistor inside the output inverter of the first stage domino gate in each domino pipeline is not fully turned off and because the keeper has a low-V.","Utilizing the leakage currents of the pulldown path transistors has been proposed (S. Heo and K. Asanovic, \u201cLeakage-Biased Dormino Circuits for Dynamic Fine-Grain Leakage Reduction,\u201d , pp. 316-319, June, 2002) for placing a dual-Vdomino logic circuit into a low leakage state. High-Vswitches are employed in series with the keeper and the NMOS transistor of the output inverter in a domino circuit. When the circuit is active, these high-Vswitches are on and the circuit operates similar to a standard dual-Vcircuit. When the circuit is idle, the high-Vseries switches are cutoff by a sleep signal, isolating the dynamic node from the power supply. The floating dynamic node slowly discharges due to the leakage current of the pulldown path transistors. The high-Vswitch in series with the NMOS transistor of the output inverter ensures that no short-circuit power is consumed during the slow discharge of the dynamic node. A high-Vseries transistor at the output inverter, however, degrades the precharge delay. Furthermore, a high-Vtransistor in series with a keeper degrades the noise immunity. To minimize the degradation in noise immunity and precharge delay, the size of these series switches needs to be increased. Wider series transistors, however, increase the energy overhead of activating the standby leakage control mechanism. Increasing the series transistor size also increases the area overhead of this technique. Another disadvantage of this technique is the slow speed of the proposed mechanism for placing a circuit into a low leakage state. The circuit technique, therefore, may not be feasible for fine-grain leakage reduction during short idle periods (a few tens to hundreds of clock cycles) in high performance integrated circuits.","It will be readily apparent that a need exists in the art to overcome the above difficulties of the prior art.","To achieve the above and other objects, the present invention, in one embodiment, is directed to a circuit technique for lowering the standby leakage energy of a domino logic circuit. The proposed circuit technique employs sleep switch transistors and a dual threshold voltage transistor distribution for placing a domino logic circuit into a low leakage state. An eight bit domino carry look ahead adder has been designed based on the proposed circuit technique. The proposed circuit technique reduces the leakage energy by up to 207 times as compared to a standard low threshold voltage domino circuit. With the proposed sleep switch circuit technique, the delay penalty for placing a circuit into a low leakage state is minimal. With the sleep switch circuit technique, a dual threshold voltage domino adder enters and leaves the sleep mode within a single clock cycle. The proposed circuit technique strongly turns off all of the high-Vtransistors and thereby exploits the full potential effectiveness of employing dual-Vtransistors to reduce the subthreshold leakage current. The proposed circuit technique, therefore, reduces the subthreshold leakage energy by up to 58 times as compared to a standard dual-Vdomino logic circuit. The energy overhead of the proposed sleep switch technique is low, permitting the proposed technique to be activated during idle periods as short as 381 clock cycles so as to reduce the standby leakage energy.","A low swing domino logic circuit technique is also proposed in another embodiment to lower the dynamic switching energy consumption of domino logic circuits operating in the active mode. The low swing concept is also applied to the domino circuit keeper to further reduce the power consumption while enhancing speed.","The sleep switch circuit technique reduces the leakage energy by up to 207 times as compared to a standard low-Vcircuit. The proposed circuit technique also reduces the active mode delay and power by up to 32% and 14%, respectively, as compared to a low-Vcircuit.","The proposed circuit technique strongly turns off all of the high-Vtransistors and thereby exploits the full potential effectiveness of employing dual-Vtransistors to reduce leakage. The sleep switch circuit technique reduces the leakage energy by up to 58 times as compared to a standard dual-Vcircuit. The energy overhead of the proposed sleep switch technique is low, justifying the use of the proposed technique during idle periods as short as 381 clock cycles in order to reduce standby leakage energy.","Low swing domino logic circuits with weakly driven keepers and fully driven keepers are proposed for power savings during the active mode of operation. The proposed low swing domino logic circuits can significantly reduce the active mode dynamic switching power consumption without degrading the noise immunity. The proposed low swing domino logic circuits with fully driven keeper lower active mode dynamic switching power by up to 9.4% and tolerate up to 2.6% more noise as compared to standard domino. The active power is further reduced by weakening the keeper which also improves the evaluation delay due to reduced contention current. The proposed low swing domino logic circuits with weakly driven keeper reduce the active mode dynamic switching power consumption by up to 12.4% as compared to standard domino logic circuits.","The standard dual-Vdomino logic circuit technique without sleep switches (prior art) is referred to as a no-sleep dual-Vdomino. The proposed sleep switch dual-Vcircuit technique (first preferred embodiment of the present invention) is referred to as SLS.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be set forth in detail with reference to the drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.","In the first preferred embodiment, a low energy and delay overhead circuit technique is proposed to lower the subthreshold leakage currents in an idle domino logic circuit. The proposed circuit technique employs sleep switches to place a dual-Vdomino logic circuit into a low leakage state within a single clock cycle. Generic domino logic gates based on the standard dual-Vdomino logic circuit technique are shown in . Generic domino logic gates based on the proposed sleep switch dual-V(SLS) domino logic circuit technique are shown in  and A-F. The generator and carry propagator gates of a domino carry look ahead adder based on the proposed SLS circuit technique are shown in .","The generic circuit A of the prior art as shown in FIG. A and the generic circuit A of the first preferred embodiment as shown in  have a low-Vpulldown network . However, the circuit A of  differs from the circuit A of  in that a high-VNMOS switch  (sleep transistor) is added to the dynamic node . The same switch is shown in the circuits  and  of . The operation of this transistor is controlled by a separate sleep signal. During the active mode of operation, the sleep signal is set low, the sleep switch is cut-off, and the proposed dual-Vcircuit operates as a standard dual-Vdomino circuit. During the standby mode of operation, the clock signal is maintained high, turning off the high-Vpull-up transistor of each domino gate. The sleep signal transitions high, turning on the sleep switch. The dynamic node of the domino gate is discharged through the sleep switch thereby turning off the high-VNMOS transistor within the output inverter. The output transitions high, cutting off the high-Vkeeper. After a sleep switch dual-Vdomino gate is forced to evaluate, the following gates (fed by the non-inverting signals) also evaluate in a domino fashion. After the node voltages settle to a steady state, all of the high-Vtransistors in a sleep switch domino logic circuit are strongly cut-off, thereby significantly reducing the subthreshold leakage current. Note that this technique, requiring no additional gating on the input signals while strongly turning off all of the high-Vtransistors within a single clock cycle, is significantly more power, delay, and area efficient as compared to the techniques proposed in the prior art.","A keeper transistor opposes the evaluation of the inputs during the evaluation period. A keeper transistor, therefore, degrades the speed and power characteristics of a domino logic circuit. A domino logic circuit can be designed without a keeper transistor if the noise immunity is not a big concern. A generic standard dual-Vdomino logic circuit B without a keeper transistor, but with a dual-Voutput , is shown in FIG. B.","A high-Vkeeper, as shown in , is preferable to reduce the subthreshold leakage current. However, a high-Vkeeper also degrades the noise immunity during the active mode of operation. For higher noise immunity, a domino logic circuit can be designed with a low-Vkeeper transistor. A generic standard dual-Vdomino logic circuit C with a low-Vkeeper transistor is shown in FIG. C.","The foot transistor  is a series switch between the pulldown network and ground. The evaluation speed of a domino logic circuit is degraded due to the parasitic impedances of the foot transistor. A domino logic circuit can be designed without a foot transistor, provided that the timing of the clock and input signals are adjusted carefully. A generic standard dual-Vdomino logic circuit D with a high-Vkeeper and without a foot transistor is shown in  generic standard dual-Vdomino logic circuit E with a low-Vkeeper and without a foot transistor is shown in  generic standard dual-Vdomino logic circuit F without a keeper and a foot transistor is shown in FIG. F.","Any of the circuits of  can be modified in accordance with the first preferred embodiment of the present invention to include a high-Vsleep transistor . The modifications of the circuits B-F are shown in  as B-F. The comments above concerning the circuit A of  apply mutatis mutandis to the circuits B-F of .","An alternative version of the proposed sleep switch dual-Vcircuit technique is also proposed. In this alternative version, the sleep transistor has a low threshold voltage. Note that this alternative circuit reduces the time it takes to enter the sleep mode, since the low-Vsleep transistor discharges the dynamic node faster as compared to a high-Vsleep transistor (assuming the low-Vand the high-Vsleep transistors have similar physical size). Generic domino logic gates based on the proposed sleep switch dual-V(SLS) domino logic circuit technique with low-Vsleep switches are shown in  as A-F, in which the low-Vsleep transistor is shown as .","Any of the circuits of  can be modified in accordance with the first preferred embodiment of the present invention to include a low-Vsleep transistor .

The standard dual-Vdomino logic circuit technique without sleep switches is referred to as a no-sleep dual-Vdomino.","The block diagram of a clock-delayed domino carry lookahead adder with the proposed sleep switch dual-Vcircuit technique is shown in FIG. . The circuit  of  includes a propagate and generate circuit , a look ahead carry generator , an invert and delay  and a sum generator . The clock signal at the clock signal input  is fed through delays  to the propagate and generate circuit , the look ahead carry generator  and the sum generator . A sleep signal input to the sleep signal input  is fed through a-delay  to the propagate and generate circuit  and the sum generator . The inputs to the propagate and generate circuit  are shown as . Each sum output  drives a capacitive load of 10 fF. A 1 GHz clock with a 50% duty cycle is applied to the domino logic circuits through the clock signal input . All of the common transistors in the SLS and no control dual-Vadders are sized the same.","In the SLS adder, all of the propagation (P), generation (G), and sum (S) domino gates have sleep switches. When the domino adder is idle, the P and G domino gates (in the first stage propagate and generate (PG) block) are forced to evaluate via sleep switches. The domino gates within the look ahead carry (C) block do not have sleep switches. Following the evaluation of the P and G gates, the domino gates within the carry block also evaluate in a domino fashion. Some of the signals originating from the PG block are inverted before being fed into the sum block (see FIG. ). The domino logic circuits within the sum block, therefore, also require sleep switches.","The input vectors applied to an adder are listed in Table 1. The leakage characteristics of the circuits are evaluated for six input vectors, Vto V. For the Vand Vinput vectors, Cand S, respectively, are evaluated through the critical path of the carry chain within the carry block shown in FIG. . The delay and active mode power are calculated for Vand V. During evaluation of the noise immunity, the same noise signal is coupled to all of the inputs of a domino logic circuit as this situation represents the worst case noise condition.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"INPUT VECTORS APPLIED TO AN ADDER"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"V","V","V","V","V","V"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"14pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["A","0","1","1","0","255","255"]},{"entry":["B","0","255","127","255","0","255"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The low noise margin (NML) is the noise immunity metric used.

Vis the output low voltage.\n","The proposed sleep switch circuit technique significantly reduces the standby leakage energy as compared to both low-Vand no-sleep dual-Vcircuits.","The leakage energy consumption (per clock cycle) of the low-V, no-sleep dual-V, and SLS adders is shown in FIG. . The leakage energy of a no-sleep dual-Vcircuit is reduced by 3.6\u00d7 to 8.1\u00d7 as compared to a low-Vcircuit. The standby leakage energy is dependent on the input vector applied to a circuit after the clock signal is gated high. The dynamic nodes of all of the domino logic circuits are precharged when the clock is low. After the clock transitions high, a portion of these domino gates evaluates provided that a necessary input combination to discharge the dynamic node is applied. For the input vector V, after the clock is gated high, the dynamic nodes of all of the domino logic gates of a no-sleep dual-Vadder are maintained high. This condition is typically the highest leakage state for a dual-Vdomino logic circuit since all of the high-Vtransistors operate in the strong inversion region. The advantages of dual-Vfor reducing the leakage current are maximized when all of the high-Vtransistors are strongly cutoff during the idle mode. For the input vector V, the leakage is from the low-Vtransistors rather than the high-Vtransistors. The Vvector, therefore, represents the worst case leakage input vector for a no-sleep dual-Vadder. For V, the leakage reduction of a no-sleep dual-Vcircuit is 3.6\u00d7 as compared to a low-Vadder.","As shown in , the proposed sleep switch circuit technique minimizes the leakage energy for all of the input vectors (applied after clock gating) as compared to both the low-Vand no-sleep dual-Vcircuits. Activating the sleep transistors places all of the domino gates into a low leakage state for any given input vector. The leakage energy reduction offered by the SLS circuit technique varies between 98\u00d7 and 207\u00d7 as compared to a low-Vadder. The proposed circuit technique cuts off all of the high-Vtransistors and thereby exploits the full effectiveness of employing dual-Vtransistors to reduce subthreshold leakage current. The proposed sleep switch circuit technique, therefore, reduces the leakage energy by 12\u00d7 to 58\u00d7 as compared to a standard no-sleep dual-Vadder.","The dependence of the leakage energy of an SLS circuit on the input vectors is due to the variation of the available leakage current conduction paths through the low-Vtransistors in the pulldown network of a domino gate. For example, for V, all of the pulldown low-Vtransistors of the generate domino gates in the first stage PG block of an adder (see ) are fully turned on. The leakage currents from the cutoff high-Vkeeper and pullup transistors passes through the low-Vpulldown transistors that operate in the strong inversion (or linear) region, thereby increasing the total leakage energy as shown in FIG. .","The active mode delay, power, and power delay product (PDP) of the low-V, no-sleep dual-V, and SLS adders are shown in FIG. . The delay and power characteristics of a no-sleep dual-Vadder are similar to SLS. The proposed circuit technique enhances the circuit speed by 32% and 4%, for Vand V, respectively, as compared to a low-Vadder. The enhancement in speed with the proposed circuit technique is primarily due to the reduced contention current of a high-Vkeeper.","The proposed sleep switch dual-Vcircuit technique also significantly reduces the active mode power consumption as compared to a low-Vcircuit. The power dissipation is reduced by 14% and 13% for the input vectors Vand V, respectively, as compared to a low-Vadder. A portion of the active mode power savings is due to the reduced contention current of the high-Vkeeper transistor in a dual-Vcircuit (see , A and B). Another important factor that reduces the power consumption of a dual-Vcircuit is the lower power consumed in the delay elements. As shown in , several delay elements (the inverters) are inserted along specific signal paths to delay the transfer of the clock, propagate, and carry signals among the circuit blocks. The delay elements in a dual-Vdomino adder (see ) are implemented with high-Vtransistors, increasing the delay of a single inverter. The number of inverters required in a signal path to satisfy the delay requirements, therefore, decreases, thereby reducing the active power dissipated by the signal delay paths.","In a standard domino logic gate, a feedback keeper is employed to maintain the state of the dynamic node against coupling noise, charge sharing, and subthreshold leakage current. In a dual-Vdomino logic circuit, the keeper transistor has a high-V(see , A and B). The current supplied by a high-Vkeeper to preserve the state of a dynamic node is reduced, thereby degrading the noise immunity as compared to a low-Vcircuit. The degradation of NML varies for different blocks within an adder. The average degradation in NML for the propagation (P), generation (G), carry (C), and sum (S) domino logic gates are listed in Table 2. The degradation in NML of SLS domino logic gates varies between 15.5% and 28.6% as compared to the low-Vcircuits.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"DEGRADATION IN NOISE MARGIN LOW (NML) OF SLS AS"},{"entry":"COMPARED TO LOW-V"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"P","G","C","S"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Average NML","15.5%","28.6%","18.7%","15.6%"]},{"entry":[{},"Reduction"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"When a domino logic circuit is idle, the clock is gated high and the sleep switches are activated to force all of the domino gates to evaluate. After the node voltages settle, all of the high-Vtransistors are strongly cut off, thereby minimizing the subthreshold leakage currents with the proposed SLS circuit technique. Depending upon the input vector, from 493 ps to 586 ps is required (after the clock is gated) for the adder circuit to be placed in a low leakage state. The clock is reactivated and all of the dynamic nodes are recharged to activate a sleeping domino circuit. The duration of reactivation is equal to the precharge time of a domino circuit. An adder circuit, therefore, is able to enter and leave the standby mode within a single clock cycle with the proposed circuit technique.","The energy overhead for entering and leaving the sleep mode with the proposed technique is also evaluated. Activating the sleep switches to place a dual-Vdomino logic circuit into standby mode requires a specific amount of energy. Additional energy is dissipated at the end of an idle period while precharging the dynamic nodes in order to reactivate a domino logic circuit. All of the dynamic nodes in a domino circuit are discharged during the sleep mode with the proposed circuit technique. The activation energy required by the proposed circuit technique is, therefore, typically higher than the low-Vand no-sleep dual-Vcircuit techniques. In order to justify the proposed sleep switch circuit technique to force a dual-Vcircuit into a low leakage state, the total energy consumed for entering and leaving the sleep mode must be less than the total savings in standby leakage energy.","The cumulative energy dissipated in the standby mode by the low-Vand SLS adders is shown in FIG. . It is assumed that the junction temperature does not significantly change for the duration of the standby mode. The leakage energy per cycle is assumed to be constant. The energy of a low-Vdomino circuit is only affected by the cumulative leakage current during the standby mode. Alternatively, both the cumulative leakage energy and the energy overhead of entering and leaving the sleep mode are included in the energy characteristics of SLS. The total energy overhead of the proposed sleep switch circuit technique is independent of the duration of the idle mode. The total energy overhead for employing the proposed circuit technique is dissipated even if a domino circuit stays in the standby mode for only a single clock cycle. The total energy overhead of the proposed technique (composed of the energy dissipated in order to activate the sleep transistors and reactivate of the domino gates after the standby mode is over) is included as an energy step in the first cycle of the standby mode (see FIGS.  and ). Similar to the low-Vand no-sleep dual-Venergy characteristics, after the first clock cycle, the SLS energy is also only due to the subthreshold leakage current. Since the standby leakage energy of the proposed SLS circuit is significantly lower (up to 207\u00d7) than a low-Vcircuit, the SLS energy characteristics are relatively flat as compared to the energy characteristics of the low-Vadder (see FIG. ). A specific amount of time in the idle mode, also dependent upon the input vectors, is necessary for the cumulative leakage energy of a low-Vcircuit to exceed the cumulative energy of an SLS circuit.","The intersection of the SLS and low-Vcumulative energy characteristics can be used to determine the necessary minimum duration of the sleep mode of operation such that the SLS circuit technique offers a net savings in energy as compared to a low-Vcircuit. As shown in , the cumulative subthreshold leakage of the low-Vand SLS circuits exhibit different behavior depending upon the input vectors. The leakage of a low-Vadder is smallest for Vand highest for V. Alternatively, the leakage energy of an SLS adder is lowest for Vand largest for V. For V, all the dynamic nodes within a no-sleep dual-Vcircuit remain high after the clock is gated high. Vis, therefore, the input vector at which the leakage energy of a no-sleep dual-Vcircuit is highest. Depending upon the input vectors, the energy overhead of the proposed SLS scheme also changes. For V, none of the dynamic nodes of the low-Vand no-sleep dual-Vcircuits are discharged during the standby mode. Alternatively, all of the dynamic nodes are discharged in an SLS circuit. The energy overhead of the SLS circuit technique required to recharge the dynamic nodes to reactivate the circuit (after the standby mode) is, therefore, highest for V. As shown in , a minimum of 59 clock cycles is required for the proposed SLS circuit technique to provide a net savings in energy as compared to a low-Vcircuit during the standby mode.","As discussed previously, a no-sleep dual-Vcircuit offers 3.6\u00d7 to 8.1\u00d7 leakage savings as compared to a low-Vcircuit. The energy savings of a no-sleep dual-Vdomino circuit originates from the selective replacement of a group of high leakage low-Vtransistors with a group of low leakage high-Vtransistors. Unlike the proposed SLS circuit technique, a standard no-sleep dual-Vcircuit does not introduce any energy overhead in order to reduce the standby leakage current. Although the leakage energy of an SLS circuit is shown to be significantly reduced as compared to a no-sleep dual-Vcircuit, the non-negligible energy overhead of the proposed circuit technique must also be assessed to accurately compare the energy characteristics of the two circuit techniques. The cumulative energy dissipated during standby mode by the SLS and no-sleep dual-Vadders is shown in FIG. .","The energy step of the SLS characteristics during the first cycle represents the energy overhead for activating the sleep switches (to enter the sleep mode) and for recharging the domino gates (to exit the sleep mode). Since the proposed SLS circuit technique reduces the standby leakage energy by 12\u00d7 to 58\u00d7 as compared to a no-sleep dual-Vcircuit, the SLS characteristics are relatively flat, after the first cycle, as compared to the energy characteristics of a no-sleep dual-Vadder. As discussed previously, Vproduces the highest leakage state in a no-sleep dual-Vcircuit. The lowest savings in leakage energy by a dual-Vcircuit is, therefore, observed at V. Alternatively, the leakage energy of a no-sleep dual-Vadder is lowest for V. No input combination exists that can place a no-sleep dual-Vadder into a lower leakage state as compared to an SLS adder. The technique proposed by Kao is, therefore, ineffective for minimizing the leakage of a domino logic circuit such as the domino adder discussed.","As shown in , a minimum of 381 clock cycles is required for the proposed SLS circuit technique to provide a net savings in energy as compared to a no-sleep dual-Vcircuit during the standby mode. Although the leakage energy of a no-sleep dual-Vdomino circuit is 12\u00d7 to 58\u00d7 higher as compared to SLS, a no-sleep dual-Vcircuit technique is preferable in those applications with short idle periods (less than 381 clock cycles).","The relative energy overhead of the proposed sleep switch circuit technique will be reduced since the subthreshold leakage is expected to increase with technology scaling. Significant savings in energy will be possible for even shorter idle periods with the proposed sleep switch dual-Vcircuit technique. Time-wise finer grain leakage reduction will, therefore, be feasible, permitting the utilization of the proposed scheme to implement a system level aggressive leakage reduction policy in the future.","A second preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be presented. The low swing circuit technique has become an attractive method to reduce power in high performance integrated circuits. This technique has primarily been applied to I\/O drivers and long interconnects. Static CMOS circuits driven by low swing input signals dissipate excessive static power while displaying poor delay characteristics. Specialized voltage interface circuits are therefore required to transfer signals between static CMOS circuits operating at different voltage levels. The circuit delay and complexity of low swing static CMOS circuits increase while the power reduction attained by lowering the node voltages diminish due to these additional voltage interface circuits. Therefore, low swing circuit techniques have not been applied to modify the voltage swing of signals driving CMOS static gates. Low swing circuit techniques, as proposed in this patent, can be effective in domino logic circuits. In a domino gate, the input signals are applied only to the NMOS transistors in the pull-down path, while a single pull-up PMOS transistor is driven by a separate clock signal. Therefore, a low swing signal that transitions between ground and a second sufficiently high voltage level to effectively turn on an NMOS transistor does not impose any functional or static power consumption problems in domino logic circuits.","Low swing circuit techniques are applied to domino logic circuits in order to reduce the dynamic power. The voltage swings at the internal nodes of domino logic circuits are modified. Two low swing domino logic circuit techniques are proposed as part of the second preferred embodiment. The first proposed low swing domino circuit uses a fully driven keeper. A second proposed domino circuit reduces both the voltage swing at the output node and at the gate of the keeper with a weak keeper.","A low swing domino logic with a fully driven keeper (LSDFDK) is proposed in this patent. A generic domino logic gate based on the proposed LSDFDK circuit technique is shown in FIG. . In the logic gate , an output circuit  includes two transistors ,  in parallel and also includes a feedback to the keeper P through an NMOS transistor N and a direct path . Also, the output is selectively grounded through a switch N receiving a control signal from the dynamic node .","The proposed circuit technique reduces the voltage swing at the output node using the NMOS transistor (N) as a pull-up. The output voltage swings between ground and V-V. The voltage swing at the output node is reduced, thereby reducing the dynamic switching power consumed to drive the parasitic impedances of the transistors and the interconnect connected to the output node. The keeper (P) is driven with a full swing signal for improved noise immunity. In , the source of the transistor N is connected to node . Alternatively, the source of N can be connected to Vas shown in  in the output circuit  of the circuit . This configuration improves the delay since the capacitive load at node  is reduced. A four input AND gate implemented using the proposed low swing domino logic circuit technique, LSDFDK, is shown in  as , using four-bit pulldown (AND) logic .","In a modification of the second preferred embodiment, a reduced keeper gate drive technique is proposed to improve the delay and power characteristics of domino circuits while maintaining robustness against noise. This technique reduces the contention current by lowering the gate voltage swing of a keeper transistor.","A generic domino logic gate based on the proposed low swing domino logic with a weakly driven keeper circuit technique (LSDWDK) is shown in  as . The output circuit  includes transistors P and N in parallel. The keeper P is driven by both a transistor N and a direct connection  through node . The output is also selectively grounded through a transistor N, which receives a control signal from the dynamic node . The transistor N is selectively grounded through a transistor P.","The weak keeper is critical in low swing circuits since the effects of the contention current on the evaluation delay is worse due to the reduced gate drive of the pull-down network transistors. LSDWDK produces two different voltage swings. The output voltage swing is between ground and V-V. The gate voltage swing of the keeper (P) is also modified using the PMOS transistor, P. The gate voltage of the keeper P swings between |V| and V(assuming |V|\u2266V). This voltage swing reduces the contention current as compared to LSDFDK, thereby, lowering the evaluation delay and the dynamic power. The tradeoff is a reduced noise margin due to the weaker keeper transistor. In , the source of the transistor N is connected to node . Alternatively, the source of N can be connected to Vas shown in the output circuit  of the circuit  of FIG. . This configuration improves the delay since the capacitive load at node  is reduced. A four input domino AND gate based on the proposed low swing domino logic circuit technique, LSDWDK, is shown in  as .","The standard domino (SDK), LSDFDK, and LSDWDK circuit techniques are evaluated for a three stage pipeline  (see ) having a pipeline input  and a pipeline output . Each of the three stages , ,  includes a four input AND gate assuming a 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS technology. Vand |V| are assumed to be 200 mV. Each AND gate drives the four inputs of the following stage AND gate (the inputs of each AND gate are tied together and driven by the same signal). The third stage  of the LSDFDK and LSDWDK pipelines is assumed to be a four input SDK AND gate to recover the full swing signal at the output of the pipeline. A 1 GHz clock signal with a 50% duty cycle is applied to each pipeline.","The size of the transistors in the pull-down network is critical for improving the evaluation delay of the domino logic circuits. The width of the keeper is minimum (W) for each circuit. The equivalent width of the pull-down network (PNEW) is a multiple of the keeper width and is varied to evaluate the delay, power, and noise immunity tradeoffs. The evaluation delay is calculated from 50% of the signal swing applied at the input of the first stage AND gate to 50% of the signal swing observed at the output of the third stage AND gate within each pipeline. To evaluate the noise immunity, the noise signal is assumed to be a square wave with a 450 ps duration. The maximum tolerable noise amplitude (MTNA) is defined as the signal amplitude at the input of the first stage AND gate that induces a 10% drop in the voltage at the dynamic node of the second stage AND gate. The pull-down and the foot transistors are the same size. The active power, evaluation delay, and MTNA for each of these three domino circuits are shown in .

As shown in , LSDFDK reduces the power consumption by up to 9.4% as compared to SDK with increasing PNEW. LSDWDK offers an additional power savings since the contention current is decreased by weakening the keeper (reduced current drive for the same size keeper as compared to both LSDFDK and SDK). LSDWDK reduces the power consumption by up to 12.4% as compared to SDK. The power savings of both LSDWDK and LSDFDK increase as compared to SDK with increasing PNEW. For all three circuits, the active power consumption increases as the size of the pull-down network increases.","Increased PNEW reduces the evaluation delay due to the increased current drive of the pull-down network. However, as shown in , both LSDWDK and LSDFDK sacrifice some speed for reduced power. As listed in Table 3, the evaluation delay is 46% higher for LSDFDK and 38% higher for LSDWDK as compared to SDK (for PNEW=3). LSDWDK offers enhanced delay characteristics as compared to LSDFDK due to the reduced contention current. As shown in , the LSDWDK evaluation delay is up to 8.6% lower than the LSDFDK evaluation delay.","Another tradeoff for increased performance of each circuit with increasing PNEW is reduced noise immunity. As shown in , the maximum tolerable noise amplitude decreases with increasing PNEW. LSDFDK not only lowers the power consumption but also displays higher noise immunity characteristics as compared to SDK. This behavior is due to the noise suppressing effect of the NMOS transistor providing the pull-up at the output (N in  to ) as the noise signal is transferred to the following gates. The MTNA of LSDFDK is up to 2.6% higher than the MTNA of SDK, and up to 10.9% higher than the MTNA of LSDWDK. Since the keeper of LSDWDK is weak, the MTNA of LSDWDK is 8.7% less than the MTNA of SDK for PNEW=1.2. With increasing PNEW, the relative effect of the keeper on the noise immunity of the domino circuits is reduced. The difference between the MTNA of LSDWDK and SDK therefore is reduced to 2.1% from 8.7% as the PNEW increases from 1.2 to 3. Similarly, the MTNA advantages of LSDFDK as compared to SDK increases from 1.3% to 2.6% as the PNEW increases from 1.2 to 3. As shown in , with increasing PNEW, the power advantages of both LSDWDK and LSDFDK increase as compared to SDK while the evaluation times of all three circuits become more similar. Therefore, low swing domino logic circuits are expected to become more attractive as the pull-down network is scaled for higher performance.","A third preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be presented. The third preferred embodiment combines concepts from the first and second preferred embodiments.","The proposed low swing domino circuits are effective in reducing the power consumed during the active mode of operation. The standby mode power characteristics of the proposed circuits, however, are comparable to standard domino (SDK).

Similarly, SLS LSDFDK consumes 235 times less leakage power as compared to low-VLSDFDK operating in the standby mode.
