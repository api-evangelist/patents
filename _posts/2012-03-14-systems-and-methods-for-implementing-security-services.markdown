{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/073,882, filed on Mar. 28, 2011, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","1. Field of the Disclosure","The present disclosure relates generally to authentication.","2. Description of the Related Art","It is often desirable to make computing resources available to only authorized users, for instance to protect against malicious users and programs and to prevent overutilization of the resources. However, the computing resources should be available to authorized users and programs, and different computing resources may need different levels of security. Making the resources available to different users and programs is made more complicated because the resources may need to be accessed across multiple security domains, different security services may be used to secure the resources, and different software platforms may be used to interface with the security services.","Computing environments provide some standardized tools to help solve these issues. In a Java\u00ae environment, the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) provides a security framework that enables developers to authenticate users and enforce access controls upon users. JAAS also standardizes interfaces and abstracts underlying authentication and authorization mechanisms. JAAS login modules do the actual authentication and authorization. However, login modules need to be determined before or at the time the virtual machine is started because login modules cannot be added or removed dynamically while the virtual machine is running. For example, OSGi platforms require the login modules provided by JAAS to be in the classpath of JAAS. In the Java Virtual Machine, the classpath includes directories or JAR files where the java compiler\/runtime will look for .class files. For example, \u201cexample.class\u201d will not be found by the Java Virtual Machine unless the classpath includes the directory or JAR file that includes \u201cexample.class\u201d. Thus, the login modules must be added to the classpath before the Java Virtual Machine is started, which in turn prevents the dynamic addition and removal of login modules.","In one embodiment, a method for providing a login context comprises starting a virtual machine, wherein the virtual machine includes an open services platform and an authentication service, wherein the authentication service includes a classloader, and an initial classloader is designated as the classloader of the authentication service, registering a login module, receiving an authentication request from a first application, and responsive to receiving the authentication request designating a classloader associated with the login module as the classloader of the authentication service, generating a login context of the login module, and providing the login context of the login module to the first application, whereby the first application uses the login context to perform an authentication.","In one embodiment, a computing device for creating a login context comprises a computer-readable storage device, and one or more processors configured to cause the computing device to perform operations including operating a virtual machine that includes a security platform, registering a first login module while the virtual machine is operating, assigning a first classloader associated with the first login module as a classloader of the security platform, generating a login context of the first login module, and providing the login context of the first login module to a first client application.","In one embodiment, one or more computer-readable media store instructions that, when executed by one or more computing devices, cause the one or more computing devices to perform operations comprising registering a security service while operating a virtual machine, the virtual machine including a security platform, designating a classloader associated with the security service as a classloader of the security platform, generating a context of the security service responsive to receiving a request for a context of the security service from a first application, wherein generating the context of the security service includes invoking the designated security platform classloader, and providing the context of the security service to the first application.","Though the following description includes certain explanatory embodiments, the scope of the claims is not limited to the explanatory embodiments. Additionally, the explanatory embodiments may include several novel features, and a particular feature may not be essential to practice the systems and methods described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","140","130","135","120","110","100","170","1","150","1","150","140","130","135","135"]},"The OSGi platform  provides a module system and service platform for JAVA and an execution environment that can install, start, stop, update, and uninstall applications and components (also collectively referred to herein as \u201cbundles\u201d) without requiring a reboot of the JVM . Bundles can make services available to other bundles. A bundle's services are added to a services registry so that other bundles can detect and use them, and the removal of a service from the registry can be used to detect the removal of the service.","The system  also includes security providers that make security services available to other applications, modules, bundles, components, etc.  illustrates security providers -N (-, - . . . -N, also referred to herein as \u201csecurity providers \u201d) where N represents any positive integer such that the system is capable of operating with the total number of security providers. The security providers  (also illustrated in ) may be implemented in bundles and make their services available as OSGi services (including adding the services to the OSGi services registry). The security providers  may include login modules and\/or provide services that include JAAS authentication and authorization services. The client application  may also be a bundle, and the client application  may request one or more services (e.g., authentication, authorization) from the security providers .","The system  also includes a context factory  in the OSGi platform . The context factory  facilitates the access of the security services by the client application . When a security provider  is loaded onto the OSGi platform and started, the security provider  registers itself (e.g., with the context factory , with the custom configuration unit  (shown in FIG. )), including registering any service(s) provided by the security provider  and registering a classloader for the service provider and\/or service(s). A classloader loads classes (e.g., Java Classes) into a virtual machine (e.g., the JVM). The class loader locates libraries, reads the contents of the libraries, and loads the classes contained within the libraries. The loading may be done \u201con demand,\u201d (i.e., dynamically), and thus the loading may not be performed until the class is actually used by the JVM.","The context factory  receives requests for the security service(s) from the client application  and returns an interface (e.g., a login context) of the security services to the client application . A login context is an object that provides an interface to a security service, stores post-authentication user credential information, and\/or lists privileges and permissions. A login context includes a \u201clogin\u201d method that invokes a method from a security provider (e.g., from a login module). Also, a login context may be instantiated by JAAS and may comply with the JAAS API. By using the interface (e.g., login context, for example a LoginContext), the client application  may then interact with the security service(s) and the security provider  without the involvement of the context factory  (e.g., without the context factory  acting as a proxy). Thus, the client application  can use the normal API of JAAS  to communicate with the security service(s), which simplifies the design of the client application and\/or the use of the security service(s).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","240","230","235","220","270","250","210","215","215","250","215","217","250","250","217","210","210","215","215","220","200","210","215"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","1","380","2","390","370","370","300","1","380"]},"The security device  includes one or more processors  (also referred to herein as \u201cCPU \u201d), which may be a conventional or customized microprocessor(s). The CPU  is configured to read and execute computer readable instructions, and the CPU  may command\/and or control other components of the security device . The security device  also includes I\/O interfaces , which provide communication interfaces to other devices, including a keyboard, a display device, a mouse, a printing device, a touch screen, a light pen, an optical storage device, a scanner, a microphone, a camera, etc. The security device  also includes a memory , which may be volatile or non-volatile, such as ROM, RAM, and flash memory. The security device  further includes a network interface  that allows the security device  to communicate with the network . The storage device  stores data or modules and may include, for example, a hard drive, an optical storage device, a diskette, and\/or a solid state drive. The components of the security device  are connected via a bus. The security device  includes an operating system, which manages the hardware, the processes, the interrupts, the memory, and\/or the file system of the security device .","The security device  also includes a context factory , a custom configuration unit , and a security provider . The context factory , the custom configuration unit , and the security provider  may be implemented in computer-executable instructions. Computer-executable instructions may be executed by the security device  to cause the security device  to perform certain operations, including the methods described herein, though for purposes of description a member of the security device  may be described as performing the operations. Computer-executable instructions may include logic and may be implemented in software, firmware, and\/or hardware. In other embodiments, the context factory  and the custom configuration unit  may be combined into a single member or further divided into more members. The security device  may control access to computing resource   and computing resource  , and may require client applications to perform authentication and\/or authorization operations with the security provider  before accessing computing resource   and computing resource  .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-3","FIG. 4"],"b":["110","215"]},"Beginning in block , a virtual machine is started, such as a JAVA virtual machine. Next, in block , a classloader for a security module is obtained. For example, a security module that includes an associated classloader may be installed as part of a bundle on a virtual machine that includes an OSGi platform, and the security module may provide the classloader (as well as login module name(s), class path, etc.) to a custom configuration unit as a parameter passed in a method call. Moving to block , a configuration entry is generated for the security module. The configuration entry indicates the classloader and associates the classloader with the security module. Finally, in block , the configuration entry is stored, for example in a configuration table in memory.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","510","520","530","540"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["680","651","615","651","615","682","615"]},"Next, in stage , a client application  requests a login context from the context factory . In stage , the context factory  retrieves the classloader for the requested login context from the custom configuration unit . Proceeding to stage , the context factory  performs a thread switch and changes the JAAS default classloader to the classloader for the requested login context. A thread is a unit of processing that can be scheduled by an operating system. Next, in stage  the context factory  requests the login context from JAAS . In stage , JAAS generates the login context using the classloader (and, in some embodiments, the class name (e.g., a login module's fully qualified class name), for example \u201ccom.canon.jaas.LoginModuleA\u201d) associated with the login module . During the thread switch, the context factory  and\/or JAAS  are blocked from attempting to generate additional login contexts (e.g., a blocking call). Moving to stage , the thread is restored, which permits the context factory  and\/or JAAS  to generate additional login contexts, the JAAS classloader may be changed back to the JAAS default classloader, and the generated login context is returned to the client application . Finally, in stage  the client application  requests a login from the login module  using the returned login context. Using the returned login context, the client application  can communicate with the login module and\/or JAAS without the use of a proxy. Thus, the client application  may use standard JAAS interfaces to perform JAAS authentication.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["770","735","710","715","751","1","751","715","751","751","715","705","715","717","715","705","751"]},"In stage , the client  sends a request for a login context  to the context factory . The request for a login context  identifies one or more requested login modules for which a login context is sought (e.g., the login module(s) ). Next, in stage , the context factory  sends a request for a classloader  for the requested login module(s) (in this example, the login module(s) ). In response to receiving the request for a classloader , the custom configuration unit  identifies the classloader associated with the requested login module(s) by referring to the configuration table  (e.g., maps the requested login module to the associated classloader). The custom configuration unit  then sends a reference to the login module classloader  to the context factory  in stage .","In stage , the context factory  modifies the reference to the login module classloader in JAAS . Initially, the login module classloader reference refers to the JAAS default classloader , which is determined at runtime of the JVM. Since JAAS  will automatically refer to the login module classloader reference to find a classloader to instantiate a login context, and since JAAS  is not capable of changing the login module classloader reference while the JVM is running, the context factory  changes the login module classloader reference to refer to the login module classloader  instead of the default classloader . The context factory  may also start a blocking thread in stage  to block the generation of other login contexts. The blocking may be important because JAAS  will use the classloader referred to by the login module classloader reference to generate a login context. Thus, if not blocked, JAAS  will use the login module classloader  to instantiate other requested login contexts while the login module classloader reference refers to the login module classloader . However, the other requested login contexts may be requests for login contexts associated with the default classloader . Therefore, it may be desirable to block the generation of other login contexts while the login module classloader reference refers to the login module classloader .","Once the login module classloader reference refers to the login module classloader , in stage  the context factory  sends a request for a login context  to JAAS . In stage , JAAS  gets the classloader  (now the login module classloader ) referred to by the login module classloader reference. In stage , JAAS  receives a classloader reference  (which refers to the login module classloader ). Next, in stage , JAAS  instantiates a login context  using the login module classloader .","Proceeding to stage , a reference to the login context  is returned to the context factory  by JAAS . The context factory  may then change the login module classloader reference to refer to the default classloader  and end the blocking thread. Next, in stage , the reference to the login context  is returned to the client . Finally, in stage , the client  uses the login context  to communicate with the login module(s) . Thus, the client  communicates with the login module(s)  via the login context  in JAAS  without a proxy, and the client  can use the standard JAAS API to communicate with the login module .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["850","1","850","2","850","3","1"]},"Additionally, a classloader may be able to generate a login context that allows communication with only the login modules of the associated OSGi bundle. For example, classloader A may be used to generate a login context that allows a client application to communicate with login module A, but cannot generate a login context that allows a client application to communicate with login modules from other security providers (e.g., login module B, login module ). Also, classloader C may be used to generate a login context that allows a client application to communicate with the login modules of security provider C (login module , login module  . . . login module N), but cannot be used to generate a login context that allows a client application to communicate with the login modules of other security providers (e.g., login module A, login module B).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["917","918","917"]},"The above described devices, systems, and methods can be achieved by supplying one or more storage media that store thereon computer-executable instructions for realizing the above described operations to one or more devices that are configured to read the computer-executable instructions stored in the one or more storage media and execute them.
