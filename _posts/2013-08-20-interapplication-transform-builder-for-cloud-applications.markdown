title: Inter-application transform builder for cloud applications
abstract: A method, system, and computer program product for customization of flows between software applications. A system implementation commences by associating a first application with a first graphical object descriptor, and by associating a second application with a second graphical object descriptor. A graphical user interface such as an integrated development environment is used to drag/drop the graphical object descriptors and other graphical objects to form logical connections between the first graphical object descriptor and the second graphical object descriptor. The installation of an application is modified (e.g., using a patch), which modification is performed based at least in part on the logical connections. The logical connections between the applications handles inter-application communication such that upon executing the modified first application at least some outputs from the modified first application are processed using the logical connection to produce modified first application results which are in turn received by the second application.

Software application offerings by vendors (including cloud vendors) span a wide spectrum of disciplines and uses. A single cloud deployment might host many diverse applications such as business applications, consumer applications, data mining applications, etc., and cloud vendors are often customer-driven to support customization of such applications. In some cases a software application provider may offer rudimentary integration between one of their application titles and another one of their application titles. For example, a \u201cdata mining tool\u201d might write the results of a data mining operation to a database or file, and a \u201clist maker tool\u201d might read data from that database or file. In some cases providers pre-specify permitted (e.g., pre-tested) inter-application I\/O parameters.","Many customers\/users of the many diverse applications need to customize the application and\/or provide add-on \u201ccustomerization\u201d of the vended applications. However, adding an add-on or other type of \u201ccustomerization\u201d to the vended applications often defeats the aforementioned offered rudimentary integration. This situation introduces several problems such as: (1) if the practices suggested by the software vendors are followed, the customers\/users cannot seize full benefit of the software titles in combination; (2) even if a customer\/user can seize benefit from the aforementioned offered rudimentary integration, the customers\/users are at the mercy of the software vendor's release schedule; and (3) customer\/users cannot easily seize benefit from integration between software titles provided by different vendors.","One legacy approach has been to employ consultants who write custom code to implement customer-specified integration between such applications. However, this approach has many drawbacks including (1) even if a customer\/user can seize benefit from the custom code, the customers\/users are at the mercy of changes rolled-out by the software vendors; and (2) the rate at which software vendors release code updates has increased dramatically, thus commensurately exploding the costs incurred to employ consultants to maintain custom code.","What's needed are techniques to facilitate high-function inter-application integration without requiring consultants to develop custom code and without requiring revisions to customerized (e.g., consultant-developed) code at each release of the constituent applications.","The present disclosure provides an improved method, system, and computer program product suited to address the aforementioned issues with legacy approaches. More specifically, the present disclosure provides a detailed description of techniques used in methods, systems, and computer program products for an inter-application transform builder for cloud applications.","A system implementation commences by associating a first application with a first graphical object descriptor, and by associating a second application with a second graphical object descriptor. A graphical user interface such as an integrated development environment is used to drag-and-drop the graphical object descriptors and other graphical objects to form logical connections between the first graphical object descriptor and the second graphical object descriptor. The installation of an application is modified (e.g., using a patch or update), which modification is performed based at least in part on the logical connections. The logical connections between the applications handles inter-application communication such that upon executing the modified first application at least some outputs from the modified first application are processed using the logical connection to produce modified first application results which are in turn received by the second application.","Further details of aspects, objectives, and advantages of the disclosure are described below and in the detailed description, drawings, and claims. Both the foregoing general description of the background and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory, and are not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the claims.","Some embodiments of the present disclosure address the problem of building and maintaining inter-application transforms and some embodiments are directed to an improved approach for implementing inter-application transform builders for cloud applications. More particularly, disclosed herein and in the accompanying figures are exemplary environments, methods, and systems for implementing an inter-application transform builder for cloud applications.","Overview","Cloud-based software application offerings by vendors (including cloud vendors) span a wide spectrum of disciplines and uses. A single cloud deployment might host many diverse applications such as business applications, consumer applications, data mining applications, etc., and cloud vendors are often customer-driven to support customization of such applications. In some cases a software application provider may offer rudimentary integration between one of their application titles and another one of their application titles. For example, a \u201cdata mining tool\u201d might write the results of a data mining operation to a database or file, and a \u201clist maker tool\u201d might read data from that database or file. In some cases providers pre-specify permitted (e.g., pre-tested) inter-application I\/O parameters.","Many challenges are presented to users of cloud services:\n\n","In some of the herein-disclosed embodiments, acts constituent to building custom applications are made available to the customer as drag-and-drop controls to the developer's integrated design environment (IDE). For example, consider a customer who has purchased a \u201chuman resources management\u201d application (App1) and two software applications (e.g., App2 and App3) from second and third independent vendors. Strictly as an example and illustration, consider that the first application (App2) is a \u201ctalent scout\u201d application that looks for potential candidates to match a job specification, and the second application (App3) is a general purpose scheduling application that could be used to schedule and conduct interviews.","As can be appreciated, App1 could interface with App2, and App1 could interface with App3, and App2 could interface with App3. Yet, since each of the software titles are sourced from different vendors, this scenario presents a need for multiple inter-application communication paths and related components. Even modest integration efforts might need to draw in consultants from the outset of any integration effort. Cloud vendors and customers alike are in need of techniques to facilitate high-function inter-application integration without requiring consultants to develop and maintain so many components.","Some of the terms used in this description are defined below for easy reference. The presented terms and their respective definitions are not rigidly restricted to these definitions\u2014a term may be further defined by the term's use within this disclosure.\n\n","Reference is now made in detail to certain embodiments. The disclosed embodiments are not intended to be limiting of the claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100"]},"As shown, cloud infrastructure  comprises a plurality of computing machines (e.g., host H, host H, host H, etc.) configured for communication over a communication path  to a database engine  and a cloud server . The cloud infrastructure can be configured by an administrator and\/or by a user . Further, a user can access and configure the cloud server  via a graphical user interface and\/or an integrated development environment (e.g., IDE ). Such a user or an administrator might also configure (e.g., initially configure and\/or maintain) storage , which contains an executable instance E. Such an executable instance comprises an instance image copy of any number of applications (e.g., App1 , App2 , etc.) and an executable instance image copy of any number of transforms , which transforms serve to provide custom functions between applications. Storage  might also contain an initial copy of site information data.","Any host (e.g., host H, host H, host H, etc.) can host software applications, application transforms, and can execute any sorts of software processes. Any host can communicate with any other host, can communicate with the database engine, and can communicate with cloud server . The processes can be run on \u201cbare metal\u201d, or can be run under an operating system or hypervisor. In exemplary embodiments, any transform (e.g., a running instance of transforms ) that runs on a host can communicate with the cloud server . Various particular functions of the transforms running on each host are discussed below, in , and elsewhere in this disclosure.","The database engine  serves as a repository for data, which data can be stored (e.g., using storage device ) and be accessed as a relational database relation, or as a file (e.g., in a file system ), or as a memory-resident data structure. As shown, database engine  comprises tenant application inventory list  and occurrences of application interfacing data (e.g., application interfacing details , application interfacing details , application interfacing details , etc.).","In the particular embodiment of , any occurrences of transforms  can access the cloud infrastructure via communication path  and\/or can access more distal points (e.g., over a WAN). Exemplary communication facilities serve to provide input to, and receive outputs from transforms. Such communication facilities (see conduit as introduced in ) can perform at least the following functions:\n\n","As shown, an integration builder tool  serves to form an integrated development environment (e.g., IDE ), comprising a GUI , a text interface , and any number of instances of a plug-in . The integration builder tool  further cooperates with a dependency manager tool  and an integration deployer tool . The aforementioned suite of tools can be combined to implement various portions of an inter-application transform builder for cloud applications.","The communication facilities provide intra-host communication and inter-host communication by and between any host within a cloud server  using any protocol (e.g., HTTP, SOAP web services, REST, socket interactions, etc.). In exemplary deployments, such protocols are supported by the cloud vendor; however, it is possible that certain communications between the cloud server  and agents can be performed using custom protocols. In some situations, the communication facilities provide communication to\/from any destination beyond the periphery of the cloud server  using any protocol (e.g., TCP\/IP, UDP, HTTP, ATM, etc.).","The heretofore-described communication facilities provide a conduit for communication between applications. In some cases, a communication conduit is provided by a software vendor in the form of an application programming interface (API) that serves to move data in and out of a supported application. Some vendors may provide multiple applications, and may provide compatibility between such applications via an API input interface that is compatible with another application's API output interface. Using such compatible API interfaces, multiple applications can be integrated to the extent provided by the APIs. Such compatible API interfaces support a conduit-based integration flow, which is now briefly reviewed (see , below) as a foundation from which to advance the discussion of the herein-disclosed transform-based integration flows.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},"As shown, App1  communicates with App2  over a software-implemented path (e.g., conduit A1A2). And, App2  communicates with App1  over a software-implemented path (e.g., conduit A2A1). The software-implemented paths can be implemented in code, and might be stored in a file system or other storage facility (e.g., storage ). Such code might be embodied as a routine or a class or a method, etc. and can be stored in a format accessible by an IDE. As shown, the code is stored as conduit A1A2 code , and as conduit A2A1 code .","Embodiments that follow the conduit-based integration flow of  can be used to integrate applications using only their input\/output configurations (e.g., as provided in an API). In some cases, data output from one application might need to be manipulated before providing the manipulated data as input to a second application. In such cases a transform-based integration flow can be employed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},"As shown, data from App1 \u201ctalent scout\u201d is received by one of the transforms  before being sent to App2 \u201cscheduler\u201d.

A request of a widget and a response of a widget are deemed to be structurally similar if they contain the same data structures or data types (though the names can be different).","Table 4 give an example of a control widget for \u201cSCH\u201d as codified in XML.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0077"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 4"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Sample control widget XML for \u201cSCH\u201d"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Line",{}]},{"entry":["No.","Sample Code"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","<CustomApp>"]},{"entry":["2","\u2003<Name>Scheduler<\/Name>"]},{"entry":["3","\u2003<Vendor> Abcd.com <\/Vendor>"]},{"entry":["4","\u2003<Version> 10.2 <\/Version>"]},{"entry":["5","<Protocols>"]},{"entry":["6","\u2003<Protocol> REST <\/Protocol>"]},{"entry":["7","<Protocol> UNIX-SCRIPT-CMDLINE <\/Protocol>"]},{"entry":["8","<\/Protocols>"]},{"entry":["9","<APIList>"]},{"entry":["10","\u2003<API>"]},{"entry":["11","\u2003<GetAvailableInterviewers>"]},{"entry":["12","\u2003<Request>"]},{"entry":["13","\u2003\u2003<StartTime type=\u201ddatetime\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":["14","\u2003\u2003<endtime type=\u201ddatetime\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":["15","\u2003\u2003\u2009<skills type=\u201dstring\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":["16","\u2003\u2003<group type=\u201dstring\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":["17","<\/Request>"]},{"entry":["18","<Response>"]},{"entry":["19","<Interviewers>"]},{"entry":["20","\u2003<Interviewer>"]},{"entry":["21","\u2003<lnterviewerld type=\u201dint\u201d>"]},{"entry":["22","\u2003<InterviewerName type=\u201dString\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":["23","\u2003<Skills type=\u201dString\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":["24","\u2003<Group type=\u201dString\/>"]},{"entry":["25","\u2003<\/ Interviewer>"]},{"entry":["26","<\/Interviewers>"]},{"entry":["27","<\/Response>"]},{"entry":["28","<\/ GetAvailablelnterviewers >"]},{"entry":["29","<\/API>"]},{"entry":["30","\u2003<API>"]},{"entry":["31","<CreateSchedule>"]},{"entry":["32","<Request>"]},{"entry":["33","\u2003<Party>"]},{"entry":["34","\u2003\u2003<PartyName type=\u201dString\u201d>"]},{"entry":["35","\u2003<Skills type=\u201dstring\u201d>"]},{"entry":["36","<\/Party>"]},{"entry":["37","\u2003<Interviewers>"]},{"entry":["38","\u2003<Interviewer>"]},{"entry":["39","\u2003<lnterviewerld type=\u201dint\u201d>"]},{"entry":["40","\u2003\u2003<\/Interviewer>"]},{"entry":["41","<\/Interviewers>"]},{"entry":["42","<\/Request>"]},{"entry":["43","<Response>"]},{"entry":["44","<Schedule>"]},{"entry":["45","\u2003<Slot>"]},{"entry":["46","\u2003\u2003<Party>"]},{"entry":["47","\u2003\u2003<Interviewer>"]},{"entry":["48","\u2003\u2002<Starttime>"]},{"entry":["49","\u2003<Endtime>"]},{"entry":["50","<\/Slot>"]},{"entry":["51","<\/Schedule>"]},{"entry":["52","<Response>"]},{"entry":["53","<\/ CreateSchedule >"]},{"entry":["54","<\/API>"]},{"entry":["55","<API>"]},{"entry":["56","\u2003<InviteUser> <!-XML Schema of the API --> <\/ InviteUser >"]},{"entry":["57","<\/API>"]},{"entry":["58","<\/APIList><\/CustomApp>"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The function to \u201cfind out available interviewers\u201d of the sample application (pertaining to step 3) is specified in the API calls given in line 10 through line 58 of Table 4.","The remaining steps of the sample application are implemented by repeating the drag-and-drop operations.

Such an update might not necessarily need to affect the sample application. As an example, suppose that some few weeks after the deployment of the sample application, the \u201cMail\u201d application is enhanced to begin using SSL for mail transport. In this case, the integrated application can be automatically redeployed by merely adding SSL credentials and details to the \u201cMail\u201d section of all referencing applications.","In exemplary embodiments, the determination of referencing applications can be performed by a dependency manager tool . Continuing with the example of adding SSL, all referencing applications can be updated by merely adding SSL credentials and details to the \u201cMail\u201d section of the \u201cMail\u201d control widget. Further, the dependency manager tool maintains inventory of applications that use a given a custom application. As depicted in  a dependency manager tool  runs on a cloud server. The dependency manager tool can be run as a background process that continuously monitors changes to the cloud infrastructure.","In a case such as earlier described, a base application (e.g., App1, App2) might be updated by the software vendor. Then, using the interconnection of a second application to the base application the dependency manager tool  fills in the runtime details of the application interconnections and interrelationships in order for it to successfully execute in the cloud. Strictly as an example, if the Mail application enforces SSL for mail transport, the application is automatically redeployed by the dependency manager by adding SSL credentials and details to the Mail section of all referencing applications.
