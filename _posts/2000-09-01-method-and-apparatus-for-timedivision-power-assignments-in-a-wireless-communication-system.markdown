title: Method and apparatus for time-division power assignments in a wireless communication system
abstract: In a CDMA data communication system capable of variable rate data transmission, a time-division power assignment cyclically reduces the carrier power level to at least one sector to reduce interference in neighboring sectors. The base station determines a time-division power assignment for each sector and generates signals according to the power assignment. The mobile unit generates filter coefficients corresponding to each power level. The mobile unit estimates Carrier Signal-to-Interference (C/I) to determine a data rate for each power level. Previous iterations of the equalizer are stored and used to refine future estimates.

No. 6,751,206, issued on Jun. 15, 2004, and assigned to the assignee hereof.","The current invention relates to wireless data communication. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel and improved method and apparatus time-division power assignments in a wireless communication system.","A modern day communication system is required to support a variety of applications. One such communication system is a code division multiple access (CDMA) system which conforms to the \u201cTIA\/EIA\/IS-95 Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d hereinafter referred to as the IS-95 standard. The CDMA system allows for voice and data communications between users over a terrestrial link. The use of CDMA techniques in a multiple access communication system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307, entitled \u201cSPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS\u201d, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,459, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM,\u201d both assigned to the assignee of the present invention and both expressly incorporated by reference herein.","In this specification, base station refers to the hardware with which the subscriber stations communicate. Cell refers to the hardware or the geographic coverage area, depending on the context in which the term is used. A sector is a partition of a cell. A sub-sector is a division of a sector. Because a sector and a sub-sector of a CDMA system have the attributes of a cell, the teachings described in terms of cells are readily extended to sectors and sub-sectors.","In a CDMA system, communications between users are conducted through one or more base stations. A first user on one subscriber station communicates to a second user on a second subscriber station by transmitting data on a reverse link to a base station. The base station receives the data and can route the data to another base station. The data is transmitted on the forward link of the same base station, or a second base station, to the second subscriber station. The forward link refers to transmission from the base station to a subscriber station and the reverse link refers to transmission from the subscriber station to a base station. In IS-95 systems, the forward link and the reverse link are allocated separate frequencies.","The subscriber station communicates with at least one base station during a communication. CDMA subscriber stations are capable of communicating with multiple base stations simultaneously during soft handoff. Soft handoff is the process of establishing a link with a new base station before breaking the link with the previous base station. Soft handoff minimizes the probability of dropped calls. A method and system for providing a communication with a subscriber station through more than one base station during the soft handoff process are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,267,261, entitled \u201cMOBILE ASSISTED SOFT HANDOFF IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM,\u201d assigned to the assignee of the present invention and expressly incorporated by reference herein. Softer handoff is the process whereby the communication occurs over multiple sectors which are serviced by the same base station. The process of softer handoff is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,876, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PERFORMING HANDOFF BETWEEN SECTORS OF A COMMON BASE STATION,\u201d assigned to the assignee of the present invention and expressly incorporated by reference herein.","Given the growing demand for wireless data applications, the need for very efficient wireless data communication systems has become increasingly significant. The IS-95 standard is capable of transmitting data traffic and voice traffic over the forward and reverse links. A method for transmitting data traffic in code channel frames of fixed size is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,773, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE FORMATTING OF DATA FOR TRANSMISSION,\u201d assigned to the assignee of the present invention and expressly incorporated by reference herein. In accordance with the IS-95 standard, the data traffic or voice traffic is partitioned into code channel frames which are 20 msec wide with data rates as high as 14.4 kbps.","Transmission of high-rate data traffic and voice traffic over the forward and reverse links is proposed in a high-data-rate standard. In accordance with the proposed high-data-rate standard, the data traffic or voice traffic is partitioned into time slots of variable duration. A code channel frame comprises one to sixteen time slots. Beamforming techniques for decreasing interference caused by transmissions of a base station to subscriber stations in neighboring cells are described in detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/388,267, filed Sep. 1, 1999, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR BEAMFORMING IN A WIRELESS SYSTEM,\u201d now U.S. Pat. No. 6,778,507, issued Aug. 17, 2004 to Jalali, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and expressly incorporated by reference herein.","A significant difference between voice services and data services is the fact that voice services impose stringent and fixed delay requirements. Typically, the overall one-way delay of speech frames must be less than 100 msec. In contrast, the data delay can become a variable parameter used to optimize the efficiency of the data communication system. Specifically, more efficient error correcting coding techniques which require significantly larger delays than those that can be tolerated by voice services can be utilized. An exemplary efficient coding scheme for data is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/743,688, entitled \u201cSOFT DECISION OUTPUT DECODER FOR DECODING CONVOLUTIONALLY ENCODED CODEWORDS,\u201d filed Nov. 6, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,933,462, issued Aug. 3, 1999 to Sindhushayana et al., assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and expressly incorporated by reference herein.","Another significant difference between voice services and data services is that voice services require a fixed and common grade of service (GOS) for all users. Typically, for digital systems providing voice services, this translates into a fixed and equal transmission rate for all users and a maximum tolerable value for the error rates of the speech frames. In contrast, for data services, the GOS can be different from user to user and can be a parameter optimized to increase the overall efficiency of the data communication system. The GOS of a data communication system is typically defined as the total delay incurred in the transfer of a predetermined amount of data, hereinafter referred to as a data packet.","Yet another significant difference between voice services and data services is that voice services require a reliable communication link which, in the exemplary CDMA communication system, is provided by soft handoff. Soft handoff results in redundant transmissions from two or more base stations to improve reliability. However, this additional reliability is not required for data transmission because the data packets received in error can be retransmitted. For data services, the transmit power used to support soft handoff can be more efficiently used for transmitting additional data.","The parameters that measure the quality and effectiveness of a data communication system are the transmission delay required to transfer a data packet and the average throughput rate of the system. Transmission delay does not have the same impact in data communication as it does for voice communication, but it is an important metric for measuring the quality of the data communication system. The average throughput rate is a measure of the efficiency of the data transmission capability of the communication system.","It is well known that in cellular systems the carrier-to-interference ratio C\/I of any given user is a function of the location of the user within the coverage area. In order to maintain a given level of service, TDMA and FDMA systems resort to frequency reuse techniques, i.e., not all frequency channels and\/or time slots are used in each base station. In a CDMA system, the same frequency allocation is reused in every cell of the system, thereby improving the overall efficiency. The C\/I that any given user's subscriber station achieves determines the information rate that can be supported for this particular link from the base station to the user's subscriber station. Given the specific modulation and error correction method used for the transmission, a given level of performance is achieved at a corresponding level of C\/I. For an idealized cellular system with hexagonal cell layouts and utilizing a common frequency in every cell, the distribution of C\/I achieved within the idealized cells can be calculated. An exemplary system for transmitting high-rate digital data in a wireless communication system is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/963,386, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HIGHER RATE PACKET DATA TRANSMISSION,\u201d (hereafter the '386 application), filed Nov. 3, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,574,211, issued Jun. 3, 2003 to Padovani et al., assigned to the assignee of the present application, and expressly incorporated by reference herein.","It is also well known that much of the signal interference in a loaded CDMA system is caused by transmitters belonging to the same CDMA system. In an effort to increase capacity and data rates by reducing interference, cells are often divided into sectors or smaller cells operating at lower power. However, conventional methods are costly and difficult to apply in areas having widely varying signal propagation properties. Conventional methods also typically have poor signal quality near sector boundaries. There is a need for a simplified way of decreasing the mutual interference between elements in the system, while increasing system capacity and data rates.","The disclosed embodiments provide a novel and improved method of increasing CDMA data communication system capacity and data rates by maximizing carrier-to-interference ratios (C\/I) measured at subscriber stations. Utilization of beam switching techniques decreases the interference caused by transmissions of a base station to subscriber stations within sectors of a cell, and its neighboring cells. Base stations utilize multiple transmit antennas, each transmitting signals at controlled amplitudes and phases, to form transmit signal beams corresponding to sector divisions, or sub-sectors. Data and reference signals are transmitted along sector division beams that alternate according to fixed time slots in order to focus energy at subscriber stations without interference from neighboring beams.","Accordingly, in one aspect of the invention, a method is provided for adjusting the signal power for transmitting data to each sector during a given time slot, where the power level for a given sector rotates through the available power levels with successive time slots.","According to one aspect of the present invention, a method for communication in a wireless communication system, having a first cell with multiple sectors, includes transmitting signals at a first power level to the first sector during a first time slot, and transmitting a signals at a second power level to the second sector during the first time slot.","According to another aspect of the present invention, a mobile unit includes an antenna, and an equalizer coupled to the antenna. The equalizer further includes a plurality of taps or amplifiers, a summing node and a memory storage unit. Each amplifier has first and second associated coefficients, the first associated coefficient corresponding to a first time slot, the second associated coefficient corresponding to a second time slot, the plurality of amplifiers being operative to scale a first set of input symbols during the first time slot by the first associated coefficients, the plurality of amplifiers being further operative to scale a second set of input symbols during the second time slot by the second associated coefficients, the plurality of amplifiers being further operative to generate amplifier outputs. The summing node is coupled to the plurality of amplifiers, the summing node being operative to sum the amplifier outputs. The memory storage unit is operative to store coefficient adjustment information, wherein the associated coefficients are adjusted according to the coefficient adjustment information.","According to yet another aspect of the present invention, an equalizer includes a plurality of amplifiers and a coefficient adjustment node. The amplifiers are operative to scale input symbols with a first set of associated coefficients during a first time slot and with a second set of associated coefficients during a second time slot. The coefficient adjustment node is coupled to the plurality of amplifiers, the coefficient adjustment node being operative to apply the first set of associated coefficients during the first time slot and to apply the second set of associated coefficients during the second time slot.","According to still another aspect of the present invention, a mobile unit includes an equalizer operative to calculate a first capacity estimate for a first transmitted signal power and a second capacity estimate for a second transmitted signal power, and a data rate decision node operative to receive capacity estimates from the equalizer and generate a first data rate decision for the first capacity estimate and a second data rate decision for the second capacity estimate.","In still a further aspect of the present invention, a mobile unit for high-speed data communication to at least one base station includes an encoder configured to receive data packets at a first signal power during a first time slot and to receive data packets at a second signal power during a second time slot, and a data rate control encoder configured to encode data rate control messages generated in response to channel condition information derived from the received data packets, for transmission during the first and second time slots.","The disclosed embodiments improve the efficiency of a CDMA system by providing a strong forward link signal to a destination subscriber station while causing minimal interference to other subscriber stations. The disclosed embodiments provide an approach to maximizing capacity in a high-data-rate wireless system by adapting fixed beam switching techniques for use in terrestrial wireless applications. In accordance with the disclosed embodiments, a cellular system with multiple transmit antennas at each base station is described. From each base station, the same signal, but each having different relative phase shifts and power levels, is transmitted from each antenna in order to focus energy in a sub-sector, the portion of a sector where a subscriber station is located. In order to maximize the carrier-to-interference ratio (C\/I) of the intended receiver of the signal (usually a single subscriber station) the amplitudes and phases of the signals being transmitted from each of the transmit antennas must be set appropriately.","Any signal quality metric that is based on the estimated C\/I may be used by the subscriber station as feedback to the base station. In the exemplary high-data-rate wireless communication system described in the '211 patent application, the subscriber station determines a data rate at which it can successfully receive packets based on its estimated C\/I. The data rate, instead of the C\/I measurement, is sent to the base station in the form of a Data Rate Control (DRC) signal. The DRC information is embedded in the reverse link signal sent by the subscriber station. The base station may also use the changes in the DRC signal to determine the time slot in which to transmit data to the subscriber station.","Conventionally, a single beam is transmitted in a sector which covers the entire sector regardless of the receiver's location within the sector. A single beam wastes energy where the subscriber station cannot receive it, and interferes with other users. The disclosed embodiments maximize the carrier-to-interference ratio (C\/I) at the subscriber station by dividing sectors into sub-sectors and transmitting fixed beams directly to each sub-sector where subscriber stations are located, alternating between non-adjacent sub-sectors to reduce interference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","108","100","108","110","108","110"]},"The antenna elements  form a phased array for each sector , , , configured to create a number of fixed beams per sector , , . In the particular embodiment shown, there are four fixed beams per sector , , . The signals transmitted through the plurality of antennas  of a single base station  are advantageously identical, except for differences in transmit amplitude and phase. When transmitting a signal, the base station  adjusts the amplitude and phase of the signals transmitted through the antennas  to form fixed signal beams directed at fixed divisions, or sub-sectors, of the sector , ,  the base station  serves.","In general, a base station  using beam switching to transmit to sub-sector divisions causes less interference to subscriber stations in neighboring sub-sectors than a base station  transmitting through a single antenna to the entire sector , , .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","204","206","204","0","207","1","209","2","211","3","213","207","209","211","213","208","210","212","214","204","207","209","211","213","0","207","2","211","1","209","3","213","208","210","212","214","216","204","216","208","210","212","214","216","216","216","216","216","216","216","216","216","216"]},"Interference to subscriber stations  in conventional cellular communications systems is greater at cell and sector boundaries where beams overlap. Conventionally, a subscriber station  at a sub-sector boundary will communicate with either sub-sector transmission beam, but neighboring beams will interfere with each other causing the C\/I to be low. The disclosed embodiments eliminate interference near sub-sector boundaries using a simple method of alternating transmissions on even ,  and odd ,  numbered sub-sector beams during odd and even transmission time slots. During even time slots, only even beams ,  are transmitted. Amplitude and phase coefficients of odd signal beams ,  are set to 0 during even time slots. During odd transmission time slots, only odd beams ,  are transmitted. Amplitude and phase coefficients of even signal beams ,  are set to 0 during odd transmission time slots. In a given time slot, two of four sets of beams are active. Eliminating interference (I) boosts C\/I, increasing system capacity and data rates. The alternating beam switching method of the disclosed embodiment, with six sub-sectors of a twelve sub-sector cell transmitting during a given time slot, performs better than a conventional six sector cell configuration with boundary interference. The alternating beam switching method of the disclosed embodiment provides subscriber stations  located near boundaries with good receive signal quality, enabling the subscriber stations  to request higher data rates.","One skilled in the art would understand that a cell could be arbitrarily divided into sectors, or any permutation of sectors and sub-sectors, without departing from the scope of the present invention",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIGS. 3","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3C"],"b":["0","2","1","3"]},"The disclosed embodiments advantageously identify even and odd transmission time slots, and corresponding even and odd sub-sector transmission beams. Even numbered signal beams are transmitted only during even numbered transmission time slots. Odd numbered signal beams are transmitted only during odd numbered transmission time slots. During any given time slot, half the sub-sector transmission beams will be activated while half the sub-sector transmission beams will be deactivated. Interference from neighboring transmission beams is advantageously eliminated with the alternate beam switching method of the disclosed embodiments.","Base stations maintain knowledge of subscriber stations located in their sub-sector coverage areas using DRC messages received from subscriber stations. The same signal is transmitted to all the sub-sectors of a sector regardless of the location of the subscriber station. The need for complicated tracking methods and smart antenna schemes for improving C\/I is eliminated by the simplicity of the disclosed embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"In step , odd numbered sub-sector beams are transmitted during odd time slots from the base station on the forward link. Subscriber stations (not shown) receiving data during odd numbered transmission slots receive a data packet, and generate a DRC based on the C\/I of the data received. In each transmission time slot there is a pilot signal, or a burst of known signal, being transmitted on the forward link. The subscriber station uses the pilot signal to predict the C\/I of the data that it will receive in the next time slot. Based on the estimated C\/I, the subscriber station determines the data rate it can support. For a given C\/I there is a maximum data rate that the subscriber station can support. The subscriber station uses the pilot signal transmitted in each activated time slot to predict the C\/I in the following activated slots, using a look-up table to find the maximum data rate.","In step , subscriber stations receiving data during even numbered transmission slots send a DRC to their base stations on the reverse link during the reverse link odd numbered time slots. Every odd time slot, subscriber stations receiving data during even numbered transmission slots send a DRC message to their base stations indicating the data rate at which they can receive. The base stations then transmit to the subscriber stations at the indicated rate during the next even numbered time slot.","In step , even numbered sub-sector beams are transmitted during even numbered time slots from the base station on the forward link.

The resulting PN spread sample streams are filtered by baseband finite impulse-response (FIR) filters  to generate the baseband complex sample streams to be upconverted and transmitted to subscriber stations (not shown).

In the exemplary embodiment, the lowest data rate of 9.6 kbps is allocated to each subscriber station upon registration with a base station. In the exemplary embodiment, subscriber stations can transmit data on the lowest-rate data channel at any time slot without having to request permission from a base station. In the exemplary embodiment, data transmissions at the higher data rates are granted by the selected base station based on a set of system parameters such as system loading, fairness, and total throughput. An exemplary scheduling mechanism for high speed data transmission is described in detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/798,951, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR FORWARD LINK RATE SCHEDULING,\u201d filed Feb. 11, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,335,922, issued Jan. 1, 2002 to Tiedemann et al., and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/914,928, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR REVERSE LINK RATE SCHEDULING,\u201d filed Aug. 20, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,923,650, issued Jul. 13, 1999 to Chen et al., both are assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein.","The exemplary block diagram of the pilot\/DRC channel is shown in . The DRC message is provided to DRC encoder , which encodes the message in accordance with a predetermined coding format. Coding of the DRC message is important since the error probability of the DRC message needs to be sufficiently low because incorrect forward link data rate determination impacts the system throughput performance. In the exemplary embodiment, DRC encoder  is a rate (8,4) block encoder which encodes the DRC message into a code word. The encoded DRC message is provided to multiplier  which covers the message with the Walsh code which uniquely identifies the destination base station for which the DRC message is directed. The Walsh code is provided by Walsh generator . The covered DRC message is provided to multiplexer (MUX) , which multiplexes the message with pilot data. The DRC message and the pilot data are provided to multipliers and , which spread the data with the PN_I and PN_Q signals, respectively. Thus, the pilot and DRC message are transmitted on both the inphase and quadrature phase of the sinusoid.","In the exemplary embodiment, the DRC message is transmitted to the selected base station. This is achieved by covering the DRC message with the Walsh code that identifies the selected base station. In the exemplary embodiment, the Walsh code is 128 chips in length. The derivation of 128-chip Walsh codes is known in the art. One unique Walsh code is assigned to each base station, which is in communication with the subscriber station. Each base station decovers the signal on the DRC channel with its assigned Walsh code. The selected base station is able to decover the DRC message and transmits data to the requesting subscriber station on the forward link in response thereto. Other base stations are able to determine that the requested data rate is not directed to them because these base stations are assigned different Walsh codes.","In the exemplary embodiment, the reverse link short PN codes for all base stations in the data communication system are the same and there is no offset in the short PN sequences to distinguish different base stations. The data communication system advantageously supports soft handoff on the reverse link. Using the same short PN codes with no offset allows multiple base stations to receive the same reverse link transmission from a subscriber station during a soft handoff. Thus the short PN codes provide spectral spreading but advantageously do not allow for identification of base stations.","In the exemplary embodiment, the DRC message carries the data rate requested by the subscriber station. In an alternate embodiment, the DRC message carries an indication of the forward link quality (e.g., the C\/I information as measured by the subscriber station). During acquisition, a subscriber station can simultaneously receive the forward link pilot signals from one or more sub-sector beams and perform the C\/I measurement on each received pilot signal. During acquisition, a subscriber station searches and makes measurements for pilots on both even and odd numbered time slots. The subscriber station selects the beam with the highest C\/I. The subscriber station subsequently sends DRC messages on the reverse link during the opposite reverse link time slot from the forward link time slot in which it receives data. The subscriber station switches from even to odd numbered time slots (or vice versa) if it crosses in to a new sub-sector. After acquisition, the C\/I is estimated by the subscriber station as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,773, except that the C\/I is measured only on the alternating even or odd time slot when data is received. The subscriber station then selects the best sub-sector beam based on a set of parameters, which can comprise present and previous C\/I measurements. The rate control information is formatted into the DRC message, which can be conveyed to the base station in one of several embodiments.","In a first embodiment, the subscriber station transmits a DRC message based on the requested data rate. The requested data rate is the highest supported data rate that yields satisfactory performance at the C\/I measured by the subscriber station. From the C\/I measurement, the subscriber station first calculates the maximum data rate, which yields satisfactory performance. The maximum data rate is then quantized to one of the supported data rates and designated as the requested data rate. The data rate index corresponding to the requested data rate is transmitted to the selected base station. An exemplary set of supported data rates and the corresponding data rate indices are shown in Table 1.","In another embodiment, wherein the subscriber station transmits an indication of the forward link quality to the selected base station, the subscriber station transmits a C\/I index that represents the quantized value of the C\/I measurement. The C\/I measurement can be mapped to a table and associated with a C\/I index. Using more bits to represent the C\/I index allows a finer quantization of the C\/I measurement. Also, the mapping can be linear or predistorted. For a linear mapping, each increment in the C\/I index represents a corresponding increase in the C\/I measurement. For example, each step in the C\/I index can represent a 2.0 dB increase in the C\/I measurement. For a predistorted mapping, each increment in the C\/I index can represent a different increase in the C\/I measurement. As an example, a predistorted mapping can be used to quantize the C\/I measurement to match the cumulative distribution function (CDF) curve of the C\/I distribution. Other embodiments to convey the rate control information from a subscriber station to a base station can be contemplated and are within the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, the use of different numbers of bits to represent the rate control information is also within the scope of the present invention.","In an exemplary embodiment, the C\/I measurement can be performed on the forward link pilot signal in a manner similar to that used in a CDMA system. A method and apparatus for performing the C\/I measurement is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/722,763, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MEASURING LINK QUALITY IN A SPREAD SPECTRUM COMMUNICATION SYSTEM,\u201d filed Sep. 27, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,903,554, issued May 11, 1999 to Saints, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and expressly incorporated by reference herein. The C\/I measurement on the pilot signal can be obtained by despreading the received signal with the short PN codes.","In an alternate embodiment, the C\/I measurement can be performed on the forward link traffic channel. The traffic channel signal is first despread with the long PN code and the short PN codes and decovered with the Walsh code. The C\/I measurement on the signals on the data channels can be more accurate because a larger percentage of the transmitted power is allocated for data transmission. Other methods to measure the C\/I of the received forward link signal by a subscriber station are also contemplated and are within the scope of the present invention.","In the exemplary embodiment, the DRC message is transmitted in the first half of the time slot. For an exemplary time slot of 1.667 msec, the DRC message comprises the first 1024 chips or 0.83 msec of the time slot. The remaining 1024 chips of time are used by the base station to demodulate and decode the DRC message. Transmission of the DRC message in the earlier portion of the time slot allows the base station to decode the DRC message within the same time slot and possibly transmit data at the requested data rate in the immediately successive time slot. The short processing delay allows the communication system to quickly adopt to changes in the operating environment.","In the alternate embodiment, the requested data rate is conveyed to the base station by the use of an absolute reference and a relative reference. In this embodiment, the absolute reference comprising the requested data rate is transmitted periodically. The absolute reference allows the base station to determine the exact data rate requested by a subscriber station. For each time slot between transmissions of the absolute reference, a subscriber station transmits a relative reference to the base station that indicates whether the requested data rate for the upcoming time slot is higher, lower, or the same as the requested data rate for the previous time slot. Periodically, the subscriber station transmits an absolute reference. Periodic transmission of the data rate index allows the requested data rate to be set to a known state and ensures that erroneous receptions of relative references do not accumulate. The use of absolute references and relative references can reduce the transmission rate of the DRC messages to the base station. Other protocols to transmit the requested data rate are also contemplated and are within the scope of the present invention.","As users place quality of service demands on a communication system, it is further desirable to understand the corresponding C\/I constraints for a particular bit rate and bit error rate that result in constraints on the transmit power for each user in the system. Note that a data signal to one user is noise or interference to another user. It is desirable not only to optimize the use of all time slots, but also to increase the C\/I of each individual user.

The transmitted signal is generated corresponding to a predetermined number of time slots per cycle, wherein the number of time slots is equal to the number of sectors. During a given time slot, each sector is assigned a power level, wherein the power assignment indicates the power level of the carrier signal transmitted to that sector. In the exemplary embodiment, the number of power levels is equal to the number of time slots per cycle. During a next time slot the power assignments change. The time-division power assignments are used to reduce the interference between transmitted signals, as only one sector receives a high-power signal. Alternate embodiments may implement a number of time slots not equal to the number of sectors, wherein the number of time slots reduces the interference for at least one transmitted signal. For example, the number of time slots may be equal to a number of sub-sectors within the sectors. Alternatively, the number of time slots may be greater than the number of sectors and\/or sub-sectors to allow for power control over multiple time slots, such as where the assignment pattern results in a predetermined average power value, or some other algorithm for controlling power to reduce interference between sectors and\/or subsectors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["1","2","3","1","1"]},"In , full power is indicated by P, and the lower power levels by Pand P, respectively. By transmitting to one sector at high power and at lower power levels to neighboring sectors, the interference within the high power sector is reduced. Alternate embodiments may implement one reduced power level to multiple sectors.","According to the exemplary embodiment, each sector receives a transmission signal during each time slot. Alternate embodiments may include inactive time slots, and\/or may include fewer power levels, wherein a single power level is assigned to multiple sectors. In the exemplary embodiment, the base station determines a time division of transmitted signals. All signals from the base station are generated according to this timing. The base station adjusts the power of each transmitted signal according to a rotational scheme consistent with this timing. For example, as illustrated in , during the first time slot , sector A is assigned a high power level, which may be full power or an adjusted power level, while sector B is assigned a low power level and sector C a mid-range power level. The power level assignment is valid throughout the time slot. During the next sequential time slot , the power assignments change, and sector A is assigned a mid-range power level, sector B a high power level, and sector C a low power level. The power assignment to the sectors rotates through the power levels cyclically. Note that in the exemplary embodiment, the order of the power assignments to a given sector does not change. For example, the power assignment order for sector A is: high, mid, low. The power assignment for sector B is: low, high, mid. The power assignment for sector C is: mid, low, high. During a given time slot, only one sector has a high power level assignment, which reduces interference to that sector and increases the C\/I for the given time slot. The exemplary embodiment thus advantageously reduces inter-symbol interference (ISI) by assigning each sector one time slot of high C\/I.","According to the exemplary embodiment, during each time slot, each sector is assigned a unique power level that is maintained sequentially. In alternate embodiments, the assignments and the order of the power assignments may be adjusted depending on the communication system. Alternate embodiments may alter the order of the power assignments to a sector, wherein at least one sector receives a transmitted signal at a high power level. For example, the power level assignment to a sector may be adjusted with respect to other sectors according to their interference conditions. This allows the base station to transmit according to a dynamic power assignment scheme.","Each of the mobile units within a sector provides DRC information to the transmitter during each time slot. For example, in the case of a system having a time division with three (3) time slots per cycle, and three (3) power levels, each mobile unit provides at least three (3) DRCs to the base station, one (1) for each power level, i.e., time slot. The DRC information is based on the C\/I estimate for a given time slot, the time slot having an associated power level. A digital filtering process, described hereinbelow, iteratively provides the C\/I estimates according to an adaptive method, wherein the calculation includes feedback from previous cycles. During a given time slot, the digital filtering performs a series of iterations to filter the symbols transmitted during the time slot. A digital filter operates on a sample set including a predetermined number of symbols. For each iteration, a C\/I estimate is generated. Each C\/I estimate includes calculations from earlier time slots of the same power level, i.e., time slot  calculations include historical information from previous time slot  calculations, etc. Note that alternate embodiments may not maintain the power assignment order and therefore the historical information corresponding to each power level may be represented by different time slots. In the exemplary embodiment, with respect to sector A, the C\/I estimate for time slot  is averaged with at least one previous time slot  calculation. Any number of previous time slots may be used to determine an estimate, wherein increasing the amount of historical information tends to increase the accuracy of the estimate. The amount of historical information included in each C\/I iteration may be limited by the number of power levels and\/or time slots, as well as the ability of the system to store the previous information. The previous C\/I results may be stored in a buffer or other memory storage device. Similarly, C\/I estimate information may be stored in matrix form, where constituent vectors correspond to specific power levels assigned to specific sectors. In the exemplary embodiment, the matrix would include C\/I information for three (3) sectors and (3) power levels each, or at least nine (9) vectors.","A mobile unit transmits DRC information back to the base station, corresponding to each assigned power level. Thus, during each active time slot, the mobile unit sends DRC information based on the C\/I averaged estimate. From the DRCs, the base station determines the data rate for transmission of data to the mobile unit for a given time slot. While the exemplary embodiment has an equal number of power levels and time slots, this is not strictly the case. It may clarify the discussion to realize that the DRC is associated with a specific power level. As discussed hereinabove, the DRC may be provided as a range of values within which the base station may transmit, or may be provided as a specific rate. Similarly, the mobile unit may provide the C\/I estimate directly and allow the base station to determine the appropriate DRC.","In one embodiment, the mobile station calculates the C\/I, performs the averaging, and selects the DRC from a look-up table. In an alternate embodiment, the mobile station sends the C\/I estimate to the base station, which then determines the appropriate data rate. On each iteration, the C\/I estimate is calculated by equalizing, or filtering, the received signal. The goal of equalization is to reduce any ISI introduced by the transmission channel. Equalization thus corrects for channel-induced distortions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["700","700","700","702","704","706","708","710","710"]},"With reference again to , while the equalizer  is illustrated as a FIR filter, it may be implemented using an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter or some other filter architecture. The equalizer  outputs the average of a sample set of sequentially received input symbols. The sample set is taken from a predetermined number of successive symbols. The number of symbols in a sample set is given as (2L+1). The equalizer  includes a series of delay elements  through . Between delay elements are taps to provide individual sample values to multipliers  through . The outputs from the taps are amplified and summed with summer . Each multiplier \u2013 receives a filter coefficient value for scaling, or amplifying, an individual sample value. The number of taps is equal to the number of symbols per sample set, i.e., (2L+1). The FIR architecture effectively performs a convolution of the filter coefficient values and the sample set.","The number of delay elements is one less than the number of taps, as there is a tap for the most recent received symbol prior to delay. Each delay element provides a delay equal to the symbol duration, given as T\/M, where T is the symbol period, and M is the fractional component of the sample. Typically, M=1 and sampling is performed once during each symbol duration, T. Alternate embodiments may set M=2 where two (2) samples are taken within each symbol duration, T. In the exemplary embodiment, there are three (3) time slots corresponding to the number of sectors.","As illustrated in , each time slot is further broken into smaller time intervals that are referred to as symbols. Within one time slot, there are N symbols, each symbol having duration time T. The equalizer  operates on a subset of the N symbols within one time slot. Note that a time slot may be referred to as a frame. During a time slot \u201ci,\u201d the equalizer  receives successive samples, given as x(n) for n=1, 2, . . . (2L+1), where \u201cn\u201d is the time index integer sequence for a sample set within one time slot. In the exemplary embodiment, the sample set increments through the delay elements  through  of equalizer  one symbol at a time.","The output of each delay element  through  is amplified by a corresponding tap coefficient, C, C, . . . C. The first coefficient index indicates the time slot, i.e., power level, of the transmitted signal.

The coefficient for iteration n is a function of the value on iteration (n\u22121), i.e., c(n)=f(c(n\u22121)). Alternate embodiments may implement a preset equalization method using a training sequence to adjust the coefficients. The preset method has the drawback of requiring training sessions on initiation, and may not be effective on time-varying degradation in the channel. Alternately, a combination of a preset initiation followed by adaptive iterations may be used for equalization.","In the adaptive equalizer , the C\/I estimate from each iteration provides feedback for adjusting the tap coefficients for the next iteration, as well as providing information to determine an appropriate data rate for the receiver and its associated DRC.

Each time slot is treated similarly, and therefore the stored information may be retrieved during the next corresponding time slot. Alternate embodiments may use information from more than one power level to generate C\/I estimates for a sector.","A base station using a time-division power assignment for beam switching to transmit to sector divisions reduces interference to subscriber stations in neighboring sectors by reducing the power to all but one sector and thus increasing that sector's C\/I.","In accordance with one embodiment, the equalizer  is realized as a finite transversal filter used for adaptive equalization of a channel. Coefficient adjustment adapts the coefficients to minimize noise and ISI at the output. The output is typically provided to a slicer or decision mechanism, and therefore the equalization step is directly related to the quality of the data. Coefficient adjustment involves a comparison of the estimated C\/I to an actual value. The exemplary embodiment utilizes a Least Mean-Square (LMS), or Minimum Mean-Square Error (MSE), algorithm. However, alternate embodiments may use any algorithm that produces an estimate based on historical information. Such algorithms include, e.g., Mean Square Error Gradient (MSEG), Recursive Least Squares (RLS) and Direct Matrix Inversion (DMI). Typically, the estimate y(n) is output to a slicer (not shown) that makes a decision as to the symbol value. An error term is calculated by comparing the equalized value, i.e., the output of summing node , with the sliced value. The result is an estimated error.","Using the LMS algorithm, a vector of filter coefficients is defined as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0104"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00006","num":"00006"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"munder":{"msub":{"mi":["c","i"]},"mi":"_"},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"c","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":",","mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"L"}}},{"mi":"c","mrow":{"mi":["i","L"],"mo":","}}],"mo":[",","\u2062",","],"mi":"\u22ef","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"8"}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0106","num":"0105"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00007","num":"00007"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"munder":{"msub":{"mi":["c","i"]},"mi":"_"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"n"}},{"mrow":[{"munder":{"msub":{"mi":["c","i"]},"mi":"_"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}},{"mi":"\u0394","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"munder":{"msub":{"mi":["x","i"]},"mi":"_"},"mo":"\u00b7","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"y","mo":"^"},"mi":"i"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"n"}},{"msub":{"mi":"y","msub":{"mi":["sliced","i"]}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"n"}}],"mo":"-"}}}}],"mo":"+"}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"9"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"While the exemplary embodiment transmits signals during all time slots, alternate embodiments may use a portion of the time slots, where at least one time slot is inactive to all but the sector receiving full signal power. Similarly, the power assignment may be adaptive, wherein the base station alters the power assignments based on feedback from the mobile units, including but not limited to DRC information and requests for retransmission of data for error correction. The base station may alter the reduced power levels to accommodate mobile units within the system. For example, the reduced power level may increase if mobile users experience an excessive amount of data errors. Similarly, the power levels may be adjusted according to a range of values for optimum operation, wherein adjustment outside of the range results in elimination of that power level, i.e., that power level is replaced with inactivity. In one embodiment, signal power is provided from 3 dB to 6 dB. Alternate embodiments may implement any power levels, where a high power level is used in one sector while at least one reduced level is used in another sector.","The presently disclosed embodiments provide a method of utilizing sub-sector beam switching techniques to decrease the average interference caused by transmissions of a base station to subscriber stations within a cell, and in neighboring cells.","Thus, a novel and improved method and apparatus for improved forward link data transmission has been described.
