{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This nonprovisional application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/362,520, filed Jul. 8, 2010, and Australian Application No. 2010202901, filed Jul. 8, 2010, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The present invention relates to a system, method and computer program for collating and preparing data for subsequent use in a data analysis process. Embodiments of the invention find particular, but not exclusive use in the collation and preparation of patent data. Other embodiments of the invention may find use in the collation and preparation of data in relation to trade marks, scientific publications, and court judgments.","With the advent of cheap and powerful computing systems and the development of the electronic database, there has been an explosion in the collection and electronic storage of data related to almost all areas of technology, industry, commerce and society. Data is generally held, in many instance, in the form of a \u201crecord\u201d, which typically comprises a series of attributes that describe a real world object or event. For example, one type of data record is a health record, which holds information regarding the attributes of a given person, such as their height, gender, weight, existing and past medical conditions, etc. Another type of data record is a database of scientific publications, the database including attributes regarding the publications such as the authors of each publication, citations or references to other publications, and the subject matter of each publication.","Another structured set of data is data describing intellectual property rights, such as patent data records or trade mark data records. Many countries have legal regimes where owners or creators of intellectual property can register their rights to an invention, a sign and\/or a design. Such records are highly structured and include a large number of attributes, such as a date of filing, the name of the Owner or Applicant, the names of the Inventors, data regrading the history of the invention and particular intellectual property office classification codes, such as the IPC (International Patent Classification) code, plus other attributes that describe the nature of the intellectual property right.","As patent data is effectively a record of innovative activity, value can be derived from searching patent data to extract commercially useful information.","However, as an ever growing number of patents are filed every year, due to a constant increase in the rate of technological development and a greater awareness of the legal rights covering inventions, patent databases now contain millions or tens of millions of records, and in turn each record contains a large and complex set of attributes. Therefore, traditional methods for searching such databases (such as by looking for keywords in the Title, Abstract or Applicant Details) lack precision, are prone to error and can return large and unwieldy data sets.","More importantly, without seeking professional assistance and studying each patent specification in detail, it is difficult to judge the relative worth or \u201cmerit\u201d of a particular patent, or the underlying invention protected by the patent, in comparison to other patents and patented inventions. As such, traditional search methodologies struggle to adequately provide any sophisticated or high level information regarding the relative merit or worth of a patent.","In a first aspect, the present invention provides a method of preparing data for analysis, comprising the steps of:","receiving an initial data set including a plurality of records, each of the plurality of records including an identifier attribute and an associative attribute that identifies a further one or more records;","receiving the further one or more records identified by the associative attribute in each of the plurality of records; and","associating the further one or more records with the initial data set to form a final data set.","In an embodiment, the method comprises the further step of upon receiving the initial data set, reviewing the associative attribute;","comparing each associative attribute from each of the plurality of data records to the identifier attribute in each of the plurality of records; and","only receiving the further one or more records identified by the associative attribute if the associative attribute does not match any one of the identifier attributes in the initial data set.","The step of receiving an initial data set may be preceded by the step of inputting a search query arranged to extract the initial data set from a database of data records.","The plurality of records may include information regarding patents, and if so, the identifier attribute may be one of a patent serial number or a patent application number. Also, the associative attribute may be a list of citations, including at least one of forward citations and backward citations.","The plurality of records may also represent information regarding trade marks, with the attributes comprising citations by trade marks examiners to earlier published trade marks that are similar to the trade mark application being examined, and in a similar class of goods and services.","The plurality of records may also represent information regarding scientific publications, with the attributes comprising citations by the authors to earlier scientific publications.","The method steps may be iterated one or more times.","In one embodiment, each of the data records received may be reviewed to determine whether the data record is in a format suitable for analysis, and if not, the data record may be reformatted or removed.","In a second aspect, the present invention provides a method of preparing data for analysis, comprising the steps of:","receiving a data set including a plurality of data records, each data record including an identifier attribute and an associative attribute; and","linking each of the plurality of data records that share at least one common identifier attribute value, to form one or more networks of data records.","The method may comprise the further step of reviewing the network of data records to identify data records that are not linked to any other data record, and removing the non-linked data records from the data set.","For each network of data records, the number of data records in each of the one or more networks may be counted to ascribe a size value to each of the one or more networks.","In an embodiment, the method may comprise the further step of selecting only the network with the largest size value.","In another embodiment, the method may comprise the further step of:","setting a predetermined size value;","comparing the predetermined size value to the size value for each of the one or more networks; and","selecting only the one or more networks that have a size value greater than the predetermined size value.","In yet another embodiment, the method may comprise the further step of:","setting a predetermined ratio value as a function of the largest size value;","determining a ratio value for each of the one or more networks as a function of the predetermined ratio; and","selecting only the one or more networks that are less than the predetermined ratio.","A subject matter value may be selected for each of the one or more networks, and only the one or more networks that have a subject matter value that is substantially similar to one or more predetermined subject matter values may be selected.","Selecting the subject matter value may include the further step of identifying one or more subject matter attributes for each of the records in each of the one or more networks and utilising the one or more subject matter attributes to derive a subject matter value.","The step of utilising the one or more subject attributes may include the further step of providing at least one of the one or more subject matter attributes to a user for review and receiving user input regarding the subject matter value. The subject matter value may be utilised to rank the records.","One of the subject matter attributes may be a computed network value using the association through direct and indirect forward citations and the step of ranking includes ranking the data records from highest network value to the least network value.","One of the subject matter attributes may be the number of family members, wherein the step of ranking includes ranking the data records from most family members to least family members.","One of the subject matter attributes may be an International Patent Classification (IPC) code, wherein the step of ranking includes ranking the data records from most popular IPC to least popular IPC.","One of the subject matter attributes may be the number of times one or more keywords appears in the subject matter attribute, wherein the step of ranking includes ranking the data records from most number of times one or more keywords appear in the subject matter attribute to least number of times the keywords appear in the subject matter attribute.","The one or more selected networks may be displayed utilising a visualisation methodology.","In a third aspect, the invention provides a method for preparing data for analysis, comprising the steps of, receiving a data set in accordance with the first or the second aspect, and reducing the number of data records in each of the one or more networks.","The step of reducing the number of data records may include the further step of identifying at least one pair of data records that are linked by a common attribute value, and identifying further data records that are linked to both of the at least one pair of data records by the common attribute value, to derive a count of the total number of links between the pair of data records.","The method steps of the third aspect may be iterated, to derive a count of the total links between all of the pairs of data records in the data set.","A predetermined level of links may be set between a pair of data records and removing all pairs of data records that have a number of links below the predetermined level.","The step of reducing the number of data records may include the further step of identifying each link between a pair of data records, counting the number of degrees of separation for each link to derive a separation value representative of the number of instances of each of the number of degrees of separation for the pair of data records, assigning a multiplier to each of the degrees of separation, multiplying each multiplier with each respective separation value to derive a count value for each degree of separation and removing all pairs of records with a count value below a predetermined value.","In an embodiment, the method may include the further step of removing any data records that are not connected to any of the other data records.","In a fourth aspect, the present invention provides a system for preparing data for analysis, comprising:","a receiving module arranged to receive an initial data set including a plurality of records, each of the plurality of records including an identifier attribute and an associative attribute that identifies a further one or more records;","the receiving module being further arranged to receive the further one or more records identified by the associative attribute in each of the plurality of records; and","an association module arranged to associate the further one or more records with the initial data set to form a final data set.","In a fifth aspect, the present invention provides a system of preparing data for analysis, comprising:","a receiving module arranged to receive a data set including a plurality of data records, each data record including an identifier attribute and an associative attribute; and","an associative module arranged to link each of the plurality of data records that share at least one common identifier attribute value, to form one or more networks of data records.","In a sixth aspect, the present invention provides a system for preparing data for analysis, comprising a receiving module arranged to receive a data set in accordance with the first aspect of the invention and a reduction module arranged to reduce the number of data records in each of the one or more networks.","In a seventh aspect, the present invention provides a computer program, including at least one instruction, which, when executed on a computing system, is arranged to implement a method in accordance with one or more of the first, second and third aspects of the invention.","In an eighth aspect, the present invention provides a computer readable media including a computer program in accordance with the seventh aspect of the invention.","In an ninth aspect, the present invention provides a method of transmitting or receiving a computer data signal comprising at least one encoded instruction in accordance with the computer program of the seventh aspect of the invention.","The foregoing description describes only a preferred embodiment of the broader invention and modifications, obvious to those skilled in the art, can be made without departing from the scope of the broader invention described in the specification as a whole.","Referring to , an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. This embodiment is arranged to provide a system for preparing and collating data for future substantive analysis. At a broad level, the embodiment comprises an interface for receiving user instructions and displaying results, and a processor for executing user commands, including commands to collect data in a suitable manner for further processing. In this example embodiment, the interface and processor are implemented by a computer system having an appropriate user interface. The computer system may be implemented by any computing architecture, including stand-alone PC, client\/server architecture, \u201cdumb\u201d terminal\/mainframe architecture, or any other appropriate architecture. The computing system is appropriately programmed to implement the embodiment described herein.","In this embodiment, there is provided a local database containing patent data records. In another embodiment, it will be understood that the system may access a separately located and\/or administered database containing patent data records. The database may be separately administered by a Government authority or third party.","Referring in detail to , there is shown a schematic diagram of a computing device which in this embodiment is a computing system . The system  comprises suitable components necessary to receive, store and execute appropriate computer instructions. The components may include a processing unit , read-only memory (ROM) , random access memory (RAM) , and input\/output devices such as disk drives , input devices  such as an Ethernet port, a USB port, etc. Display  such as a liquid crystal display, a light emitting display or any other suitable display and communications links . The system  includes instructions that may be included in ROM , RAM  or disk drives  and may be executed by the processing unit . There may be provided a plurality of communication links  which may variously connect to one or more computing devices such as a server, personal computers, terminals, wireless or handheld computing devices. At least one of a plurality of communications link may be connected to an external computing network through a telephone line or other type of communications link.","The system may include storage devices such as a disk drive  which may encompass solid state drives, hard disk drives, optical drives or magnetic tape drives. The system  may use a single disk drive or multiple disk drives. The system  may also have a suitable operating system  which resides on the disk drive or in the ROM of the system .","The system has a database  residing on a disk or other storage device which is arranged to store at least one record  providing patent related data. The database  is in communication with an interface (comprising one or more of the abovementioned components), which is implemented by computer software residing on the system . The interface provides a means by which the data may be appropriately searched and collated.","The interface is connected to the processor and is arranged to facilitate both the entering of user commands and the display of information to the user.","To perform an analysis of patent records held in the database, it is important to firstly ensure that the data records extracted from the database is reliable and \u201cclean\u201d (i.e. the data should ideally contain few or no errors and should be in a format that allows maximum information to be extracted from the records). It is commonly thought that patent records and patent databases are a clean and reliable source of information. However, even Government maintained databases are prone to human error and\/or may not provide the facilities required to easily extract large amounts of data in a format suitable for substantive analysis.","Therefore, as a first step, it is necessary to correctly select appropriate patent records to be used in any subsequent analysis. The process is shown, generally at  in . At step , the user first defines a search query which is designed to extract relevant data records from a patent database. It will be understood that any suitable process may be used to arrive at the search query. At step , the search query is used to extract the set of data records. In more detail, at step , a list of backward citations is identified within the list of attributes of each data record and at step a list of forward citations is identified within the list of attributes of each data record.","It should be noted that in the context of the embodiments described herein, the term \u201cforward citation\u201d refers to a data record that contains, as an attribute value, a reference to another data record, while a \u201cbackward (or reverse) citation\u201d refers to the data record that is referenced by another data record. It will be understood that in the context of embodiments described the terms \u201cforward\u201d and \u201cbackward\u201d do not imply any chronological (or other) order.","At step , the backward and forward citations are compared to the list of data records originally extracted from the database and all identified citations that are not listed as data records in the current list of data records are extracted. These may be termed \u201cadditional data records\u201d. At step , information regarding the additional data records is extracted from the database. The extracted data records are concentrated to the original list of data records to create an amended list of data records.","This process may be iterated a number of times (), until the user is satisfied (). For example, the user may be satisfied with just one iteration, or be satisfied once a certain number of data records have been collected.","The process shown in  is best described by use of a simplified example shown in  and with the aid of Tables 1 to 4.","Referring to , there is shown a diagrammatic representation of a set of data records which are also listed in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Data Record","Backward Citations","Forward Citation"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["A","B","C, E"]},{"entry":["B","D","C, F"]},{"entry":["C","A, B","D"]},{"entry":["D","C","B"]},{"entry":["E","A","F, G"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"As can be seen from Table 1, data records A through E have a number of backward and forward citations.

In the embodiment described herein, this methodology finds two uses. Firstly, the methodology is utilisable as \u201cone click\u201d type process within the broader software application, where a user can choose to \u201cexpand the network\u201d after performing an initial keyword search by merely clicking on the \u201cexpand network\u201d button that is assembled through the user interface. More importantly, the methodology described above is a first step in a broader methodology that allows for sophisticated and substantive analysis and visualisation of patent data.","Once the methodology describe above has been carried out, the user may choose to perform some more detailed analysis on the patent records identified.","Once a set of data records including their citations have been downloaded, the data records may be linked to form one or more \u201cnetworks\u201d of data records.","In the context of the specification and the embodiments described herein, the term \u201cnetwork\u201d is utilised to describe a conceptual entity where data records are associated to each other directly through a forward or backward citation or by a common attribute value (e.g. two patent data records which share a common citation are associated or \u201clinked\u201d by the fact that they share the same citation). Moreover, when referring to the visualisation of the association between records, the terms \u201cnetwork\u201d and more specifically \u201cnetwork visualisation\u201d are utilised to denote a spatial visualisation technique where data records may be presented in a visual, spatial format in either a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space by assigning a two-dimensional or three-dimensional closed shape to each data record (e.g. each data record may be denoted by a sphere) and utilising a one-dimensional connector (e.g. a line) to denote an association or link (i.e. a common attribute) between each node. In other words, it will be understood that the term \u201cnetwork\u201d may refer to both the visual representation of a number of data records and also to the abstract construct the linkage between various data records by virtue of the association between data records that have a common attribute value. One methodology for building a visual \u201cnetwork\u201d is described with reference to .","In , there is shown a process flow , which includes a first step of downloading the data records  followed by a linking step  where data records are linked together to form one or more networks. The data records are linked using citation data.","At step , isolated data records are removed. That is, data records which are not linked to any other data record by known citation information are removed from the network. At step , as it is possible that a number of independent networks may have been formed, then, the size of each network is counted. If there are a number of networks then the methodology moves to step , to determine whether further analysis should be applied to each network. If there are multiple networks, then four possible methodologies may be utilised to further analyse each network, as denoted by steps , , and . At , the largest network, only is selected (i.e. all other networks are ignored and no further analysis is applied). At , one or more networks are selected by utilising a minimum size methodology. That is, only networks with a number of data records greater than a predetermined number are selected for further analysis. At step , the user can identify and select a cluster from a number of clusters within a network, the cluster (rather than the network as a whole) having a number of data records greater than a predetermined number of records. At step , the user may choose to select one or more networks based on the subject matter defined by the networks. As such, the user can choose to focus on particular subsections of the network map as a whole by only concentrating on networks that are of immediate interest or are of a suitable size.","Optionally, the user may then proceed to a step. If step is selected that provides a number of methodologies for identifying the subject matter of each network (or cluster within a network). The user may be provided with a facility to individually view data related to each node in the network (e.g. the user may be able to view a list of attribute values for each of the data records within a network) so that the user can subjectively review the attributes of each data record and decide whether the subject matter is appropriate or of interest. Alternatively, an automated sorting method may be employed, which may include techniques such as ranking data records by the number of forward citations, the number of family methods or any other suitable method and then only displaying those records to the user to allow the user to subjectively review only those records.","Alternatively, another automated methodology is provided, namely that a classification attribute is used (for example an International Patent Classification Code) to identify the relevant subject matter of data records with a cluster or within a network.","Another variation, can use popular and technically related words to identify and classify data records.","It will also be understood that variations on steps a through d (including combinations of different methodologies) may also be utilised. Alternatively, various automated semantic text analysis methods may be utilised.","Returning to step , once the data has been collated correctly, the data may then be used as an input to further substantive analysis. Alternatively, the data may be modelled using appropriate visualisation software to create a network map.","The methodology described above is best explained through use of an example.","Referring to , there is shown a network map which lists the results of a search for children's authors in a database using a set of search criteria. The results in this simplified example identify eight (8) data records. Using citation relationships the eight (8) records form two non-connected data sets.","A manual review of the subject matter shows that three of the data records in fact referred to authors who wrote for adults and not for children. As such, the data records that are not relevant can be removed from the data set to arrive at the network map shown in . Alternatively, in the example given the selection of the largest network would have also correctly identified the children's authors.","Once a network has been created, it will be understood that the visualisation (i.e. the display of the network to an end user) will not always convey useful information, due to the fact that the network may contain thousands, tens of thousands or potentially hundreds of thousands of nodes, such that larger clusters of nodes may partially or wholly obscure other clusters of nodes. As such, there is a need to provide a methodology for reducing the number of data records in a network to make the structure easier to visualise and interpret. For the purposes of better describing this embodiment, it is instructive to provide some definitions.","In the context of the foregoing embodiment, a \u201cDirect Link\u201d is a direct citation link between two data records.","An \u201cIndirect Connection\u201d is any link between data records Dand Dwhich is not a direct link (i.e. Dlinks to Dthrough one or more intermediate data records D, Detc);","a \u201cPath Link\u201d refers to the number of data records found in the shortest path between any two data records;","an \u201cIntermediate Data Record\u201d refers to any data record that lies in the shortest path between any two outer records that are not directly connected;","a \u201cTwo Degrees of Separation Link\u201d refers to any indirect connection between any two data records Dand Dthat has a path link of 2 (i.e. there is only one data record Dbetween Dand D); and","an \u201cN Degree of Separation Link\u201d refers to any indirection connection between any two data records that has a path link of N.","With these definitions in mind, there is now described an embodiment which allows for the automatic selection and culling of data records to be used in a network visualisation or any other data analysis. The embodiment is described with reference to flowchart  in . At , a set of data records is selected, such that all data records are linked to each other either directly or indirectly. At steps  to , there are shown two possible methods for reducing the number of data records within the particular network. At A, there is shown the two degree separation link count methodology. At step , for each direct citation link between every connected pair of data records Dand D(where Dand Dare also two degree of separation links), the number of data records Dthat directly link to both Dand Dare counted to provide a value for a citation link (C). At , a minimum value of C is selected (i.e. C). All direct links where the C value is less than the Care removed at step . At step  all data records that are not connected to the network after the direct links are removed in step  are also removed. At step  (which is optional), different values of Care utilised to determine the effect of each different value on the final structure of the network.","The methodology is explained further with reference to an example and ,  and . A set of data records which are linked to the connections between people within an organisation. In the example, Jim shares knowledge with Catherine directly but Jim also mentors to other people who also mentor Catherine. Therefore, as shown in  each link has a value of 1. However, if we wish to identify the strongest relationship in the organisation, we firstly calculate the C value for each pair which is displayed in . As can be seen in , the mentoring relationship between Jim and Catherine is assigned a C value of 2, which represents two \u2018Two Degrees of Separation\u2019 Links. However, there are other mentoring relationships, and an attempt to focus on the strongest relationship, the organisation assigns a Cvalue of 2. Therefore, since the mentoring relationships between Jim and Jing, Jim and Sarah, Jing and Catherine, and Sarah and Catherine each only have a C value of 1 in this present diagram, before all relationships are removed as shown in . If we expand this across an entire organisation (i.e. include members of the organisation not shown in ), we arrive at the final chart of . At the end of the process, only direct links with a C value greater than 2 and only data records that remain linked to a network are retained. That is, Jing, Sarah and others are removed from the initial network and only four people remain in . As such, the principal or main mentors and their relationship to the other main mentors are shown and it can be seen that Xi is the \u201cmain\u201d or central mentor followed by Jing.","Alternatively, a different methodology may be utilised to determine nodes of high importance. A second embodiment uses an \u2018Mcount\u2019 method. At step , for every link between every pair of data records in a network Dand D, whether directly connected or otherwise, the number of data records Dare counted in all paths between Dand D, where the degree of separation for these paths is one degree, two degrees, N degrees etc. There is a sign of value to the count C, C, CN respectively. At , a multiplier is assigned to each direct link\u2014each one degree link each 2 degree link, etc, namely N, N, . . . NN. At step , for each direct citation link, the C value is multiplied by N, the C value by N and so on; and finally the multiples are added together along with the N value to provide a Mcount for each citation link. At step , a minimum value of Mcount is selected. At step , all direct citation links where the Mcount value is less than Mcountare removed. At step , all data records that are not connected to the network after the links are removed are also removed. Optionally, it may be possible to experiment with different values N and N (see step ) to determine the affect of these different values on the final structure of the network.","With reference to  and Tables 5, 6 and 7, it can be seen that if we take a similar example to the last example (i.e. mentoring in a workplace),  shows that between Jim and Catherine there is one degree of separation, but each of Jim and Catherine also have relationships of two degrees of separation and one three degrees of separation relationship. Hence the relationship between Jim and Catherine has the Mcount values found in Table 5.","The multiplier for each of the Mcount values is decided (as per Table 6).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0114"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 5"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Count Contributor","Value"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"C1","1"]},{"entry":[{},"C2","2"]},{"entry":[{},"C3","1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0116","num":"0115"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 6"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Multiplier","Value"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"N1","1"]},{"entry":[{},"N2","\u20020.5 (\u00bd)"]},{"entry":[{},"N3","0.33 (\u2153)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Therefore, the final Mcount values are shown in Table 7.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0117"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00007","num":"00007"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 7"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Degree of Separation","M Count Contributor"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"1","1*1 = 1"]},{"entry":[{},"2","2*0.5 = 1"]},{"entry":[{},"3","1*0.33 = 0.33"]},{"entry":[{},"Final MCount Value","2.33"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"In the example, if the minimum Mcount value (Mcount) is set as being 2, then the only relationship that has a higher value than Mcountis the relationship between Jim and Catherine at an N count value of 2.33, so this relationship is retained but all other relationships are culled.","Utilising this methodology, it becomes much easier to focus on data records of high importance, and remove data records that, may be only peripheral to a particular subject area.","Although not required, the embodiments described with reference to the Figures can be implemented as an Application Programming Interface (API) or as a series of libraries for use by a developer or can be included within another software application, such as a terminal or personal computer operating system or a portable computing device operating system.
