title: Controlling a shared service
abstract: A method includes determining whether a first amount of liability contributed by a first subscriber during a provision of a service to the first subscriber exceeds a first balance indicative of a first portion of available funding that may be consumed by the first subscriber, determining whether a second amount of liability contributed by a second subscriber during a provision of a service to the second subscriber exceeds a second balance indicative of a second portion of the available funding that may be consumed by the second subscriber, issuing a first communication to a device to affect the provision of a service to the first subscriber if the first amount of liability exceeds the first balance, and issuing a second communication to the device to affect the provision of a service to the second subscriber if the second amount of liability exceeds the second balance.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present disclosure relates to a technique for controlling usage of a shared service, such a mobile telephone service being provided to a group of subscribers or group of accounts in real time.","2. Description of the Related Art","The approaches described in this section are approaches that could be pursued, but not necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated, the approaches described in this section may not be prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.","Service providers, for example, a service provider for mobile telephone communication, may provide plans or packages that include a service for more than one user so that the users share an account or more than one account established by the plan. The accounts may include a sum of minutes shared by the users during use of their phones. However, the service provider incurs risk when providing the service to accounts and subscribers of accounts without pre-payment such as possible losses due to non-payment. This risk increases with each additional user and account due to the increase in usage of the service. Moreover, users may desire service providers limit use of the service in order to decrease cost. Accordingly, service providers have a necessity for control.","The present document discloses a technique for controlling usage of a service by more than one subscriber or account.","A method includes obtaining a liability limit indicative of an available funding, determining whether a first amount of liability contributed by a first subscriber during a provision of a service to the first subscriber exceeds a first balance indicative of a first portion of the available funding that may be consumed by the first subscriber, determining whether a second amount of liability contributed by a second subscriber during a provision of a service to the second subscriber exceeds a second balance indicative of a second portion of the available funding that may be consumed by the second subscriber, issuing a first communication to a device to affect the provision of a service to the first subscriber if the first amount of liability exceeds the first balance, and issuing a second communication to the device to affect the provision of a service to the second subscriber if the second amount of liability exceeds the second balance.","A method includes obtaining a hierarchy of a first account having a first subscriber and a second account having a second subscriber, the second account being lower in the hierarchy than the first account, obtaining (a) a first liability limit indicative of a first available funding to the first account, and (b) a second liability limit indicative of a second available funding to the second account, maintaining a first running total that includes a sum of (a) a first amount of liability contributed by the first subscriber during a provision of a service to the first subscriber, and (b) a second amount of liability contributed by the second subscriber during a provision of a service to the second subscriber, determining whether the first running total exceeds the first liability limit, issuing a first communication to a device to affect the provision of a service to the first subscriber and the provision of a service to the second subscriber, if the first running total exceeds the first liability limit.","A component or a feature that is common to more than one drawing is indicated with the same reference number in each of the drawings.","The present description introduces a concept referred to herein as a \u201ctotal monetary liability.\u201d Total monetary liability is a specific type of sum defined for controlling consumption of funds from another source. Funds include monetary sums, goods and services. Services may include goods and\/or services. In more detail, total monetary liability includes a running total of a sum of an amount of liability or funds consumed. The running total has a value that reflects debits to the account, increasing the total monetary liability, and credits to the account, decreasing the total monetary liability.","The present description also introduces a concept referred to herein as a \u201ctotal monetary liability limit.\u201d The total monetary liability limit is a value of the running total. The total monetary liability limit may be a maximum financial exposure that a source is willing to extend to an account.","At the end of the present description, there is a table, namely Table 3, which contains definitions of some other terms.","A source such as a provider of service incurs risk when providing funds to accounts and subscribers of accounts without pre-payment such as possible losses due to non-payment. This risk is increased where there is more than one subscriber of an account or more than one account in a hierarchy due to increased use of the service. A total monetary liability system (\u201cTML system\u201d) provided herein obtains a total monetary liability limit for an account that is indicative of an available amount of funding predetermined by the source or service provider. The TML system maintains a total monetary liability that is a running total for an amount of liability contributed by subscribers of each account or accounts within a defined scope. The TML system determines whether the total monetary liability exceeds the total monetary liability limit in order to notify the source or subscribers. If the total monetary liability exceeds the total monetary liability limit a communication may be issued to affect the provision of a service to the subscriber. The communication issued may affect the provision of a service in order to notify the subscriber or terminate usage of the service. The term \u201cexceed\u201d, as used herein, includes reaching or exceeding.","The TML system may also determine an available total monetary liability (\u201cavailable TML\u201d) that equals an amount of a total monetary liability below a total monetary limit. The available TML is indicative of a portion of an available funding that may be consumed by a subscriber or account prior to the total monetary liability exceeding the total monetary liability limit. A communication of the available TML may be issued, for example, to a network, indicating that usage of funds can only be allowed for an amount of time that corresponds to the available TML, or indicating that the subscriber or account can only consume up to an amount that corresponds to the available TML, and the network is obligated to terminate usage of funds when this amount, for example, consumption level, is reached.","An amount of liability contributed by each subscriber during a provision of a service to each subscriber may be determined to exceed a balance that is indicative of a portion of the available funding that may be consumed by each subscriber. If the amount of liability of one of the subscribers exceeds the balance that is indicative of the portion of the available funding that may be consumed by the subscriber, a communication to a device to affect the provision of a service to the subscriber is issued. As above, the affect of the provision of a service may be issued in order to notify the subscriber or terminate usage of the service.","Thus, the TML system maintains, in real time, the total monetary liability and determines an available TML or if the total monetary liability exceeds a total monetary liability limit during consumption of the funds so that action may be taken as soon as the total monetary liability exceeds a total monetary liability limit. By using a current up-to-date value of the total monetary liability, as well as the total monetary liability limit, for example, when used with on-line authorization and charging for usage, a merchant or service provider can inhibit further usage of an account, including usage by any and all members or subscribers of the account once the total monetary liability limit has been reached. The restrictions can be relaxed, for example, when the total monetary liability has either been reduced by credit to the account (e.g. payment), or the merchant agrees to increase the account's total monetary liability limit.","Referring to , an account structure  has an account  that contains a TML system  that obtains a total monetary liability limit  and maintains overall total monetary liability  of account .","Account  has a single account offer , which in turn establishes three account balances , , and . The three account balances , , and  are available for use to pay for goods and services for all subscribers of account , including subscribers , , and . The account offer  also dictates charges and terms of usage for account .","Account  has subscriber  that is a member of account . Subscriber  has a subscriber offer , which dictates the terms, conditions, and rates for usage by subscriber . Subscriber offer  also establishes subscriber balances , , and . Subscriber balances , , and  are available to be used to pay for goods and services by subscriber  only.","Account  has subscriber  that is a member of account . Subscriber  has a subscriber offer , which dictates the terms, conditions, and rates for usage by subscriber . Subscriber offer  also establishes subscriber balances , , and . Subscriber balances , , and  are available to be used to pay for goods and services by subscriber  only. Subscriber offer  and subscriber offer  are the same, however, subscriber offer  and subscriber offer  may be different.","Account  has subscriber  that is a member of account . Subscriber  has a subscriber offer , which dictates the terms, conditions, and rates for usage by subscriber . This offer also establishes subscriber balance . Subscriber balance  is available to be used to pay for goods and services by subscriber  only.","Total monetary liability  reflects a liability of account . Total monetary liability  is affected by, and affects use of all currency balances within account , including subscriber balances , , , , , , . Account balance  and subscriber balances  and  are non-currency balances. Non-currency balances, such as short message services (SMS), may not affect, nor are they affected by total monetary liability . For example, a plan may be purchased from a service provider that for $10 provides 500 SMSs per month, with any overage charged at $0.10 per SMS. The $10 charge for the plan would be applied to total monetary liability. Each month would be started with the SMS balance set to 500, and the $10 applied to the total monetary liability. As each of the first 500 SMSs is used and charged, the SMS balance would be decremented by one, however the total monetary liability would not be affected, because the $10 for the monthly allotment. When the user does an SMS beyond the initial 500, the SMS balance would be 0, so $0.10 would be charged. This $0.10 charge would be applied to the total monetary liability. Accordingly, the total monetary liability may be only affected by currency changes.","Each subscriber is limited by their available balances. For example, subscriber  is limited by balances ,  and , subscriber  is limited by balances ,  and  and subscriber  is limited by balance . Additionally, each subscriber is limited by the account total monetary liability limit, for example, subscribers ,  and  are limited by total monetary liability limit . These are essentially independent, parallel checks or limits that are applied.","Total monetary liability  is a sum of liability, for example, through use of goods and services, contributed by account  and subscribers ,  and . TML system maintains total monetary liability  and determines when total liability  exceeds total monetary liability . In addition, TML system may also determine an available TML that equals an amount of total monetary liability  below total monetary limit . The available TML is indicative of a portion of an available funding that may be consumed by account  and subscribers ,  and  prior to total monetary liability  exceeding total monetary liability limit .","Referring to , an account structure including an account hierarchy configuration  has a more complex, hierarchical structure than configuration , including accounts , , , , , , and  that are sub accounts, or lower on the hierarchy, than account . This becomes important when it comes to a scope of TML systems , , , , , , , and .","Referring to , configuration  has scopes , , , , , , , and . By default, a scope of a TML system having a total monetary liability and a total monetary liability limit is an account and all subscribers directly associated to the account.

There is no overlap of TML systems , , , , ,  and .","Accordingly, the total monetary liability of each account includes a sum of liability contributed by the account and all subscribers directly associated to the account. The TML system of each account determines when the total monetary liability exceeds the total monetary liability limit of the TML system.

Row 2 of Table 2 represents when subscriber , who is part of account , makes a $120 purchase that directly affects total monetary liability  and balance , but does not affect any of the other balances, or total monetary liability . Row 3 of Table 2 represents when subscriber , who is part of account , makes a $140 purchase that not only directly affects total monetary liability , the $140 purchase also directly affects total monetary liability . Since total monetary liability  only has $240 remaining, total monetary liability  limits an availability of balance  to $240. Since total monetary liability  only has $60 remaining, total monetary liability  limits an availability of balance  to $60. Row 4 of Table 2 represents when subscriber , who is part of account , makes a $200 purchase. The $200 purchase directly affects total monetary liability , and balance . Since total monetary liability  only has $40 remaining, total monetary liability  limits the availability of balance , balance , and balance  to $40. Row 5 of Table 2 represents when a payment of $50 is made to account  that directly affects total monetary liability . However, the payment of $50 does not immediately make any more funds available to any of accounts  and  or balances , ,  and , as they are limited due to the fact that total monetary liability  has less available funds than total monetary liability .","Advantageously, balances , ,  and  may support concurrent usage as well, ensuring that even with multiple simultaneous events affecting total monetary liabilities  and  (e.g. multiple subscribers within the account performing simultaneous usage), accounts  and  do not exceed total monetary liability limits  and . That is, just as balances , ,  and  can use reservations and balance nibbling to support simultaneous consumption from the same balance, TML amounts can be reserved. For example, a subscriber has a single balance with $10. The subscriber wants to make a phone call that is charged $1.00 per minute. Based on the $10 of available balance, the subscriber could potentially make a 10-minute phone call before running out of funds. However, it is possible that while making this call, the subscriber could perform additional activities, such as starting a data session, or maybe even making a second call, for example, as part of a three-way call. If the subscriber were to make the second call, for example, at the same rate of $1.00 per minute, then the subscriber does not have enough funds for the first call to be 10-minutes, and the second call to be 10-minutes, as this would be a total charge of $20.00, and the single balance is only has $10. A portion of the available $10.00 may be reserved (a \u201cnibble\u201d of the balance) when the first call is made, and dedicate the portion to the first call. A size of the nibble or portion reserved is configurable. In this example, a reservation of $3.00 may be made, so that $7.00 is remaining for any other usage. If the first call goes beyond 3-minutes (fully consumes the $3.00 reservation), a second reservation (assuming there are available funds) to extend the first call for another few minutes may be made. Note that if during the first 3-minutes the subscriber made the second call at $1.00 per minute, a second reservation for $3.00 may be made, meaning that there was $3.00 reserved for the first call, and $3.00 reserved for the second call, and $4.00 remaining for other usage. When the usage ends, a \u201creconcile\u201d of the portions reserved may be made, meaning that there is a charge for the used portion and a return of any unused portion to the balance. If the first call only lasted 2-minutes, there would be a charge $2.00, and a return $1.00 to the single balance. This is reserving and balance nibbling. When it comes to a TML system, the same reserving and balance nibbling may be performed. For example, if a reserve of $3.00 from the single balance is made, a reserve of $3.00 is also made in the total monetary liability in the TML system.","The TML system may trigger internal and external actions. Based on a value of the total monetary liability, and a relationship to the total monetary liability limit, another function around total monetary liability is a capability to trigger internal and external actions. One action is sending a message to an account owner or subscriber when the total monetary liability reaches the total monetary liability limit, and when the total monetary liability goes below the total monetary liability limit. That is, to inform an account owner that the account has reached a maximum allowed liability, so that the owner is aware that no more goods or services may be purchased until the owner takes some action (e.g. make a payment), and inform the owner that total monetary liability has been reduced below the total monetary liability limit, and that the account may now purchase goods and services.","The TML system can be used to trigger other internal and external actions as well. For example, when the total monetary liability reaches the total monetary liability limit, the merchant or source might want to trigger a credit watch on the account, or perform some sort of other specialized business process to the account. Additionally, in many applications such as telecommunication services, individual goods and services are turned on\/off for particular entities (e.g. accounts or subscribers) by configuring specific network elements to allow\/inhibit a particular entity from using a particular service, or purchasing a particular item. The total monetary liability reaching the total monetary liability limit could be used to trigger provisioning of these external network elements to deny authorization for an account, and all subscribers of the account. Similarly, when the total monetary liability is reduced from the total monetary liability limit (e.g. a payment is made), external network elements could be configured to allow usage for this account, and all subscribers of the account.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","900","905","930","935","945","955","965","990"]},"Customer\/consumer  purchases  goods and services . Before being able to make purchases or use any goods and services , customer\/consumer  sets up an account with a merchant or source, which specifies what goods and services may be purchased, prices for these goods and services , payment terms, and anything else needed to manage\/interact with customer\/consumer .","Account\/customer management system  is used to acquire and manage customers. Account\/customer management system  records all terms and conditions of an agreement between customer\/consumer  and merchant and controls and keeps records of all purchases and interactions with customer\/consumer . Account\/customer management system  is where account information of customer\/consumer  is stored, which not only includes the agreement with respect to the prices of goods and services , but also includes running totals of usage of the goods and services  by customer\/consumer  to date (kept in balances), and available credit.","Authorization\/pricing\/charging  controls what goods and service the account and associated customers are allowed to consume, based on the agreements between the merchant and the customer, as well as well as logic to price and charge each consumption. Whether or not the consumption is allowed, as well as the how it is priced and charged, is dependent on many factors, including agreements between customer\/consumer  and the merchant, current running totals, and total monetary liability of customer\/consumer . Also authorization\/pricing\/charging  supports real time authorization or authorization during usage by customer\/consumer , allowing for usage and services by the account and\/or customers in the account to be rejected or stopped as soon as the account and\/or customer reaches certain conditions (like exhausting available funds, reaching the account credit limit, etc.). For example, if the customer is purchasing phone service, and is paying one dollar per minute authorization\/pricing\/charging  can terminate the call mid-session as soon as the customer exhausts his available credit.","Account\/customer management system  passes  account information to authorization\/pricing\/charging , including current subscriptions and account balance values, so that authorization\/pricing\/charging  can determine if the usage should be allowed, and how to price and charge the usage. In turn, authorization\/pricing\/charging  passes back  records of the usage, including associated pricing and charging, allowing account\/customer management system  to record the usage, and update the balances accordingly.","Goods and services  are offered by the merchant, and consumed by customer\/consumer . Goods and services  could be simple transactions, like buying a can of soda, or more complex services, like purchasing telecommunications services, which includes monthly charges, as well as individual charges for each usage within the month. When a customer attempts to performs a usage action, goods and services  notifies  authorization\/pricing\/charging  of customer\/consumer  and what usage is being attempted, and is authorization\/pricing\/charging  ultimately responds to authorize\/deny the usage. If the usage is authorized, authorization\/pricing\/charging  also specifies for how long the usage is allowed (e.g. maximum number of bytes allowed in a data session, maximum duration of a phone call, etc.).","Billing  is a process by which the merchant sums up any unpaid charges, and presents the sum to the customer, with the expectation that the customer would respond with a payment. Billing  could add or remove charges. For example, billing  may add monthly recurring charges, or reduce charges by applying volume discounts or promotions. Any additional charges added or removed by billing , is reflected in the running totals kept in account\/customer management system , including total monetary liability. Account\/customer management system  passes  usage and other account-specific information to billing , so that billing  performs the proper billing action on the account. In turn, billing  passes back  information to account\/customer management system , including the invoice itself, as well as any new or adjusted charges. Account\/customer management system  keeps the information for historical purposes, and also adjusts any running balances based on new or adjusted charges from billing . Billing  may add or remove charges to the account. The additions or subtractions by billing  to the account are passed  to TML management system  so that the total monetary liability may be updated.","Payments  by customer\/consumer  to the merchant are typically based on bills\/invoices received. Any payments received are typically shown on the bills\/invoices, and reflected  in the total monetary liability of TML management system . When a payment  is made, the information of payment  is passed to TML Management system  so that total monetary liability may be updated. Customer\/consumer  can make payments  towards his accounts, via financial institutions like banks, credit\/debit cards, cash, or any other accepted payment method.","Payments  are recorded  in account\/customer management system  for historical purposes, so that this information can be viewed by customer\/consumer  on-demand, or as part of an invoice. Additionally, account\/customer management system  applies payment  towards the account, performing the appropriate accounting logic (E.g. updating A\/R balances), and update the account status according to prescribed business rules. For example, if the account was in arrears, causing the account to have limited or restricted usage, payment  may cause these restrictions\/limitations to be restricted. Similarly, account\/customer management system  rewards the account for payment , giving additional services or reduced process for existing services.","TML management system  includes a running total of an amount of money owed by the account or funds consumed by customer\/consumer  to the merchant or total monetary liability. Debits (e.g. charges) to the account increase the total monetary liability, while credits (e.g. payments) decrement the total monetary liability. The TML management system  includes updating of the total monetary liability based on credits and debits to the account.","Associated with each total monetary liability is a total monetary liability limit, which can be a value set by the merchant. When the account's total monetary liability reaches the total monetary liability limit, the account may be prohibited from accruing any additional charges until a payment is received to reduce the total monetary liability below the total monetary liability limit. The merchant may set the total monetary liability limit to a customer defined value, typically if the total monetary liability limit defined by the customer is less that a the total monetary liability limit that the merchant would impose.","Account\/customer management system  may control the total monetary liability limit, so the total monetary liability limit information is passed  to TML Management system . Additionally, account\/customer management system  may make financial adjustments to the account, such as refunding charges, correcting erroneous charges, and the like. This information is passed  to TML Management system  as well, again so the total monetary liability may be updated. The total monetary liability is passed  from TML Management system  to Account management, so that the total monetary liability can be presented to customer\/consumer .","Authorization\/pricing\/charging  uses the total monetary liability as part of an authorization process. The authorization process denies usage that will cause the total monetary liability to exceed the total monetary liability limit. Authorization\/pricing\/charging  passes  charging information related to usage to TML Management system , so that the total monetary liability can be updated with the usage charges.","Customer\/consumer  interacts  with account\/customer management system  to create and modify accounts, add\/remove services, get account history, get running balance and TML values, question charges, make complaints, and the like. Account\/customer management system  responds to customer\/consumer  requests, as well as initiating contact to customer\/consumer with information about promotions, low balance\/low credit warnings, and the like.
