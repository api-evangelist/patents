title: Dynamic prediction of road traffic conditions
abstract: Techniques are described for generating predictions of traffic conditions at one or more indicated times, such as by using probabilistic techniques to assess various input data while producing predictions for each of one or more road segments (e.g., in a real-time manner based on changing current conditions for a network of roads in a given geographic area). In some situations, one or more predictive Bayesian models and corresponding decision trees are automatically created for use in generating the traffic condition predictions for each geographic area of interest, such as based on observed historical traffic conditions for those geographic areas. Predicted traffic condition information may then optionally be used in a variety of ways to assist in travel and for other purposes, such as to plan optimal routes through a network of roads based on predictions about traffic conditions for the roads at multiple times.

No. 12\/897,621, filed Oct. 4, 2010 and entitled \u201cDynamic Time Series Prediction Of Future Traffic Conditions,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/897,621 is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/367,463, filed Mar. 3, 2006 and entitled \u201cDynamic Time Series Prediction of Future Traffic Conditions,\u201d now U.S. Pat. No. 7,813,870, which is also hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The following disclosure relates generally to techniques for predicting road traffic conditions, such as in a probabilistic manner based on current and past conditions, so as to improve travel over one or more roads.","As road traffic has continued to increase at rates greater than increases in road capacity, the effects of increasing traffic congestion have had growing deleterious effects on business and government operations and on personal well-being. Accordingly, efforts have been made to combat the increasing traffic congestion in various ways, such as by obtaining and providing information about current traffic conditions to individuals and organizations. One source for obtaining information about current traffic conditions in some larger metropolitan areas is networks of traffic sensors capable of measuring traffic flow for various roads in the area (e.g., via sensors embedded in the road pavement), and such current traffic condition information may be provided to interested parties in various ways (e.g., via frequent radio broadcasts, an Internet Web site that displays a map of a geographical area with color-coded information about current traffic congestion on some major roads in the geographical area, information sent to cellular telephones and other portable consumer devices, etc.). However, while such current traffic information provides some benefits in particular situations, a number of problems exist with such information.","Accordingly, limited attempts have been made to estimate and provide information about possible traffic conditions, but such attempts have typically suffered from inaccuracies in the estimates, as well as various other problems. For example, some efforts to provide information about possible traffic conditions have merely calculated and provided historical averages of accumulated data. While such historical averages may occasionally produce information for a particular place at a particular day and time that is temporarily similar to actual conditions, such historical averages cannot adapt to reflect specific current conditions that can greatly affect traffic (e.g., weather problems, traffic accidents, current road work, non-periodic events with large attendance, etc.), nor can they typically accommodate general changes over time in the amount of traffic, and thus such estimated information is typically inaccurate and of little practical use for planning purposes.","Techniques are described for generating predictions of traffic conditions that are likely or otherwise expected to occur at indicated times. In some embodiments, the predictions are generated using probabilistic techniques that incorporate various types of input data in order to produce predictions for each of numerous road segments, such as in a real-time manner based on changing current conditions for a network of roads in a given geographic area. Moreover, in at least some embodiments one or more predictive Bayesian or other models are automatically created for use in generating the traffic condition predictions for each geographic area of interest, such as based on observed historical traffic conditions for those geographic areas under varying other conditions at those times. Predicted traffic condition information may be used in a variety of ways to assist in travel and for other purposes, such as to plan optimal routes through a network of roads based on predictions about traffic conditions for the roads. In at least some embodiments, a predictive traffic information provider system uses the described techniques to generate such predictions, as described in greater detail below.","In some embodiments, the types of input data used to generate predictions of traffic conditions may include a variety of current and past conditions, and outputs from the prediction process include the generated predictions of the expected traffic conditions on each of multiple target road segments of interest for each of one or more indicated times (e.g., every 5, 15 or 60 minutes into the future, such as within a pre-determined future time interval like three hours or one day; at a current time for one or more road segments based at least in part on actual current or recent traffic information for other related road segments; etc.), as discussed in greater detail below. For example, types of input data may include the following: information about current and past amounts of traffic for various target road segments of interest in a geographic area, such as for a network of selected roads in the geographic area; information about current and recent traffic accidents; information about current and recent road work; information about current and past weather conditions (e.g., precipitation, temperature, wind direction, wind speed, etc.); information about at least some current and past scheduled events (e.g., type of event, expected start and end times of the event, and\/or a venue or other location of the event, etc., such as for all events, events of indicated types, events that are sufficiently large, such as to have expected attendance above an indicated threshold (for example, 1000 or 5000 expected attendees), etc.); and information about school schedules (e.g., whether school is in session and\/or the location of one or more schools). Moreover, actual and predicted traffic conditions may be measured and represented in one or more of a variety of ways, such as in absolute terms (e.g., average vehicle speed, volume of traffic for an indicated period of time; average occupancy time of one or more traffic sensors, such as to indicate the average percentage of time that a vehicle is over or otherwise activating the sensor; one of multiple enumerated levels of roadway congestion, such as measured based on one or more other traffic condition measures; etc.) and\/or in relative terms (e.g., to represent a difference from typical or from maximum). In addition, while in some embodiments the times at which traffic conditions are predicted are each points in time, in other embodiments such predictions may instead represent multiple time points (e.g., a period of time), such as by representing an average or other aggregate measure of the traffic conditions during those multiple time points. Furthermore, some or all of the input data may be known and represented with varying degrees of certainty, and additional information may be generated to represent degrees of confidence in and\/or other metadata for the generated predictions. In addition, the prediction of traffic conditions may be initiated for various reasons and at various times, such as in a periodic manner (e.g., every five minutes), when any or sufficient new input data is received, in response to a request from a user, etc.","Some of the same types of input data may be used to similarly generate longer-term forecasts of future traffic conditions (e.g., one week in the future, or one month in the future) in some embodiments, but such longer-term forecasts may not use some of the types of input data, such as information about some types of current conditions at the time of the forecast generation (e.g., current traffic, weather, or other conditions). In addition, such longer-term forecasts may be generated less frequently than shorter-term predictions, and may be made so as to reflect different time periods than for shorter-term predictions (e.g., for every hour rather than every 15 minutes).","The roads and\/or road segments for which traffic condition predictions and\/or forecasts are generated may also be selected in various manners in various embodiments. In some embodiments, traffic condition predictions and\/or forecasts are generated for each of multiple geographic areas (e.g., metropolitan areas), with each geographic area having a network of multiple inter-connected roads\u2014such geographic areas may be selected in various ways, such as based on areas in which current traffic condition information is readily available for at least some road segments (e.g., based on networks of road sensors for at least some of the roads in the area) and\/or in which traffic congestion is a significant problem. In some such embodiments, the roads for which traffic condition predictions and\/or forecasts are generated include those roads for which current traffic condition information is readily available, while in other embodiments the selection of such roads may be based at least in part on one or more other factors (e.g., based on size or capacity of the roads, such as to include freeways and major highways; based on the role the roads play in carrying traffic, such as to include arterial roads and collector roads that are primary alternatives to larger capacity roads such as freeways and major highways; based on functional class of the roads, such as is designated by the Federal Highway Administration; etc.). In other embodiments, traffic condition predictions and\/or forecasts may be made for a single road, regardless of its size and\/or inter-relationship with other roads. In addition, segments of roads for which traffic condition predictions and\/or forecasts are generated may be selected in various manners, such as to treat each road sensor as a distinct segment; to group multiple road sensors together for each road segment (e.g., to reduce the number of independent predictions and\/or forecasts that are made, such as by grouping specified numbers of road sensors together); to select road segments so as to reflect logically related sections of a road in which traffic conditions are typically the same or sufficiently similar (e.g., strongly correlated, such as above a correlation threshold), such as based on traffic condition information from traffic sensors and\/or from other sources (e.g., data generated from vehicles and\/or users that are traveling on the roads, as discussed in greater detail below); etc.","In addition, traffic condition prediction and\/or forecast information may be used in a variety of ways in various embodiments, as discussed in greater detail below, including to provide such information to users and\/or organizations at various times (e.g., in response to requests, by periodically sending the information, etc.) and in various ways (e.g., by transmitting the information to cellular telephones and\/or other portable consumer devices; by displaying information to users, such as via Web browsers and\/or application programs; by providing the information to other organizations and\/or entities that provide at least some of the information to users, such as third parties that perform the information providing after analyzing and\/or modifying the information; etc.). For example, in some embodiments, the prediction and\/or forecast information is used to determine suggested travel routes and\/or times, such as an optimal route between a starting location and an ending location over a network of roads and\/or an optimal time to perform indicated travel, with such determinations based on predicted and\/or forecast information at each of one or more times for one or more roads and\/or road segments.","For illustrative purposes, some embodiments are described below in which specific types of predictions are generated in specific ways using specific types of input, and in which generated prediction information is used in various specific ways. However, it will be understood that such traffic predictions may be generated in other manners and using other types of input data in other embodiments, that the described techniques can be used in a wide variety of other situations, that future traffic forecasts may similarly be generated and used in various ways, and that the invention is thus not limited to the exemplary details provided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["5","405","90","520"]},"In this example, an area of Interstate  east of Interstate  is divided into multiple road links L-L, which are grouped into 3 road segments S -, S -, and S -. For example, road link   is a bi-directional link that corresponds to both eastbound and westbound traffic, and thus is part of two road segments  that each correspond to one of the directions, with example road segment S corresponding to westbound traffic and including the westbound traffic of link L (as well as the westbound traffic of links L-L), and with example road segment S corresponding to eastbound traffic and including the eastbound traffic of link L (as well as the eastbound traffic of adjacent links L and L). For the purposes of this example, other road links may be part of a single bi-directional road segment, such as for road segments S -, S -, S - and S -. Road links and road segments may have various relationships in various embodiments, such as with several road segments that each correspond to multiple contiguous road links (e.g., road segment S and road links L-L, road segment S and road links L-L, road segment S and road links L-L, etc.), with road link L and road segment S corresponding to the same portion of road and with road link L and road segment S corresponding to the same portion of road, with road segment S corresponding to non-contiguous road links L and L, etc. For example, road links L and L may have similar traffic flow characteristics so as to be grouped together in one road segment, such as may be determined automatically or manually in particular embodiments. Also, for ease of illustration, only one link and\/or segment designator per physical road portion and direction is shown, but as noted in greater detail elsewhere, each lane or subsets of lanes may be assigned one or more unique link and\/or section designators in some embodiments. Similarly, each direction of traffic for a bi-directional road portion may be assigned one or more unique link and\/or section designators. In addition, while various road links are of differing lengths in this example embodiment, in other embodiments the road links may all be the same length.","Relationships between road links and road segments may be determined in various ways. For example, for the purposes of predicting road traffic conditions, different road segments may be related to each other in different manners in different situations. Consider a situation in which the morning commute along Interstate  is predominantly in a westbound direction into Seattle\u2014in that situation, road traffic on road segments S and S may be highly correlated, such that a knowledge of current road traffic conditions on one of those two road segments may be relevant in predicting current and\/or near-term future traffic conditions on the other road segment. However, in the same situation, road segments S may not be significantly related to road segments S or S, despite road segments S and S being adjacent, if there is not a high degree of correlation between the traffic on those road segments (e.g., if eastbound traffic on S predominantly turns north on Interstate , S and a corresponding road segment on northbound Interstate , not shown, may be highly correlated in that situation). Conversely, if the evening commute along Interstate  is predominantly in an eastbound direction away from Seattle, road segments S may be highly correlated with one or both of the road segments S and S in situation. In addition, in some situations, road segments may be highly correlated with respect to road traffic conditions despite not being adjacent or even part of the same road or directly connected. For example, road segments S and S in this example correspond to two primary alternatives for moving between the east and west sides of Lake Washington. As such, in some traffic situations (e.g., heavy traffic situations, such as when levels of congestion prevent free flow of traffic; situations in which tolls on one of the roads are above a defined threshold; etc.), road segments S and S may be highly correlated with respect to road traffic conditions, such that a knowledge of current road traffic conditions on one of those two road segments may be relevant in predicting current and\/or near-term future traffic conditions on the other road segment. Conversely, in other traffic situations (e.g., low traffic situations, such as when levels of congestion do not prevent free flow of traffic; situations in which tolls on one of the roads are not above a defined threshold; etc.), road segments S and S may not be highly correlated with respect to road traffic conditions, such that a knowledge of current road traffic conditions on one of those two road segments is not relevant in predicting current and\/or near-term future traffic conditions on the other road segment.","It will be appreciated that particular examples of related traffic segments and possible reasons for the relationships have been illustrated to enhance understanding. However, as described in greater detail herein, in at least some embodiments the determination of particular road segments that are sufficiently related for predictive purposes in particular situations are automatically determined based on statistical correlations or other statistical relationships.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-2H"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-2D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["202","202","202","202","202","202","202","202","202","1","1","202","202","1","1"],"i":["a","n ","a ","b ","c ","d ","e","n ","e","h","f ","m","n ","m "]},"Nodes -may each be used to represent the average or most common traffic conditions on a particular road segment at the present time or at some time in the past. These nodes are labeled SegmentXColorT\u2212Y in this example, where X refers to a particular road segment and \u2212Y refers to a time in the past (e.g., in minutes, or other unit of time measurement) at which a particular level of traffic congestion on that road segment has been identified (with the traffic congestion level represented here with its corresponding color), and with \u201cT\u201d corresponding to the current time. For example, node labeled SegmentColorT\u221260 may be used to represent the traffic conditions 60 minutes ago on road segment S, with the level of traffic congestion at that time being illustrated with the appropriate congestion color.","In some situations, current road traffic conditions information may be available for one or more of the road segments, but not for other road segments, such as with current road traffic conditions being available in this example for road segment S but not for road segments S, S or S. Such differences in the availability of current road traffic conditions information for different road segments may, for example, be based at least in part on the availability of functioning road sensors, such as to reflect one or more factors from a group including a particular road segment having road sensors or not, of the road sensors on a particular road segment be functioning or not, of the road sensors on a particular road segment being able to perform real-time or near-real-time reporting or not, etc. In addition, in at least some embodiments, differences in the availability of current road traffic conditions information for different road segments may be based at least in part on the availability of current road conditions data from one or more sources other than functioning road sensors, such as from mobile devices in vehicles that are currently or recently traveling along particular road segments and that have transmission capabilities to provide corresponding data samples in a real-time or near-real-time manner (e.g., within seconds or minutes of data sample acquisition, such as within 10 minutes or 15 minutes), but without having such current road conditions data for other particular road segments. Thus, in this example, road segment S may have road sensors that are functioning properly and able to provide real-time or near-real-time road traffic conditions information, while road segments S, S and S may not have such properly functioning road sensors with real-time or near-real-time reporting capabilities. Accordingly, the current traffic conditions information for road segment S may in some situations be available to be used to predict current traffic conditions information for one or more of road segments S, S and S, and\/or be available to be used to predict future traffic conditions information for road segments S and others (e.g., S, S and\/or S). A variety of other input variables may be used in other embodiments, such as to provide additional details related to various of the types of conditions shown or to represent other types of conditions, as discussed in greater detail below.","Nodes -in  represent output variables in the predictive model, and in particular correspond to predictions regarding traffic conditions that may be made given prior probabilities assigned to input nodes -and any current input information for those input nodes. Each output node -in this example is labeled SegmentXColorT+Y, where X refers to a particular road segment and +Y refers to a time for which a particular color corresponding to a level of traffic congestion on that road segment is predicted, and with \u201cT\u201d again corresponding to the current time. For example, optional node labeled SegmentColorT+30 may be used to represent the predicted traffic conditions on road segment S at 30 minutes in the future, while node labeled SegmentColorT may be used to represent the predicted traffic conditions on road segment S at the current time. In some embodiments, only one of future traffic conditions and current traffic conditions may be predicted. When future traffic conditions are predicted, traffic conditions for a given road segment may be predicted for a number of future times\u2014for example, optional nodes -represent the predicted traffic conditions on road segment S at some or all of 15-minute time intervals over a three hour-long time window into the future, although larger or smaller time windows and\/or more or less time intervals may be represented.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["210","212","212","214","214","214","214","214","214","214","0","214"],"i":["a ","b ","a","g ","a ","b ","c ","d ","e ","f ","g "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["220","222","222","202","222","222","204","224","1","2","224"],"i":["a","f ","a","n ","g","j ","a","g ","a ","b","g "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2D","FIG. 2C","FIG. 2D","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2D"],"b":["204","204","202","232","234","234","234","232","234","232","4","0","234","1","232","1","4","232","232"],"i":["b","d ","n ","a","m ","a","d","a","c ","a","m ","c ","i ","c ","i","a","d "]},"If a child node has multiple parent nodes, its probability is conditional on the probabilities of combinations of its multiple parent nodes. For example, output node has eleven parent nodes in this example, those being input nodes , , , , , , , , , and , which can be understood to mean that the probability of the output variable SegmentColorT represented by node is conditional on the prior probabilities of the input variable IsSchoolDay represented by node , the input variable CurrentTime represented by node , the input variable Precipitation represented by node , the input variable StadiumXEvtType represented by node , the input variable PercentBlackSegmentT\u221215 represented by node , the input variable PercentBlackSegmentT\u221230 represented by node , the input variable PercentBlackSegmentT\u221260 represented by node , the input variable SegmentColorT\u221215 represented by node , the input variable SegmentColorT\u221260 represented by node , the input variable SegmentColorT\u22120 represented by node , and the input variable BlackStartSegment represented by node . In this example, the output node representing the current traffic conditions on segment S is also dependent in part on the input variable SegmentColorT\u22120 represented by node , but the output node representing the current traffic conditions on segment S is not dependent on that input variable. Thus, in this example and situation, the current traffic conditions on segments S and S are predicted based in part on the actual current traffic conditions on segment S, while the prediction of the current traffic conditions on segment S is not based on the actual current traffic conditions on segment S.","Intuitively, the Bayesian network may be understood to represent correlated relationships, which in some cases may include causal relationships. For example, the illustrated Bayesian network expresses correlated relationships between input factors such as school schedules, stadium events, weather, and current and past traffic conditions (as represented by input nodes -) and predicted output traffic conditions on various road segments (as represented by output nodes -). As one specific example, the traffic conditions reported 60 minutes ago on road segment S and whether it is a school day may be among the factors that influence the current traffic conditions on road segment S, as depicted in  by way of arcs from each of node labeled IsSchoolDay and node labeled SegmentColorT\u221260 to node labeled SegmentColorT.","The structure and probability distributions of a Bayesian network such as that depicted in  may be generated from observation data via learning algorithms that determine the corresponding relationships and values, such as to determine a network structure that best matches the given observation data. In addition, at least some such learning algorithms can proceed with incomplete data (e.g., such as where some of the observation records are missing some data elements), and may further in some embodiments generate more complicated network structures (e.g., by identifying and representing one or more levels of intermediate nodes between the input nodes and output nodes, such as to reflect high-level relationships between groups of input nodes and\/or output nodes).

The server computing system and its executing systems may communicate with other computing systems via a network  (e.g., the Internet, one or more cellular telephone networks, etc.), such as various client devices , vehicle-based clients and\/or data sources , road traffic sensors , other data sources , and third-party computing systems . In particular, one or more of the predictive traffic information systems receives various information regarding current conditions and\/or previous observed case data from various sources, such as from the road traffic sensors, vehicle-based data sources and other data sources. The Predictive Traffic Information Provider system then uses the received data to generate traffic condition predictions for one or more indicated current and\/or future times, and provides the predicted information to one or more other recipients, such as the Route Selector system, one or more other predictive traffic information systems, client devices, vehicle-based clients, third-party computing systems, and\/or otherwise to users. If the Route Selector system is present and receives such information, it may optionally use the received predicted traffic condition information to generate route-related information, such as for frequently used routes and\/or upon request for indicated routes, and similarly may provide such route-related information to one or more other predictive traffic information systems, client devices, vehicle-based clients, and\/or third-party computing systems.","The client devices  may take various forms in various embodiments, and may generally include any communication devices and other computing devices capable of making requests to and\/or receiving information from the predictive traffic information systems. In some cases, the client devices may run interactive console applications (e.g., Web browsers) that users may utilize to make requests for traffic-related information based on predicted traffic information, while in other cases at least some such traffic-related information may be automatically sent to the client devices (e.g., as text messages, new Web pages, specialized program data updates, etc.) from one or more of the predictive traffic information systems.","The road traffic sensors  include multiple sensors that are installed in, at, or near various streets, highways, or other roadways, such as for one or more geographic areas. These sensors include loop sensors that are capable of measuring the number of vehicles passing above the sensor per unit time, vehicle speed, and\/or other data related to traffic flow. In addition, such sensors may include cameras, motion sensors, radar ranging devices, and other types of sensors that are located adjacent to or otherwise near a roadway. The road traffic sensors  may periodically or continuously provide measured data via wire-based or wireless-based data link to the Predictive Traffic Information Provider system  via the network  using one or more data exchange mechanisms (e.g., push, pull, polling, request-response, peer-to-peer, etc.). In addition, while not illustrated here, in some embodiments one or more aggregators of such road traffic sensor information (e.g., a governmental transportation body that operates the sensors) may instead obtain the raw data and make that data available to the predictive traffic information systems (whether in raw form or after it is processed).","The clients\/data sources  in this example may each be a mobile computing system or device that provides data to one or more of the predictive traffic information systems and\/or that receives data from one or more of those systems, such as for computing systems or devices located within vehicles. In some embodiments, the Predictive Traffic Information Provider system may utilize a distributed network of vehicle-based data sources that provide information related to current traffic conditions for use in traffic prediction. For example, each vehicle may include a GPS (\u201cGlobal Positioning System\u201d) device (e.g., a cellular telephone with GPS capabilities, a stand-alone GPS device, etc.) and\/or other geo-location device capable of determining the geographic location, speed, direction, and\/or other data related to the vehicle's travel, and one or more devices on the vehicle (whether the geo-location device(s) or a distinct communication device) may from time to time obtain such data and provide it to one or more of the predictive traffic information systems (e.g., by way of a wireless link)\u2014such vehicles may include a distributed network of individual users, fleets of vehicles (e.g., for delivery companies, transportation companies, governmental bodies or agencies, vehicles of a vehicle rental service, etc.), vehicles that belong to commercial networks providing related information (e.g., the OnStar service), a group of vehicles operated in order to obtain such traffic condition information (e.g., by traveling over predefined routes, or by traveling over roads as dynamically directed, such as to obtain information about roads of interest), etc. Moreover, in at least some embodiments other mobile data sources may similarly provide actual data based on travel on the roads, such as based on computing devices and other mobile devices of users who are traveling on the roads (e.g., users who are operators and\/or passengers of vehicles on the roads). In addition, such vehicle-based information may be generated in other manners in other embodiments, such as by cellular telephone networks, other wireless networks (e.g., a network of Wi-Fi hotspots) and\/or other external systems (e.g., detectors of vehicle transponders using RFID or other communication techniques, camera systems that can observe and identify license plates and\/or users' faces) that can detect and track information about vehicles passing by each of multiple transmitters\/receivers in the network.","Such generated vehicle-based travel-related information may then be used for a variety of purposes, such as to provide information similar to that of road sensors, but for road segments that do not have functioning road sensors (e.g., for roads that lack sensors, such as for geographic areas that do not have networks of road sensors and\/or for arterial roads that are not significantly large to have road sensors, for road sensors that are broken, etc.), to verify duplicative information that is received from road sensors or other sources, to identify road sensors that are providing inaccurate data (e.g., due to temporary or ongoing problems), etc. The wireless links may be provided by a variety of technologies known in the art, including satellite uplink, cellular network, WI-FI, packet radio, etc., although in at least some embodiments such information about road traffic conditions may be obtained from mobile devices (whether vehicle-based devices and\/or user devices) via physical download when the device reaches an appropriate docking or other connection point (e.g., to download information from a fleet vehicle once it has returned to its primary base of operations or other destination with appropriate equipment to perform the information download). In some cases, various factors may cause it to be advantageous for a mobile device to store multiple data samples that are acquired over a determined period of time (e.g., data samples taken at a pre-determined sampling rate, such as 30 seconds or a minute) and\/or until sufficient data samples are available (e.g., based on a total size of the data), and to then transmit the stored data samples together (or an aggregation of those samples) after the period of time\u2014for example, the cost structure of transmitting data from a vehicle-based data source via a particular wireless link (e.g., satellite uplink) may be such that transmissions occur only after determined intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes), one or more of the geo-location and\/or communication devices may be configured or designed to transmit at such intervals, an ability of a mobile device to transmit data over a wireless link may be temporarily lost (e.g., such as for a mobile device that typically transmits each data sample individually, such as every 30 seconds or 1 minute, and possibly due to factors such as a lack of wireless coverage in an area of the mobile device, other activities being performed by the mobile device or a user of the device, or a temporary problem with the mobile device or an associated transmitter) such that storage of data samples will allow later transmission or physical download, etc. For example, if a wireless transmission of up to 1000 units of information costs $0.25 cents, and each data sample is 50 units in size, it may be advantageous to sample every minute and send a data set comprising 20 samples every 20 minutes, rather than sending samples more frequently (e.g., every minute). Moreover, in some embodiments additional information may be generated and provided by a mobile device based on multiple stored data samples. For example, if a particular mobile device is able to acquire only information about a current instant position during each data sample, but is not able to acquire additional related information such as speed and\/or direction, such additional related information may be calculated or otherwise determined based on multiple subsequent data samples.","Alternatively, some or all of the clients\/data sources  may each have a computing system to obtain information from one or more of the predictive traffic information systems, such as for use by an occupant of a vehicle. For example, a vehicle may contain an in-dash navigation system with an installed Web browser or other console application that a user may utilize to make requests for traffic-related information via a wireless link from the Predictive Traffic Information Provider system or the Route Selector system, or instead such requests may be made from a portable device of a user (e.g., a smart phone) in the vehicle. In addition, one or more of the predictive traffic information systems may automatically transmit traffic-related information to such a vehicle-based client device (e.g., updated predicted traffic information and\/or updated route-related information) based upon the receipt or generation of updated information.","The other data sources  include a variety of types of other sources of data that may be utilized by one or more of the predictive traffic information systems to make predictions related to traffic flow and\/or to make selections of traffic routes. Such data sources include, but are not limited to, sources of current and past weather conditions, short and long term weather forecasts, school schedules and\/or calendars, event schedules and\/or calendars, traffic incident reports provided by human operators (e.g., first responders, law enforcement personnel, highway crews, news media, travelers, etc.), road work information, holiday schedules, etc.","The third-party computing systems  include one or more optional computing systems that are operated by parties other than the operator(s) of the predictive traffic information systems, such as parties who receive traffic-related data from one or more of the predictive traffic information systems and who make use of the data in some manner. For example, the third-party computing systems  may be systems that receive predicted traffic information from one or more of the predictive traffic information systems, and that provide related information (whether the received information or other information based on the received information) to users or others (e.g., via Web portals or subscription services). Alternatively, the third-party computing systems  may be operated by other types of parties, such as media organizations that gather and report predicted traffic condition and route information to their consumers, or online map companies that provide predicted traffic-related information to their users as part of travel-planning services.","In this illustrated embodiment, the Predictive Traffic Information Provider system  includes a Data Supplier component , a Traffic Prediction Model Generator component , and a Dynamic Traffic Predictor component . The Data Supplier component obtains current condition data that may be used by one or more of the other components or other predictive traffic information systems, such as from the data sources previously discussed, and makes the information available to the other components and predictive traffic information systems. In some embodiments, the Data Supplier component may optionally aggregate obtained data from a variety of data sources, and may further perform one or more of a variety of activities to prepare data for use, such as to place the data in a uniform format; to detect and possibly correct errors or missing data (e.g., due to sensor outages and\/or malfunctions, network outages, data provider outages, etc.); to filter out extraneous data, such as outliers; to discretize continuous data, such as to map real-valued numbers to enumerated possible values; to sub-sample discrete data (e.g., by mapping data in a given range of values to a smaller range of values); to group related data (e.g., a sequence of multiple traffic sensors located along a single segment of road that are aggregated in an indicated manner); etc. Information obtained by the Data Supplier component may be provided to other predictive traffic information systems and components in various ways, such as to notify others when new data is available, to provide the data upon request, and\/or to store the data in a manner that is accessible to others (e.g., in one or more databases on storage  or elsewhere, not shown).","In the illustrated embodiment, the Traffic Prediction Model Generator component uses obtained observation case data to generate predictive models used to make predictions about traffic conditions, as previously discussed. In some embodiments, the Traffic Prediction Model Generator component utilizes historical observation case data to automatically learn the structure of a Bayesian network for a given group of one or more roads, and further automatically learns multiple decision tree models that each may be used to make predictions of traffic flow on a particular road segment for a particular indicated time. The created predictive models may then be provided to other predictive traffic information systems and components in various ways, such as to notify others when the new models are available, to provide the models upon request, and\/or to store the models in a manner that is accessible to others (e.g., in one or more databases on storage  or elsewhere, not shown).","The Dynamic Traffic Predictor component utilizes the predictive models generated by the Traffic Prediction Model Generator component to generate predictions of traffic conditions for one or more indicated times, such as based on real-time and\/or other current condition information. Such predictions may be made at various times, such as periodically (e.g., every five or ten minutes), when new and\/or anomalous data (e.g., a traffic accident incident report) has been received, upon request, etc. The generated predicted traffic condition information may then be provided to other predictive traffic information systems and components and\/or to others in various ways, such as to notify others when new information is available, to provide the information upon request, and\/or to store the information in a manner that is accessible to others (e.g., in one or more databases on storage  or elsewhere, not shown).","If present, the optional Route Selector system  selects travel route information based on predicted traffic condition information, and provides such route information to others in various ways. In some embodiments, the Route Selector system receives a request from a client to provide information related to one or more travel routes between a starting and ending location in a given geographic area at a given date and\/or time. In response, the Route Selector system obtains predictions of road conditions for the specified area during the specified time period from, for example, the Predictive Traffic Information Provider system, and then utilizes the predicted road condition information to analyze various route options and to select one or more routes based on indicated criteria (e.g., shortest time). The selected route information may then be provided to other predictive traffic information systems and components and\/or to others in various ways, such as to notify others when information is available, to provide the information upon request, and\/or to store the information in a manner that is accessible to others (e.g., in one or more databases on storage  or elsewhere, not shown).","It will be appreciated that the illustrated computing systems are merely illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Computing system  may be connected to other devices that are not illustrated, including through one or more networks such as the Internet or via the Web. More generally, a \u201cclient\u201d or \u201cserver\u201d computing system or device, or predictive traffic information system and\/or component, may comprise any combination of hardware that can interact and perform the described types of functionality, optionally when programmed or otherwise configured with appropriate software instructions, including without limitation desktop or other computers, database servers, network storage devices and other network devices, PDAs, smart phones and other cell phones, wireless phones, pagers, electronic organizers, Internet appliances, television-based systems (e.g., using set-top boxes and\/or personal\/digital video recorders), and various other consumer products that include appropriate inter-communication capabilities. In addition, the functionality provided by the illustrated system components may in some embodiments be combined in fewer components or distributed in additional components. Similarly, in some embodiments the functionality of some of the illustrated components may not be provided and\/or other additional functionality may be available.

The system components and data structures may also in some embodiments be transmitted as generated data signals (e.g., as part of a carrier wave or other analog or digital propagated signal) on a variety of computer-readable transmission mediums, including wireless-based and wired\/cable-based mediums, and can take a variety of forms (e.g., as part of a single or multiplexed analog signal, or as multiple discrete digital packets or frames). Such computer program products may also take other forms in other embodiments.
