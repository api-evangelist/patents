title: Adjusting yield of a manufacturing process for energetic compounds through solubility modification
abstract: A method of adjusting the yield of a manufactured compound comprising primarily two energetic materials to yield a product comprising primarily one of the two energetic materials. Specifically, embodiments of the present invention provide a method of purifying a compound primarily comprising RDX and HMX to achieve a desired purity of RDX with an acceptable yield percentage. By adding sufficient acetonitrile (ACN) to the manufactured compound to dissolve it and form a solution; adding a pre-specified volume of water to the resultant solution and stirring sufficiently to precipitate at least the RDX; separating and drying the precipitate, a pre-specified purity and yield percentage of RDX may be obtained by varying the volume of water added. The process uses relatively environmentally benign recyclable solvents at ambient temperature and pressure reducing both environmental impact and energy costs.

This and related patents are available for licensing to qualified licensees. Please contact Bea Shahin at 217 373-7234.","Explosive compounds with reduced sensitivity characteristics are desirable to provide safe loading, packing and assembly operations, in particular for military applications. The two most widely used explosive compounds, Research Department Composition X (RDX) (1,3,5-Trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane, also known as cyclotrimethylene trinitramine) and High Molecular Weight RDX (HMX) (1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclooctane, also known as cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine), each have properties sought for modern munitions. Pure RDX is relatively insensitive and desirable for that characteristic while HMX is not. RDX may be produced several ways, the most common being the continuous Bachmann Process that involves reacting hexamine with nitric acid, ammonium nitrate, glacial acetic acid, and acetic anhydride. Bachmann et al., 71, 1842, (1979). The resultant product is filtered and re-crystallized to form RDX containing a typically acceptable 8-12% HMX. L. A. Nock and R. Doherty, 39& & 7 Exhibition, Baltimore, Md., 13-16 Apr. 2004. The sensitivity of the final product depends on the relative proportions of RDX and HMX, sensitivity generally increasing with increased HMX. HMX, along with solvent inclusions, is the main impurity causing increased sensitivity. Lionel Borne and Helmut Ritter, 31, 482, 2006. Thus, to increase RDX content and reduce sensitivity of the resultant RDX product, a better method is required to selectively eliminate HMX from the initially formed RDX\/HMX combination.","Attempts yielding marginal success in reducing the amount of HMX in the initial formulation of RDX included simple re-crystallization by freezing; selective adsorption of RDX or HMX on various sorbents (e.g., granular activated carbon (GAC), XAD\u2122 resins, alginates, and the like), membrane separation; and phase separation by adding a hydrophilic solvent.","A goal met by select embodiments of the present invention is purifying an initial product having about 90% RDX and about 10% HMX to a final product having greater than about 99% RDX depending on the desired yield percentage.","Select embodiments of the present invention provide a process for purifying RDX from an initial compound comprising RDX and impurities that include HMX. Select embodiments of the present invention, in particular, include a method of purifying a mixture of approximately 90% RDX and 10% HMX to obtain RDX with a purity approaching about 100%.","Select embodiments of the present invention employ phase separation to selectively separate (e.g., by precipitation from liquids) a compound from a homogenous system into two (or more) phases. By solubilizing impure (crude) RDX in a suitable solvent and phase separating the resultant intermediate product by adding water, a final RDX composition approaching about 100% purity may be obtained.","Select embodiments of the present invention add sufficient acetonitrile (ACN), CHCN, to a compound comprising RDX and HMX to dissolve the compound and form a solution of RDX and HMX in acetonitrile. Water is added to the solution to precipitate the RDX and the precipitate is then filtered and dried.","The phase separation occurs because of the difference in solubility of RDX and HMX in a \u201cgood solvent,\u201d such as ACN, and modification of the solubility of RDX in a solution formed from a good solvent and a \u201cpoor solvent\u201d (for an energetic compound such as RDX) such as water. That is, with select embodiments of the present invention, a good solvent is one that RDX is readily solubilized in and a \u201cpoor solvent\u201d is one that RDX is not readily solubilized in, e.g., water. In select embodiments of the present invention, the solubility of RDX is high in the good solvent, e.g., ACN, and the good solvent and poor solvent, e.g., water, are miscible so that separate liquid phases are not formed during phase separation. Preferably, the major impurity, in particular HMX, is more soluble in the poor solvent, e.g., water, than is RDX.","For select embodiments of the present invention, a first characteristic of a suitable good solvent is one that demonstrates a high solubility for each of the components of the RDX\/HMX compound. Further, a good solvent should also have a low vapor pressure under conditions used for phase separation, in particular, ambient atmospheric pressure and temperature (i.e., about 20\u00b0 C. to about 25\u00b0 C.), to reduce vaporization prior to separation. A solvent should also have good transport properties, such as diffusivity and viscosity. The above properties contribute to the kinetics of solubilization and evaporation, thereby facilitating thorough mixing of all components, including RDX, HMX and any other solvents that may be employed as well as the removal of solvents in the final stage. Finally, it is advantageous for candidate solvents to minimize airborne pollution and reduce hazards from handling while being relatively inexpensive. ACN, having a relatively low boiling point (81.6\u00b0 C.) and an enthalpy of vaporization of 31.3 kJ\/mol, meets requirements for a good solvent in that it readily dissolves both RDX and HMX, is miscible with the preferred poor solvent, water, and has a relatively low vapor pressure. ACN also possesses excellent transport properties with a high diffusivity and low viscosity. While other solvents, such as acetone, cyclohexanone or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), demonstrate suitable solubility characteristics, they do not possess all of the required characteristics, such as a suitable vapor pressure, above average toxicity, poor transport properties or cost.","The solubility of RDX and HMX in water and ACN was determined experimentally at ambient temperature and pressure as shown in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Solubility of RDX and HMX in water and ACN at 23\u00b0 C."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"SOLUBILITY (mg\/L)",{}]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"SOLVENT","RDX","HMX"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Water","45.87","3.49"]},{"entry":[{},"ACN","48,690","17,150"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Select embodiments of the present invention provide a method of altering a compound comprising primarily of a first and a second energetic material to adjust yield and concentration of the first energetic material in a final product resultant from employing the method.

The ACN solution was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an Acclaim E1 Explosive column (Dionex ICS-3000)) coupled to an ultraviolet detector (UVD170U). Analysis showed that the RDX\/HMX compound contained 91.6% RDX and 8.4% HMX. Water was added to seven 50 ml capped vials of the ACN solution in different volumes (25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250 ml). All water used in the examples was filtered and de-ionized. The seven vials were stirred for about 30 minutes on a magnetic stirrer. A precipitate was formed in each vial. The vials were kept at room temperature (23\u00b10.5\u00b0 C.) for about two hours. The precipitate was then separated by filtration using Whatman filter paper. The filtered precipitate was dried in air for about 48 hours and weighed. Next, a small amount of the precipitate was dissolved in ACN and analyzed for composition using the HPLC. The percent yield of precipitate and the concentration of RDX and HMX in the precipitate were determined for each of the seven vials with results summarized in Table 2. As can be seen, quite a loss in % Yield is taken in going from a 96.9% pure RDX at 91.6% yield to a 99.2% pure RDX at 72.7% yield and an even more significant loss in % Yield is taken in going from 99.2% pure RDX to 100% pure RDX at 42.4% yield.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"280pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Compositions and yields of purified RDX and HMX."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["ACN",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Solution","Water","Ratio of Water to","% Yield of","Feed solution","Precipitated solid"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["(ml)","(ml)","ACN Solution","precipitate*","% RDX","% HMX","% RDX","% HMX"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["50","25","0.5","42.4","91.6","8.4","100","0"]},{"entry":["50","50","1","72.7","91.6","8.4","99.2","0.8"]},{"entry":["50","75","1.5","91.6","91.6","8.4","96.9","3.1"]},{"entry":["50","100","2","98.8","91.6","8.4","93.1","6.9"]},{"entry":["50","150","3","98.7","91.6","8.4","92.6","7.4"]},{"entry":["50","200","4","100","91.6","8.4","91.4","8.6"]},{"entry":["50","250","5","100","91.6","8.4","91.4","8.6"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"*% Yield = [Weight of precipitate\/(Weight of RDX + HMX originally)] \u00d7 100."}]}}]}}},"Further, refer to , a line graph representing % Yield data from Table 2. As the volume of added water increased, the yield of the precipitate increased correspondingly with 100% yield obtained when the vial contents was mixed with 200 ml of water but the precipitate contained the same ratio of RDX and HMX as originally provided as can be seen most readily in the bar graph of  in which both the 200 and 250 mL additions of water achieved the same amount of HMX in the precipitate as in the original \u201cFeed\u201d compound. That is, the percent yield of RDX in the precipitate decreased and the percent of HMX increased as the volume of water increased above about a 1:1 ratio (50 mL) of water to ACN solution. Therefore, added water volumes of between about 50 ml and about 100 ml (1:1 to 2:1 ratio of water to ACN solution) would be chosen as an optimum range to achieve a relatively high % Yield (72.7-98.8) with a relatively high concentration (99.2-93.1, respectively) of RDX in the precipitate.

The % Yield of precipitate was 42.4%, containing 100% RDX, a figure equal to that of Example I (42.4%; 100%) with the same 0.5:1 \u201cdilution ratio\u201d and sample volume.","To 50 ml of a compound comprising primarily RDX and HMX in solution with ACN, 100 ml of water was added. The resultant \u201cdiluted ACN solution\u201d was stirred for about 30 minutes. Precipitate formation was observed. The resultant precipitate was separated by filtration and air dried. The total precipitate was analyzed for RDX and HMX content. The % Yield of precipitate was 98.8%, containing 93.1% RDX, a figure equal to that of Example I (98.8%; 93.1%) with the same 2:1 \u201cdilution ratio\u201d and sample volume.","These examples demonstrate that by varying the amount of water added to the ACN solution both the amount and purity of RDX precipitated may be controlled. Specifically, as more water is added above a ratio of about 0.5:1 of water to the ACN solution, the total yield of the precipitate increased while the purity of the RDX precipitate decreased. Thus, based on the above examples, a 1:1 ratio of water to the ACN solution may be a best compromise between yield and purity of RDX. If purity is preferred over yield then a smaller volume of water may be added to the volume of ACN solution, on the order of about 0.5:1 water:ACN solution. Alternatively, if a higher yield of RDX is preferred while still providing a purity of RDX of almost 97%, a volume of water may be added to the volume of stock solution used, on the order of about 1.5:1 (water:ACN solution).","In addition to the option of varying purity and yield of RDX provided by select embodiments of the present invention, e other advantages exist. For example, select embodiments of the present invention do not require modifications to the current industrial Bachmann Process, select embodiments of the present invention being an addition to an existing process. Further, simple relatively environmentally benign and inexpensive solvents suitable for recycling are used, such as acetonitrile and water. Since select embodiments of the present invention may be conducted at room temperature, energy requirements are also minimized.","The abstract of the disclosure is provided to comply with the rules requiring an abstract that will allow a searcher to quickly ascertain the subject matter of the technical disclosure of any patent issued from this disclosure. (37 CFR \u00a71.72(b)). Any advantages and benefits described may not apply to all embodiments of the invention.","While the invention has been described in terms of some of its embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modifications within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. For example, although the system is described in specific examples for modifying the yield and purity of a specific energetic, i.e., RDX, it may be used for any type of energetic compound that is included in a mixture in which one wishes to efficiently and cost effectively precipitate out a target energetic compound. Thus select embodiments of the present invention may be useful in such diverse applications as manufacturing, refining, re-cycling, remediating, improving operational safety, and the like. In the claims, means-plus-function clauses are intended to cover the structures described herein as performing the recited function and not only structural equivalents, but also equivalent structures. Thus, although a nail and a screw may not be structural equivalents in that a nail employs a cylindrical surface to secure wooden parts together, whereas a screw employs a helical surface, in the environment of fastening wooden parts, a nail and a screw may be equivalent structures. Thus, it is intended that all matter contained in the foregoing description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative rather than limiting, and the invention should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
