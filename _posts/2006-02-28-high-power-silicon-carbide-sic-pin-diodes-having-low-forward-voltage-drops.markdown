However, this invention should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the thickness of layers and regions are exaggerated for clarity. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.

As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises\u201d and\/or \u201ccomprising,\u201d when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and\/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and\/or groups thereof.","It will be understood that when an element such as a layer, region or substrate is referred to as being \u201con\u201d or extending \u201conto\u201d another element, it can be directly on or extend directly onto the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d or extending \u201cdirectly onto\u201d another element, there are no intervening elements present. It will also be understood that when an element is referred to as being \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201ccoupled\u201d to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly connected\u201d or \u201cdirectly coupled\u201d to another element, there are no intervening elements present. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout the specification.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.","Furthermore, relative terms, such as \u201clower\u201d or \u201cbottom\u201d and \u201cupper\u201d or \u201ctop,\u201d may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to another elements as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in the Figures is turned over, elements described as being on the \u201clower\u201d side of other elements would then be oriented on \u201cupper\u201d sides of the other elements. The exemplary term \u201clower\u201d, can therefore, encompass both an orientation of \u201clower\u201d and \u201cupper,\u201d depending of the particular orientation of the figure.

Thus, embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an etched region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have tapered, rounded or curved features. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.","Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and the present disclosure and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.","It will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art that references to a structure or feature that is disposed \u201cadjacent\u201d another feature may have portions that overlap or underlie the adjacent feature.","Silicon carbide power devices based on 4H polytype silicon carbide (4H\u2014SiC) according to some embodiments of the present invention have the potential to revolutionize the power semiconductor industry. Benefiting from an order of magnitude larger critical electric field than silicon (Si) and sufficiently high carrier mobility, 4H\u2014SiC power devices may be designed with thinner, heavier doped drift layers, which may enable high voltage capability with low conduction and switching losses. The advantages of SiC are discussed in a paper by Singh et al. (., vol. 49, p. 2054, 2002) the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Furthermore, the wide bandgap may enable high temperature operation well beyond the limits of conventional packaging. PiN diodes have been shown to operate at elevated temperatures up to 800 K as discussed in HIGH-TEMPERATURE (UP TO 773K) OPERATION OF 6-KV 4H-SIC JUNCTION DIODES to Levinshtein, et al. (Solid-State Electronics; July 2005, Vol. 49 Issue 7, pages 1228-1232, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety. 4H\u2014SiC Schottky diodes are supplanting Si in 300 V-1200 V applications. For even higher voltage applications, the rectifier of choice appears to be the 4H\u2014SiC PiN diode, which has been demonstrated to block up to 20 kV with low Vof 6 V as discussed in LATEST ADVANCES IN 4H-SIC PIN AND MOS POWER DEVICES by Das (, Washington, D.C., 2003, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety.","However, as discussed above, technological issues like effective edge termination, low resistivity p-type ohmic contacts, and forward voltage stability have historically hampered PiN diode development. Thus, some embodiments of the present invention provide from 6 kV to about 10 kV, up to 50 A, 4H\u2014SiC PiN diodes that may not experience the problems of existing SiC PiN diodes. In particular, high power 10 kV, up to 50 A, SiC PiN diodes having a low forward voltage drop (V) of 3.75 V and a fast reverse recovery time of 150 nsec are provided according to some embodiments of the present invention.","Furthermore, SiC PiN diodes according to some embodiments of the present invention may not experience the historical problems with the SiC PiN diode technology, such as ineffective edge termination (Vincreased to >70% of ideal breakdown voltage), poor ohmic contacts to p-type SiC (\u03c1reduced to <10\u03a9cm), and forward voltage drift (\u0394Vreduced to <0.1 V). Some embodiments of the present invention have addressed these issues with design, material, and process improvements which have resulted in high overall device yields according to some embodiments of the present invention as will be discussed further below with respect to .","Exemplary devices according to some embodiments of the present invention are schematically illustrated in . However, embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular exemplary embodiments described herein but may include any suitable structure that provides PiN Diode characteristics as described herein.","Referring first to , a cross section of PiN diodes, for example, a 10 kV, 4H\u2014SiC PiN diode, according to some embodiments of the present invention will be discussed. As illustrated in , a substrate  is provided on which PiN Diodes according to some embodiments of the present invention may be formed. In particular embodiments of the present invention, the substrate  may be a conducting n-type silicon carbide (SiC) substrate that may be, for example, 4H polytype of silicon carbide. The substrate  may have a resistivity of from about 0.017 to about 0.022. An n-type drift layer  is provided on the substrate . The n-type drift layer may have a thickness of about 100 \u03bcm and a carrier concentration of about 2\u00d710cm. A p-type anode injection layer  is provided on the drift layer . The p-type anode injection layer  may have a thickness of about 2.5 \u03bcm and a carrier concentration of about 8\u00d710cm. The p-type anode injection layer  may be doped with aluminum (Al). The p-type anode injection layer  may have first and second portions. A first portion may be a p layer having a carrier concentration of about 8\u00d710cm. A second layer may be provided on the first layer. The second layer may be a p layer having a carrier concentration of 5\u00d710cm.","The n-type drift layer  and the p-type anode injection layer  may be epitaxial layers that are continuously grown on the substrate, for example, a 0.6 cmmicropipe density 8\u00b0 off-axis (0001) 4HN 3 inch substrate . The epitaxial layers may be fabricated using, for example, the process described in United States Patent Publication No. US 2005\/0064723 to Sumakeris, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth in its entirety. Other low BPD epitaxial processes discussed in, for example, a paper by Sumakeris et al. (457-460, 1113 (2004)) and Sumakeris et al. (2005, Pittsburgh, Pa. (2005)) the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The device is mesa isolated by etching down to the n drift layer  in the field areas using, for example, a reactive ion etch (RIE). Mesa areas for each diode design were based on a designed current density of 100 A\/cmfor 2 A, 5 A, and 50 A diodes, or 142 A\/cm2 for 25 A diodes, with mesas measuring 1.46 mm\u00d71.46 mm (2 A), 1.46 mm\u00d73.51 mm (5 A), 4.21 mm\u00d74.21 mm (25 A), and 7.08 mm\u00d77.08 mm (50 A).","It will be understood that the mesa sizes discussed herein are provided for exemplary purposes and embodiments of the present invention are not limited to this configuration. For example, the mesa sizes discussed above may only correspond to 6 kV diodes according to some embodiments of the present invention. It will be further understood that mesa sizes may vary slightly for different blocking thicknesses. Thus, for example, a mesa for a 50 A\/10 kV diode may have slightly different dimensions than a mesa for a 50 A\/6 kV diode.","An aluminium (Al) implanted guard ring-based termination  is provided\/formed around the device periphery while a nitrogen (N) implanted channel stop regions  ground the field area away from the devices. The implants are activated with a 1600-1650\u00b0 C. Argon (Ar) anneal in the presence of silicon (Si) overpressure.","In some embodiments of the present invention, a junction termination extension (JTE) technique may be used as discussed in ----by Trantraporn et al. (, Vol. ED-34, No. 10, OCTOBER 1987), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety.","A passivation layer  is provided on the surface of the device. The passivation layer  may be formed using a two step passivation process. A first portion of the passivation layer  is thermally grown to a thickness of from about 600 \u212b to about 700 \u212b. A second portion of the passivation layer  may be provided on the first portion. The second portion may be deposited on the first portion using, for example, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process at a temperature of about 410\u00b0 C. The second portion may have a thickness of about 1 \u03bcm. The passivation layer  may include silicon dioxide (SiO) and\/or polymide. An ohmic contact  including, for example, titanium\/aluminium (Ti\u2014Al) is provided on the anode injection layer . An ohmic contact  including, for example, nickel (Ni) is provided on the cathode. The contacts were annealed at 1000\u00b0 C. in Ar. As used herein the term \u201cohmic contact\u201d refers to contacts where an impedance associated therewith is substantially given by the relationship of Impedance=V\/I, where V is a voltage across the contact and I is the current, at substantially all expected operating frequencies (i.e., the impedance associated with the ohmic contact is substantially the same at all operating frequencies) and currents. Gold (Au) overlayers  and  are provided on the ohmic contacts  and , respectively, to aid in current spreading and\/or die attach. In other words, sintered Ti\u2014Al and Ni contacts  and  are made to the anode and cathode, respectively, before depositing thick Au overlayers  and .","PiN Diodes according to some embodiments of the present invention, for example, 50 A PiN diodes, may be provided on 8.7 mm\u00d78.7 mm chips, which have a 0.50 cmactive area. In some embodiments of the present invention, a total of 48 chips can be fabricated on a single 3 inch wafer as illustrated, for example, in . In particular,  illustrates completed wafers with, from left to right, 2 A and 5 A diodes (combined on one wafer), 25 A diodes, and 50 A diodes.","Referring now to , a graph illustrating Reverse Voltage (\u2212V) vs. Diode Leakage Current (A) of a 50 A diode (8.7 mm\u00d78.7 mm) and a 0.78 A diode according to some embodiments of the present invention will be discussed.  illustrates the reverse blocking capability of a typical PiN diode. Reverse blocking is measured out to 9 kV where the leakage current exceeds the current compliance limit of the measurement apparatus. Extrapolating the leakage current to 10 kV a low leakage current density of approximately 1 mA\/cm(based on a device footprint of 0.615 cm) is estimated. The validity of this extrapolation is contingent on the absence of avalanching prior to 10 kV. Reverse operation of small 0.78 A diodes confirm full 10 kV blocking capability without any premature avalanche as illustrated in . Hence, a 10 kV blocking capability is implied for the large devices blocking, such as greater than 7 kV. As illustrated in , the large diode demonstrates greater than 9 kV blocking that is current compliance limited. The dashed line extrapolates the reverse blocking to 10 kV with only 1 mA\/cm. The small diode confirms 10 kV capability.","Referring now to , pulsed forward I-V characteristic of a large 10 kV diode with a 3.75 V forward drop at 50 A and 5.9 V forward drop at 328 A indicating a high level of conductivity modulation. As illustrated in , a low forward voltage drop of 3.75 V is observed at 50 A (100 A\/cm) indicating a high degree of conductivity modulation. 4H\u2014SiC PiN diodes are capable of handling very high current densities and we have measured this large device out to a pulsed current of 328 A (656 A\/cm) at a low forward drop of 5.9 V. For a single chip, this demonstrates over 3 MW of pulsed power. As illustrated in , these devices also show excellent forward characteristics with respect to temperature.","Referring now to , forward I-V curve measured at several temperatures on a small 10 kV device where a positive temperature coefficient at high current density facilitates device paralleling. The differential resistance at low current density remains constant versus temperature because the increase in carrier lifetime is balanced by the reduction in carrier mobility and diffusivity. The Vat low current densities decreases slightly with temperature due to bandgap narrowing effects that reduce the built-in potential. This introduces a concern for thermal runaway. However, at high current densities, the behavior reverses to a positive temperature coefficient, thereby making these devices attractive for use in a parallel configuration.","Referring now to , a graph illustrating a dI\/dt reverse recovery transient showing fast turn-off with very little reverse recovery charge for a 10 kV, 20 A device, even at elevated temperatures according to some embodiments of the present invention will be discussed. Large dI\/dt reverse recovery transient showed fast turn-off with very little reverse recovery charge for a 10 kV, 20 A device, even at elevated temperatures. One potential drawback of a well modulated PiN diode is that the switching ability may suffer, especially the turn-off transient, due to the extra time needed for carrier removal in the drift layer. As illustrated in , the reverse recovery of the 10 kV diodes shows a fast 150 nsec recovery at room temperature with very little reverse recovery charge despite an aggressive dI\/dt of 330 A\/\u03bcsec. At elevated temperatures, the high speed switching capability remains intact with very minimal charge increase and a 300 nsec recovery time.","To be a commercially viable product, stable device performance should be demonstrated across the entire wafer. Historically, the 4H\u2014SiC PiN diodes have suffered from forward voltage instability, where the Vmay increase by several volts during forward operation as discussed in H. Lendenmann et al. (, Vol. 389-393 p. 1259, 2002), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety. As discussed in Sumakeris, et al. (, vol. 457-460, p. 1113, 2004), under forward bias, bipolar current flow in the \u201ci\u201d layer causes electron-hole recombination; the recombination provides energy to the lattice allowing basal plane screw dislocations (BPD) to generate stacking faults; the stacking fault becomes negatively charged by trapping electrons; electron injection is attenuated at the cathode with a corresponding reduction of hole injection at the anode; the area under the fault becomes devoid of plasma thereby reducing the effective current handling area of the device; and a larger amount of forward bias is now needed to maintain the same forward current level.","Hence, the key to producing drift-free PiN structures is the reduction of BPDs. Typically, the areal density of BPDs in the substrate is \u02dc2000 cmof which 90% can be turned into relatively benign threading edge dislocations in epitaxy. Recent innovations have reduced the epilayer BPD density below 10 cmas discussed in Sumakeris, et al. (, vol. 457-460, p. 1113, 2004) such that the devices have become fairly well behaved as illustrated in . Devices can now be effectively screened for their Vstability by a simple on-wafer 30 min constant current stress at 50 A\/cmas discussed in B. A. Hull et al. (., vol. 34, no. 4, 2005), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety.","Referring now to , graphs of number of devices vs. forward voltage drift (mV) for two different types of epitaxy according to some embodiments of the present invention will be discussed.
