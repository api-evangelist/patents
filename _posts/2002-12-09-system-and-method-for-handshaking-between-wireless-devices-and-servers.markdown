{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["I. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to computer device networks and communications. More particularly, the invention relates to computer device interface protocols and data transfer upon bridging an initial communication connection, and during ongoing communication between computer devices on a wireless network.","II. Description of the Related Art","Wireless devices, such as cellular telephones, communicate packets including voice and data over a wireless network. In existing wireless networks, upon the initial contact between two computer devices on the wireless network, the devices will exchange a summary of information, which is called \u201chandshaking.\u201d The handshaking process allows the computer devices to initially synchronize the data pathway and pass any relevant data necessary to maintain a satisfactory connection between the devices. Computer devices can also engage in handshaking activities after an initial contact has been bridged, while communication is ongoing, in order to maintain the satisfactory connection.","In an analog or digital wireless cellular network, there is an initial handshaking session between the cellular device and the base station. Typically, when the device is turned on, the mobile switch determines the identify of the device, such as through a mobile identification number (MIN), and what cell will carry any transmission from that device and assigns a vacant channel within that cell to take any voice or data transmission from the device. Rudimentary data may also be exchanged at the initial log in of the cellular device, such as device model identification. Ongoing data exchange also occurs in the cellular network, but typically to solely manage \u201chandoffs,\u201d or motion of the device physically from cell to cell. The base station serving an ongoing communication sends a hand-off request to the mobile switch after the signal of the device drops below a handover threshold.","With complex devices, the data necessary for exchange at the time of initial device contact can be considerable in order to establish robust communication. Further, if increasingly complex activities are undertaken during the communication, such as data or application transfer, a significant handshaking communication at such time could disrupt or sever the existing communication connection. Accordingly, it is to an improved system of handshaking between computer devices across a wireless network that the present invention is primarily directed.","The present invention is a system, method, and computer program for data communication, or \u201chandshaking,\u201d between wireless devices and a server, such as an application download server, on a wireless network. Upon the wireless device communicating with the application download server, the server obtains data from the wireless device indicative of wireless device attributes during the \u201chandshaking session\u201d and determines access to applications based upon the wireless device attributes. The applications can be resident on either that server or on another computer device on the wireless network.","The system of interfacing includes one or more wireless devices in selective communication with the wireless network with each wireless device has attributes thereof and a computer platform for selectively executing computer programs thereupon, and each wireless device further has an end-user who can selectively access the computer platform, and one or more application download servers in selective communication to the wireless network with each application download server having at least one resident application and selectively downloading applications to the wireless device(s). Once the wireless device initially communicates with the application download server across the wireless network, the application download server obtains data from the wireless device indicative of wireless device attributes to determine the access of the wireless device to applications resident on, or controlled by, the application download server, such as computer programs, graphics, menus and the like.","The method of communication between a wireless device and an application download server on a wireless network particularly includes the steps of communicating from the wireless device to a server across a wireless network, obtaining data from the wireless device indicative of wireless device attributes, and determining access of the wireless device to applications resident on, or controlled by, the application download server based upon the wireless device attributes. The step of obtaining the data from the wireless device can be receiving the wireless device attributes at the application download server where the application desired downloaded by the wireless device is resident. Further, the step of obtaining data from the wireless device can occur at the initial contact of the application download server by the wireless device, or at an application download attempt by the wireless device during an ongoing communication.","The present invention thus allows the data communication necessary between a complex wireless device and application download server to govern device access to applications available across the wireless network. Through the transmission of attribute data, such as hardware and software capabilities and subscriber identity, the risk of the device accessing unusable or inappropriate software is minimized. Further, if increasingly complex activities are undertaken during the communication between the wireless device and server, a further non-intrusive handshaking can occur to maintain access control without disrupting the extant connection.","Other objects, advantages, and features of the present invention will become apparent after review of the hereinafter set forth Brief Description of the Drawings, Detailed Description of the Invention, and the Claims.","With reference to the figures in which like numerals represent like elements throughout,  illustrates one embodiment of the present inventive system  for handshaking between one or more wireless devices, such as cellular telephone , in communication across a wireless network  with at least one application download server  that selectively downloads software applications or other data to the wireless devices across a wireless communication portal or other data access to the wireless network . As shown here, the wireless device can be a cellular telephone , with a graphics display , a personal digital assistant , a pager  with a graphics display, which is shown here as a two-way text pager, or even a separate computer platform  that has a wireless communication portal, and may otherwise have a wired connection  to a network or the Internet. The system  can thus be performed on any form of remote computer module including a wireless communication portal, including without limitation, wireless modems, PCMCIA cards, access terminals, personal computers, access terminals, telephones without a display or keypad, or any combination or sub-combination thereof. As used herein, the term \u201capplication\u201d is intended to encompass executable and nonexecutable software files, raw data, aggregated data, patches, graphics, menus, and other code segments. The application or code segments can reside, run, and\/or be utilized on the wireless device ,,, as \u201cclient\u201d software, or can be web-based or distributed applications instead of client-based applications.","In the system , one or more wireless devices ,,, are in selective communication with the wireless network , each has and end-user thereof that typically controls the communication connection to the wireless network , and the end-user will attempt to download an application or data from an application download server  across the wireless network. The application download server  typically has at least one resident application, and selectively communicates with the one or more wireless devices ,,, through the network (such as a cellular network shown in ) and selectively downloads the applications thereto. The server  can also control access of the wireless devices ,,, to applications resident on other data stores, such as database , second application download server , or stand-alone server . The system  facilitates the application download process through the application download server  obtaining data from the wireless device ,,, indicative of wireless device attributes and then determining access of the wireless device to applications accessible through the application download server  based upon those wireless device attributes. The handshaking can convey device attributes at initial contact, or upon the wireless device ,,, attempting to access an application during an ongoing communication.","The system  therefore addresses the desire for end-users to be able to run applications on their wireless devices, such as 3G mobile phones, other than the applications that the phones are manufactured with. The system  filters the available applications to the wireless device ,,, to occur transparently, i.e. without end-user knowledge\/awareness. For example, a wireless device ,,, can be manufactured with an address book that is not very user friendly and\/or does not synchronize with the address book that the person uses on a separate personal computer. The end-user consequently would desire to download another address book that is more user-friendly, and that has the synchronization capabilities desired. Other examples of programs are games, mapping applications (position location applications), and \u201cBluetooth\u201d remote controls. As the end-user can be charged for airtime to download an application, the end-user desires a method of determining prior to application download whether that application will actually run on that end-users wireless device ,,,. Without a method of such determination prior to application download, the end-user might pay for airtime to download an unusable application. Furthermore, if the end-user cannot ascertain why an application will not run, the end-user can become frustrated, which will generate customer service calls. Thus, when the end-user attempts to download an application over a data interface, handshaking is used to determine the capabilities of the wireless device prior to allowing an actual download to occur. If, and only if, the handshaking yields that the wireless device ,,, supports all the needs of the application will the application be downloaded. Moreover, other results can occur instead of a refusal to download, such as multiple levels of results, e.g. \u201cnot possible,\u201d \u201cpossible,\u201d \u201cnot recommended,\u201d and \u201cadditional recommendations.\u201d","The one or more application download servers , such as application download server , that provide the applications to the wireless devices ,,, are shown here on a local server-side network  with other computer elements in communication with the wireless network . A stored application database  can contain software applications and data that are accessible and downloadable to be executable on the wireless devices ,,,, either directly or through application download server . There is also shown a stand-alone server , a second application download server  which can provide applications, along with other functionality, to the wireless devices ,,,. All of the components can work in tandem to provide application access as is further herein described. However, it should be noted that all server-side functions can also be performed on one server, such as application download server . Further, any computer or server-side computer platform can provide separate services and processes to the wireless devices ,,, across the wireless network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["14","10","14","12","18","20","22","14","40","42","42","42","44","46"]},"The routers  communicate with a carrier network  through a data link, such as the Internet, a secure LAN, WAN, or other network. The carrier network  controls messages (generally in the form of data packets) sent to a messaging service controller (\u201cMSC\u201d) . The carrier network  communicates with the MSC  by a network, the Internet and\/or POTS (\u201cplain ordinary telephone system\u201d). Typically, the network or Internet connection between the carrier network  and the MSC  transfers data, and the POTS transfers voice information. The MSC  is connected to multiple base stations (\u201cBTS\u201d) . In a similar manner to the carrier network, the MSC  is typically connected to the BTS  by both the network and\/or Internet for data transfer and POTS for voice information. The BTS  ultimately broadcasts messages wirelessly to the wireless devices, such as cellular telephone , by short messaging service (\u201cSMS\u201d), or other over-the-air methods known in the art.","With reference to , there is shown a block diagram of wireless device computer platform  that can receive and execute one or more software applications in an application layer , wherein the applications are transmitted from the application download server . The computer platform  includes, among other components, an application-specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d) , or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, programmable gate array, or other data processing device. The ASIC  is installed at the time of manufacture of the wireless device and is not normally upgradeable. The ASIC  or other processor executes an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) layer  that interfaces with the device operating layer  that supports the execution of any resident programs in the memory of the wireless device ,,,. The memory can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EPROM, EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform  also is in communication with a local database that can hold the software applications not actively used in memory, such as the software applications downloaded from the application download server . The local database is typically comprised of one or more flash memory cells, but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EPROM, EEPROM, optical media, tape, or soft or hard disk. The OS layer  is embodied as interfacing with the application download server  through a HTTP\/SSL and TCP\/IP exchange that will occur through the carrier network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["16","68","12","16","10","16","74","76","16","76","68","78","70","12","18","20","22","40"]},"In operation, when an application is selected to be downloaded either through an initial handshake or a handshake at the time of the download attempt between the wireless device ,,, and application download server , in which information concerning the needs of the application are compared with the available capabilities of the wireless device. In one embodiment, the application download server  contains an information file that states the requirements of the application, such as features or classes required by the application. For instance, a mapping application may require access to the classes of position and location for querying the device for its current latitude and longitude, display parameters for drawing bitmaps on the display of the device, menu capabilities for creating pull-down menus, end-user input capabilities, and networking capabilities such as TCP\/IP connections. Another example of an attribute is access to third party libraries. In the mapping application example, access to a third party library of maps can be necessary in order to properly use the mapping program. The information file can also contain the specific file system and RAM storage needs as well. For instance, a particular information file might state that an application is 100K in size, and thus the wireless device must have 100K of file system space to store the download and 100K of RAM to load the application into at runtime. The information file can also contain other hardware needs, such as the number of colors needing on the display, screen dimensions, processor speed, or any other criteria that can impact successful application download and execution.","In one embodiment, the handshake has the contents of the information file transmitted from the application download server  to the wireless device ,,,. In such embodiment the wireless device determines whether or not it supports all the requirements outlined in the information file. If the wireless device ,,, would allow support of these features of the application, then the download of the application commences after the handshake. Otherwise, if the required features are not all supported, the display of a message indicating to the end-user that the application cannot be downloaded because the wireless device does not meet a particular requirement. Such a message can be generated autonomously by the wireless device ,,, or the message can be retrieved from a server, such as second server , or another server on the wireless network . If embodied wherein such an error message is sent from a server ,,, the network carrier can customize the messages for customer care purposes.","It should also be noted that extra steps can occur on the wireless device ,,, to remedy the reason that the application cannot be downloaded. For example, if the only reason for download failure is that certain software classes or libraries are not resident on the wireless device platform  necessary to support the application, then the wireless device ,,, can attempt to download those classes or libraries rather than immediately issuing a message that the download failed. If the download of those classes\/libraries succeed, then the application can subsequently be downloaded.","In another embodiment, rather than the information file being transmitted from the application download server  to the wireless device ,,,, the wireless device transmits to the application download server  that wireless device's attributes. As an example, the wireless device transmits to the application download server that it has 400K of RAM available, 1 MB of flash available, a 60\u00d775 screen with 8 bit color display, and that it has the Network Class\u2014the Bluetooth class. In such a case, the application is downloaded only if the application download server  determines that the wireless device ,,, supports everything that the application requires. Otherwise, the application download server  can return an error to the wireless device regarding the attempted download.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["16","12","16","12","18","20","22","80","82","16","12","18","20","22","84","86","80","12","18","20","22","84","90","16","12","18","20","22","84","16","10"]},"Once the wireless device attributes are obtained, a determination is made as to whether the wireless device can access the requested application, as shown at decision . If the wireless device cannot access the application for some reason, such as inadequate hardware or software capability, then an error is returned to the end-user as shown at step  and the process otherwise return to await a further connection attempt from a wireless device at step . If the wireless device ,,, is able to download the application, then the requested application is provided to the wireless device as shown at step  and then a determination is made as to whether the end-user has requested access to a new application, as shown at decision . If the end-user has not requested a new application, the process enters a wait state at decision  relative to the specific thread of interaction with the wireless device. Otherwise, if the end-user has requested another application, the process iterates to step  and treats the request like a new connection attempt.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["12","18","20","22","16","102","14","16","104","114","104","106","108"]},"If the end-user has not given permission for attribute access at decision , then an error is returned to the end-user indicating the inability to access the requested application, as shown at step , and the process execution thread terminates. Otherwise, if the end-user has given permission to access the attributes, the attributes are sent to the application download server , as shown at step . Step  is only one embodiment of the process, and the wireless device ,,, does not have to send its attributes, via file or other data, to the application download server , but can simply provide access to the attributes to an agent of the server, make the attributes searchable, or through any other data gathering method known in the art. After the attributes have been sent at step , a determination is made as to whether the wireless device has accessed the requested application, as shown at decision , and if not, an error is returned to the end-user at step , and the application access thread terminates. Otherwise, if the access has been granted at decision , then the process thread simply terminates on the wireless device ,,,. The process will begin again at step  upon the end-user desiring to access another application across the network.","The system  accordingly provides a method of communication between a wireless device ,,, and an application download server  on a wireless network  including the steps of communicating from a wireless device ,,, to an application download server  across a wireless network , wherein the wireless device having attributes thereof and a computer platform  for selectively executing computer programs thereupon, and the wireless device further having an end-user who can selectively access the computer platform , and the application download server  having at least one downloadable application resident thereupon. The method further includes the step of obtaining data from the wireless device ,,, indicative of wireless device attributes, and then determining access of the wireless device ,,, to applications accessible through the application download server  based upon the wireless device attributes. The step of obtaining data from the wireless device ,,, can be obtaining attributes of the wireless device that include data relative to the computer platform  and\/or software resident on the wireless device computer platform .","The step of obtaining the data from the wireless device ,,, can be receiving the wireless device attributes at the application download server  where the application desired downloaded by the wireless device ,,, is resident. The step of obtaining data from the wireless device ,,, can occur at the initial contact of the application download server  by the wireless device, or alternately, can occur at an application download attempt by the wireless device. The method can also further include the steps of, at the application download attempt, prompting the end-user of the wireless device ,,, to request access to wireless device attributes, and upon grant of end-user permission, transmitting wireless device attributes to the application download server .","If the system  is so embodied, the method can further include the steps of transmitting the requirements for a requested application to be downloaded to the wireless device ,,,, and indicating if the download is possible based upon the requirements received. Alternately, the method can include the step of transmitting the requirements for a requested application to be downloaded to the wireless device ,,, can be transmitting the requirements from the application download server  where the application is resident, and then the step of indicating if the download is possible is transmitting data from the wireless device ,,, to the application download server  to indicate if the download is possible.","Upon failure of a download by the wireless device ,,,, the method can include the step of notifying the end-user of the download failure.","In view of the method being executable on the computer platform of a wireless device ,,,, the present invention includes a program resident in a computer readable medium, where the program directs a server or other computer device having a computer platform to perform the steps of the method. The computer readable medium can be the memory of the application download server , or can be in a connective database, such as database . Further, the computer readable medium can be in a secondary storage media that is loadable onto a wireless device computer platform, such as a magnetic disk or tape, optical disk, hard disk, flash memory, or other storage media as is known in the art.","In the context of , the method may be implemented, for example, by operating portion(s) of the wireless network  to execute a sequence of machine-readable instructions, such as wireless device computer platform , the application download server , and stand-alone server .
