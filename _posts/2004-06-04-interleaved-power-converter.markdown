title: Interleaved power converter
abstract: A power converter architecture interleaves full bridge converters to alleviate thermal management problems in high current applications, and may, for example, double the output power capability while reducing parts count and costs. For example, one phase of a three phase inverter is shared between two transformers, which provide power to a rectifier such as a current doubler rectifier to provide two full bridge DC/DC converters with three rather than four high voltage inverter legs.

Field of the Invention","This disclosure generally relates to electrical power systems, and more particularly to power module architectures suitable for rectifying, inverting, and\/or converting electrical power between power sources and loads.","2. Description of the Related Art","Power modules are typically self-contained units that transform and\/or condition power from one or more power sources for supplying power to one or more loads. Power modules commonly referred to as \u201cinverters\u201d transform direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC), for use in supplying power to an AC load. Power modules commonly referred to as \u201crectifiers\u201d transform AC to DC. Power modules commonly referred to as \u201cDC\/DC converters\u201d step up or step down a DC voltage. An appropriately configured and operated power module may perform any one or more of these functions. The term \u201cconverter\u201d commonly applies generically to all power modules whether inverters, rectifiers and\/or DC\/DC converters, and is used herein in that generic sense.","Many applications employ the delivery of high power, high current and\/or high voltage from a power source to a load. For example, transportation applications may employ high power to drive a load such as a traction motor for propelling an electric or hybrid electric vehicle. Such applications may employ one or more of a variety of power sources, for example, energy producing power sources such as arrays of fuel cells or photovoltaic cells, and\/or energy storage power sources such as arrays of battery cells and\/or super capacitors. Often, such applications employ a power converter to transform and\/or condition the power, for example, stepping down the voltage at which the power is supplied to the load.","Power converters typically employ power semiconductor devices, such as insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), and\/or semiconductor diodes. These power semiconductor devices dissipate large amounts of heat during high power operation, creating thermal management problems which may limit the operating range, increase cost, increase size and\/or weight, adversely effect efficiency, and\/or reduce reliability of the power converter.","Methods and, or architectures for power converters capable of high power operation that alleviate the thermal management problems are highly desirable.","In one aspect, a power converter comprises: an inverter circuit comprising a first phase leg comprising a first node, a second phase leg comprising a second node, and a third phase leg comprising a third node; a first transformer comprising a first side and a second side, the first side of the first transformer electrically coupled between the first node of the first phase leg and the second node of the second phase leg of the inverter circuit; and a second transformer comprising a first side and a second side, the first side of the second transformer electrically coupled between the first node of the first phase leg and the third node of the third phase leg of the inverter circuit.","In another aspect, a method of converting power comprises: inverting a direct current to produce at least three phases of alternating current; supplying a first and a second of the three phases of alternating current to a first side of a first transformer to induce an alternating current on a second side of the first transformer; supplying the second and a third of the three phases of alternating current to a first side of a second transformer to induce an alternating current on a second side of the second transformer; supplying the alternating current from the second side of the first transformer to a rectifier; supplying the alternating current from the second side of the second transformer to the rectifier; and rectifying the first and the second alternating currents supplied to the rectifier from the second sides of the first and the second transformers, respectively, to produce a first voltage across a first potential node and a second potential node and to produce a second voltage across the second potential node and a third potential node.","In a further aspect, a power converter comprises: a first transformer comprising a first side including at least a first pole and a second pole, and a second side including at least a first pole and a second pole; a second transformer comprising a first side including at least a first pole and a second pole, and a second side including at least a first pole and a second pole; means for supplying a first phase of alternating current to the first pole of the first side of the first transformer, a second phase of alternating current to the second pole of the first side of the first transformer and to the first pole of the first side of the second transformer, and a third phase of alternating current to the second pole of the first side of the second transformer; and means for current double rectifying alternating currents supplied from the second sides of the first and the second transformers.","In the following description, certain specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments. However, one skilled in the art will understand that the invention may be practiced without these details. In other instances, well-known structures associated with power converters, controllers and\/or gate drives have not been shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring descriptions of the embodiments.","Unless the context requires otherwise, throughout the specification and claims which follow, the word \u201ccomprise\u201d and variations thereof, such as, \u201ccomprises\u201d and \u201ccomprising\u201d are to be construed in an open sense, that is as \u201cincluding, but not limited to.\u201d","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment.

The second leg and third leg of the inverter  are phase shifted controlled to generate a three-level square wave form Uto the first side or winding Tof the second transformer T. Thus, phase B is shared by the transformers T, T to form the equivalent of two conventional full bridge DC\/DC converters, while advantageously saving one high voltage leg (i.e., at least two power semiconductor switches and associated power semiconductor diodes) and gate driver circuit.","The two outputs Uand Uare phase locked to each other, so that the second phase leg (phase B) can achieve a wide soft-switching range by means of the load current in the transformers T. The soft switching is achieve by the energy stored in the filter inductors L\u2013L, without relying on the energy stored in the leakage inductance of the transformers T. The output voltage Vout is regulated by a phase shift angle \u03c6, and the output voltage Vout is regulated by a phase shift angle \u03c6. The power converter  can be configured as either single output or dual output. In single output configuration, the outputs Vout and Vout are paralleled together to double the output current\/power. If Vout and Vout are paralleled together in a single output voltage configuration, the phase shift angles \u03c6, \u03c6are equal.

Soft switching is achieved over a wide range of loads, reducing switching losses and providing high efficiency operation by means of the load currents in the transformers T, T and filter inductors L\u2013L. Thus, the described power converter may efficiently provide high power conversion, with high power density and high coolant temperature. The interleaving also advantageously reduces high frequency ripple current to the input and output capacitors CI, CO, CO. Sharing of a phase leg \u2013of the inverter  allows the use of one less inverter phase leg (i.e., at least two power semiconductor switches and associated diodes) than would typically be required, reducing parts count, complexity, and cost while increasing reliability. The power converter  is further easily configurable as either a single or dual output unit.","The integration of planar transformers in the power converter  described above, avoids the use of conventional air-cooled heavy copper printed circuit board windings. The integration of planar transformers may allow a reduction in Ohmic losses and inductance related to contacts, which are particularly problematic at high frequencies, by employing direct wire bonding connections as described above. Leakage inductance and AC loss may be reduced by employing the flat winding structure of the planar transformers T, T. The use of planar transformers in the described power converter  may advantageously allow an increase in the magnetic core window utilization ratio, a reduction in the magnetic core value, and an increase in power density. The power converter  described above may also provide enhanced EMI performance.","Although specific embodiments of and examples for the power converter and method are described herein for illustrative purposes, various equivalent modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as will be recognized by those skilled in the relevant art. The teachings provided herein can be applied to power converters, not necessarily the DC\/DC interleaved power converter with planar transformers generally described above.","For example, the power converter  may share the first or third phase legs , , rather than the second phase leg . Also for example, the teachings are not limited to a three phase inverter , but may be applied to inverters with an even greater number of phase legs, for example, to provide even high power. For example, the power converter  may comprise a fourth phase leg added to the inverter , and a third transformer electrically coupled between the third phase leg and the added phase leg. The power converter may also comprise two filter inductors, along with adding power semiconductor switches and associated diodes to the rectifier which are supplied from the second side of the third transformer to provide a power increase of 50%. Also for example, synchronized rectification is optional, and may be omitted in some embodiments, for example being replaced by a diode rectifier. As a further example, the integrated planar transforms may be advantageously employed in other power converters such as inverters and\/or rectifiers. As an even further example, the interleaving may be advantageously employed without the integrated planar transformers.","The various embodiments described above can be combined to provide further embodiments.
