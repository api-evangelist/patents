A crosswind is a wind moving across the projectile's trajectory and pushing against the projectile; causing the projectile to deviate from its current trajectory, for example to a side. At longer target ranges, crosswind effects on a projectile must be taken into account. As crosswinds may vary in speed at different points along the projectile's planned trajectory, compensating for crosswind effects normally requires estimations\/measurements to be made at different ranges between the weapon and the intended target and an average crosswind speed to be calculated to properly account for cumulative crosswind effects on the projectile. Crosswind speeds are often estimated by manual, visual observations made by a weapon operator and\/or an assistant target spotter and then an adjustment (a target offset) is made to a weapon point-of-aim using a weapon's sights and\/or physical adjustment of the weapon's direction-of-aim in order to correct for estimated crosswind effects on a fired projectile. Manual observation accuracy is affected by training, experience, and\/or skills of a weapon operator\/spotter. Inaccurate observations\/estimations can introduce unacceptable error into offset calculations and result in a projectile missing a target.","The present disclosure relates to methods and systems for measuring crosswind speed by optical measurement of laser scintillation. One method includes One method includes projecting radiation into a medium, receiving, over time, with a photodetector receiver, a plurality of scintillation patterns of scattered radiation, comparing cumulative a radiation intensity for each received scintillation pattern of the received plurality of scintillation patterns, and measuring a cumulative weighted average cross-movement within the medium using the compared cumulative radiation intensities.","Other implementations of this aspect include corresponding systems configured to perform the actions of the method. One or more systems can be configured to perform particular actions of the method. The systems can include one or more computers configured to perform the particular operations or actions by virtue of having software, firmware, hardware, computer-readable media or a combination of software, firmware, hardware, or computer-readable media installed on the systems. One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that, when executed by a computer, cause the computer to perform the actions.","The foregoing and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features, alone or in combination:","A first aspect, combinable with the general implementation, wherein the medium is one of air or water.","A second aspect, combinable with any of the previous aspects, further comprising: calculating a ballistic solution for a projectile using at least the calculated cumulative weighted average cross-movement within the medium, and calculating a weapon aiming offset using the calculated ballistic solution.","A third aspect, combinable with any of the previous aspects, further comprising determining that a particular scintillation pattern is moving, determining a direction-of-movement for the particular scintillation pattern, and determining a speed-of-movement for the particular scintillation pattern.","A fourth aspect, combinable with any of the previous aspects, wherein the determination that the particular scintillation pattern is moving is performed by a cross-covariance computation between two or more scintillation patterns.","A fifth aspect, combinable with any of the previous aspects, further comprising providing a multi-axis scintillation pattern movement determination.","The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in particular implementations so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. First, chosen weapon accuracy is enhanced by mitigating crosswind effects on fired projectiles. Second, laser scintillation allows for highly-accurate, real-time crosswind speed measurements. Third, the crosswind speed measurement can be calculated as a weighted average crosswind speed along the entire path from a weapon to target providing complete target path coverage including ranges beyond accurate manual observation and\/or estimation capabilities. Fourth, accurate crosswind speed measurements can be calculated using a single pixel receiver. Fifth, accurate crosswind speed measurements and\/or point-of-aim offsets can be made in different weather and atmospheric conditions. Sixth, due to provided real-time, high-accuracy offset calculations, concealment\/safety of a weapon operator and\/or assistant target spotter is enhanced by maximizing weapon-to-target engagement ranges and minimizing weapon operator, assistant target spotter and\/or weapon movement necessary to adjust a projectile point-of aim to impact a desired target. Seventh, training of weapon operators and\/or assistant target spotters is enhanced by providing real-time feedback and\/or correction of manual, visual crosswind speed observations\/estimations and offset calculations for various target ranges. Eighth, the crosswind calculation system (CCS) combines a ballistic calculator, receiver(s) and laser emitter(s) in a compact\/portable, weapon-mountable package. Ninth, the CCS can be networked with other CCS units and\/or suitable weather\/atmospheric data systems to enhance accuracy of crosswind calculations, ballistic solutions, and related provided data and\/or functions. Other advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Tenth, one or more components of the CCS can be coupled with other instruments to provide useful combined instrumentalities.","The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter of this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.","Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.","This disclosure generally describes methods and systems for measuring crosswind speed by optical measurement of laser scintillation.","The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of a particular application and its requirements. By measuring movement of scintillation patterns along a path between an origin and destination, a cumulative crosswind speed measurement can be calculated. An example application includes providing a ballistic solution for a projectile along with a provided crosswind-corrective offset applied to enhance the likelihood that the projectile will impact an intended target. Various modifications to the disclosed implementations will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from scope of the disclosure. Thus, the present disclosure is not intended to be limited only to the described and\/or illustrated implementations, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.","Laser Radiation Scattering","Rayleigh scattering is the scattering of light or other electromagnetic radiation by particles smaller than the wavelength of light. For example, ambient light and\/or a laser of sufficient power fired through a medium such as the atmosphere, gas, water, liquid, etc. causes atoms\/molecules of gas\/liquid to move at the same frequency of the laser radiation and become a small radiating dipole scattering the laser radiation. Similarly, Mie scattering results when roughly spherical particles approximately the size of the wavelength of the laser radiation, for example microscopic liquid droplets, particulates, dust, pollen, smoke, and the like, scatter the laser radiation when exposed to the laser.","Atmospheric Turbulence","Based at least partially on Kolmogorov's theory of 1941, it is known that temperature gradients in a gas or liquid cause the formation of small turbulent cells (or \u201ceddies\u201d) of varying density. The eddies act as lenses and prisms to diffract\/refract electromagnetic radiation passing through them causing modulations in apparent intensity of the radiation (or \u201cscintillation\u201d). Although the temperature gradients\/intensity modulations are small for a given volume of gas\/liquid, the cumulative effect of applied electromagnetic radiation, for example from a laser transmitter, passing through many moving eddies over a long distance is measureable by one or more receivers that detect and measure over time an eddy-caused scintillation pattern of Rayleigh\/Mie scattered laser radiation along a path from an illumination laser transmitter to a particular target and\/or scattered from the particular target. As eddies drift from gas\/liquid current through a laser path, an associated scintillation pattern created by the eddies moves as well. A change in a scintillation pattern is measured and the measurement converted into a cumulative weighted average crosswind\/crosscurrent speed for the entire path to the particular target for use in measuring a crosswind-corrective\/crosscurrent-corrective offset.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","102","102","104","106","106","108","104","110","112","106","106","114","114","114","116","200","114","112","106","106","112","106","106"],"i":["a","b","a","b ","a","b","a","b "]},"The laser transmitter  is coupled with appropriate optics for illumination laser  focusing and transmission. The illumination laser  is used to illuminate a target. In some implementations, a target can include a gas\/liquid, for example air\/water, at a desired distance. In some implementations, the laser can operate in a continuous or pulsed mode. A continuously operating laser transmitter  can provide real-time, continuous crosswind speed calculations while a pulsed laser transmitter  can provide intermittent, as-needed crosswind speed calculations. In addition, if a laser is pulsed and receivers are gated, a given segment of distance between the laser source and the atmosphere at the distance can be measured. For example, crosswind speed can be measured in a segment of 100-120 m from the laser source. Next, a segment 120-140 m can be measured. In this manner, the average crosswind to each segment can be determined and the particular segment crosswinds also determined.","In some implementations, the laser transmitter emission axis  is bore sighted parallel to the detection axis of the receivers \/. In other implementations, the laser transmitter  emission axis is placed at an angle to the detection axis of the receivers \/. In some implementations, the CCS  does not include a laser transmitter  and instead depends upon sufficient ambient or other light sources to provide necessary illumination to detect atmospheric eddies between the CCS  and a target. For example, for daytime use, sunlight can provide sufficient illumination for scintillation pattern detection. In some implementations, other sufficient light sources may include high-intensity flood lights, security lights, flashlights, headlights, scattered illumination, targeting, and\/or other laser light, and the like.","Typically each receiver \/is made up of one photodiode coupled with appropriate optics for focusing a separate received scintillation pattern image on the photodiode. The cumulative intensity of the light of the received scintillation pattern is converted by the photodiode into either current or voltage, depending on a photodiode mode of operation, which can then be analyzed in order to determine the individual scintillation pattern light intensity. In this manner, each photodiode can be considered as a single-pixel receiver in that it receives a scintillation pattern and converts the received scintillation pattern into a single data point measuring cumulative light intensity of the scintillation pattern. Known spacing between and a size of receivers \/are factored into detection\/calculation software allowing each receiver to detect a particular scintillation pattern intensity and for the CCS  to compare multiple intensity determinations over time in order to further determine whether the scintillation pattern is moving, a direction of movement, a speed of movement, and a cumulative weighted average crosswind speed for the entire path to the particular target. The minimum number of receivers is one, but two or more receivers or one or more receivers with multiple photodiodes may be used to enhance crosswind calculation accuracy as well as provide multi-axis scintillation pattern movement determinations. Other receiver implementations can include multiple photodiodes and\/or single photodiodes. In some instances, optics can be used to focus light on particular detector areas of a photodiode. In these instances, the use of the optics can allow the simulation of multiple individual\/grouped photodiodes. For example, a quadrant detector (or simulated quadrant detector) can be used in some implementations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","106","106","304","304","304","102","106","106"],"i":["a","b ","a","b","c ","a ","b.

The laser transmitter  can be, among other things, a light emitting diode (LED), a super-luminescent diode (SLD), a solid, chemical, and\/or gas laser, and\/or multiple lasers or arrays of laser emitters covering different laser powers, frequencies, and\/or optical properties. For example, an emitted illumination laser  can be visible, invisible, and\/or multi-frequency. The collimator narrows and aligns the output of the laser transmitter  to produce a narrow, focused illumination laser  with which to illuminate a target to produce scattered laser radiation  as shown in .","The alignment laser assemblies \/each also include a collimator and a laser transmitter to emit alignment lasers used to assist with aligning a CCS  with the riflescope crosshairs of a weapon the CCS  is mounted upon. The collimator associated with the alignment laser assemblies \/operates similarly to that in the illumination laser assembly . Each alignment laser assembly \/laser transmitter can also be a light emitting diode (LED), a super luminescent diode (SLD), a solid, chemical, and\/or gas laser, and\/or multiple lasers or arrays of laser emitters covering different laser powers, frequencies, and\/or optical properties. For example, an emitted alignment laser can be visible, invisible, and\/or multi-frequency. In some implementations, the pair of alignment laser assemblies \/can be made up of a visible and an invisible alignment laser. The visible alignment laser assembly can be used, for example, during daytime and\/or in a safe environment where visibility of an alignment laser is either necessary and\/or not of concern to a CCS  operator. Likewise, the invisible alignment laser assembly can be used during nighttime, where concealment of a CCS  operator is a priority, and\/or in other environments where visibility of an alignment laser is not necessary and\/or of concern to a CCS  operator. In some implementations, both alignment lasers can be used simultaneously. In some implementations, both alignment lasers can be either visible or invisible. In other implementations, there can be zero, one, or three or more available alignment laser assemblies.","The integrating circuits \/each sample an associated photodetector and transfer the data to system memory (not illustrated) where the data is accessed by internally stored applications (not illustrated) providing crosswind speed (wind calculator application (WCA)) and ballistic solution calculations (ballistic solver application (BSA)) executed by a main system processor . The WCA performs crosswind speed calculations based on the sampled photodetector data and weather\/atmospheric data provided by integrated or connected weather\/atmospheric sensors. The BSA provides projectile ballistic calculation and other related functionality (refer to  and associated descriptions below for additional information concerning BSA functionality) based upon ballistics data and the weather\/atmospheric data provided by the integrated or connected weather\/atmospheric sensors. The BSA computes wind influence on a projectile achieving six degrees-of-freedom using a three degree-of-freedom modified point mass numerical solver that considers velocity, time of flight, and bullet drop as a function of the projectile's position downrange until the projectile reaches the target taking into account current environmental conditions. The BSA fully accounts for Coriolis effects in both vertical and horizontal directions-of-fire, spin drift, and aerodynamic jump (the Magnus effect). The BSA contains all standard drag curves (G1, G7, etc.) and the ability to input\/create custom drag curves for custom\/designer projectiles.","Generally, the processor  executes instructions and manipulates data to perform the operations of the CCS . Specifically, the processor  executes instructions required to provide calculations and associated functionality for measuring crosswind speed by optical measurement of laser scintillation and providing ballistic solution calculations.

The external device interfaces \/can support, for example, universal serial bus (USB), FIREWIRE, LIGHTNING, RS-232, BLUETOOTH, WiFi, wireless, cellular and\/or other suitable interface type connectivity to the CCS . External devices could include a flash memory to store data, a computer to update internal software\/application programs (not illustrated), a KESTREL brand pocket weather station (PWS) providing, among other things, temperature, pressure, and humidity data, a rifle scope, a spotting scope, a display, a recording device such as a computer or server to capture the data from the CCS , an array of wind turbines, and the like.","The sensor and user interface processor  is coupled with the processor  and provides functionality to integrate support for various built-in sensors (e.g., an inclination sensor, digital magnetic compass, temperature sensor, pressure sensor, humidity sensor, and the like) is available, a digital display , and a user input keypad . The digital display  provides, for example, textual and\/or graphical data to a CCS  user regarding crosswind speed, ballistic solutions, target data, atmospheric data, and other suitable data. In some implementations, the digital display  can be configured to be removable in a communicably coupled manner with the CCS  unit, for example using a wired or wireless connection. In other implementations, a separate communicably coupled digital display  can be used in conjunction with a digital display  integrated into the CCS  unit. In this implementation, each digital display  can display different data to a CCS  user.","The user input keypad  allows a CCS  user to manually input data and or select menu options and\/or functions\/settings directly on the CCS  unit.

Implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions encoded on a tangible, non-transitory computer-storage medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. Alternatively or in addition, the program instructions can be encoded on an artificially-generated propagated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by a data processing apparatus. The computer-storage medium can be a machine-readable storage device, a machine-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory device, or a combination of one or more of them.","The term \u201cdata processing apparatus\u201d refers to data processing hardware and encompasses all kinds of apparatus, devices, and machines for processing data, including by way of example, a programmable processor, a computer, or multiple processors or computers. The apparatus can also be or further include special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., a central processing unit (CPU), a FPGA (field programmable gate array), or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). In some implementations, the data processing apparatus and\/or special purpose logic circuitry may be hardware-based and\/or software-based. The apparatus can optionally include code that creates an execution environment for computer programs, e.g., code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an operating system, or a combination of one or more of them. The present disclosure contemplates the use of data processing apparatuses with or without conventional operating systems, for example LINUX, UNIX, WINDOWS, MAC OS, ANDROID, IOS or any other suitable conventional operating system.","A computer program, which may also be referred to or described as a program, software, a software application, a module, a software module, a script, or code, can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, or declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data, e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document, in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files, e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub-programs, or portions of code. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network. While portions of the programs illustrated in the various figures are shown as individual modules that implement the various features and functionality through various objects, methods, or other processes, the programs may instead include a number of sub-modules, third-party services, components, libraries, and such, as appropriate. Conversely, the features and functionality of various components can be combined into single components as appropriate.","The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable computers executing one or more computer programs to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatus can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., a CPU, a FPGA, or an ASIC.","Computers suitable for the execution of a computer program can be based on general or special purpose microprocessors, both, or any other kind of CPU. Generally, a CPU will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory (ROM) or a random access memory (RAM) or both. The essential elements of a computer are a CPU for performing or executing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to, receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices. Moreover, a computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a global positioning system (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device, e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive, to name just a few.","Computer-readable media (transitory or non-transitory, as appropriate) suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically-erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM, DVD+\/\u2212R, DVD-RAM, and DVD-ROM disks. The memory may store various objects or data, including caches, classes, frameworks, applications, backup data, jobs, web pages, web page templates, database tables, repositories storing business and\/or dynamic information, and any other appropriate information including any parameters, variables, algorithms, instructions, rules, constraints, or references thereto. Additionally, the memory may include any other appropriate data, such as logs, policies, security or access data, reporting files, as well as others. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.","To provide for interaction with a user, implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube), LCD (liquid crystal display), or plasma monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse, trackball, or trackpad by which the user can provide input to the computer. Input may also be provided to the computer using a touchscreen, such as a tablet computer surface with pressure sensitivity, a multi-touch screen using capacitive or electric sensing, or other type of touchscreen. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input. In addition, a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user; for example, by sending web pages to a web browser on a user's client device in response to requests received from the web browser.","The term \u201cgraphical user interface,\u201d or GUI, may be used in the singular or the plural to describe one or more graphical user interfaces and each of the displays of a particular graphical user interface. Therefore, a GUI may represent any graphical user interface, including but not limited to, a web browser, a touch screen, or a command line interface (CLI) that processes information and efficiently presents the information results to the user. In general, a GUI may include a plurality of user interface (UI) elements, some or all associated with a web browser, such as interactive fields, pull-down lists, and buttons operable by the business suite user. These and other UI elements may be related to or represent the functions of the web browser.","Implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front-end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of wireline and\/or wireless digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (LAN), a radio access network (RAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wide area network (WAN), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WIMAX), a wireless local area network (WLAN) using, for example, 802.11a\/b\/g\/n and\/or 802.20, all or a portion of the Internet, and\/or any other communication system or systems at one or more locations. The network may communicate with, for example, Internet Protocol (IP) packets, Frame Relay frames, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cells, voice, video, data, and\/or other suitable information between network addresses.","The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.","In some implementations, any or all of the components of the computing system, both hardware and\/or software, may interface with each other and\/or the interface using an application programming interface (API) and\/or a service layer. The API may include specifications for routines, data structures, and object classes. The API may be either computer language independent or dependent and refer to a complete interface, a single function, or even a set of APIs. The service layer provides software services to the computing system. The functionality of the various components of the computing system may be accessible for all service consumers via this service layer. Software services provide reusable, defined business functionalities through a defined interface. For example, the interface may be software written in JAVA, C++, or other suitable language providing data in extensible markup language (XML) format or other suitable format. The API and\/or service layer may be an integral and\/or a stand-alone component in relation to other components of the computing system. Moreover, any or all parts of the service layer may be implemented as child or sub-modules of another software module, enterprise application, or hardware module without departing from the scope of this disclosure.","While this specification contains many specific implementation details, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any invention or on the scope of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features that may be specific to particular implementations of particular inventions. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate implementations can also be implemented in combination in a single implementation. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single implementation can also be implemented in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable sub-combination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a sub-combination or variation of a sub-combination.","Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be performed, to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation and\/or integration of various system modules and components in the implementations described above should not be understood as requiring such separation and\/or integration in all implementations, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.","Particular implementations of the subject matter have been described. Other implementations, alterations, and permutations of the described implementations are within the scope of the following claims as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the above description of example implementations does not define or constrain this disclosure. Other changes, substitutions, and alterations are also possible without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A-5D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A-7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 7C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 8A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 8B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 8C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 8D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 8E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIGS. 8F-8G"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIGS. 9A-9D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIGS. 10A-10D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 13"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
