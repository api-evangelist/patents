title: Customizable system for the automatic gathering of software service information
abstract: The present invention provides methods and systems for a customizable collector application, which automates multiple diagnostic techniques to obtain sets of diagnostic information. The collector application is easily customizable for use by different products, and may reduce the diagnostic information gathering to a single session. This includes gathering all of the required sets of information about a product problem, the hardware environment, the maintenance levels of the operating system environment, and the involved middleware, both local and distributed. In addition, the collector application has a reusable framework designed to have minor external customization for each product that requires its' service. The output of the collector application may be provided in a format, such as XML, that is viewable by another application, such as browser.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to gathering diagnostic information. In particular, the present invention relates to methods and systems for gathering diagnostic information in a customizable manner for each supported application.","Computer systems are constantly growing more complex to the point that it is extremely difficult to diagnose these systems. Software now presents a wide variety of configuration options, programming interfaces (APIs), software dependencies, performance tuning, etc. Typically, these complex computer systems comprise several layers of architectural abstractions. Each layer may have a number of components that interact with each other in a virtually infinite number of ways. Thus, this complexity makes diagnosis of the system very difficult.","Gathering sufficient diagnostic data on a complex stack of software can be both labor-intensive and error-prone. It is usually an iterative multi-pass process conducted between a remote service representative and the user experiencing the problem. These problems are exacerbated if the computer system topology is distributed or client-server.","Frequently, the diagnostic process requests data that is not available to the user as it pertains to hardware and software in \u201cthe stack\u201d: the operating system, middleware (including database and communication software), a specific application or user interface, with which the user is not familiar. Often, the service representative knows and uses diagnostic techniques. These techniques, however, are generally beyond the technical depth of the end user.","Getting the necessary diagnostic information requires educating the end-user about information gathering. Because many users are unable to figure out what has gone wrong with their system, the user is often hostile or unable to gather as much information as is needed to efficiently isolate the problem. This information gathering dialog can thus be tedious, expensive, frustrating, and time consuming.","Due to this multi-step manual process and frequent user hostility, the service representative is often disinclined to acquire all of the potentially needed facts in the initial dialog. Collecting full information involves walking the end user through complex diagnosis on a number of related interdependent components in the stack. Because each diagnostic test is an imposition on the end user, the service representative tries to run the fewest possible tests. Consequently, too little information is often obtained in the initial call, resulting in a back and forth dialog between service representative and end user, which again exacerbates the frustration of the user. Each iteration of this dialog can eventually contribute to the complete diagnosis; yet all the while the system is inoperable or operating poorly.","Accordingly, it may be desirable to provide methods and systems that can automatically and efficiently gather diagnostic information from a computer system. In addition, it may be desirable to provide methods and systems that can gather diagnostic information in a manner that is easy and transparent for the user.","In accordance with one feature of the invention, a method is provided for gathering diagnostic information in a customized manner for a target running on a computer. A specification file is received and the specification file identifies sets of diagnostic information requested by the target to be collected from the computer. The sets of diagnostic information are then collected based on the specification file. The sets of diagnostic information may then be provided in a format that is specified in the specification file.","In accordance with another feature of the invention, a computer is configured to gather sets of diagnostic information for a target that is running on the computer. The computer generally comprises a memory and a processor. The memory comprises a specification file that identifies sets of diagnostic information requested by the target to be collected from the computer. The specification file also customizes a collector application for the target. The processor runs the collector application, which reads the specification file, collects the sets of diagnostic information requested by the target, and formats the diagnostic information into an output based on the specification file.","In accordance with another feature of the invention, a diagnostic system can be customized for a target running on a first computer. The system generally comprises a collector application and a viewer application. The collector application runs on the first computer and is customized by an external specification file specifying sets of diagnostic information requested by the target. The collector application collects the sets of diagnostic information requested by the target and formats the diagnostic information into an output based on the specification file. The viewer application receives the diagnostic information output from the collector application and provides a view of the diagnostic information.","Additional features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The features of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.","The present invention provides methods and systems provide a customizable collector application, which automates multiple sets of diagnostic techniques. The customizable collector application has a reusable framework that permits customization as part of its service. This application is customizable for use by different products and can reduce the diagnostic information gathering to a single session (or relatively few sessions). When a computer system is experiencing a problem, such as an error or poor performance, a collector application may be invoked to collect sets of diagnostic information. The collector application may be customized using a specification file that is external to the collector application. The specification file may be specifically configured to diagnose problems with a product or component (herein referred to as the \u201ctarget\u201d of the collector application) running on the computer system.","The diagnostic information gathering by the collector application may include, for example, gathering all of the required information about a problem, the hardware environment, the maintenance levels of the operating system environment, and the involved middleware, both local and distributed. The collector application may then output the diagnostic information in a readily portable form, such as an extensible markup language (XML) file. The format of the XML file may be specified in the specification file. A user or technician may then view the diagnostic information using a standard browser, either remotely or locally on the system being diagnosed.","One skilled in the art will recognize that the customizable collector software may eliminate the need for an iterative human dialog and the manual gathering, packaging and transportation of diagnostic information. In addition, the collector software can eliminate the common human errors in executing diagnostic information gathering techniques and errors in transcription. Further, the collector software can be customized to diagnose not only deterministic (or predictable) issues, but non-deterministic issues as well, since substantially complete diagnostic information can be collected in one invocation of the collector software. Regardless of how many individual detailed diagnostics are required, the end user can invoke the collector software by executing a single command. This can facilitate far faster, less expensive resolution of the user problem, and restoration of the business function. Of course, one skilled in the art will recognize that embodiments of the present invention may provide a number of benefits and advantages over the prior art.","Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the invention, which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. The present disclosure now begins with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100"]},"Accordingly, system  is shown comprising a target system  of concern by the user, and a remote viewer , which are coupled together via a network . Network  may comprise a local area network, or wide area network, or a combination of networks. In addition, the components of system  may communicate with each other using known protocols, such as the transport control protocol and internet protocol (\u201cTCP\/IP\u201d) and hypertext transport protocol (\u201cHTTP\u201d).","The components of system  may be implemented on separate devices or may be implemented on one or more of the same devices or systems. For example, as noted above, target system  and viewer  may be implemented on separate systems. However, target system  and viewer  may run on the same machine and run under a common operating system. Such implementations may be useful, for example, when the user is interested in self diagnosing their own systems. Alternatively, system  may have one or more of its components implemented on multiple machines that run different operating systems. The components of system  shown in  will now be described in turn.","Target system  may refer to any device or plurality of devices. For example, target system  may simply be a personal computer, workstation, or terminal. Alternatively, target system  may be a server, a database server, an application server, and the like. Such devices and systems are well known to those skilled in the art.","Although  shows a single target system , system  may include any number of target systems. As also shown, target system  may further comprise a target , a collector application , and a specification file . These components will now be briefly described.","Target  generally refers to any software or component of software that runs on target system . Target  may be on many types of computer system environments and many types of computer systems. For example, target  may be an application running on a UNIX-based operating system, or a database application, such as the DB2 Universal Database system from IBM Corporation.","Collector application  refers to an application or piece of software that collects diagnostic information regarding target . Collector application  is a customizable piece of software, which automates multiple sets of diagnostic techniques. In some embodiments, collector application  is configured to reduce diagnostic information gathering to a single session (or relatively few sessions) and gather all of the required information about a product problem with target .","In general, diagnostic information refers to information that identifies the cause or nature of a problem with target . The problem may range from an execution failure to poor performance. For example, the diagnostic information may include information that indicates the hardware environment of target system , the maintenance levels of the operating system environment, and the involved middleware both local to target system  and distributed. One skilled in the art will also recognize that collector application  may collect sets of diagnostic information for any number of targets simultaneously. For example, collector application  may be requested to gather diagnostic information for a plurality of targets that interact with each other.","Collector application  may be customizable and utilize an extensible framework for use by any number of products that have a target, such as target , running on target system . That is, collector application  may run as a service on target system  that runs and configures itself accordingly to the needs of the target being diagnosed. In some embodiments, collector application  uses a reusable framework designed to allow its customization for each product that requires its' service using an external specification file . For example, collector application  may be initiated via a command prompt for a \u201c.bat\u201d file execution (i.e., for Java implementations) or \u201c.sh\u201d file execution (i.e., for UNIX implementations), etc. An example for collector application  written in Java is provided

For example, specification file  may be maintained at a central location that is accessible via network , but which is available for download to target system . Alternatively, specification file  may be included with target  during its installation.

diagnosing target system . For example, viewer  may be employed as an administrative interface by a support center. Viewer  formats and displays all of the information gathered by collector application  and allows browsing of the diagnostic information collected at target system .","Viewer  may be implemented using a variety of devices and software. For example, viewer  may be implemented on a personal computer, workstation, or terminal. In addition, viewer  may run under a Windows operating system, or through a browser application, such as Internet Explorer by Microsoft Corporation or Netscape Navigator by Netscape Communications Corporation. In the embodiment shown, viewer  runs through a browser, such as Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator that communicates with target system  using HTTP, secure HTTP (HTTPs), secure sockets layer (SSL), and the like. Although  shows a single viewer, system  may include any number of viewers. Alternatively, viewer  may run directly on target system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["102","102","200","202","204","206","208"]},"Processor  may include cache  for storing frequently accessed information. Cache  may be an \u201con-chip\u201d cache or external cache. Target system  may also be provided with additional peripheral devices, such as a keyboard, mouse, or printer (not shown). In the embodiment shown, the various components of target system  communicate through a system bus or similar architecture.","Although  illustrates one example of the structure of target system , the principles of the present invention are applicable to other types of processors and systems. That is, the present invention may be applied to any type of processor or system. For example, target system  may comprise multiple processors, such as those provided by the Intel Corporation, or may comprise multiple computers that are linked together.","Operating system (OS)  may be installed in memory , for example, from local storage , and is an integrated collection of routines that service the sequencing and processing of programs and applications by target system . OS  may provide many services for target system , such as resource allocation, scheduling, input\/output control, and data management. OS  may be predominantly software, but may also comprise partial or complete hardware implementations and firmware. Well-known examples of operating systems that are consistent with the principles of the present invention include the z\/OS operating system, LINUX, and UNIX.","Main memory  serves as the primary storage location for target system . For example, main memory  may be implemented in the form of a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), or combination of both. As shown, memory  is shown with target , collector application , and specification file  being loaded. Of course, one skilled in the art will recognize that these components may be swapped in\/out of memory  based on the operations of target system .","Local storage  serves as a mass storage device for target system . Such devices are well known to those skilled in the art. For example, local storage  may be implemented as a hard disk drive, an optical drive, a tape drive, and the like.","Input\/output controller  couples target system  to other devices and network . For example, input\/output controller  may comprise well known hardware, firmware, and software for network communications, such as an Ethernet interface, a universal serial bus interface, and the like. Other devices and software for input\/output controller  are well known to those skilled in the art.","Now that some exemplary systems have been described, the present disclosure will now describe various processes and methods that are consistent with the principles of the present invention. The flow diagram depicted herein is provided by way of example. There may be variations to these diagrams or the steps (or operations) described herein without departing from the spirit of the invention. For instance, in certain cases, the steps may be performed in differing order, or steps may be added, deleted or modified. All of these variations are considered to comprise part of the present invention as recited in the appended claims. Reference will now be made to .","In general,  illustrates an exemplary process flow for gathering diagnostic information from target system  related to the running of target . Collecting diagnostic information can involve guiding a user through complex diagnosis on a number of related interdependent components in a stack running on target system . Because each diagnostic test can be an imposition, often times too little information may be collected from the user. Thus, it may be desirable minimize the amount of involvement by the user and automate some or all of this process. Embodiments of the present invention can remove or reduce the need for an iterative dialog between the user at target system  and a support center. In addition, embodiments of the present invention can automate the gathering, packaging, and transport of the diagnostic information. Hence, the user at target system  does need to have detailed knowledge about diagnostic techniques or various information gathering techniques, such as transcription.","Furthermore, a support center may have an enhanced ability to understand and evaluate any problems at target system  because embodiments of the present invention can provide a more complete and automated information gathering process. In some embodiments, regardless of the number of individual diagnostic tests that may be needed, collector application  can be customized for each target system  or each target  and configured to run automatically to perform any number of diagnostic tests based on the execution of one command or a single invocation. In particular, collector application  may provide a relatively generic service\/platform that is a reusable and customizable framework for each supported application, such as target . Thus, embodiments of the present invention can also collect diagnostic information within a single or fewer sessions.","This process may be run upon request by the user when target system  experiences problems, such as during install or normal use. Alternatively, collector application  may be normally a hidden or \u201cdormant\u201d application. That is, collector application  may be normally inactive and activated on an as-needed basis by the user or a technician.","The process flow may be initiated by invoking collector application  from the command prompt at target system  via a \u201c.bat\u201d file (for those embodiments of collector application  that are Java applications). As another example, collector application  may be initiated using a \u201c.sh\u201d file for when collector application  is implemented on UNIX based systems. The user or technician may also be prompted to provide various necessary arguments that collector application  may require. These arguments may differ for different targets. Alternatively, collector application  may be automatically invoked in response to an event, such as a system or application failure, or based on a predetermined time interval. Processing by collector apparatus may begin at stage .","In stage , collector application  receives the specification file . For example, as noted above, the user or a technician may be prompted to enter the location of specification file . Collector application  may then receive the specification file  in variety of ways. In particular, the specification file  may be downloaded from a web site or file transfer protocol site that is accessible from network . Alternatively, specification file  may have previously been stored locally on target system , such as in storage . One skilled in the art will recognize that collector application  may receive specification file  in a variety of other ways that are consistent with the principles of the present invention, such as accessing a disk. Processing may then flow to stage .","In stage , collector application  customizes itself based on specification file  and gathers the sets of diagnostic information requested. A set of diagnostic information may be any group or amount of information resulting from a diagnostic test or other form of information gathering technique. In some embodiments, collector application  is implemented as a Java program, which is made customizable by providing a Java interface that can be tailored to target . For example, collector application  may: search for one or more of several versions of target , or run a query, such as a DB2 query, and capture output of the query, in order to obtain various sets of diagnostic information. In some embodiments, collector application  may employ a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) application programming interface that enables it to execute SQL statements. This allows collector application  interact with any SQL-compliant database, such as a relational database management system. Collector application  may also support Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) methods.","Collector application  may also run commands when collecting the sets of diagnostic information. For example, collector application  may run a DB2 administrative service command on a remote DB2 instance of a database in target system  via TCP\/IP and capture the output. Collector application  may also run other commands, such as DB2 commands, on a local DB2 instance of a database in target system . In addition, collector application  may run various local operating system commands, such as DOS\/UNIX commands, and capture their output, or capture the contents of any system file, such as log file, trace file, text file, etc. This feature thus permits collector application  to make calls to an existing executable that is to collect information rather than recreating functions that may already be available for other reasons. Collector application  may also collect diagnostic information that a utility on target system  already gathers. One skilled in the art will recognize that collector application  may gather any type of diagnostic information. Once the diagnostic information has been collected, processing may flow to stage .","In stage , collector application  provides the sets of diagnostic information it has gathered into a form requested by the user or technician, as indicated in specification file . For example, in some embodiments, collector application  is configured to provide the sets of diagnostic information in the form of an XML file. Collector application  may then provide the XML file via email or a file transfer protocol operation. Collector application  may also store the diagnostic information locally on target system , where it can be viewed by viewer . A user or technician may then use viewer  to browse through the diagnostic information in order to diagnose target system .","In some embodiments, viewer  can be run via a command prompt script, such as \u201cViewer.bat\u201d (for Java applications) or \u201cViewer.sh\u201d (for UNIX applications) at target system  or at another computer that is remote from target system , such as at a workstation in a support center. The user or technician may then operate viewer  to browse the XML files contents, for example, in a tree-form. One skilled in the art will recognize that viewer  may provide a wide variety of graphical user interfaces for presenting the diagnostic information.","The present invention can be included, for example, in an article of manufacture (e.g., one or more computer program products) having, for instance, computer usable media. This media has embodied therein, for instance, computer readable program code means for providing and facilitating the capabilities of the present invention. The articles of manufacture can be included as part of the computer system or sold separately. Additionally, at least one program storage device readable by machine, tangibly embodying at least one program of instructions executable by the machine, to perform the capabilities of the present invention, can be provided.","For example, collector application  may be provided as part of a larger product or software application. In particular, as noted previously, collector application  may be written as a Java application, which is instantiated in the code of another application, such as target . Target  may then call methods to capture the sets of diagnostic information desired.","Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
