This invention also pertains to compounds which inhibit the activity of ROCK, compositions containing the compounds, and methods of treating diseases during which ROCK is expressed.","NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a coenzyme that plays a critical role in many physiologically essential processes (Ziegkel, M. 267, 1550-1564, 2000). NAD is necessary for several signaling pathways including among others poly ADP-ribosylation in DNA repair, mono-ADP-ribosylation in both the immune system and G-protein-coupled signaling, and NAD is also required by sirtuins for their deacetylase activity (Gallen, A. et al 20, 130-138, 2008).","NAMPT (also known as pre-B-cell-colony-enhancing factor (PBEF) and visfatin) is an enzyme that catalyzes the phosphoribosylation of nicotinamide and is the rate-limiting enzyme in one of two pathways that salvage NAD.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"69.09mm","wi":"139.45mm","file":"US09302989-20160405-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Increasing evidence suggests that NAMPT inhibitors have potential as anticancer agents. Cancer cells have a higher basal turnover of NAD and also display higher energy requirements compared with normal cells. Additionally, increased NAMPT expression has been reported in colorectal cancer (Van Beijnum, J. R. et al 101, 118-127, 2002) and NAMPT is involved in angiogenesis (Kim, S. R. et al. 357, 150-156, 2007). Small-molecule inhibitors of NAMPT have been shown to cause depletion of intracellular NAD+ levels and ultimately induce tumor cell death (Hansen, C M et al. 20, 42111-4220, 2000) as well as inhibit tumor growth in xenograft models (Olese, U. H. et al. 9, 1609-1617, 2010).","NAMPT inhibitors also have potential as therapeutic agents in inflammatory and metabolic disorders (Galli, M. et al 70, 8-11, 2010). For example, NAMPT is the predominant enzyme in T and B lymphocytes. Selective inhibition of NAMPT leads to NAD+ depletion in lymphocytes blocking the expansion that accompanies autoimmune disease progression whereas cell types expressing the other NAD+ generating pathways might be spared. A small molecule NAMPT inhibitor (FK866) has been shown to selectively block proliferation and induce apoptosis of activated T cells and was efficacious in animal models of arthritis (collagen-induced arthritis) (Busso, N. et al. 3, e2267, 2008). FK866 ameliorated the manifestations of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of T-cell mediated autoimmune disorders. (Bruzzone, S et al. 4, e7897, 2009). NaMPT activity increases NF-kB transcriptional activity in human vascular endothelial cell, resulting in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activation, suggesting a role for NAMPT inhibitors in the prevention of inflammatory mediated complications of obesity and type 2 diabetes (Adya, R. et. Al. 31, 758-760, 2008).","Rho kinases (ROCKs), the first Rho effectors to be described, are serine\/threonine kinases that are important in fundamental processes of cell migration, cell proliferation and cell survival. Abnormal activation of the Rho\/ROCK pathway has been observed in various disorders. Examples of disease states in which compounds with ROCK inhibition have potentially beneficial therapeutic effects due to their anti vasospasm activity includes cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, chronic and congestive heart failure, cardiac hypertrophy, restenosis, chronic renal failure, cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid bleeding, pulmonary hypertension and atherosclerosis. This muscle relaxing property is also beneficial for treating asthma, male erectile dysfunctions, female sexual dysfunction, and over-active bladder syndrome. Injury to the adult vertebrate brain and spinal cord activates ROCKs, thereby inhibiting neurite growth and sprouting Inhibition of ROCKs results in induction of new axonal growth, axonal rewiring across lesions within the CNS, accelerated regeneration and enhanced functional recovery after acute neuronal injury in mammals (spinal-cord injury, traumatic brain injury). Inhibition of the Rho\/ROCK pathway has also proved to be efficacious in other animal models of neurodegeneration like stroke, inflammatory and demyelinating diseases, Alzheimer's disease as well as for the treatment of pain. Rho\/ROCK pathway inhibitors therefore have potential for preventing neurodegeneration and stimulating neuroregeneration in various neurological disorders, including spinal-cord injury, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as for the treatment of pain. ROCK inhibitors have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, compounds of the invention can be used as treatment for neuroinflammatory diseases such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and inflammatory pain, as well as other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, Lupus, and inflammatory bowel disease. Since ROCK inhibitors reduce cell proliferation and cell migration, they could be useful in treating cancer and tumor metastasis. Further more, there is evidence suggesting that ROCK inhibitors suppress cytoskeletal rearrangement upon virus invasion, thus they also have potential therapeutic value in anti-viral and anti-bacterial applications. ROCK inhibitors are also useful for the treatment of insulin resistance and diabetes. Further, ROCK inhibitors have been shown to ameliorate progression of cystic fibrosis (Abstract S02.3, 8th World Congress on Inflammation, Copenhagen, Denmark, Jun. 16-20, 2007).","In addition, Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinases (ROCK)-1 and -2, have been shown to enhance myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation by inhibiting MLC phosphatase as well as phosphorylating MLC. This results in the regulation of actin-myosin contraction. Recent reports have demonstrated that inhibition of ROCK results in disruption of inflammatory cell chemotaxis as well as inhibition of smooth muscle contraction in models of pulmonary inflammation associated with asthma. Therefore, the inhibitors of the Rho\/ROCK pathway may be useful for the treatment of asthma.","One embodiment of this invention, therefore, pertains to compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which are useful as inhibitors of NAMPT or ROCK, the compounds having Formula (Ic)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"15.24mm","wi":"62.31mm","file":"US09302989-20160405-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein","X, X, and Xare CH;

Examples of aryls include phenyl, naphthalenyl, indenyl, 2,3-dihydroindenyl, indanyl, and tetrahydronapthyl.","In some instances, the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbyl substituent (e.g., alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or cycloalkyl) is indicated by the prefix \u201cC-C-\u201d, wherein x is the minimum and y is the maximum number of carbon atoms in the substituent. Thus, for example, \u201cC-C-alkyl\u201d refers to an alkyl substituent containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Illustrating further, C-C-cycloalkyl means a saturated hydrocarbyl ring containing from 3 to 8 carbon ring atoms.","The term \u201chydrogen\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a hydrogen radical, and may be depicted as \u2014H.","The term \u201chydroxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014OH.","The term \u201ccarboxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014OH.","The term \u201camino\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014NH.","The term \u201chalogen\u201d or \u201chalo\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a fluorine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014F), chlorine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014Cl), bromine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014Br), or iodine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014I).","If a substituent is described as being \u201csubstituted\u201d, a non-hydrogen radical is in the place of hydrogen radical on a carbon or nitrogen of the substituent. Thus, for example, a substituted alkyl substituent is an alkyl substituent in which at least one non-hydrogen radical is in the place of a hydrogen radical on the alkyl substituent. To illustrate, monofluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with a fluoro radical, and difluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with two fluoro radicals. It should be recognized that if there are more than one substitution on a substituent, each non-hydrogen radical may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated).","If a substituent is described as being \u201coptionally substituted\u201d, the substituent may be either (1) not substituted or (2) substituted. If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non-hydrogen radicals, that substituent may be either (1) not substituted; or (2) substituted by up to that particular number of non-hydrogen radicals or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent, whichever is less. Thus, for example, if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non-hydrogen radicals, then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non-hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate, tetrazolyl (which has only one substitutable position) would be optionally substituted with up to one non-hydrogen radical. To illustrate further, if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non-hydrogen radical.","This patent application uses the terms \u201csubstituent\u201d and \u201cradical\u201d interchangeably.","The prefix \u201chalo\u201d indicates that the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with one or more independently selected halogen radicals. For example, haloalkyl means an alkyl substituent in which at least one hydrogen radical is replaced with a halogen radical. Examples of haloalkyls include chloromethyl, 1-bromoethyl, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, and 1,1,1-trifluoroethyl. It should be recognized that if a substituent is substituted by more than one halogen radical, those halogen radicals may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated).","The prefix \u201cperhalo\u201d indicates that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is replaced with independently selected halogen radicals, i.e., each hydrogen radical on the substituent is replaced with a halogen radical. If all the halogen radicals are identical, the prefix typically will identify the halogen radical. Thus, for example, the term \u201cperfluoro\u201d means that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with a fluorine radical. To illustrate, the term \u201cperfluoroalkyl\u201d means an alkyl substituent wherein a fluorine radical is in the place of each hydrogen radical.","The term \u201ccarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014.","The term \u201caminocarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014NH.","The term \u201coxo\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means (\u2550O).","The term \u201coxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an ether substituent, and may be depicted as \u2014O\u2014.","The term \u201calkylhydroxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means -alkyl-OH.","The term \u201calkylamino\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means -alkyl-NH.","The term \u201calkyloxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an alkylether substituent, i.e., \u2014O-alkyl.

Isotope containing compounds have been used in pharmaceutical research to investigate the in vivo metabolic fate of the compounds by evaluation of the mechanism of action and metabolic pathway of the nonisotope-labeled parent compound (Blake et al. 64, 3, 367-391 (1975)). Such metabolic studies are important in the design of safe, effective therapeutic drugs, either because the in vivo active compound administered to the patient or because the metabolites produced from the parent compound prove to be toxic or carcinogenic (Foster et al., Advances in Drug Research Vol. 14, pp. 2-36, Academic press, London, 1985; Kato et al., 36(10):927-932 (1995); Kushner et al., 77, 79-88 (1999).","In addition, non-radio active isotope containing drugs, such as deuterated drugs called \u201cheavy drugs,\u201d can be used for the treatment of diseases and conditions related to Bcl-2 activity. Increasing the amount of an isotope present in a compound above its natural abundance is called enrichment. Examples of the amount of enrichment include from about 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 42, 46, 50, 54, 58, 63, 67, 71, 75, 79, 84, 88, 92, 96, to about 100 mol %. Replacement of up to about 15% of normal atom with a heavy isotope has been effected and maintained for a period of days to weeks in mammals, including rodents and dogs, with minimal observed adverse effects (Czajka D M and Finkel A J, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1960 84: 770; Thomson J F, Ann. New York Acad. Sci 1960 84: 736; Czakja D M et al., 1961 201: 357). Acute replacement of as high as 15%-23% in human fluids with deuterium was found not to cause toxicity (Blagojevic N et al. in \u201cDosimetry & Treatment Planning for Neutron Capture Therapy\u201d, Zamenhof R, Solares G and Harling O Eds. 1994. Advanced Medical Publishing, Madison Wis. pp. 125-134; Diabetes Metab. 23: 251 (1997)).","Stable isotope labeling of a drug can alter its physico-chemical properties such as pKa and lipid solubility. These effects and alterations can affect the pharmacodynamic response of the drug molecule if the isotopic substitution affects a region involved in a ligand-receptor interaction. While some of the physical properties of a stable isotope-labeled molecule are different from those of the unlabeled one, the chemical and biological properties are the same, with one important exception: because of the increased mass of the heavy isotope, any bond involving the heavy isotope and another atom will be stronger than the same bond between the light isotope and that atom. Accordingly, the incorporation of an isotope at a site of metabolism or enzymatic transformation will slow said reactions potentially altering the pharmacokinetic profile or efficacy relative to the non-isotopic compound.","Compounds","Suitable groups for X, X, X, and Rin compounds of Formula (I) are independently selected.

The T-cell then attacks the target cancer cell. Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab (Micromet MT201), blinatumomab (Micromet MT103) and the like. Without being limited by theory, one of the mechanisms by which T-cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule components, which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard, Bcl-2 has been shown to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest that inhibition of Bcl-2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T-cells when targeted to cancer cells (V. R. Sutton, D. L. Vaux and J. A. Trapani, 1997, 158 (12), 5783).","SiRNAs are molecules having endogenous RNA bases or chemically modified nucleotides. The modifications do not abolish cellular activity, but rather impart increased stability and\/or increased cellular potency. Examples of chemical modifications include phosphorothioate groups, 2\u2032-deoxynucleotide, 2\u2032-OCH-containing ribonucleotides, 2\u2032-F-ribonucleotides, 2\u2032-methoxyethyl ribonucleotides, combinations thereof and the like. The siRNA can have varying lengths (e.g., 10-200 bps) and structures (e.g., hairpins, single\/double strands, bulges, nicks\/gaps, mismatches) and are processed in cells to provide active gene silencing. A double-stranded siRNA (dsRNA) can have the same number of nucleotides on each strand (blunt ends) or asymmetric ends (overhangs). The overhang of 1-2 nucleotides can be present on the sense and\/or the antisense strand, as well as present on the 5\u2032- and\/or the 3\u2032-ends of a given strand.","Multivalent binding proteins are binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Multivalent binding proteins are engineered to have the three or more antigen binding sites and are generally not naturally occurring antibodies. The term \u201cmultispecific binding protein\u201d means a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain (DVD) binding proteins are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Such DVDs may be monospecific (i.e., capable of binding one antigen) or multispecific (i.e., capable of binding two or more antigens). DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD Ig's. Each half of a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide, a light chain DVD polypeptide, and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site.","Alkylating agents include

Thus ROCK inhibitors have been suggested for the treatment of restenosis and atherosclerosis (see above (Morishige K, Shimokawa H, Eto Y, Kandabashi T, Miyata K, Matsumoto Y, Hoshijima M, Kaibuchi K, Takeshita A, Adenovirus-mediated transfer of dominant-negative rho-kinase induces a regression of coronary arteriosclerosis in pigs in vivo.

In a study with the ROCK inhibitor fasudil, the intimal thickening and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation was significantly suppressed, whereas VSMC apoptosis was enhanced in the weeks following the procedure, suggesting that ROCK inhibitors can be used as a therapeutic agent for the prevention of graft (Morishige K, Shimokawa H, Eto Y, Kandabashi T, Miyata K, Matsumoto Y, Hoshijima M, Kaibuchi K, Takeshita A, Adenovirus-mediated transfer of dominant-negative rho-kinase induces a regression of coronary arteriosclerosis in pigs in vivo.

Circulation 103, 2001, 284-289).","Injury to the adult vertebrate brain and spinal cord activates ROCKs, thereby causing neurodegeneration and inhibition of neuroregeneration like neurite growth and sprouting (Bito, H., Furuyashiki, T., Ishihara, H., Shibasaki, Y., Ohashi, K., Mizuno, K., Maekawa, M., Ishizaki, T., Narumiya, S., A critical role for a Rho-associated kinase, p 160ROCK, in determining axon outgrowth in mammalian CNS neurons. Neuron 26, 2000, 431-441). Inhibition of ROCKs results in induction of new axonal growth, axonal rewiring across lesions within the CNS, accelerated regeneration and enhanced functional recovery after acute neuronal injury in mammals (spinal-cord injury, traumatic brain injury) (see above (Peters, S. L. et al., Rho kinase: a target for treating urinary bladder dysfunction. Trends Pharmacol Sci. 27, 2006, 492-7) and Hara, M. et al., Protein kinase inhibition by fasudil hydrochloride promotes neurological recovery after spinal cord injury in rats. J. Neurosurg. Spine 93, 94-101; Fournier, A. E., Takizawa, B. T. & Strittmatter, S. M., ROCK inhibition enhances axonal regeneration in the injured CNS. J. Neurosci. 23, 2003, 1416-1423; Sung, J.

ROCK inhibitors are therefore likely to be useful for regenerative (recovery) treatment of CNS disorders such as spinal cord injury, acute neuronal injury (stroke, traumatic brain injury) (Okamura N et al., Vasodilator effects of fasudil, a Rho-kinase inhibitor, on retinal arterioles in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. J Ocul Pharmacol Ther. 23, 2007, 207-12; Yagita Y et al., Rho-kinase activation in endothelial cells contributes to expansion of infarction after focal cerebral ischemia. J Neurosci Res. 85, 2007, 2460-9), Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer disease (Pedrini S et al., Modulation of statin-activated shedding of Alzheimer APP ectodomain by ROCK. PLoS Med. 2, 2005, 18; Burton A., NSAIDS and Alzheimer's disease: it's only Rock and Rho. Lancet Neurol. 3(1), 2004, 6) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Other neurodegenetarive disorders for which ROCK inhibitors are expected to be useful are Huntington's disease (Shao J, Welch W J, Diprospero N A, Diamond M I. Phosphorylation of profilin by ROCK1 regulates polyglutamine aggregation. Mol Cell Biol. 2008 September; 28(17):5196-208; Shao J, Welch W J, Diamond M I. ROCK and PRK-2 mediate the inhibitory effect of Y-27632 on polyglutamine aggregation. FEBS Lett. 2008 May 28; 582(12):1637-42), spinal muscular atrophy (Bowerman M, Shafey D, Kothary R. Smn depletion alters profilin II expression and leads to upregulation of the RhoA\/ROCK pathway and defects in neuronal integrity. J Mol. Neurosci. 2007; 32(2):120-31) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Inhibition of the Rho\/ROCK pathway has also proved to be efficacious in other animal models of neurodegeneration like stroke (Okamura N et al., Vasodilator effects of fasudil, a Rho-kinase inhibitor, on retinal arterioles in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. J Ocul Pharmacol Ther. 23, 2007, 207-12; Yagita Y et al., Rho-kinase activation in endothelial cells contributes to expansion of infarction after focal cerebral ischemia. J Neurosci Res. 85, 2007, 2460-9) and in inflammatory and demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis (Sun X et al., The selective Rho-kinase inhibitor Fasudil is protective and therapeutic in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. J Neuroimmunol 180, 2006, 126-34), acute and chronic pain (Inoue, M. et al., Initiation of neuropathic pain requires lysophosphatidic acid receptor signaling. Nature Med. 10, 2004, 712-718; Ramer, L. M., Borisoff, J. F. & Ramer, M. S., Rho-kinase inhibition enhances axonal plasticity and attenuates cold hyperalgesia after dorsal rhizotomy. J.

Neuroscience 131, 2005, 491-498).","ROCK inhibitors have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties by decreased cytokine release, e.g. TNF\u03b1. Thus they can be used as treatment for neuroinflammatory diseases such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and inflammatory pain, as well as other inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, or inflammatory bowel disease (Segain J. P., Rho kinase blockade prevents inflammation via nuclear factor kappa B inhibition: evidence in Crohn's disease and experimental colitis. Gastroenterology. 124(5), 2003, 1180-7). In addition, recent reports have demonstrated that inhibition of ROCK results in disruption of inflammatory cell chemotaxis as well as inhibition of smooth muscle contraction in models of pulmonary inflammation associated with asthma. Therefore, the inhibitors of the Rho\/ROCK pathway should be useful for the treatment of asthma (see above (Sun X et al., The selective Rho-kinase inhibitor Fasudil is protective and therapeutic in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

C., Rho GTPases: potential candidates for anticancer therapy. Cancer Lett. 206, 2004, 181-191; Yin, L. et al., Fasudil inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mol Cancer Ther 5, 2007, 1517-25.

P., Rho-kinase inhibitor retards migration and in vivo dissemination of human prostate cancer cells. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 269, 2000, 652-659). ROCK inhibitors can also be beneficial in diseases with impaired blood brain barrier function, e.g. HIV-1 encephalitis (Persidski Y et al., Rho-mediated regulation of tight junctions during monocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier in HIV-1 encephalitis (HIVE). Blood. 107, 2006, 4770-4780) and Alzheimer's disease (Man S-M et al., Peripheral T cells overexpress MIP-1a to enhance its transendothelial migration in Alzheimer's disease. Neurobiol. Of Aging 28, 2007, 485-496).","Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that ROCK inhibitors suppress cytoskeletal rearrangement upon virus invasion, thus they also have potential therapeutic value in anti-viral and anti-bacterial applications (Favoreel H W, Cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell extensions induced by the US3 kinase of an alphaherpesvirus are associated with enhanced spread. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 102(25), 2006, 8990-5).","ROCKs have been reported to interfere with insulin signalling through serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), in cultured VSMC. Activation of RhoA\/ROCK was observed in skeletal muscles and aortic tissues of Zucker obese rats. Inhibition of ROCK, by fasudil for 4 weeks, reduced blood pressure, corrected glucose and lipid metabolism, improved insulin signalling and endothelial dysfunction. In another experiment administration of high dose fasudil completely suppressed the development of diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia and increased serum adiponectin levels in OLETF rats. ROCK inhibitors may therefore be useful for the treatment of insulin resistance and diabetes (Nakamura Y et al., Marked increase of insulin gene transcription by suppression of the Rho\/Rho-kinase pathway. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 350(1), 2006, 68-73; Kikuchi Y et al., A Rho-kinase inhibitor, fasudil, prevents development of diabetes and nephropathy in insulin-resistant diabetic rats.

Pharmacol. 568(1-3), 2007, 242-7).","The ROCK inhibitor Fasudil increased cerebral blood flow and was neuroprotective under CNS ischemic conditions. ROCK inhibitors are expected to be useful for the treatment of ischemic CNS disorders and may therefore improve functional outcome in patients suffering from stroke, vascular or AD type dementia (Okamura N et al., Vasodilator effects of fasudil, a Rho-kinase inhibitor, on retinal arterioles in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.
