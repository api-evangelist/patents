title: Information processing apparatus, method and medium using a virtual reality space
abstract: An object in a virtual reality space is made perform complicated movements. A user (or a keeper) who controls an object (or a pet) in a virtual reality space enters a command at the client terminal of the user by means of chat operation. The entered command is sent to a server. The server has a table listing the relationship between commands and movements to be performed by the object in the virtual reality space. For example, the relation is between command “Jump” and movement of jumping. The server interprets the received command by referencing this table. The interpretation result is sent to the client terminal. On the client terminal, the object (the pet) in the virtual reality space performs complicated movements such as dancing according to the received interpretation result.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This patent application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/229,819, filed on Jan. 13, 1999, which is incorporated herein by reference, now abandoned.","The present invention generally relates to an information processing apparatus, an information processing method, and an information providing medium. More particularly, the present invention relates to an information processing apparatus, an information processing method, and information providing medium that control a virtual reality life object to be reared in a virtual reality space.","A cyberspace service named Habitat (registered trademark) is known in so-called personal computer communications services such as NIFTY-Serve (registered trademark) of Japan and CompuServe (registered trademark) of US in which a plurality of users connect their personal computers via modems and public telephone networks to the host computers installed at the centers of the services to access them in predetermined protocols.","Development of Habitat started in 1985 by Lucas Film of the US, operated by Quantum Link, one of US commercial networks, for about three years. Then, Habitat started its service in NIFTY-Serve as Fujitsu Habitat (trademark) in February 1990. In Habitat, users can send their alter egos called avatars (the incarnation of a god figuring in the Hindu mythology) into a virtual city called Populopolis drawn by two-dimensional graphics to have a chat (namely, a realtime conversation based on text entered and displayed) with each other. For further details of Habitat, refer to the Japanese translation \u201cpp. 282-307\u201d of \u201cCyberspace: First Steps,\u201d Michael Benedikt, ed., 1991, MIT Press Cambridge, Mass., ISBN0-262-02327-X, the translation being published Mar. 20, 1994, by NTT Publishing, ISBN4-87188-265-9C0010.","In the conventional cyberspace systems operated by personal computer communications services such as mentioned above, a virtual street and the inside of a room for example are drawn in two-dimensional graphics. Therefore, moving an avatar in the depth direction is realized simply by moving it up and down in the background of the two-dimensional graphics. This results in a poor expression in simulating walking and movement in a virtual reality space. Also, the two-dimensional virtual reality space in which own avatar and the avatar of another user are displayed is viewed from a viewpoint of a third party, thereby impairing the sense of simulated experience.","To overcome this drawback, a capability that enables a user to walk as desired with the viewpoint of the avatar of the user in a virtual reality space represented in three-dimensional graphics is realized by use of a three-dimensional graphics data description language called VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 09-81781 corresponding to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/678,340. Considerations about various cyberspaces in which chat is made by use of the avatar of a user are described in NIKKEI Electronics, Sep. 9, 1996, No. 670, pp. 151-159.","Recently, breeding simulation games for breeding tropical fish and a virtual reality creature having artificial intelligence living in a virtual world for example have come to be available as personal computer software programs. A product is also known that displays a simulated pet such as a dog or a cat on an electronic notepad to enjoy the process of its growth (refer to NIKKEI Electronics, Apr. 7, 1997, No. 686, pp. 131-134). In addition, \u201cTamagotchi\u201d (registered trademark) developed and commercialized by Bandai Co. is widely known that is an egg-sized portable virtual reality pet with a breeding simulation game program as mentioned above incorporated.","Virtual reality pets of this type have a CPU (Central Processing Unit), a ROM (Read Only Memory), a RAM (Random Access Memory) and so on mounted on a single-chip LSI (Large Scale Integration), a breeding simulation game program being stored in the ROM, the figure and state of the pet being displayed on an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) device. The user gives such instructions by operating buttons as \u201cfeed\u201d and \u201cclean up\u201d for example necessary for breeding the virtual reality creature as a pet. As a result of caring, the virtual reality creature displayed on the LCD grows stepwise from an egg to a chick to a grown-up bird for example in its external view.","The virtual reality creature is programmed such that proper instructions given help the virtual reality creature grow without problem and improper instructions given make it sick or, in the worst case, die. Further, the virtual reality creature is programmed to make various requests based on the time elapsing from its birth provided by an incorporated calendar timer. For example, in the nighttime zone, the virtual reality creature requests a sleep and, in the mealtime zone, it requests food. In other times, the virtual reality creature requests, at random, snack and play for example. If the user fails to answer these requests properly, the growth of the virtual reality creature may be retarded or its character worsens. If the user answers properly, the life of the virtual reality creature is lengthened.","Meanwhile, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 07-160853 corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. 5,572,646 discloses a technology applicable to an electronic notepad for example for displaying images according to the growth processes of a virtual reality creature such as an animal or a plant. To be more specific, bit-map images representing the growth processes of a plant character for example are stored in the ROM in the electronic notepad. The plant character according to the degree of growth is displayed on the LCD of the electronic notepad and, at the same time, characters representing plant growing elements (water, light, and fertilizer for example) are displayed. Necessary amounts of these growing elements are inputted by operating corresponding keys on the electronic notepad. The inputted values are set to a water amount register, a light amount register, and a fertilizer amount register respectively in the RAM of the electronic notepad. Based on the values set to these registers, a new degree of growth is computed. Then, the plant character corresponding to the computed degree of growth is read from the ROM to be displayed on the LCD. Thus, the plant growth process according to the state of cultivation by the user is displayed.","However, having a virtual reality pet perform a predetermined movement in such a virtual reality space as described above requires a user to select predetermined buttons. This consequently prevents the user from having a virtual reality pet perform complicated movements or unique movements.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an information processing apparatus, an information processing method, and an information providing medium that allow a user to have a virtual reality pet perform complicated or unique movements in a simple and reliable manner.","In carrying out the invention and according to a first aspect thereof, there is provided an information processing method for receiving the provision of a virtual reality space from a server through a network, comprising steps of: inputting a command for making an object under control in the virtual reality space perform a predetermined movement; sending the command to the server; receiving a control instruction for controlling a behavior of the object under control in response to the command from the server; and controlling, based on the control instruction, the displaying of the object under control.","In carrying out the invention and according to a second aspect thereof, there is provided an information processing apparatus connected to a server through a network for receiving the provision of a virtual reality space, comprising: an inputting means for inputting a command for making an object under control in the virtual reality space perform a predetermined movement; a sending means for sending the command to the server; a receiving means for receiving a control instruction for controlling a behavior of the object under control in response to the command from the server; and a control means for controlling, based on the control instruction, the displaying of the object under control.","In carrying out the invention and according to a third aspect thereof, there is provided an information providing medium for providing a computer program comprising steps of: inputting a command for making an object under control in the virtual reality space perform a predetermined movement; sending the command to the server; receiving a script for controlling a behavior of the object under control in response to the command from the server; and controlling, based on the script, the displaying of the object under control.","In carrying out the invention and according to a fourth aspect thereof, there is provided an information processing method for providing a virtual reality space to a client terminal connected through a network, comprising steps of: receiving a command associated with a predetermined movement to be performed by an object under control in the virtual reality space from the client terminal; interpreting the command received by the receiving step by referencing a table listing a relationship between the command and the predetermined movement to be performed by the object under control; and transmitting a control instruction for controlling the displaying of the object under control based on a result of the interpretation by the interpreting step.","In carrying out the invention and according to a fifth aspect thereof, there is provided an information processing apparatus for providing a virtual reality space to a client terminal connected to the information processing apparatus through a network, comprising: a receiving means for receiving a command associated with a predetermined movement to be performed by an object under control in the virtual reality space from the client terminal; a storing means for storing a table listing a relationship between the command and the predetermined movement to be performed by the object under control; an interpreting means for interpreting the command received by the receiving means by referencing the table; and transmitting a control instruction for controlling the displaying of the object under control based on a result of the interpretation by the interpreting means.","In carrying out the invention and according to a sixth aspect thereof, there is provided an information providing means for providing a computer program for providing a virtual reality space to a client terminal connected through a network, the computer program comprising steps of: receiving a command associated with a predetermined movement to be performed by an object under control in the virtual reality space from the client terminal; interpreting the command received by the receiving step by referencing a table listing a relationship between the command and the predetermined movement to be performed by the object under control; and transmitting a control instruction for controlling the displaying of the object under control based on a result of the interpretation by the interpreting step.","This invention will be described in further detail by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings.","First, there will be described VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language), which is a descriptive language enabling users to integrally handle three-dimensional information by use of the framework of the WWW (World Wide Web) for providing a variety of information through the Internet, a computer network built worldwide.","Meanwhile, for an information providing system available on the Internet, the WWW developed by CERN (European Center for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland is known. This technology allows a user to browse information including text, image and voice for example in the hyper text form. Based on HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol), the information stored in a WWW server terminal is sent asynchronously to terminals such as personal computers.","The WWW server is constituted by server software called an HTTP daemon and an HTML file in which hyper text information is stored. The wording \u201cdaemon\u201d means a program for executing management and processing in the background upon working on UNIX. The hyper text information is described in a description language called HTML (Hyper Text Makeup Language). In the description of a hypertext by HTML, a logical structure of a document is expressed in a format specification called a tag enclosed by \u201c<\u201d and \u201c>\u201d. Description of linking to other information is made based on link information called an anchor. A method in which a location at which required information is stored by the anchor is URL (Uniform Resource Locator).","A protocol for transferring a file described in HTML on the TCP\/IP (Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol) network is HTTP. This protocol has a capability of transferring a request for information from a client to the WWW server and the requested hyper text information stored in the HTML file to the client.","Used by many as an environment for using the WWW is client software such as Netscape Navigator (trademark of Netscape Communications Corp. of US) called a WWW browser.","Use of the WWW browser allows users to browse files, which are called home pages, corresponding to URLs stored in WWW servers on the Internet built worldwide, thereby performing net-surfing by sequentially following home pages linked to each other to access a variety of WWW information sources.","Recently, a VRML browser has been developed by extending this WWW. The VRML browser displays a three-dimensional space described in a three-dimensional graphics language called VRML that enables description of a three-dimensional space and setting of hypertext links to objects drawn in three-dimensional graphics, thereby allowing users to follow these links to sequentially access WWW servers.","Details of VRML are described in the Japanese translation of \u201cVRML: Browsing & Building Cyberspace,\u201d Mark Pesce, 1995, New Readers Publishing, ISBN 1-56205-498-8, the translation being entitled \u201cGetting to Know VRML: Building and Browsing Three-Dimensional Cyberspace,\u201d translated by Kouichi Matsuda, Terunao Gamaike, Shouichi Takeuchi, Yasuaki Honda, Junichi Rekimoto, Masayuki Ishikawa, Takeshi Miyashita and Kazuhiro Hara, published on Mar. 25, 1996, Prenticehall Publishing, ISBN4-931356-37-0, as well as \u201cMost Recent Trend of VRML And CyberPassage,\u201d Koichi Matsuda and Yasuaki Honda, the bit Magazine, Kyoritsu Publishing, 1996, Vol. 28, No. 7, pp. 29-36, No. 8, pp. 57-65, No. 9, pp. 29-36, No. 10, pp. 49-58.","The authorized and complete specifications of the Virtual Reality Modeling Language Version 2.0, ISO\/IEC CD 14772, released on Aug. 4, 1996, are available on the Internet.","Further, for the browser for VRML 2.0 and the software for shared server, Sony Corporation, the present applicant, has developed and commercialized as Community Place Browser\/Bureau (registered trademark), of which beta version is downloadable from the Internet home page of Sony.","To build a three-dimensional virtual reality space by use of VRML 2.0, a VRML file for representing a desired content is created by generating graphics data indicative of the shape and behavior of an object (or a model) in the virtual reality space by use of VRML (model creation), adding the model in the virtual reality space displayed on the screen to a switch (or a sensor) for generating an event when the user clicks the model with the mouse for example, programming (or scripting) a script for realizing an event to be generated when the sensor is pointed, and relating (or routing) between graphics data and script (hereafter, common nodes such as write specified in graphics data, script, and VRML are also generically referred to as nodes) such as operating the sensor and starting the script.","The following describes a mechanism for implementing an autonomous behavior in a VRML space, a new feature provided by VRML 2.0, not supported by VRML 1.0.","VRML 2.0 data is constituted by a node and a field, which is basically written as follows:","Node {Field(s)}","In the above-mentioned file syntax, \u201cField (s)\u201d may be omitted but \u201cNode\u201d and the braces \u201c{\u201c, \u201d}\u201d cannot. A field passes a variable to a node to specify a node parameter. If the field is omitted, a default is used. There are two types of fields. A single-value field (SF) having only one value and a multiple-value field (MF) having two or more values. Each single-value field begins with \u201cSF\u201d and each multiple-value field begins with \u201cMF.\u201d","VRML 2.0 realizes an autonomous movement (behavior) of an object according to an event to be caused by an operation performed on the object arranged in a three-dimensional virtual reality space and a timer event that occurs when a preset time has been reached. The mechanism of this Behavior is realized by the cooperation of three elements; sensor, routing, and script as follows.","(1) A sensor node described as a VRML file related to a node such as an object arranged in a three-dimensional virtual reality space beforehand senses an external event based on a change in its field value to generate an event in a VRML scene.","(2) The generated event is transmitted to an external script, which is a program for specifying the behavior of the object based on a routing described as a VRML file.","(3) The external script describes beforehand a method to be called when a particular event is received. The external script, which has received the event transmitted by the routing, executes the processing based on the description and then changes the value of the field of the corresponding node in the VRML scene based on the result of the processing and the description of the routing.","For sensor nodes, the VRML 2.0 defines TouchSensor that causes an event when the pointing device passes over a specified object or the same is clicked by the user, ProximitySensor that causes an event when ViewPoint (of the user) enters a specified region, and TimeSensor that is caused every time a preset time interval elapses, for example.","The following describes the mechanism of Behavior in more detail. As described above, the mechanism of Behavior is implemented by a sensor, an event, a routing, and a script.","The sensor is functionally divided into the following two types:","the type for sensing a user operation; and","the type for sensing a system change.","The sensor for sensing a user operation provides a software switch related to an object arranged in a three-dimensional virtual reality space. The sensor for sensing a system change starts a timer preset to a start time. These sensors sense these external events and convert them into events inside VRML.","The event indicates data for transmitting information between associated nodes in VRML. Actually, a change in a field value described in a VRML file is transmitted as an event.","The routing is a mechanism for specifying to which node an event sensed by the sensor capability is to be transmitted. Actually, the routing specifies a path of information transmission by the event.","The script provides an input\/output port, performs some computation from an inputted event, and outputs a result of the computation. The script is not restricted to a particular language. In the current stage, the script can be written in Java (registered trademarks of Sun Microsystems, Inc. of US) and JavaScript noticed in the Internet, C language widely used in ordinary systems, Tcl\/Tk and PERL widely used in UNIX, or Visual Basic provided by Microsoft Corporation of US. Thus, VRML 2.0 does not depend on a particular script language (in the course of defining VRML 2.0 specifications, employment of VRMLScript as particular language specifications was discussed but this idea was eventually discarded).","The following describes the processing means of Behavior with reference to . The processing by Behavior is diagramatically represented as shown in . The Following Describes Flows of Processing Signals.","(1) Sensor Node","As described above, the sensor node is largely classified into two types; a sensor for sensing a user operation and a sensor for sensing a system change.","The sensor for sensing a user operation has sensor nodes such as TouchSensor and PlaneSensor for sensing a mouse click on a three-dimensional object and passing of a pointing device over a plane of the three-dimensional object. The sensor for sensing a system change has TimeSensor adapted to generate an event when a preset time has been reached.","In the example of , it is assumed that TouchSensor is attached to a sphere. When an user clicks the sphere, this event is sensed by TouchSensor. This event is sensed because the field value of the eventOut field of TouchSensor changes. Generally, one mouse click operation generates two events; namely, the timing of pressing the mouse button and the timing of releasing the mouse button.","Then, this event is routed by the routing description part.","(2) Routing","\u201cRoute\u201d as shown in  specifies routing of this event.","When an event caused in the sensor description part is transmitted to the eventOut field of the Route and then to a script node to be described below, the event is passed to the external file, upon which the Behavior capability is executed.","(3) Script Node","This is a node for mediating the interlocking between a VRML file and an external script. This node specifies the language in which the description is made and a file name according to the description format of the script node, and the eventIn field and the eventOut field in order to give and take the event to and from the external script file. Available script files include those written in Java, JavaScript, C language, Tcl\/Tk, PERL, and Visual Basic.","In actual processing, the processing is transmitted to the script file in which the routed event is described in the script node and the external script file is executed. The external script file is received through eventIn (event entrance) defined in it and the processing described in that file is executed. When this processing has come to an end, the processing result is returned through eventOut (event exit) to the routing of the VRML file. The VRML file executes this returned result, upon which the series of Behavior processing operations come to an end.","Use of the mechanism of Behavior to be realized by the above-mentioned cooperation between the sensor, the routing, and the script allows the user to dynamically change the external view (shape, attitude, size, color, and so on) or behavioral sequence for example of an object arranged in a three-dimensional virtual reality space by clicking an object resembling a switch also arranged in this space.","Details of the Behavior mechanism are disclosed in Section 4 \u201cConcept\u201d in the Specifications \u201cThe Virtual Reality Modeling Language Version 2.0,\u201d ISO\/IEC CD 14772, Aug. 4, 1996, which are available on the Internet. This section describes the key concepts of the VRML specifications. These concepts include various general node-related items such as a method of linking a node to a scene graph, a method in which a node generates or receives an event, a method of generating a node type by a prototype, a method in which a node type is added to VRML and then exported to be made available from outside, and a method of incorporating a script to operate as a program into a VRML file.","The following describes a technology in which, by application of the mechanism for realizing the above-mentioned autonomous movement (Behavior) of VRML 2.0, a virtual reality life object is created in a shared virtual reality space, growth parameters (external growth or internal growth (personality)) that change according to the generation of an event such as a user operation or passing of a predetermined time are controlled by a server, and a script program for dynamically changing one or both of the external view (shape, attitude, size, color, and so on) and the behavioral sequence of the created virtual reality life object based on the growth parameters transferred from this server is interpreted and executed, thereby displaying the virtual reality life object according to the growth parameters.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"In , a VRML browser and a WWW browser are installed client PCs (Personal Computers)  through , which are connected to the Internet  through IPs (Internet Service Providers)  through .","A LAN (Local Area Network)  connected to the Internet  through a router  is connected to a WWW server , a WLS (World Location Server) , a shared server , AO (Application Object) servers  and , a mail server , and a communication server .

If the contacting means is , contact to the keeper is performed by converting text data of a message statement into a voice by an automatic reading tool on the communication server  and inputting the voice into the analog telephone . If the contacting means is , contact to the keeper is performed by a message statement to the portable telephone terminal  by use of an electronic mail service based on the data transmission protocol of wireless communication. If the contacting means is , contact to the keeper is performed by a written document to the facsimile . If the contacting means is , contact to the keeper is performed by a message statement to the pager terminal .","The keeper data as described above is controlled to realize the capability of contacting the keeper by use of the existing communication infrastructure to be describe later and the capability of simplified operation of a virtual reality pet by use of the existing communication infrastructure.","The above-mentioned system is summarized as follows. Namely, the growth parameter (indicative of outer growth or inner growth (personality)) of a virtual reality life object existing in a shared virtual reality space is controlled by the AO server , this growth parameter changing with occurrence of a predetermined event (an event caused by a user operation or passing of predetermined time). Based on the growth parameter transferred from the AO server , the script for dynamically changing one or both of the appearance (shape, attitude, size, or color) and the behavioral sequence of the virtual reality life object is interpreted to display the virtual reality life object according to the growth parameter on the client PCs  and .","The AO server  for controlling the autonomous behavior of a virtual reality life object existing in a shared virtual reality space is provided with a control table for controlling growth parameters for the virtual reality life object that change with occurrence of a predetermined event (an event caused by a user operation or passing of a predetermined time). A growth parameter read from the control table upon request from a client or occurrence of a predetermined demand is sent to one or both of the requesting client and another client.","As described above, the growth parameter is a value indicative of the degree of external growth to be calculated based on the occurrence of a predetermined event (an event caused by a user operation or passing of a predetermined time) from the birth of a virtual reality life object. Therefore, the outer growth parameter defines the outer change of a virtual reality creature or a virtual reality pet (AO) according to the age from baby to grown-up to aged.","The growth parameter is also a value indicative of the degree of inner growth (character) to be calculated based the occurrence of a predetermined event (a user operation or passing of a predetermined time) for a virtual reality life object. For example, a virtual reality life object having a sociable and positive character takes on good attitude and countenance. Conversely, a virtual reality life object having a dark and negative character takes on bad attitude and countenance. Thus, the change in the character of a virtual reality creature or a virtual reality pet (AO) is specified by the inner growth parameter.","For the inner growth parameter, a different value is calculated according to the type of an event for a virtual reality life object, updating the degree of the inner growth. If the character of a virtual reality pet for example is controlled by the AO server , 0.1 point is added to a predetermined index of the growth parameter according to the type of a message sent from each client; for example, every time the virtual reality pet is talked to in chat. Every time, the virtual reality pet is praised by pressing of the praise button D, 0.2 point is added. Every time the virtual reality pet is scolded by pressing of the scold button F, 0.2 point is subtracted from the predetermined index. Thus, the calculation is performed based on predetermined arithmetic equations.","The AO server  for controlling the autonomous behavior of a virtual reality life object in a shared virtual reality space is provided with a growth parameter control table indicative of the degree of growth of each virtual reality life object. This control table holds the birth date of each virtual reality life object. Based on the elapsed time starting from this birth date, the growth parameter according to the age of each virtual reality life object is calculated. The control table is updated by the newly calculated growth parameter.","The autonomous behaviors of plural virtual reality life objects in a shared virtual reality space are independently controlled by the AO server  (the single AO server  may control plural growth parameter control tables or the AO server  and the AO server  may control the plural control tables separately). Thus, the growth parameter control tables indicative of the growth degrees of different virtual reality life objects may be provided separately to control the growth parameters of the different virtual reality life objects independently.","In addition, various applications such as described below for example are possible.","For example, the AO server  for controlling the autonomous behavior of a virtual reality life object in a shared virtual reality space may be provided with a control table for controlling the ID (a nickname for example of the virtual reality life object set by user) of a client who has accessed the virtual reality life object (the control items of this control table may be included in the growth parameter control table or this control table may be provided independently). Based on this control table, an event indicative of an intimacy emotional expression may be started according to the access by the client having this ID. Thus, holding the degree of intimacy (access count and contents) on the AO server  can realize a pet (virtual reality life) object that approaches its keeper when the keeper has entered the world (the shared virtual reality space).","The ID of a client who has set or reset a virtual reality life object may be stored in the growth parameter control table as the keeper of this virtual reality life object. Updating of this ID is disabled until the life of the virtual reality life object expires. At the time of the expiration, this ID may be deleted. This can realize a virtual reality pet that is loyal to its keeper who has given birth to it (namely set it in the shared virtual reality space). Further, when the life of a virtual reality life object expires (namely, it is reset), a child of this virtual reality life object may be automatically generated and the ID of the keeper of its parent may be set to this child. This makes the child pet be also loyal to the keeper of its ancestor.","The AO server  may be provided with a history control table for controlling the history of a client who has set or reset a virtual reality life object. The client higher in access frequency than other clients can start a behavioral sequence indicative of more intimate emotional expression. As the access frequency lowers, the degree of intimacy lowers, thereby realizing a whimsical pet of which degree of intimacy changes with access frequency.","If the movement of a virtual reality life object is controlled according to the position of client in a shared virtual reality space, the virtual reality life object immediately appears just in front of the client (keeper) when the client enters the shared virtual reality space, thereby realizing the virtual reality life object that always follows its keeper about.","An intimate expression of feelings may be realized by making a virtual reality life object periodically report an event in a shared virtual reality space (for example, an event of being fed by another client) to its client through a text-based chat window.","Experience of an event in a shared virtual reality space may be reported from the virtual reality life object to the client through a voice chat to provide an intimacy emotional expression. Alternatively, this report may be made through a voice chat capability as an analog voice message based on text-to-voice conversion supported by text reading software. Alternatively still, several types of voice messages may be sampled and compressed to be stored as digital voice compressed data in the hard disk (of the AO server  or the client PC ). Then, an optimum voice message is selectively read from the hard disk, decompressed, and reported to the client as an analog voice message through the voice chat capability. For the conversion between text and voice, the technology disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 09-214486 corresponding to U.S. application Ser. No. 08\/789,083 is available.","The following describes the capability of notification to the client based on an existing communication infrastructure and the capability of simplifying the operation of a virtual reality pet based on an existing communication infrastructure.","For example, if the appetite index of a virtual reality life object increases or its remaining life time goes below a predetermined value, the virtual reality life object (the AO server ) notifies, through the mail server  or the communication server , its keeper at the keeper's address of contact of this change by use of the contacting means () previously set to the growth parameter control table. If the keeper cannot immediately access the personal computer under situations that the keeper is away from the personal computer or the personal computer itself is malfunctioning for example, the keeper can later check requests of the virtual reality pet and make communication with it.","On the other hand, a service provider for providing services for virtual reality pet breeding such as described so far can evoke a motivation of a kind that the user must soon access the virtual reality pet. This provides a by-product that the service provider can ensure regular access, contributing to its stable management.","The following describes a particular example for realizing the above-mentioned notification capability based on an existing communication infrastructure.","The communication server , one of the servers for controlling the autonomous behavior of a virtual reality life object in a shared virtual reality space, is provided with a communication control table (a table corresponding to the keeper data in the growth parameter control table shown in ) for controlling the type of a message notification means (or a message notification method) for making notification to the user, or the keeper of each virtual reality life object and controlling the address of contact of the keeper. As the state of the virtual reality life object changes (the communication server  is notified of this change by the AO server ), the message is sent to the address of contact by use of the communication means registered in the communication control table. This allows actual communication from the shared virtual world to the real world.","The ID for identifying each user, or the keeper of each virtual reality life object and the history access by the user having this ID are controlled by this communication control table. Based on the access history, a message \u201cI miss you\u201d for example may be sent to a user who has not accessed his or her virtual reality life object for over a certain period.","Further, based on the access history, an optimum message statement may be selected from among plural message statements. The day after the day on which access has been made by the user, a message \u201cThank you for playing with me. Let's play again\u201d for example may be sent from the virtual reality life object to its keeper. If no access has been made for over one week for example, a message \u201cAre you busy these days? Please come to play with me sometimes\u201d for example is sent.","A transition in the state of a virtual reality life object is sensed based on the updated content of the growth parameter control table, an optimum message statement is selected from among plural message statements, and the selected message is sent. For example, the day after the day on which the virtual reality life object has been fed much, a message \u201cI'm still full\u201d for example is sent. If no access has been made for one week for example, a message \u201cI'm starving to death\u201d for example is sent. In a scenario in which a virtual reality life object is aged one year in one week, its birthday comes every week and a message \u201cI have become  years old today. Please look at grown-up me\u201d for example is sent. If the allocated remaining life time is nearly expiring, a message \u201cI have to go somewhere far away soon. Please be with me when I die\u201d for example is sent.","The mail server  may be provided with a part of the communication control table associated with electronic mail to send a text-based message to the keeper of each virtual reality life object at his or her electronic mail address (including his or her ID) by the communication control table of the mail server .","In addition to an electronic mail transmitted through the Internet , a message may be sent from the communication server  through the public telephone network  to the portable telephone terminal  based on wireless communication or to the pager terminal  to be displayed on the LCD of the wireless telephone terminal or the pager.","Alternatively, the telephone number (including the ID) of the user of each virtual reality life object may be controlled by the communication control table to automatically call the user at his or her registered telephone number from the communication server , thereby sending a voice message. In this case, this notification may be made as an analog voice message based on text-to-voice conversion supported by text reading software through the ordinary telephone  or the portable telephone terminal . Alternatively, several types of voice messages may be sampled and compressed to be stored as digital voice compressed data in the hard disk (of the AO server  or the client PC ) Then, an optimum voice message is selectively read from the hard disk, decompressed, and reported to the client as an analog voice message.","The facsimile number (including the ID) of the user of each virtual reality life object may be controlled by the communication control table to automatically call the user at this facsimile number, thereby sending a message to the facsimile .","Further, by use of a terminal such as the telephone  that has received the above-mentioned message from the virtual reality pet, two-way communication may be made between the keeper and its virtual reality pet from this terminal by a simplified operation.","The following describes a particular example of realizing the capability of performing a simplified operation on a virtual reality pet by use of an existing communication infrastructure.","For example, the shared server  can interpret an operation command returned with the ID (caller ID) of the user through the portable telephone terminal  or the telephone , recognize the operation command as a message to the corresponding virtual reality life object, send the message to the AO server , and reflect the content of the message onto the state transition (updating of a growth parameter) of the virtual reality life object.","For the above-mentioned returned operation command, a DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) signal that is generated when a push button on the telephone  is pressed for example may be used.","In addition, by use of Web-On-Call (registered trademark) voice browser by NetPhonic Communications Inc. for example, various notifications to a virtual reality pet may be made.

Moreover, this voice browser can also send text by facsimile or electronic mail.","It should be noted that the shared server , the AO servers  and , the mail server , and the communication server  execute various capabilities in a shared manner, thereby realizing a service for providing a shared virtual reality space to client PCs as a whole system.","The following describes a chat capability to be executed in this shared virtual reality space. Chat is classified into public chat and personal chat. In public chat, conversation uttered by one client (user) at a predetermined location in the shared virtual reality space is transmitted to other nearby clients (users).","In personal chat, conversation is made only with a specified party.

If the keeper enters \u201cDance: Jump Stand (Right arm Up+Left arm Up) * 2) for example in step S, this command is interpreted in the AO server  in step S. The AO server  references the behavior command control table and interprets the command as follows.","First, \u201cDance:\u201d, denoting that a dance command follows, is a control identifier for making distinction from a normal conversation (chat) with a virtual reality pet or another avatar (user) accessing a shared virtual reality space. Having detected such a control identifier in a chat text transmitted from a client, the AO server  interprets the subsequent command. In this example, \u201cJump\u201d denotes a jump at a particular position, \u201cStand\u201d denotes standing on the hind legs, the opening parenthesis \u201c(\u201d denotes the start of grouping, \u201cRight arm\u201d specifies the right forefoot, \u201cUp\u201d denotes raising of the right forefoot, \u201c+\u201d denotes a subsequent motion to be performed with the right forefoot raised, \u201cLeft arm\u201d denotes raising of the left forefoot, the closing parenthesis \u201c)\u201d denotes the end of grouping, and \u201c*2\u201d denotes that the grouped motion is to be repeated twice.","The AO server  sends a script for specifying the motions to be performed by the virtual reality pet based on the interpreted command to the shared server  in step S. The shared server  transfers the received script to the client PC , which is the keeper of the virtual reality pet, and the client PC  sharing the virtual reality space by means of multicast processing in step S.","Based on the received motion parameter (namely the script), the client PC  executes a dance script program written with a processing procedure for controlling the behaviors such as dance of the virtual reality pet in step S, the field values of the nodes forming the 3D object representing the virtual reality pet are modified in step S, the virtual reality pet resulted from the modification is rendered in step S, and the rendered virtual reality pet is displayed in the main window of the VRML browser on the CRT monitor  of the client PC .","Namely, in the command example shown in , a dog (the virtual reality pet) that jumps and stands on the hind legs and then raises both forefeet twice is displayed in the main window of the VRML browser on the CRT monitor  of the client PC .  shows a display example of a predetermined timing of the dog performing the above-mentioned motions.  also shows the entered and executed dance command in the Chat Log in which chat contents are written.","Normally, chat window is used for conversation with another user accessing the shared virtual reality space through the avatar, in which an inputted conversation sentence is transmitted to the AO server  through the shared server .

In doing so, the command (\u201cDance\u201d in this example) for executing a predetermined control instruction is transmitted from the client PC  and the client PC  to the AO server  in the same manner as a normal conversation sentence is transmitted. The AO server  interprets the received command and accordingly generates a script for making the virtual reality pet perform the specified motions and sends the generated script to the client PCs through the shared server .","Obviously, other commands than \u201cDance\u201d may be prepared.

In addition, meaningless words may be inputted as commands to make a virtual reality pet perform meaningless movements.","A virtual reality pet may ignore a command issued by its keeper in some situations. For example, if the mood index as a growth parameter of a virtual reality pet is low (namely, the virtual reality pet is in a bad mood) or the intelligent quotient is low, the virtual reality pet may not respond to a given command.","Obviously, the commands that can be issued to a virtual reality pet are not limited to those listed above. The keeper may add his or her unique commands. Further, a dance contest may be held by gathering keepers in a shared virtual reality space and having their virtual reality pets dance.","In the above-mentioned embodiment, dedicated commands for making a virtual reality pet perform movements are prepared and, when one of these commands is located at the beginning of a sentence, a script for controlling the virtual reality pet is generated. It will be apparent that a word may be automatically extracted from a natural conversation of a user and, based on the extracted word, the script may be generated.","It will also be apparent that, by determining the nickname column in the growth parameter control table shown in , a script for controlling only an object (a virtual reality pet) responsive to a nickname may be generated. For example, when a command \u201cTaro, Sit Down\u201d is entered, the AO server  compares the command with the growth parameter control table and generates a script for controlling the object (the virtual reality pet) having the nickname corresponding to \u201cTaro\u201d.","It should be noted that the medium for providing the computer program for executing the above-mentioned processing includes not only information recording media such as a magnetic disc and a CD-ROM but also networks such as the Internet and a digital satellite.","According to the above-mentioned embodiment, a client transmits a command to a server and receives a script for controlling the behavior of a virtual reality life object in response to the command from the server. Based on the script, display of the virtual reality life object on the client is controlled. Consequently, the novel constitution allows the virtual reality life object to perform complicated and unique movements.","Besides, a command issued by a client is interpreted by the server by referencing a table listing a relationship between commands and movements to be performed by a virtual reality life object and, based on an interpretation result, a script for controlling the displaying of the movement of the virtual reality life object in response to the command is transmitted from the server to the client apparatus. Consequently, the novel constitution can provides a shared virtual reality space in which a virtual reality life object can perform complicated and unique movements.","While the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described using specific terms, such description is for illustrative purposes only, and it is to be understood that changes and variations may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and other objects of the invention will be seen by reference to the description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawing, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 23"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
