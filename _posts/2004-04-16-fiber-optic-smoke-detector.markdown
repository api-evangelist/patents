title: Fiber optic smoke detector
abstract: A passive sensor housing has an air gap formed therein between a collimating lens and a lens focused mirror reflecting optical light signals transmitted through the lens into the air gap within which smoke is received through screened openings in the housing. The optical light signals which are generated within an opto-electronics unit are returned thereto by reflection through the air gap into a fiber cable connected to the collimating lens of the sensor and to an optical coupler within the opto-electronic unit to which generated light signals are delivered from a light emitting diode and returned from the sensor for delivery to a receiver within which such signals are processed into an output signal reflecting smoke density within the air gap.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention relates generally to the detection of smoke.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","Smoke detection is presently concerned primarily with aerosol content of smoke produced by burning of material under different conditions which significantly affect aerosol property of the smoke, such as particle size and distribution quantified in terms of percentage obscuration involving the interaction of light wave radiation with the smoke aerosols producing scattering and absorption of the light waves due to the presence of the smoke. Currently there are two basic types of smoke detectors used for fire detection purpose when smoke density exceeds a certain threshold. One of such smoke detectors is of an ionization chamber type within which radioactive, charged plate electric field is established through which ionized air molecules migrate to trigger a fire indicating alarm. Such smoke detectors however have a high false alarm rate tendency caused by airborne dust and water droplets. False alarms caused by airborne dirt or water droplets are applicable to the other types of photoelectric smoke detectors, wherein smoke particles entering an optically powered illuminated test chamber scatter light in all directions causing light collection. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide a smoke detector which avoids the aforementioned false alarms and other disadvantages associated with the ionization chamber and aforementioned photoelectric types of smoke detectors.","Pursuant to the present invention, shifts in optical power spectrum of light returned from a passive sensor through a fiber cable is detected to measure smoke density. Light originating from an opto-electronic unit enters the sensor through the same fiber cable and is collimated through a lens before traversing a short length air gap for focused reflection by a mirror back through the lens and return through the fiber cable to the remotely located opto-electronic unit within which the light is generated and compared with the light being returned from the sensor to determine the optical spectrum shift and related obscuration within the sensor air gap.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrates a smoke detector system  featuring a sensor  adapted to be positioned within an air space test location for detection of smoke therein. The sensor  is connected by a fiber cable  to an opto-electronics unit  which may be remotely spaced therefrom. Standard smoke density data is transmitted from the unit  to an indicator , pursuant to the present invention as hereinafter explained.","As shown in , ,  and , the sensor  has an axially elongated cylindrical housing  closed at one axial end by a mirror  held in position within the housing  between a mirror mount  and a retention ring . An air gap  of relatively short axial length, such as 2 inches, is formed within the housing , sealed between a concave surface  of the mirror  focusing reflected optical signal light through the air gap  onto a graded-index micro-lens  positioned within a lens mount  closing the other axial end of the housing  opposite the mirror . Such lens  collimates the optical signal light entering into the lens mount  of the sensor  from the fiber cable  to prevent it from spreading outwardly across the air gap  within the housing . Also formed in the housing  as shown in ,  and  are angularly spaced openings in screening  through which inflow smoke may be received within the air gap .","Referring now to , the opto-electronics unit  is provided with a broad band light-emitting diode  centered around 465 manometers to produce an optical signal applied to one leg (a) of an optical coupler . One outgoing optical signal exits from the coupler  through its leg (c) to the sensor  through the fiber cable , from which a reflected optical signal is returned within the fiber cable  to the coupler leg (c) for reentry into the coupler . All optical signal light received within the coupler  through the legs (a) and (c) are exclusively routed through leg (b) to a receiver component  of the unit , while light routed to the leg (d) is ignored.","With continued reference to , the optical signals from the coupler  are fed to the receiver  for detection of varying effects of smoke by signal splitting through a divider  between one path directly to a detector  and a second path to a wavelength filter  before being fed to another detector . The filter  selectively passes only optical signals within the upper half of the optical spectrum of the LED diode as an originating optical signal source. The output signals from the detectors  and  are then passed into a processor  having coded hardware and software relating the varying signal values of the outputs of the detectors  and  to the amount of smoke obscuration by smoke particles  within the air gap  of the sensor  as shown in . Thus, as smoke enters the sensor air gap , the lower half of the optical signal spectrum will be absorbed more than the upper spectrum half due to the relationship of wavelength to smoke particle size, resulting in a greater percentage signal change in the output of the detector  than that of the output from the detector .","It will be apparent from the foregoing description that the smoke detector system  involves use of the sensor  which is completely passive in avoiding use of any operational power and may therefore be remotely located from the electronic unit  to which it is connected by the fiber cable  of any desired length. The sensor  is furthermore of a relatively short axial length, while use of the fiber cable  for signal transmission to and from the unit , as compared to use of copper wire signal lines, enables sensor operation under high temperature conditions. Also the sensor  because of its association with the unit  possesses the ability to suppress the adverse optical spectrum effect of ambient light noise from sources such as room lighting, flashlights, heat, etc. having flat and broad patterns.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
