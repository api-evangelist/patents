title: Engineering Fc Antibody regions to confer effector function
abstract: The present invention relates to molecules having a variant Fc region, wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild-type Fc region. These modified molecules confer an effector function to a molecule, where the parent molecule does not detectably exhibit this effector function. In particular, the molecules of the invention have an increased effector cell function mediated by a FcγR, such as, but not limited to, ADCC. In one embodiment, the variant Fc region binds FcγRIIIA and/or FcγRIIA with a greater affinity, relative to a comparable molecule comprising the wild-type Fc region. The molecules of the invention have particular utility in treatment, prevention or management of a disease or disorder, such as cancer, in a sub-population of patients, wherein the target antigen is expressed at low levels in the target cell population, in particular, in patients refractory to treatment with an existing therapeutic antibody due to the low level of target antigen expression on the cancer or associated cells.

These modified molecules confer an effector function to a molecule, where the parent molecule does not detectably exhibit this effector function. In particular, the molecules of the invention have an increased effector cell function mediated by a Fc\u03b3R, such as, but not limited to, ADCC. In one embodiment, the variant Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA with a greater affinity, relative to a comparable molecule comprising the wild-type Fc region. The molecules of the invention have particular utility in treatment, prevention or management of a disease or disorder, such as cancer, in a sub-population of patients, wherein the target antigen is expressed at low levels in the target cell population, in particular, in patients refractory to treatment with an existing therapeutic antibody due to the low level of target antigen expression on the cancer or associated cells.","2.1 Fc Receptors and Their Roles in the Immune System","The interaction of antibody-antigen complexes with cells of the immune system results in a wide array of responses, ranging from effector functions such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, mast cell degranulation, and phagocytosis to immunomodulatory signals such as regulating lymphocyte proliferation and antibody secretion. All these interactions are initiated through the binding of the Fc domain of antibodies or immune complexes to specialized cell surface receptors on hematopoietic cells. The diversity of cellular responses triggered by antibodies and immune complexes results from the structural heterogeneity of Fc receptors. Fc receptors share structurally related ligand binding domains which presumably mediate intracellular signaling.","The Fc receptors, members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily of proteins, are surface glycoproteins that can bind the Fc portion of immunoglobulin molecules. Each member of the family recognizes immunoglobulins of one or more isotypes through a recognition domain on the a chain of the Fc receptor. Fc receptors are defined by their specificity for immunoglobulin subtypes. Fc receptors for IgG are referred to as Fc\u03b3R, for IgE as FFR, and for IgA as Fc\u03b3R. Different accessory cells bear Fc receptors for antibodies of different isotype, and the isotype of the antibody determines which accessory cells will be engaged in a given response (reviewed by Ravetch J. V. et al. 1991, 9: 457-92; Gerber J. S. et al. 2001 3: 131-139; Billadeau D. D. et al. 2002, 2(109): 161-1681; Ravetch J. V. et al. 2000, 290: 84-89; Ravetch J. V. et al., 2001 19:275-90; Ravetch J. V. 1994, 78(4): 553-60). The different Fc receptors, the cells that express them, and their isotype specificity is summarized in Table 1 (adapted from 4ed. 1999, Elsevier Science Ltd\/Garland Publishing, New York).","Fc\u03b3 Receptors","Each member of this family is an integral membrane glycoprotein, possessing extracellular domains related to a C2-set of immunoglobulin-related domains, a single membrane spanning domain and an intracytoplasmic domain of variable length. There are three known Fc\u03b3Rs, designated Fc\u03b3RI(CD64), Fc\u03b3RII(CD32), and Fc\u03b3RIII(CD16). The three receptors are encoded by distinct genes; however, the extensive homology between the three family members suggest they arose from a common progenitor perhaps by gene duplication.","Fc\u03b3RII(CD32)","Fc\u03b3RII proteins are 40 KDa integral membrane glycoproteins which bind only the complexed IgG due to a low affinity for monomeric Ig (10M). This receptor is the most widely expressed Fc\u03b3R, present on all hematopoietic cells, including monocytes, macrophages, B cells, NK cells, neutrophils, mast cells, and platelets. Fc\u03b3RII has only two immunoglobulin-like regions in its immunoglobulin binding chain and hence a much lower affinity for IgG than Fc\u03b3RI. There are three human Fc\u03b3RII genes (Fc\u03b3RII-A, Fc\u03b3RII-B, Fc\u03b3RII-C), all of which bind IgG in aggregates or immune complexes.","Distinct differences within the cytoplasmic domains of Fc\u03b3RII-A and Fc\u03b3RII-B create two functionally heterogenous responses to receptor ligation. The fundamental difference is that the A isoform initiates intracellular signaling leading to cell activation such as phagocytosis and respiratory burst, whereas the B isoform initiates inhibitory signals, e.g., inhibiting B-cell activation.","Signaling Through Fc\u03b3Rs","Both activating and inhibitory signals are transduced through the Fc\u03b3Rs following ligation. These diametrically opposing functions result from structural differences among the different receptor isoforms. Two distinct domains within the cytoplasmic signaling domains of the receptor called immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motifs (ITAMs) or immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motifs (IFIMS) account for the different responses. The recruitment of different cytoplasmic enzymes to these structures dictates the outcome of the Fc\u03b3R-mediated cellular responses. ITAM-containing Fc\u03b3R complexes include Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIIA, whereas ITIM-containing complexes only include Fc\u03b3RIIB.","Human neutrophils express the Fc\u03b3RIIA gene. Fc\u03b3RIIA clustering via immune complexes or specific antibody cross-linking serves to aggregate ITAMs along with receptor-associated kinases which facilitate ITAM phosphorylation. ITAM phosphorylation serves as a docking site for Syk kinase, activation of which results in activation of downstream substrates (e.g., PIK). Cellular activation leads to release of proinflammatory mediators.","The Fc\u03b3RIIB gene is expressed on B lymphocytes; its extracellular domain is 96% identical to Fc\u03b3RIIA and binds IgG complexes in an indistinguishable manner. The presence of an ITIM in the cytoplasmic domain of Fc\u03b3RIIB defines this inhibitory subclass of Fc\u03b3R. Recently the molecular basis of this inhibition was established. When coligated along with an activating Fc\u03b3R, the ITIM in Fc\u03b3RIIB becomes phosphorylated and attracts the SH2 domain of the inosital polyphosphate 5\u2032-phosphatase (SHIP), which hydrolyzes phosphoinositol messengers released as a consequence of ITAM-containing Fc\u03b3R-mediated tyrosine kinase activation, consequently preventing the influx of intracellular Ca. Thus crosslinking of Fc\u03b3RIIB dampens the activating response to Fc\u03b3R ligation and inhibits cellular responsiveness. B cell activation, B cell proliferation and antibody secretion is thus aborted.","Current approaches to optimize the Fc region function (e.g., antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activity) in therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and soluble polypeptides fused to Fc regions have focused on a limited number of single amino acid changes based on structural analysis and\/or computer aided designs. Alternative approaches in engineering Fc regions have focused on the glycosylation of the Fc region to optimize Fc region function.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"350pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Receptors for the Fc Regions of Immunoglobulin Isotypes"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Fc\u03b3RI","Fc\u03b3RII-A","Fc\u03b3RII-B2","Fc\u03b3RII-B1","Fc\u03b3RIII",{},"Fc\u03b1RI"]},{"entry":["Receptor","(CD64)","(CD32)","(CD32)","(CD32)","(CD16)","Fc\u03b5RI","(CD89)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Binding","IgG1","IgG1","IgG1","IgG1","IgG1","IgE","IgA1, IgA2"]},{"entry":[{},"10M","2 \u00d7 10M","2 \u00d7 10M","2 \u00d7 10M","5 \u00d7 10M","1010 M","10M"]},{"entry":["Cell Type","Macrophages","Macrophages","Macrophages","B cells","NK cells","Mast cells","Macrophages"]},{"entry":[{},"Neutrophils","Neutrophils","Neutrophils","Mast cells","Eosinophil","Eosinophil","Neutrophils"]},{"entry":[{},"Eosinophils","Eosinophils","Eosinophils",{},"Macrophages","Basophils","Eosinophils"]},{"entry":[{},"Dendritic cells","Dendritic cells",{},{},"Neutrophils"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Platelets",{},{},"Mast Cells"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Langerhan cells"]},{"entry":["Effect of","Uptake","Uptake","Uptake","No uptake","Induction of","Secretion of","Uptake"]},{"entry":["Ligation","Stimulation","Granule release","Inhibition of","Inhibition of","Killing","granules","Induction of"]},{"entry":[{},"Activation of",{},"Stimulation","Stimulation",{},{},"killing"]},{"entry":[{},"respiratory burst"]},{"entry":[{},"Induction of"]},{"entry":[{},"killing"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The present invention is based, in part, on the inventors' discovery of methods for engineering the Fc region of an antibody to confer one or more effector function activities to a parent antibody, which parent antibody does not exhibit the particular effector function activity at a detectable level when tested against a target cell. Such methods of engineering include introducing one or more amino acid modifications (substitutions, deletions or insertions) in one or more portions of the Fc region, which modifications introduce a detectable level of the effector function activity in the modified antibody. In certain embodiments, the modifications alter the parent antibody's affinity for certain Fc\u03b3R receptors (e.g., activating Fc\u03b3Rs, inhibitory Fc\u03b3Rs) and one or more effector functions, such as antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In other embodiments, the modifications confer homo-oligomerization activity to the parent Fc region such that oligomerization of the modified antibody cross-links cell-surface antigens, resulting in apoptosis, negative-growth regulation or cell killing.","The inventors have found that modification of an Fc region of a chimeric 2B6 antibody (anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody) surprisingly conferred an effector function activity (particularly, ADCC) on chimeric 2B6 antibodies, which normally exhibit no detectable ADCC in routine in vitro ADCC assays. The inventors have found that modification of an Fc region of a chimeric 4D5 antibody (anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody) surprisingly improved the effector function activity (particularly, ADCC) of chimeric 4D5 antibodies in cells with low levels of antigen expression. The inventors have further found that modification of an Fc region of rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) conferred effector function activity on the rituximab antibody in cells from a patient population whose cells were otherwise refractory to rituximab-induced effector function activity.","In one aspect, the invention encompasses molecules, preferably polypeptides, and more preferably immunoglobulins (e.g., antibodies) comprising a variant Fc region having one or more amino acid modifications (e.g., substitutions, but also including deletions or insertions) in one or more Fc regions, relative to a parent molecule, which modifications confer a particular effector function activity on the modified molecule, as compared to the parent molecule which has little or no detectable activity of that effector function (as measured using standard in vitro methods known in the art and exemplified herein). The effector function activities that may be conferred using the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, ADCC, antibody-dependent phagocytosis, phagocytosis, opsonization, opsonophagocytosis, cell binding, rosetting, complement dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (CDC).","Another aspect of the invention relates to molecules, preferably polypeptides, and, more preferably, immunoglobulins (e.g., antibodies) comprising a variant Fc region having one or more amino acid modifications (e.g., substitutions, deletions, insertions) in one or more portions, which modifications increase the affinity and avidity of the variant Fc region for an Fc\u03b3R (including activating and inhibitory Fc\u03b3Rs). In some embodiments, said one or more amino acid modifications increase the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA. In another embodiment, the variant Fc region further specifically binds Fc\u03b3RIIB with a lower affinity than does the Fc region of the comparable parent antibody (i.e., an antibody having the same amino acid sequence as the antibody of the invention except for the one or more amino acid modifications in the Fc region). In some embodiments, such modifications increase the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA and also enhance the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIB relative to the parent antibody. In other embodiments, said one or more amino acid modifications increase the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA but do not alter the affinity of the variant Fc regions for Fc\u03b3RIIB relative to the Fc region of the parent antibody. In another embodiment, said one or more amino acid modifications enhance the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIA but reduce the affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB relative to the parent antibody.","Increased affinity and\/or avidity results in detectable binding to the Fc\u03b3R or detectable Fc\u03b3R-related activity in cells that express low levels of the Fc\u03b3R when binding activity of the parent molecule (without the modified Fc region) cannot be detected on the cells. In certain embodiments the target antigen of the modified antibody is an Fc\u03b3R, and the modified antibody exhibits Fc\u03b3R-binding or related activity in cells which express the target Fc\u03b3R at a density of 10,000 molecules\/cell or less, at a density of 5000 molecules\/cell or less, at a density of 1000 molecules \/cell or less, at a density of 500 molecules or less, or at a density of 200 molecules or less (but at least 10, at least 50, at least 100 or at least 150 molecules\/cell). In embodiments wherein the target antigen is an Fc\u03b3R, the increased binding to the on the cell surface may be mediated by the CDR region of the antibody to an epitope on the target Fc\u03b3R. Furthermore, this mechanism of increased antigen binding may occur with antibodies against non-Fc\u03b3 receptors or surface proteins.","The invention encompasses molecules, e.g., antibodies, with altered affinities and avidities for one or more target Fc\u03b3Rs. The antibodies of the invention with enhanced affinity and avidity for one or more target Fc\u03b3Rs are particularly useful in cellular systems (for example for research or diagnostic purposes) where the Fc\u03b3Rs are expressed at low levels, for example, tumor specific B cells with low levels of Fc\u03b3RIIB (e.g., non-Hodgkins lymphoma, CLL, and Burkitt's lymphoma). Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, the molecules of the invention with enhanced affinity and avidity for a particular target Fc\u03b3R are valuable as research and diagnostic tools by enhancing the sensitivity of detection of Fc\u03b3Rs which are normally undetectable due to a low level of expression. The antibodies of the invention with enhanced affinity and avidity for Fc\u03b3Rs are particularly useful for the treatment, prevention or management of a cancer, or another disease or disorder, in a subject, wherein the Fc\u03b3Rs are expressed at low levels in the target cell populations. As used herein, Fc\u03b3R expression in cells is defined in terms of the density of such molecules per cell as measured using common methods known to those skilled in the art. The molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions preferably also have an enhanced avidity and affinity and\/or effector function in cells which express a target antigen to which the modified antibody immunospecifically binds, e.g., a cancer antigen, at low density, for example, at a density of 30,000 to 20,000 molecules\/cell, at a density of 20,000 to 10,000 molecules\/cell, at a density of 10,000 to 5,000 molecules\/cell, at a density of 5,000 to 1,000 molecules\/cell, at a density of 1,000 to 200 molecules\/cell or at a density of 200 molecules\/cell or less. The molecules of the invention have particular utility in treatment, prevention or management of a disease or disorder, such as cancer, in a sub-population of patients, wherein the target antigen is expressed at low levels in the target cell population, in particular, in patients refractory to treatment with an existing therapeutic antibody due to the low level of target antigen expression on the cancer or other cells associated with the disease or disorder to be treated, prevented or managed.","The invention encompasses engineering human, chimeric or humanized therapeutic antibodies in the Fc region by modifying one or more Fc region amino acids, which modifications alter the detectable affinity and avidity of the antibodies for one or more target antigens, e.g., Fc\u03b3R receptors or cancer antigens, and\/or the detectable effector function activity or cell killing activity of the modified antibody. In one embodiment, said one or more modifications to the amino acids of the Fc region enhance the affinity and avidity of the antibody for one or more target antigens, e.g., Fc\u03b3R receptors or cancer antigens. These therapeutic antibodies, by virtue of the modifications of the invention, have increased efficacy in patients refractory to treatment with the parent antibody, due, in certain instances, to reduced levels of the expression of the target antigen, as well as in patients who respond to the parent antibody.","Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, therapeutic antibodies engineered in accordance with the invention have enhanced therapeutic efficacy, in part, due to the ability of the Fc portion of the antibody to bind a target cell which expresses the particular Fc\u03b3Rs at reduced levels, for example, by virtue of the ability of the antibody to remain on the target cell longer due to an improved off rate for Fc-Fc\u03b3R interaction. In another embodiment, said one or more modifications to the amino acids of the Fc region modifies the affinity and avidity of the antibody for one or more Fc\u03b3R receptors. In a specific embodiment, the invention encompasses antibodies comprising a variant Fc region, wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to the parent Fc region, which variant Fc region only binds one Fc\u03b3R, wherein said Fc\u03b3R is Fc\u03b3RIIIA. In another specific embodiment, the invention encompasses antibodies comprising a variant Fc region, wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to the parent Fc region, which variant Fc region only binds one Fc\u03b3R, wherein said Fc\u03b3R is Fc\u03b3RIIA. In yet another embodiment, the invention encompasses antibodies comprising a variant Fc region, wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to the parent Fc region, which variant Fc region only binds one Fc\u03b3R, wherein said Fc\u03b3R is Fc\u03b3RIIB.","The affinities and binding properties of the antibodies of the invention for the target antigen or an Fc\u03b3R are initially determined using in vitro assays (biochemical or immunological based assays) known in the art for determining antigen-antibody or Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions (i.e., specific binding of an Fc region to an Fc\u03b3R), respectively, including but not limited to, ELISA assay, surface plasmon resonance assay or immunoprecipitation assay. Preferably, the binding properties of the molecules of the invention are also characterized by in vitro functional assays for determining one or more Fc\u03b3R mediated effector cell functions. In most preferred embodiments, the antibodies of the invention have similar binding properties in in vivo models (such as those described and disclosed herein) as those in in vitro based assays. However, the present invention does not exclude molecules of the invention that do not exhibit the desired phenotype in in vitro based assays but do exhibit the desired phenotype in vivo.","The invention also encompasses molecules, preferably polypeptides, and more preferably, immunoglobulins (e.g., antibodies) comprising a variant Fc region having one or more amino acid modifications (e.g., substitutions, deletions, insertions) in one or more portions, which modifications confer detectable effector function activity to the molecule not detectable in the parent molecule. In certain embodiments, the parent molecule is an antibody. In yet other embodiments, the parent antibody is rituximab or humanized 2B6 (see U.S. Patent Application Publication 2004\/0185045 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/126,978, filed May 10, 2005, by Johnson et al., which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties), and the modified antibodies are used to treat the indications associated with the parent antibodies. Although not intending to be bound to a particular mechanism of action, the molecules of the invention with conferred effector function activity are particularly useful for the treatment and\/or prevention of a disease or disorder where an effector cell function (e.g., ADCC) mediated by an Fc\u03b3R is desired (e.g., cancer, infectious disease). Alternately, the molecules of the invention with Fc modifications may exhibit enhanced therapeutic efficacy due to the introduction of homo-oligomerization activity in the Fc region, resulting in apoptosis, negative-growth regulation or cell killing associated with surface antigen cross-linking.","The invention encompasses methods and compositions for treatment, prevention or management of a cancer in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules comprising a variant Fc region engineered in accordance with the invention, which molecule further binds a cancer antigen. In certain embodiments, the subject is human. In other embodiments, the molecules of the invention are modified rituximab, and are preferably used in the treatment of lymphoma, such as Non-Hodgkins lymphoma, or modified humanized 2B6 antibodies engineered according to the methods of the invention, which modified antibodies possess the same indications as the parent antibodies. Molecules of the invention comprising the variant Fc regions are particularly useful for the prevention, inhibition, reduction of growth or regression of primary tumors, or metastasis of cancer cells. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, molecules of the invention enhance the efficacy of cancer therapeutics by i) enhancing antibody mediated effector function or ii) enhancing the apoptosis signaling, negative-growth regulation or cell killing associated with surface antigen cross-linking by introducing homo-oligornerization activity in the modified molecules, resulting in an enhanced rate of tumor clearance or an enhanced rated of tumor reduction or a combination thereof.","According to an aspect of the invention, immunotherapeutics may be modifying in accordance with the invention to increase the potency of an antibody effector function activity, e.g., ADCC, CDC, phagocytosis, opsonization, etc. In a specific embodiment, antibody dependent cellular toxicity and\/or phagocytosis (e.g., of tumor cells) is enhanced by modifying immunotherapeutics with variant Fc regions of the invention. Molecules of the invention may render immunotherapy cancer treatment efficacious in a patient population by enhancing (or rendering detectable) at least one antibody-mediated effector function activity. In one particular embodiment, the efficacy of immunotherapy treatment is enhanced by rendering the complement dependent cascade activity detectable. In another embodiment of the invention, the efficacy of immunotherapy treatment is enhanced by rendering the phagocytosis and\/or opsonization of the targeted cells, e.g., tumor cells, detectable. In another embodiment of the invention, the efficacy of treatment is enhanced by enhancing antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (\u201cADCC\u201d) in destruction of the targeted cells, e.g., tumor cells, detectable. Determining whether such activity is detectable is done using routine assays known in the art and described herein.","In a specific embodiment, the invention encompasses a molecule comprising a variant Fc region, wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to the parent Fc region such that the molecule has an enhanced effector activity, provided said one or more amino acid modifications includes substitutions at one or more positions. The amino acid positions recited herein are numbered according to the EU index as set forth in Kabat et al., 5Ed. Public Health Service, NH1, MD (1991), expressly incorporated herein by reference. In a specific embodiment, the variant Fc region has a leucine at position 247, a lysine at position 421, or a glutamic acid at position 270. In other specific embodiments, the variant Fc region has a leucine at position 247, a lysine at position 421 and a glutamic acid at position 270 (MgFc31\/60); a threonine at position 392, a leucine at position 396, a glutamic acid at position 270, and a leucine at position 243 (MgFc38\/60\/F243L); a histidine at position 419, a leucine at position 396, and a glutamic acid at position 270 (MGFc51\/60); an alanine at position 240, a leucine at position 396, and a glutamic acid at position 270 (MGFc52\/60); a histidine at position 419, a leucine at position 396, a glutamic acid at position 270, and a leucine at position 243 (MGFc51\/60\/F243L); a lysine at position 255 and a leucine at position 396 (MgFc55); a lysine at position 255, a leucine at position 396, and a glutamic acid at position 270 (MGFc55\/60); a lysine at position 255, a leucine at position 396, a glutamic acid at position 270, and a lysine at position 300 (MGFc55\/60\/Y300L); a lysine at position 255, a leucine at position 396, a glutamic acid at position 270, and a leucine at position 243 (MgFc55\/60\/F243L); a lysine at position 255, a leucine at position 396, a glutamic acid at position 270, and a glycine at position 292 (MgFc55\/60\/R292G); a glutamic acid at position 370, a leucine at position 396, and a glutamic acid at position 270 (MGFc59\/60); a glutamic acid at position 270, an aspartic acid at position 316, and a glycine at position 416 (MgFc71); a leucine at position 243, a proline at position 292, an isoleucine at position 305, and a leucine at position 396 (MGFc74\/P396L); a leucine at position 243, a glutamic acid at position 270, a glycine at position 292, and a leucine at position 396; a leucine at position 243,a lysine at position 255, a glutamic acid at position 270, and a leucine at position 396; or a glutamine at position 297.","The invention also encompasses methods for treating or preventing an infectious disease in a subject comprising administering a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of one or more molecules of the invention that bind an infectious agent or cellular receptor therefore. Infectious diseases that can be treated or prevented by the molecules of the invention are caused by infectious agents including but not limited to viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozae, and viruses. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, the methods and\/or molecules of the invention confer a therapeutic effect not detectable in the parent antibody or enhance the therapeutic effect of the parent antibody by i) enhancing or rendering detectable the antibody mediated effector function toward an infectious agent or ii) enhancing or rendering detectable the apoptosis signaling, negative-growth regulation or cell killing associated with surface antigen cross-linking by conferring homo-oligomerization activity in the modified molecules.","According to one aspect of the invention, molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions have detectable antibody effector function towards an infectious agent, which was not detectable in the parent molecule comprising a wild-type Fc region. In a specific embodiment, molecules of the invention enhance the efficacy of treatment of an infectious disease by enhancing or rendering detectable phagocytosis and\/or opsonization of the infectious agent causing the infectious disease. In another specific embodiment, molecules of the invention enhance the efficacy of treatment of an infectious disease by enhancing or rendering detectable ADCC of infected cells causing the infectious disease.","The invention encompasses characterization of the molecules of the invention (e.g., therapeutic monoclonal antibodies engineered according to the methods of the invention) using assays known to those skilled in the art for identifying the effector cell function of the molecules. In particular, the invention encompasses characterizing the molecules of the invention for Fc\u03b3R-mediated effector cell function.

In particular, the modified molecules, e.g., antibodies, of the invention comprise a variant Fc region, having one or more amino acid modifications (e.g., substitutions, but also including insertions or deletions) in one or more regions, which modifications confer at least one effector function. In particular, the modifications alter the affinity and avidity of the variant Fc region for an Fc\u03b3R (e.g., activating Fc\u03b3Rs or inhibitory Fc\u03b3Rs) and thereby altering the activity of one or more effector functions.

In some embodiments, such modifications increase the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA and also enhance the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIB relative to the parent antibody. In other embodiments, said one or more amino acid modifications increase the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA but do not alter the affinity of the variant Fc regions for Fc\u03b3RIIB relative to the Fc region of the parent antibody. In another embodiment, said one or more amino acid modifications enhance the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIA but reduce the affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB relative to the parent antibody.

Preferably, the molecules of the invention with one or more glycosylation sites and\/or one or more modifications in the Fc region confer or have an enhanced antibody mediated effector function, e.g., enhanced ADCC activity, compared to a parent antibody. In some embodiments, the invention further comprises molecules comprising one or more modifications of amino acids that are directly or indirectly known to interact with a carbohydrate moiety of the antibody, including but not limited to amino acids at positions 241, 243, 244, 245, 245, 249, 256, 258, 260, 262, 264, 265, 296, 299, and 301. Amino acids that directly or indirectly interact with a carbohydrate moiety of an antibody are known in the art, see, e.g., Jefferis et al., 1995 44: 111-7, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","In another embodiment, the invention encompasses molecules that have been modified by introducing one or more glycosylation sites into one or more sites of the molecules, preferably without altering the functionality of the molecules, e.g., binding activity to target antigen or Fc\u03b3R. Glycosylation sites may be introduced into the variable and\/or constant region of the molecules of the invention. As used herein, \u201cglycosylation sites\u201d include any specific amino acid sequence in an antibody to which an oligosaccharide (ie., carbohydrates containing two or more simple sugars linked together) will specifically and covalently attach. Oligosaccharide side chains are typically linked to the backbone of an antibody via either N\u2014 or O-linkages. N-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of an oligosaccharide moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of an oligosaccharide moiety to a hydroxyamino acid, e.g., serine, threonine. The molecules of the invention may comprise one or more glycosylation sites, including N-linked and O-linked glycosylation sites. Any glycosylation site for N-linked or O-linked glycosylation known in the art may be used in accordance with the instant invention. An exemplary N-linked glycosylation site that is useful in accordance with the methods of the present invention is the amino acid sequence: Asn-X-Thr\/Ser, wherein X may be any amino acid and Thr\/Ser indicates a threonine or a serine. Such a site or sites may be introduced into a molecule of the invention using methods well known in the art to which this invention pertains. See, for example, \u201c, J. D. Watson, et al. W.H.

An exemplary method for introducing a glycosylation site into a molecule of the invention may comprise: modifying or mutating an amino acid sequence of the molecule so that the desired Asn-X-Thr\/Ser sequence is obtained.","In some embodiments, the invention encompasses methods of modifying the carbohydrate content of a molecule of the invention by adding or deleting a glycosylation site. Methods for modifying the carbohydrate content of antibodies are well known in the art and encompassed within the invention, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,218,149; EP 0 359 096 B1; U.S. Publication No. US 2002\/0028486; WO 03\/035835; U.S. Publication No. 2003\/0115614; U.S. Pat. No. 6,218,149; U.S. Pat. No. 6, 472,511; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In other embodiments, the invention encompasses methods of modifying the carbohydrate content of a molecule of the invention by deleting one or more endogenous carbohydrate moieties of the molecule. In a specific embodiment, the invention encompasses shifting the glycosylation site of the Fc region of an antibody, by modifying positions adjacent to 297. In a specific embodiment, the invention encompasses modifying position 296 so that position 296 and not position 297 is glycosylated.","5.1 Polypeptides and Antibodies with Variant Fc Regions","The present invention is based, in part, on the inventors' discovery of methods for engineering the Fc region of an antibody to confer an effector function activity to the antibody, which the parent antibody did not exhibit when tested against a target cell. Such methods of engineering include introducing one or more amino acid modifications (substitutions, deletions or insertions) in one or more portions of the Fc region, which modifications introduce a detectable effector function activity on the parent antibody. In particular, the modifications alter the parent antibody's affinity for certain Fc\u03b3R receptors (e.g., activating Fc\u03b3Rs, inhibitory Fc\u03b3Rs) and one or more effector functions, such as ADCC. Alternately, the modifications alter the affinity of the variant Fc region such that the variant Fc regions oligomerize and homo-oligomers of the modified antibody are formed. The inventors have found that modification of an Fc region of a chimeric 2B6 or 4D5 antibody (anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody) surprisingly conferred a particular effector function activity (ADCC) on chimeric 2B6 antibodies, which normally exhibit no detectable ADCC activity, and improved effector function activity (particularly ADCC) of chimeric 4D5 antibodies in cells with low levels of antigen expression. The inventors have further found that modification of an Fc region of rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) conferred effector function activity on the rituximab antibody in a patient population whose cells were otherwise refractory to rituximab-induced effector function activity.","It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that aside from amino acid substitutions, the present invention contemplates other modifications of the Fc region amino acid sequence in order to generate an Fc region variant with one or more altered properties, e.g., enhanced effector function. The invention contemplates deletion of one or more amino acid residues of the Fc region in order to, e.g., reduce binding to an Fc\u03b3R. Preferably, no more than 5, no more than 10, no more than 20, no more than 30, no more than 50 Fc region residues will be deleted according to this embodiment of the invention. The Fc region herein comprising one or more amino acid deletions will preferably retain at least about 80%, and preferably at least about 90%, and most preferably at least about 95%, of the wild type Fc region. In some embodiments, one or more properties of the molecules are maintained such as for example, non-immunogenicity, Fc\u03b3RIIIA binding, Fc\u03b3RIIA binding, or a combination of these properties.","In alternate embodiments, the invention encompasses amino acid insertion to generate the Fc region variants, which variants have altered properties including enhanced effector function. In one specific embodiment, the invention encompasses introducing at least one amino acid residue, for example, one to two amino acid residues and preferably no more than 10 amino acid residues adjacent to one or more of the Fc region positions identified herein. In alternate embodiments, the invention further encompasses introducing at least one amino acid residue, for example, one to two amino acid residues and preferably no more than 10 amino acid residues adjacent to one or more of the Fc region positions known in the art as impacting Fc\u03b3R interaction and\/or binding.","The invention further encompasses incorporation of unnatural amino acids to generate the Fc variants of the invention. Such methods are known to those skilled in the art such as those using the natural biosynthetic machinery to allow incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins, see, e.g., Wang et al., 2002 Chem. Comm. 1:1-11; Wang et al., 2001, Science, 292: 498-500; van Hest et al., 2001. Chem. Comm. 19: 1897-1904, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Alternative strategies focus on the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of amino acyl-tRNA, see, e.g., Tang et al., 2001, J. Am. Chem. 123(44): 11089-11090; Kiick et al., 2001, FEBS Lett. 505(3): 465; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The effector function properties of the molecules of the invention are determined for one or more Fc\u03b3R mediator effector cell functions as described in Section 5.2.7. The affinities and binding properties of the molecules of the invention for a target antigen or an Fc\u03b3R are initially determined using in vitro assays (biochemical or immunological based assays) known in the art for determining antibody-antigen or Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions, i.e., specific binding of an antibody to an antigen or an Fc region to an Fc\u03b3R, respectively, including but not limited to ELISA assay, surface plasmon resonance assay, immunoprecipitation assays (See Section 5.2.1). In most preferred embodiments, the molecules of the invention have similar binding properties in in vivo models (such as those described and disclosed herein) as those in in vitro based assays. However, the present invention does not exclude molecules of the invention that do not exhibit the desired phenotype in in vitro based assays but do exhibit the desired phenotype in vivo. A representative flow chart of the screening and characterization of molecules of the invention is described in .","The invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc region that binds with a greater affinity to one or more Fc\u03b3Rs. Such molecules preferably mediate effector function more effectively as discussed infra. In other embodiments, the invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc region that bind with a weaker affinity to one or more Fc\u03b3Rs. In general, increased or added effector function would be directed to tumor and foreign cells.","The Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other Fc modifications, including but not limited to other modifications that enhance effector function. The invention encompasses combining an Fc variant of the invention with other Fc modifications to provide additive, synergistic, or novel properties in antibodies or Fc fusions. Preferably the Fc variants of the invention enhance the phenotype of the modification with which they are combined. For example, if an Fc variant of the invention is combined with a mutant known to bind Fc\u03b3RIIIA with a higher affinity than a comparable molecule comprising a wild type Fc region; the combination with a mutant of the invention results in a greater fold enhancement in Fc\u03b3RIIIA affinity.","In one embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other known Fc variants such as those disclosed in Duncan et al, 1988, Nature 332:563-564; Lund et al., 1991, J.

Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes, including, but not limited to, enhancing effector function. Engineered glycoforms may be generated by any method known to one skilled in the art, for example by using engineered or variant expression strains, by co-expression with one or more enzymes, for example, DI N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT111), by expressing an antibody comprising an Fc region in various organisms or cell lines from various organisms, or by modifying carbohydrate(s) after the antibody comprising Fc region has been expressed.

Properties that may be optimized include, but are not limited to, conferred or enhanced effector function, enhanced or reduced affinity for an Fc\u03b3R, or conferred oligomerization activity. In a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention are optimized to possess enhanced affinity for a human activating Fc\u03b3R, preferably Fc\u03b3R, Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIc, Fc\u03b3RIIIA, and Fc\u03b3RIIIB, most preferably Fc\u03b3RIIIA. In an alternate preferred embodiment, the Fc variants are optimized to possess reduced affinity for the human inhibitory receptor Fc\u03b3RIIB. These preferred embodiments are anticipated to provide antibodies and Fc fusions with new or enhanced therapeutic properties in humans, for example, enhanced effector function and greater anti-cancer potency as described and exemplified herein. These preferred embodiments are anticipated to provide antibodies and Fc fusions with enhanced tumor elimination in mouse xenograft tumor models.","In an alternate embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention are optimized to have reduced affinity for a human Fc\u03b3R, including but not limited to Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIB, Fc\u03b3RIIc, Fc\u03b3RIIIA, and Fc\u03b3RIIIB. These embodiments are anticipated to provide antibodies and Fc fusions with enhanced therapeutic properties in humans, for example, reduced toxicity.","In alternate embodiments, the Fc variants of the present invention possess a conferred effector function and\/or enhanced or reduced affinity for Fc\u03b3Rs from non-human organisms, including, but not limited to, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. Fc variants that are optimized for effector function in a non-human or binding to a non-human Fc\u03b3R may find use in experimentation. For example, mouse models are available for a variety of diseases that enable testing of properties such as efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics for a given drug candidate. As is known in the art, cancer cells can be grafted or injected into mice to mimic a human cancer, a process referred to as xenografting. Testing of antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise Fc variants that confer an effector function and\/or are optimized for one or more mouse Fc\u03b3Rs, may provide valuable information with regard to the efficacy of the antibody or Fc fusion, its mechanism of action, and the like.","In certain embodiments, while it is preferred to alter binding to an Fc\u03b3R, the instant invention further contemplates Fc variants with altered binding affinity to the neonatal receptor (FcRn). Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, Fc region variants with improved affinity for FcRn are anticipated to have longer serum half-lives, and such antibodies will have useful applications in methods of treating mammals where long half-life of the administered polypeptide is desired, e.g., to treat a chronic disease or disorder. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, Fc region variants with decreased FcRn binding affinity, on the contrary, are expected to have shorter half-lives, and such antibodies may, for example, be administered to a mammal where a shortened circulation time may be advantageous, e.g., for in vivo diagnostic imaging or for polypeptides which have toxic side effects when left circulating in the blood stream for extended periods. Fc region variants with decreased FcRn binding affinity are anticipated to be less likely to cross the placenta, and thus may be utilized in the treatment of diseases or disorders in pregnant women.","In other embodiments, these variants may be combined with other known Fc modifications with altered FcRn affinity such as those disclosed in International Publication Nos. WO 98\/23289; and WO 97\/34631; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,277,375, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The invention encompasses any other method known in the art for generating molecules, e.g., antibodies, having an increased half-life in vivo, for example, by introducing one or more amino acid modifications (i.e., substitutions, insertions or deletions) into an IgG constant domain, or FcRn binding fragment thereof (preferably a Fc or hinge-Fc domain fragment).

Such modifications may involve further alteration of the amino acid sequence (substitution, insertion and\/or deletion of amino acid residues), fusion to heterologous polypeptide(s) and\/or covalent modifications. Such further modifications may be made prior to, simultaneously with, or following, the amino acid modification(s) disclosed herein which results in altered properties such as an enhanced binding to target antigen, conferred oligomerization activity, or enhanced effector function and\/or alteration of Fc receptor binding.","Alternatively or additionally, the invention encompasses combining the amino acid modifications disclosed herein with one or more further amino acid modifications that confer or enhance additional effector functions, e.g., C1q binding and\/or complement dependent cytoxicity function, of the Fc region as determined in vitro and\/or in vivo. The further amino acid substitutions described herein will generally serve to confer the activity on a parent antibody that does not exhibit detectable levels of the activity or enhance the ability of the starting antibody to bind to C1q and\/or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) function. For example, the starting antibody may be unable to bind C1q and\/or mediate CDC and may be modified according to the teachings herein such that it acquires these further effector functions. Moreover, antibodies with preexisting C1q binding activity, optionally further having the ability to mediate CDC may be modified such that one or both of these activities are enhanced. In some embodiments, the invention encompasses variant Fc regions with altered CDC activity without any alteration in C1q binding. In yet other embodiments, the invention encompasses variant Fc regions with altered CDC activity and altered C1q binding.","To generate an Fc region with altered C1q binding and\/or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) function, the amino acid positions to be modified are generally selected from positions 270, 322, 326, 327, 329, 331, 333, and 334, where the numbering of the residues in an IgG heavy chain is that of the EU index as in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed.

In specific embodiments, the invention encompasses variant Fc regions with improved C1q binding and improved Fc\u03b3RIII binding; e.g. having both improved ADCC activity and improved CDC activity. In alternative embodiments, the invention encompasses a variant Fc region with reduced CDC activity and\/or reduced ADCC activity.

provides modified molecules with variant Fc regions, having one or more amino acid modifications, which one or more amino acid modifications confer an effector function and\/or increase the affinity of the molecule for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA. Such molecules include IgG molecules that naturally contain Fc\u03b3R binding regions (e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIB binding region), or immunoglobulin derivatives that have been engineered to contain an Fc\u03b3R binding region (e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIB binding region). The modified molecules of the invention include any immunoglobulin molecule that binds, preferably, immunospecifically, i.e., competes off non-specific binding as determined by immunoassays well known in the art for assaying specific antigen-antibody binding, an antigen and contains an Fc\u03b3R binding region (e.g., a Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIB binding region). Such antibodies include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, bi-specific, multi-specific, human, humanized, chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab\u2032)fragments, disulfide-linked Fvs, Fc fusions, and fragments containing either a VL or VH domain or even a complementary determining region (CDR) that specifically binds an antigen, in certain cases, engineered to contain or fused to an Fc\u03b3R binding region.","In some embodiments, the molecules of the invention comprise portions of an Fc region. As used herein the term \u201cportion of an Fc region\u201d refers to fragments of the Fc region, preferably a portion with effector activity and\/or Fc\u03b3R binding activity (or a comparable region of a mutant lacking such activity). The fragment of an Fc region may range in size from 5 amino acids to the entire Fc region minus one amino acids. The portion of an Fc region may be missing up to 10, up to 20, up to 30 amino acids from the N-terminus or C-terminus.","The IgG molecules of the invention are preferably IgG1 subclass of IgGs, but may also be any other IgG subclasses of given animals. For example, in humans, the IgG class includes IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4; and mouse IgG includes IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG2c and IgG3.","The immunoglobulins (and other polypeptides used herein) may be from any animal origin including birds and mammals. Preferably, the antibodies are human, rodent (e.g., mouse and rat), donkey, sheep, rabbit, goat, guinea pig, camel, horse, or chicken. As used herein, \u201chuman\u201d antibodies include antibodies having the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and include antibodies isolated from human immunoglobulin libraries or from animals transgenic for one or more human immunoglobulin and that do not express endogenous immunoglobulins, as described infra and, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,598 by Kucherlapati et al.","The antibodies of the present invention may be monospecific, bispecific, trispecific or of greater multispecificity. Multispecific antibodies may be specific for different epitopes of a polypeptide or may be specific for heterologous epitopes, such as a heterologous polypeptide or solid support material. See, e.g., PCT publications WO 93\/17715; WO 92\/08802; WO 91\/00360; WO 92\/05793; Tutt, et al., 147:60-69, 1991; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,474,893; 4,714,681; 4,925,648; 5,573,920; 5,601,819; Kostelny et al., 148:1547-1553, 1992.","Multispecific antibodies have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. While such molecules normally will only bind two antigens (i.e. bispecific antibodies, BsAbs), antibodies with additional specificities such as trispecific antibodies are encompassed by the instant invention. Examples of BsAbs include without limitation those with one arm directed against a tumor cell antigen and the other arm directed against a cytotoxic molecule.","Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities (Millstein et al., Nature, 305:537-539 (1983); which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93\/08829, and in Traunecker et al., EMBO J., 10:3655-3659 (1991).","According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1) containing the site necessary for light chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when, the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.","In a preferred embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94\/04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., Methods in Enzymology, 121:210 (1986). According to another approach described in WO96\/27011, a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the CH3 domain of an antibody constant domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory \u201ccavities\u201d of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g. alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.","Bispecific antibodies include cross-linked or \u201cheteroconjugate\u201d antibodies. For example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (WO 91\/00360, WO 92\/200373, and EP 03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.","Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared. See, e.g., Tutt et al., 1991, J. Immunol. 147: 60, which is incorporated herein by reference.","The antibodies of the invention include derivatives that are otherwise modified, i.e., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibody such that covalent attachment does not prevent the antibody from binding antigen and\/or generating an anti-idiotypic response. For example, but not by way of limitation, the antibody derivatives include antibodies that have been modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to, specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin, etc. Additionally, the derivative may contain one or more non-classical amino acids.","For some uses, including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays, it may be preferable to use chimeric, humanized, or human antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species, such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a constant region derived from a human immunoglobulin. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g., Morrison, 229:1202, 1985; Oi et al., 4:214 1986; Gillies et al., 125:191-202, 1989; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 4,816,397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species that bind the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and framework regions and constant domains from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Often, framework residues in the human framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. See, e.g., Queen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; Riechmann et al., 332:323, 1988, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art including, for example, CDR-grafting (EP 239,400; PCT publication WO 91\/09967; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539; 5,530,101 and 5,585,089), veneering or resurfacing (EP 592,106; EP 519,596; Padlan, 28(4\/5):489-498, 1991; Studnicka et al., 7(6):805-814, 1994; Roguska et al., 91:969-973, 1994), and chain shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332), all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. Humanized antibodies may be generated using any of the methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,762 (Protein Design Labs), U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,761, (Protein Design Labs) U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089 (Protein Design Labs), U.S. Pat. No. 6,180,370 (Protein Design Labs), and U.S. Publication Nos. 20040049014, 200300229208, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,444,887 and 4,716,111; and PCT publications WO 98\/46645; WO 98\/50433; WO 98\/24893; WO 98\/16654; WO 96\/34096; WO 96\/33735; and WO 91\/10741, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins, but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar, 13:65-93, 1995. For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies, see, e.g., PCT publications WO 98\/24893; WO 92\/01047; WO 96\/34096; WO 96\/33735; European Patent No. 0 598 877; U.S. Pat.

In addition, companies such as Abgenix, Inc. (Freemont, Calif.), Medarex (N.J.) and Genpharm (San Jose, Calif.) can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above.","Completely human antibodies which recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as \u201cguided selection.\u201d In this approach a selected non-human monoclonal antibody, e.g., a mouse antibody, is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope (Jespers et al., 12:899-903, 1988).","The invention encompasses engineering human or humanized therapeutic antibodies (e.g., tumor specific monoclonal antibodies) in the Fc region, by modification (e.g., substitution, insertion, deletion) of at least one amino acid residue, which modification confers an effector function activity, e.g., enhanced ADCC activity, phagocytosis activity, etc., as determined by standard assays known to those skilled in the art. The engineered therapeutic antibodies may further have increased affinity of the Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA. In other embodiments, the engineered therapeutic antibodies may exhibit oligomerization activity mediated by the variant Fc region. In another embodiment, the invention relates to engineering human or humanized therapeutic antibodies (e.g., tumor specific monoclonal antibodies) in the Fc region, by modification of at least one amino acid residue, which modification increases the affinity of the Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA and further decreases the affinity of the Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIB.","In another specific embodiment, the invention encompasses engineering an monoclonal antibody by modification (e.g., substitution, insertion, deletion) of at least one amino acid residue in the Fc region which modification confers an effector function as determined by standard assays known in the art and disclosed and exemplified herein. In another embodiment, modification of the monoclonal antibody increases the affinity of the Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA. In another specific embodiment, modification of the monoclonal antibody may also further decrease the affinity of the Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIB.","In a specific embodiment, the invention encompasses a modified molecule comprising an Fc chain with a substitution at position 255 with leucine, at position 396 with leucine, at position 270 with glutamic acid, and at position 300 with leucine; or a substitution at position 419 with histidine, at position 396 with leucine, and at position 270 with glutamic acid; or a substitution at position 240 with alanine, at position 396 with leucine, and at position 270 with glutamic acid; or a substitution at position 370 with glutamic acid, at position 396 with leucine, and at position 270 with glutamic acid; or a substitution at position 392 with threonine, at position 396 with leucine, and at position 270 with glutamic acid; or a substitution at position 370 with glutamic acid and at position 396 with leucine; or a substitution at position 419 with histidine and at position 396 with leucine; or a substitution at position 247 with leucine, at position 421 with lysine, and at position 270 with glutamic acid; or a substitution at position 255 with leucine, at position 396 with leucine, at position 270 with glutamic acid, and at position 292 with glycine.

The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct, but may occur through linker sequences.","Further, molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions may be conjugated to a therapeutic agent or a drug moiety that modifies a given biological response. Therapeutic agents or drug moieties are not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, a toxin such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin (i.e., PE-40), or diphtheria toxin, ricin, gelonin, and pokeweed antiviral protein, a protein such as tumor necrosis factor, interferons including, but not limited to, \u03b1-interferon (IFN-\u03b1), \u03b2-interferon (IFN-\u03b2), nerve growth factor (NGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), an apoptotic agent (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b2, AIM I as disclosed in PCT Publication No. WO 97\/33899), AIM II (see, PCT Publication No. WO 97\/34911), Fas Ligand (Takahashi et al., 6:1567-1574, 1994), and VEGI (PCT Publication No. WO 99\/23105), a thrombotic agent or an anti-angiogenic agent (e.g., angiostatin or endostatin), or a biological response modifier such as, for example, a lymphokine (e.g., interleukin-1 (\u201cIL-1\u201d), interleukin-2 (\u201cIL-2\u201d), interleukin-6 (\u201cIL-6\u201d), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (\u201cGM-CSF\u201d), and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (\u201cG-CSF\u201d), macrophage colony stimulating factor, (\u201cM-CSF\u201d), or a growth factor (e.g., growth hormone (\u201cGH\u201d); proteases, or ribonucleases.","Molecules of the invention can be fused to marker sequences, such as a peptide to facilitate purification. In preferred embodiments, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., 9259 Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, Calif., 91311), among others, many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al., 1989, 86:821-824, for instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other peptide tags useful for purification include, but are not limited to, the hemagglutinin \u201cHA\u201d tag, which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson et al., 37:767 1984) and the \u201cflag\u201d tag (Knappik et al., 17(4):754-761, 1994).","Additional fusion proteins may be generated through the techniques of gene-shuffling, motif-shuffling, exon-shuffling, and\/or codon-shuffling (collectively referred to as \u201cDNA shuffling\u201d). DNA shuffling may be employed to alter the activities of molecules of the invention (e.g., antibodies with higher affinities and lower dissociation rates). See, generally, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,605,793; 5,811,238; 5,830,721; 5,834,252; and 5,837,458, and Patten et al., 1997, 8:724-33; Harayama, 1998, 16:76; Hansson, et al., 1999, 287:265; and Lorenzo and Blasco, 1998, 24:308 (each of these patents and publications are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions, or the nucleic acids encoding the molecules of the invention, may be further altered by being subjected to random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR, random nucleotide insertion or other methods prior to recombination. One or more portions of a polynucleotide encoding a molecule of the invention, may be recombined with one or more components, motifs, sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc. of one or more heterologous molecules.","The present invention also encompasses molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions conjugated to a diagnostic or therapeutic agent or any other molecule for which serum half-life is desired to be increased and\/or targeted to a particular subset of cells. The molecules of the invention can be used diagnostically to, for example, monitor the development or progression of a disease, disorder or infection as part of a clinical testing procedure to, e.g., determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen. Detection can be facilitated by coupling the molecules of the invention to a detectable substance. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, radioactive materials, positron emitting metals, and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions.

Preferably, the binding properties of the molecules of the invention are also characterized by in vitro functional assays for determining one or more Fc\u03b3R mediator effector cell functions. In most preferred embodiments, the antibodies of the invention have similar binding properties in in vivo models (such as those described and disclosed herein) as those in in vitro based assays. However, the present invention does not exclude molecules of the invention that do not exhibit the desired phenotype in in vitro based assays but do exhibit the desired phenotype in vivo.","In preferred embodiments, screening and identifying molecules comprising variant Fc regions with altered Fc\u03b3R affinities (e.g., enhanced Fc\u03b3RIIIA affinity) are done using the yeast display technology as described herein in combination with one or more biochemical based assays, preferably in a high throughput manner. In some embodiments, screening and identifying molecules comprising variant Fc regions with altered Fc\u03b3R affinities (e.g., enhanced Fc\u03b3RIIIA affinity) are done using the yeast display technology as described herein in combination with one or more functional based assays, preferably in a high throughput manner. The functional based assays can be any assay known in the art for characterizing one or more Fc\u03b3R mediated effector cell functions such as those described herein in Section 5.2.7. Non-limiting examples of effector cell functions that can be used in accordance with the methods of the invention, include but are not limited to, antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent phagocytosis, phagocytosis, opsonization, opsonophagocytosis, cell binding, rosetting, C1q binding, and complement dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity.","The term \u201cspecific binding\u201d of an Fc region to an Fc\u03b3R refers to an interaction of the Fc region and a particular Fc\u03b3R which has an affinity constant of at least about 150 nM, in the case of monomeric Fc\u03b3RIIIA and at least about 60 nM in the case of dimeric Fc\u03b3RIIB as determined using, for example, an ELISA or surface plasmon resonance assay (e.g., a BIAcore\u2122). The affinity constant of an Fc region for monomeric Fc\u03b3RIIIA may be 150 nM, 200 nM or 300 nM. The affinity constant of an Fc region for dimeric Fc\u03b3RIIB may be 60 nM, 80 nM, 90 nM, or 100 nM. Dimeric Fc\u03b3RIIB for use in the methods of the invention may be generated using methods known to one skilled in the art. Typically, the extracellular region of Fc\u03b3RIIB is covalently linked to a heterologous polypeptide which is capable of dimerization, so that the resulting fusion protein is a dimer, e.g., see, U.S. Application No. 60\/439,709 filed on Jan. 13, 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A specific interaction generally is stable under physiological conditions, including, for example, conditions that occur in a living individual such as a human or other vertebrate or invertebrate, as well as conditions that occur in a cell culture such conditions as used for maintaining and culturing mammalian cells or cells from another vertebrate organism or an invertebrate organism.","In a specific embodiment, screening for and identifying molecules comprising variant Fc regions and altered Fc\u03b3R affinities comprise: displaying the molecule comprising a variant Fc region on the yeast surface; and characterizing the binding of the molecule comprising the variant Fc region to a Fc\u03b3R (one or more), using a biochemical assay for determining Fc-Fc\u03b3R interaction, preferably, an ELISA based assay.

These strategies may be applied individually or in various combinations to engineer the Fc variants of the instant invention.","In most preferred embodiments, the engineering methods of the invention comprise methods in which amino acids at the interface between an Fc region and the Fc ligand are not modified. Fc ligands include but are not limited to Fc\u03b3Rs, C1q, FcRn, C3, mannose receptor, protein A, protein G, mannose receptor, and undiscovered molecules that bind Fc. Amino acids at the interface between an Fc region and an Fc ligand is defined as those amino acids that make a direct and\/or indirect contact between the Fc region and the ligand, play a structural role in determining the conformation of the interface, or are within at least 3 angstroms, preferably at least 2 angstroms of each other as determined by structural analysis, such as x-ray crystallography and molecular modeling The amino acids at the interface between an Fc region and an Fc ligand include those amino acids that make a direct contact with an Fc\u03b3R based on crystallographic and structural analysis of Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions such as those disclosed by Sondermann et al., (2000, Nature, 406: 267-273; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Examples of positions within the Fc region that make a direct contact with Fc\u03b3R are amino acids 234-239 (hinge region), amino acids 265-269 (B\/C loop), amino acids 297-299 (C\u2032\/E loop), and amino acids 327-332 (F\/G) loop. In some embodiments, the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions comprise modification of at least one residue that does not make a direct contact with an Fc\u03b3R based on structural and crystallographic analysis, e.g., is not within the Fc-Fc\u03b3R binding site.","Preferably, the engineering methods of the invention do not modify any of the amino acids as identified by Shields et al,. which are located in the CH2 domain of an Fc region proximal to the hinge region, e.g., Leu234-Pro238; Ala327, Pro329, and affect binding of an Fc region to all human Fc\u03b3Rs.","In other embodiments, the invention encompasses Fc variants with altered Fc\u03b3R affinities and\/or altered effector functions, such that the Fc variant does not have an amino acid modification at a position at the interface between an Fc region and the Fc ligand. Preferably, such Fc variants in combination with one or more other amino acid modifications which are at the interface between an Fc region and the Fc ligand have a further impact on the particular altered property, e.g. altered Fc\u03b3R affinity. Modifying amino acids at the interface between Fc and an Fc ligand may be done using methods known in the art, for example based on structural analysis of Fc-ligand complexes. For example but not by way of limitation by exploring energetically favorable substitutions at Fc positions that impact the binding interface, variants can be engineered that sample new interface conformations, some of which may improve binding to the Fc ligand, some of which may reduce Fc ligand binding, and some of which may have other favorable properties. Such new interface conformations could be the result of, for example, direct interaction with Fc ligand residues that form the interface, or indirect effects caused by the amino acid modifications such as perturbation of side chain or backbone conformations","The invention encompasses engineering Fc variants comprising any of the amino acid modifications disclosed herein in combination with other modifications in which the conformation of the Fc carbohydrate at position 297 is altered. The invention encompasses conformational and compositional changes in the N297 carbohydrate that result in a desired property, for example increased or reduced affinity for an Fc\u03b3R. Such modifications may further enhance the phenotype of the original amino acid modification of the Fc variants of the invention. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of actions such a strategy is supported by the observation that the carbohydrate structure and conformation dramatically affect Fc-Fc\u03b3R and Fc\/C1 q binding (Umaha et aL, 1999, Nat Biotechnol 17:176-180; Davies et aL, 2001, Biotechnol Bioeng 74:288-294; Mimura et aL, 2001, J Biol Chem 276:45539; Radaev et aL, 2001, J Biol Chem 276:16478-16483; Shields et aL 2002, J Biol Chem 277:26733-26740; Shinkawa et aL, 2003, J Biol Chem 278:3466-3473).","Another design strategy for generating Fc variants in accordance with the invention is provided in which the Fc region is reengineered to eliminate the structural and functional dependence on glycosylation. This design strategy involves the optimization of Fc structure, stability, solubility, and\/or Fc function (for example affinity of Fc for one or more Fc ligands) in the absence of the N297 carbohydrate. In one approach, positions that are exposed to solvent in the absence of glycosylation are engineered such that they are stable, structurally consistent with Fc structure, and have no tendency to aggregate. Approaches for optimizing aglycosylated Fc may involve but are not limited to designing amino acid modifications that enhance aglycosylated Fc stability and\/or solubility by incorporating polar and\/or charged residues that face inward towards the Cg2-Cg2 dimer axis, and by designing amino acid modifications that directly enhance the aglycosylated Fc-Fc\u03b3R interface or the interface of aglycosylated Fc with some other Fc ligand.","The Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other Fc modifications, including but not limited to modifications that enhance effector function. The invention encompasses combining an Fc variant of the invention with other Fc modifications to provide additive, synergistic, or novel properties in antibodies or Fc fusions. Such modifications may be in the CH1, CH2, or CH3 domains or a combination thereof. Preferably the Fc variants of the invention enhance the property of the modification with which they are combined. For example, if an Fc variant of the invention is combined with a mutant known to bind Fc\u03b3RIIIA with a higher affinity than a comparable molecule comprising a wild type Fc region; the combination with a mutant of the invention results in a greater fold enhancement in Fc\u03b3RIIIA affinity.","In one embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other known Fc variants such as those disclosed in Duncan et al, 1988, Nature 332:563-564; Lund et al., 1991, J.

The method involves the formation of an Fc\u03b3R complex that has an improved avidity for an Fc region, relative to an uncompleted Fc\u03b3R. According to the invention, the preferred molecular complex is a tetrameric immune complex, comprising: (a) the soluble region of Fc\u03b3R (e.g., the soluble region of Fc\u03b3RIIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIA or Fc\u03b3RIIB); (b) a biotinylated 15 amino acid AVITAG\u2122 peptide sequence operably linked to the C-terminus of the soluble region of Fc\u03b3R (e.g., the soluble region of Fc\u03b3RIIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIA or Fc\u03b3RIIB); and (c) streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SA-PE); in a molar ratio to form a tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complex (preferably in a 5:1 molar ratio). According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the fusion protein is biotinylated enzymatically, using for example, the Bir A enzyme, a biotin ligase which specifically biotinylates a lysine residue in the 15 amino acid AVITAG\u2122 peptide sequence. In a specific embodiment of the invention, 85% of the fusion protein is biotinylated, as determined by standard methods known to those skilled in the art, including but not limited to streptavidin shift assay. According to preferred embodiments of the invention, the biotinylated soluble Fc\u03b3R proteins are mixed with SA-PE in a 1\u00d7 SA-PE:5\u00d7 biotinylated soluble Fc\u03b3R molar ratio to form a tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complex.","In a preferred embodiment of the invention, molecules comprising Fc regions bind the tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complexes, formed according to the methods of the invention, with at least an 8-fold higher affinity than the monomeric uncomplexed Fc\u03b3R. The binding of polypeptides comprising Fc regions to the tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complexes may be determined using standard techniques known to those skilled in the art, such as for example, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), radioimmunoassays, ELISA assays, etc.","The invention encompasses the use of the immune complexes formed according to the methods described above, for determining the functionality of molecules comprising an Fc region in cell-based or cell-free assays.","As a matter of convenience, the reagents may be provided in an assay kit, i.e., a packaged combination of reagents for assaying the ability of molecules comprising variant Fc regions to bind Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complexes. Other forms of molecular complexes for use in determining Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions are also contemplated for use in the methods of the invention, e.g., fusion proteins formed as described in U.S. Provisional Application 60\/439,709, filed on Jan. 13, 2003; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","5.2.3 Mutagenesis and Construction of Yeast Display Libraries","Molecular interactions between the IgG Fc and Fc receptors have been previously studied by both structural and genetic techniques. These studies identified amino acid residues that are critical for functional binding of Fc to different Fc\u03b3R. None of these changes have been shown to improve human Fc\u03b3R mediated efficacy of therapeutic antibodies in animal models. A complete analysis of all potential amino acid changes at these residues or other potentially important residues has not been reported. The platform described herein has the ability to both construct mutant libraries with all possible amino acid changes, screen libraries using multiple functional assays, and finally analyze libraries in relevant humanized animal models.","The instant invention encompasses construction of multiple libraries based on both genetic and structural data known in the art or being developed. The method described and exemplified herein incorporates building individual libraries that contain mutants testing all 20 amino acid changes at between 3-6 residues in the Fc region. The complete set of mutations will be assembled in all possible combinations of mutations. The number of independent mutations generated is based on the number of sites being saturated during library assembly (Table 9 below).

Using a library of randomly mutagenized IgG1 Fc and the screening assays described and exemplified herein Fc variants will be identified. In the initial rounds, the best 5 mutations, based on both FcR binding profile and functional activity will be selected. It will take 20individual mutants to cover all possible amino acid changes and their combinations at five locations. A library with at least 10-fold coverage for each mutant will be generated. In addition regions will be chosen based on available information, e.g., crystal structure data, Mouse\/Human isotype Fc\u03b3R binding differences, genetic data, and additional sites identified by mutagenesis.","The biggest disadvantage of current site directed mutagenic protocols is production of bias populations, over-representing variations in some regions and under-representing or completely lacking mutations in others. The present invention overcomes this problem by generating unbiased arrays of desirable Fc mutants using a well-developed gene building technology to eliminate the bias introduced in library construction by PCR based approaches such as overlapping PCR and inverted PCR. The key distinctions of the approach of the present invention are: 1) Employment of equimolar mix of 20 individual oligos for every targeted codon instead of degenerated primers. This way each amino acid is represented by a single, most used codon, whereas degenerated primers over represent those amino acids encoded by more codons over those encoded by fewer codons. 2) Building mutants by a chain replacement approach. This insures unbiased introduction of all desirable changes into the final product.","An exemplary protocol comprises of the following steps: 1) phosphorylated oligos, representing desirable changes at one or several locations, all complementary to the same strand, added to the template along with a thermostable, 5\u2032>3\u2032 exonuclease deficient, DNA polymerase and ligase (). 2) assembled mix undergoes a number of polymerization\/ligation cycles, sufficient to generate desirable amount of product. Use of a 5\u2032>3\u2032 exonuclease deficient DNA polymerase insures integrity of the primer sequence and its phosphate residue, when a thermostable ligase assembles individual primer-extended fragments into a contiguous single-stranded chain. Reaction cycles can continue until complete exhaustion of the oligos pool without introducing bias into the final product (). 3) generated pool of single-stranded mutants is converted into double-stranded DNA by adding a reverse gene-specific primer to the reaction ( ). 4) double-stranded product gets digested at the end-designed restriction sites and cloned into an appropriate expression vector ( )","To insure quality of the library, PCR amplified fragments will be analyzed by electrophoresis to determine the length of the final PCR products. The reaction will be characterized as successful if >99% of the PCR products are of the expected length. The final library will be cloned into an expression vector. A fraction of the mutant library will be sequenced to determine the rate of mutant codon incorporation. The number of fragments sequenced will be based on the number of target sites mutated and library validation will be determined by the observed rate of mutation at targeted sites (Table 10). The rate of vector without inserts should be less than 2%. The rate of mutation at non-targeted sites should be less than 8%.

In order to remain unbiased, individual primers for each codon will be used rather than degenerative primers. A similar validation scheme as disclosed supra will be employed.","Most preferably automated protocols will be employed for high throughput library production. Automation allows for improved throughput, walk away operation, and an overall reduction in experimental error for tasks requiring tedious repetitive operations. Oligo synthesis capabilities is based on 2 Mermade DNA synthesizers (Bioautomation, Inc.) with a total output capability of 575 60 mer Oligos\/12 hrs. Proprietary software handles all aspects of design, synthesis, and storage of the final oligonucleotides. Robotic liquid handlers will be employed to set up oligos for synthesis of full length Fc mutants and ligation reactions for incorporating the mutant Fcs into antibody heavy chain expression vectors will be set up. After ligation it is estimated that it would take 1 FTE \u02dc10 days to array the library clones and generate \u02dc8000 minipreps, equivalent to a combinatorial library saturated at 3 sites. Subsequent to bacterial transformation a Qpix-2 clone picker robot will be used for picking colonies into 96 deep well plates. Culture growth will be done using a magnetic levitation stirrer, capable of incubating 12 plates and resulting in dense growth in 12-16 hr at 37\u00b0 C. A Qiagen miniprep robot will be used to perform DNA preps at the rate of 4 96 well plates in 2.5 hrs. By overlapping tasks 5 such libraries could be constructed in 9 months with 1 FTE.","Affinity maturation requires the assembly of a new set of combinations of mutations, from a preselected mutant pool or members of a gene family, which can be enriched by a selection protocol. The process is repeated several times until the isolation of a mutant with the desired phenotype is achieved. The disadvantage of the current enzymatic approach, DNA shuffling, to accomplish this process is bias which can be introduced due to specific sites within gene that are hot spots for nucleases, dominance of specific mutants in the final reassembled pool and loss of some of the original mutants in the final pool. In order to overcome this shortcoming a build-a-gene (BAG) technology will be used to generate a highly complex library of Fc mutants containing random amino acid changes at all potential locations that may be important for receptor(s) binding. Sets of degenerated oligos covering specific regions of the IgG Fc will be used (See ).","Oligos will be \u02dc30 nt and degenerate oligos synthesized to change one (4 oligos) or two AAs (8 oligos) will be constructed. The oligos are designed to be overlapping with no gaps. It will take \u02dc200 oligos to accommodate all single AA changes and \u02dc2000 to change two AAs per oligonucleotide. All 2000+ oligos will be used individually and in combinations to generate arrays of Fc mutants using the protocol outlined above (A.20). We will use a home-written randomizer program and a robotic liquid handler for pooling selected combinations of mutant and wild type oligos. Large libraries will be cloned into vectors that will allow for screening using yeast surface display. This approach utilizes a magnetic bead selection followed by flow cytometry and has been successfully applied to libraries with a complexity >10(Feldhaus et al., 2003, Nat. Biotech. 21(2): 163-170; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). This limits the number of sites to test at any one pool to 7, resulting in \u02dc1.3\u00d710possible mutations\/pool.","To insure quality of the library PCR amplified fragments will be analyzed by electrophoresis to determine the length of the final PCR products. The reaction will be characterized as successful if >99% of the PCR products are of the expected length.

The rate of vectors without inserts should be less than 2%. The rate of mutation at non-targeted sites should be less than 8%.","The ability to generate the desired level of efficiency of mutagenesis by this approach will be determined by sequencing of a subset of clones. The alternative to BAG will be using a \u201cDNA shuffle\u201d protocol. This requires pooling all of the mutants, single, double, triple, etc. Following DNA preparation, Fc regions will be amplified by PCR using flanking primers that selectively amplify the mutated region of the Fc, \u02dc700 bp. Novel mutants are constructed by reshuffling of mutations in the Fc via DNAseI treatment of the amplified DNA and isolation of 150-200 bp fragments (see, e.g., Stemmer et al., 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 91: 10747-51). Fragments will be religated, PCR amplified with nested primers and cloned into the yeast surface display vector, pYD1. The recombined library will be reselected in the yeast Fc display screen as described and exemplified herein.","BAG libraries will utilize most of the same equipment as the combinatorial library. However cloning will be in a vector suitable for yeast surface display and will not require arraying of individual clones as the yeast surface display will initially be employed for enrichment of large libraries. Subsequent to the appropriate level of enrichment individual clones will be arrayed.","An initial library of molecules comprising variant Fc regions is produced using any random based mutagenesis techniques known in the art. It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that amino acid sequence variants of Fc regions may be obtained by any mutagenesis technique known to those skilled in the art. Some of these techniques are briefly described herein, however, it will be recognized that alternative procedures may produce an equivalent result. In a preferred embodiment molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions are prepared by error-prone PCR as exemplified in Example 6, infra (See Leung et al., 1989, 1:11). It is especially preferred to have error rates of 2-3 bp\/Kb for use in the methods of the invention. In one embodiment, using error prone PCR a mutation frequency of 2-3 mutations\/kb is obtained.","Mutagenesis may be performed in accordance with any of the techniques known in the art including, but not limited to, synthesizing an oligonucleotide having one or more modifications within the sequence of the Fc region of an antibody or a polypeptide comprising an Fc region (e.g., the CH2 or CH3 domain) to be modified. Site-specific mutagenesis allows the production of mutants through the use of specific oligonucleotide sequences which encode the DNA sequence of the desired mutation, as well as a sufficient number of adjacent nucleotides, to provide a primer sequence of sufficient size and sequence complexity to form a stable duplex on both sides of the deletion junction being traversed. Typically, a primer of about 30 to about 45 nucleotides or more in length is preferred, with about 10 to about 25 or more residues on both sides of the junction of the sequence being altered. A number of such primers introducing a variety of different mutations at one or more positions may be used to generated a library of mutants.","The technique of site-specific mutagenesis is well known in the art, as exemplified by various publications (see, e.g., Kunkel et al., 154:367-82, 1987, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). In general, site-directed mutagenesis is performed by first obtaining a single-stranded vector or melting apart of two strands of a double stranded vector which includes within its sequence a DNA sequence which encodes the desired peptide. An oligonucleotide primer bearing the desired mutated sequence is prepared, generally synthetically. This primer is then annealed with the single-stranded vector, and subjected to DNA polymerizing enzymes such as T7 DNA polymerase, in order to complete the synthesis of the mutation-bearing strand. Thus, a heteroduplex is formed wherein one strand encodes the original non-mutated sequence and the second strand bears the desired mutation. This heteroduplex vector is then used to transform or transfect appropriate cells, such as cells, and clones are selected which include recombinant vectors bearing the mutated sequence arrangement. As will be appreciated, the technique typically employs a phage vector which exists in both a single stranded and double stranded form. Typical vectors useful in site-directed mutagenesis include vectors such as the M13 phage. These phage are readily commercially available and their use is generally well known to those skilled in the art. Double stranded plasmids are also routinely employed in site directed mutagenesis which eliminates the step of transferring the gene of interest from a plasmid to a phage.","Alternatively, the use of PCR\u2122 with commercially available thermostable enzymes such as Taq DNA polymerase may be used to incorporate a mutagenic oligonucleotide primer into an amplified DNA fragment that can then be cloned into an appropriate cloning or expression vector. See, e.g., Tomic et al., 18(6):1656, 1987, and Upender et al., 18(1):29-30, 32, 1995, for PCR\u2122-mediated mutagenesis procedures, which are hereby incorporated in their entireties. PCR\u2122 employing a thermostable ligase in addition to a thermostable polymerase may also be used to incorporate a phosphorylated mutagenic oligonucleotide into an amplified DNA fragment that may then be cloned into an appropriate cloning or expression vector (see e.g., Michael, 16(3):410-2, 1994, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).","Another method for preparing variants for use in the invention, is cassette mutagenesis based on the technique described by Wells et al. (1985, 34: 315). The starting material is the plasmid comprising the desired DNA encoding the protein to be mutated (e.g., the DNA encoding a polypeptide comprising an Fc region). The codon(s) in the DNA sequence to be mutated are identified; there must be a unique restriction endonuclease site on each side of the identified mutations site(s). If no such restriction site exits, it may be generated by oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis. After the restriction sites have been introduced into the plasmid, the plasmid is cut at these sites and linearized. A double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the sequence of the DNA between the restriction sites but containing the mutation is synthesized using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art. The double stranded oligonucleotide is referred to as the cassette. This cassette is designed to have 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends that are compatible with the ends of the linearized plasmid, such that it can be directly ligated to the plasmid.","Other methods known to those of skill in the art for producing sequence variants of the Fc region of an antibody or polypeptides comprising an Fc region can be used. For example, recombinant vectors encoding the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of an antibody or a fragment thereof may be treated with mutagenic agents, such as hydroxylamine, to obtain sequence variants.","Once a mutant library is produced according to the methods described, the mutagenized library is transformed into a yeast strain, preferably EBY100 (Invitrogen), MATa ura3-52 trpl leu2\u03941 his3\u0394200 pep4::HIS3 prb1\u03941.6R can1 GAL::GAL-AGA1 using a standard lithium acetate transformation protocol known to those skilled in the art.","It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, that once molecules of the invention with desired effector function and\/or binding properties (e.g., molecules with variant Fc regions with at least one amino acid modification, which modification confers ADCC activity or enhances the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA relative to a comparable molecule, comprising a wild-type Fc region) have been identified (See Section 5.1 and Table 2) according to the methods of the invention, other molecules (i.e, therapeutic antibodies) may be engineered using standard recombinant DNA techniques and any known mutagenesis techniques, as described in this section to produce engineered molecules carrying the identified mutation sites.","5.2.4 Yeast Surface Display","The preferred method for screening and identifying molecules comprising variant Fc regions with altered Fc\u03b3R affinities (i.e., enhanced Fc\u03b3RIIIA affinity and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA) is yeast surface display technology (for review see Boder and Wittrup, 2000, 328: 430-444, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) which addresses the deficiency in the prior art for screening binding interactions of extracellular post-translationally modified proteins.

Fc mutant libraries with >10,000 independent mutants (4 or more sites) will be cloned into the appropriate vectors for yeast surface display and enriched by FACS sorting until <8000 mutants are able to be tested by other biochemical and functional assays as described below.","The invention provides methods for constructing an Fc mutant library in yeast for displaying molecules comprising Fc regions, which have been mutated as described in Section 5.2.2. Preferably, the Fc mutant libraries for use in the methods of the invention contain at least 10cells, up to 10cells. One exemplary method for constructing a Fc library for use in the methods of the invention comprises the following: nucleic acids encoding molecules comprising Fc regions are cloned into the multiple cloning site of a vector derived from a yeast replicating vector, e.g., pCT302; such that the Fc encoding nucleic acids are expressed under the control of the GAL1 galactose-inducible promoter and in-frame with a nucleotide sequence encoding Aga2p, the mating agglutinin cell wall protein. In a preferred embodiment, nucleic acids encoding molecules comprising Fc regions are cloned C-terminal to the Aga2p coding region, such that a Fc-region Aga2p fusion protein is encoded. A fusion protein comprising the Aga2p protein and polypeptides comprising Fc regions will be secreted extracellularly and displayed on the cell wall via disulfide linkage to the Aga1p protein, an integral cell wall protein, using the preferred construct of the invention.

Any epitope tag nucleotide coding sequence known to those skilled in the art can be used in accordance with the invention, including, but not limited to nucleotide sequences encoding hemagglutinin (HA), c-myc Xpress TAG, His-TAG, or V5TAG. The presence of the fusion protein on the yeast cell surface may be detected using FACS analysis, confocal fluorescence microscopy or standard immunostaining methods, all of which are known to those skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the presence of the Fc fusion proteins of the invention on the yeast cell surface are detected using Fc-specific monoclonal antibodies (CH3 specific), including but not limited to IgG1 Fc-specific monoclonal antibody, HP6017 (Sigma), JL512 (Immunotech), and any antibody disclosed in Partridge et al., 1986, 23 (12): 1365-72, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In another embodiment, the presence of the Fc fusion proteins of the invention are detected by immunofluorescent labeling of epitope tags using techniques known to those skilled in the art. It is particularly useful in the methods of the invention, to use nucleotide sequences encoding epitope tags to flank the nucleic acids encoding the Fc fusion proteins, as an internal control, to detect if the fusion proteins are displayed on the cell wall in a partially proteolyzed form.","5.2.5 Screening of Yeast Display Libraries","The invention encompasses screening the yeast display libraries using immunological based assays including but not limited to cell based assays, solution based assays, and solid phase based assays.","In some embodiments, the invention encompasses identification of Fc mutants with altered Fc\u03b3R affinities using affinity maturation methods which are known to those skilled in the art and encompassed herein. Briefly, affinity maturation creates novel alleles by randomly recombining individual mutations present in a mutant library, see, e.g., Hawkins et al., 1992, 226: 889-896; Stemmer et al., 1994 370: 389-91; both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. It has been used successfully to increase the affinity of antibodies, T cell receptors and other proteins. The invention encompasses using mutations that show increased Fc\u03b3R binding as a baseline to construct new mutant libraries with enhanced phenotypes. Using the methods of the invention, a population of IgG1 Fc mutants enriched by yeast surface display for increased binding to an Fc\u03b3R, e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA, may be selected. Following DNA preparation, Fc regions can be amplified by PCR using flanking primers that selectively amplify the mutated region of the Fc, which is about \u02dc700 bp using methods known to one skilled in the art and exemplified or disclosed herein. Novel mutants can thus be constructed by reshuffling of mutations in the Fc region for example via DNAseI treatment of the amplified DNA and isolation of fragments using methods such as those disclosed by Stemmer et al., 1994 91: 10747-51, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Fragments can then be religated, PCR amplified with nested primers and cloned into the yeast display vector, e.g., pYD1 using methods known to one skilled in the art. The recombined library can then be reselected in the yeast Fc display screen. As the Kdecreases, below 10 nM, conditions can be established to allow for further increases in affinity based on the reduction of the off rate of the Fc\u03b3RIIIA ligand from the Fc receptor using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in Boder et al., 1998, 14: 55-62, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The invention encompasses a kinetic screen of the yeast library. A kinetic screen may be established by labeling of the Fc displaying cells to saturation with a labeled ligand, e.g., a fluorescent ligand followed by incubation with an excess of non-labeled ligand for a predetermined period. After termination of the reaction by the addition of excess buffer (e.g., 1\u00d7 PBS, 0.5 mg\/ml BSA) cells will be analyzed by FACS and sort gates set for selection. After each round of enrichment individual mutants can be tested for fold increases in affinity and sequenced for diversity. The in vitro recombination process can be repeated. In some embodiments, the in vitro recombination process is repeated at least 3 times.","Selection of the Fc variants of the invention may be done using any Fc\u03b3R including but not limited to polymorphic variants of Fc\u03b3R. In some embodiments, selection of the Fc variants is done using a polymorphic variant of Fc\u03b3RIIIA which contains a phenylalanine at position 158. In other embodiments, selection of the Fc variants is done using a polymorphic variant of Fc\u03b3RIIIA which contains a valine at position 158. Fc\u03b3RIIIA 158V displays a higher affinity for IgG1 than 158F and an increased ADCC activity (see, e.g., Koene et al., 1997, 90:1109-14; Wu et al., 1997, 100: 1059-70, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties); this residue in fact directly interacts with the lower hinge region of IgG1 as recently shown by IgG1-Fc\u03b3RIIIA co-crystallization studies, see, e.g., Sonderman et al., 2000, 100: 1059-70, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Studies have shown that in some cases therapeutic antibodies have improved efficacy in Fc\u03b3RIIIA-158V homozygous patients. Therapeutic antibodies may also be more effective in patients heterozygous for Fc\u03b3RIIIA-158V and Fc\u03b3RIIIA-158F, and in patients with Fc\u03b3RIIA H131.","The invention encompasses screening yeast libraries based on Fc\u03b3RIIB depletion and Fc\u03b3RIIIA selection so that Fc mutants are selected that not only have an enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIIA but also have a reduced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB. Yeast libraries may be enriched for clones that have a reduced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB by sequential depletion methods, for example, by incubating the yeast library with magnetic beads coated with Fc\u03b3RIIB. Fc\u03b3RIIB depletion is preferably carried out sequentially so that the library is enriched in clones that have a reduced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB. In some embodiments, the Fc\u03b3RIIB depletion step results in a population of cells so that only 30%, preferably only 10%, more preferably only 5%, most preferably less than 1% bind Fc\u03b3RIIB. In some embodiments, Fc\u03b3RIIB depletion is carried out in at least 3 cycles, at least 4 cycles, at least 6 cycles. The Fc\u03b3RIIB depletion step is preferably combined with an Fc\u03b3RIIIIA selection step, for example using FACS sorting so that Fc variants with an enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIIA are selected.","5.2.5.1 FACS Assays; Solid Phased Assays and Immunological Based Assays","The invention encompasses characterization of the mutant Fc fusion proteins that are displayed on the yeast surface cell wall, according to the methods described in Section 5.2.3. One aspect of the invention provides a method for selecting mutant Fc fusion proteins with a desirable binding property, specifically, the ability of the mutant Fc fusion protein to bind Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA with a greater affinity than a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild-type Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA. In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for selecting mutant Fc fusion proteins with a desirable binding property, specifically, the ability of the mutant Fc fusion protein to bind Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA with a greater affinity than a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild-type Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA, and further the ability of the mutant Fc fusion protein to bind Fc\u03b3RIIB with a lower affinity than a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild-type Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIB. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, that the methods of the invention can be used for identifying and screening any mutations in the Fc regions of molecules, with any desired binding characteristic.","Yeast cells displaying the mutant Fc fusion proteins can be screened and characterized by any biochemical or immunological based assays known to those skilled in the art for assessing binding interactions.","Preferably, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), using any of the techniques known to those skilled in the art, is used for screening the mutant Fc fusion proteins displayed on the yeast cell surface for binding Fc\u03b3RIIIA, preferably the Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex, or optionally Fc\u03b3RIIB. Flow sorters are capable of rapidly examining a large number of individual cells that contain library inserts (e.g., 10-100 million cells per hour) (Shapiro et al., 1995). Additionally, specific parameters used for optimization including, but not limited to, ligand concentration (i.e., Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex), kinetic competition time, or FACS stringency may be varied in order to select for the cells which display Fc fusion proteins with specific binding properties, e.g., higher affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA compared to a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild-type Fc region. Flow cytometers for sorting and examining biological cells are well known in the art. Known flow cytometers are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,347,935; 5,464,581; 5,483,469; 5,602,039; 5,643,796; and 6,211,477; the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. Other known flow cytometers are the FACS Vantage\u2122 system manufactured by Becton Dickinson and Company, and the COPAS\u2122 system manufactured by Union Biometrica.","According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, yeast cells are analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). In most preferred embodiments, the FACS analysis of the yeast cells is done in an iterative manner, at least twice, at least three times, or at least 5 times. Between each round of selection cells are regrown and induced so the Fc regions are displayed on the maximum number of yeast cell surfaces. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mode of action, this iterative process helps enrich the population of the cells with a particular phenotype, e.g., high binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIA.","In preferred embodiments, screening for Fc variants of the invention comprises a selection process that has multiple rounds of screening, e.g., at least two rounds of screening. In one embodiment, screening for Fc variants that have an enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA may comprise the following steps: in the first round of screening, a library of yeast cells, e.g., a naive library of 10cells is enriched by FACS, preferably in an iterative manner, using for example labeled tetrameric Fc\u03b3RIIIA to select for Fc variants that have an enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA; the variant Fc region that is selected with the desired phenotype, e.g., enhanced binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIA, is then introduced into an antibody, e.g., a 4-4-20 antibody, and the engineered antibody is assayed using a secondary screen, e.g., ELISA for binding to an Fc\u03b3R. In the second round of screening, a single mutation library may be generated based on the first screen so that the Fc region harbors the variant displaying the enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA; and enriched by FACS using for example labeled monomeric Fc\u03b3RIIIA in both the presence and absence of unlabeled receptor; and the variant Fc region is then introduced into an antibody, e.g., a 4-4-20 antibody, and the engineered antibody is assayed using a secondary screen, e.g., ELISA for binding to an Fc\u03b3R. In some embodiments, the secondary screen may further comprise characterizing the antibodies comprising Fc variants in an ADCC or BIAcore based assay using methods disclosed herein","The invention encompasses FACS screening of the mutant yeast library under equilibrium or kinetic conditions. When the screening is performed under equilibrium conditions, an excess of the yeast library carrying Fc mutants is incubated with Fc\u03b3RIIIA, preferably labeled Fc\u03b3RIIIA at a concentration 5-10 fold below the Kd, for at least one hour to allow binding of Fc mutants to Fc\u03b3RIIIA under equilibrium conditions. When the screening is performed under kinetic conditions, the mutant yeast library is incubated with labeled Fc\u03b3RIIIA; the cells are then incubated with equimolar unlabeled Fc\u03b3RIIIA for a pre-selected time, bound Fc\u03b3RIIIA is then monitored.","One exemplary method of analyzing the yeast cells expressing mutant Fc fusion proteins with FACS is costaining the cells with Fc\u03b3RIIIA-tetrameric complex which has been labeled with a fluorescent label such as, PE and an anti-Fc antibody, such as F(ab)anti-Fc which has been fluorescently labeled. Fluorescence measurements of a yeast library produced according to the methods of the invention preferably involves comparisons with controls; for example, yeast cells that lack the insert encoding molecules comprising an Fc region (negative control). The flow sorter has the ability not only to measure fluorescence signals in cells at a rapid rate, but also to collect cells that have specified fluorescent properties. This feature may be employed in a preferred embodiment of the invention to enrich the initial library population for cells expressing Fc fusion proteins with specific binding characteristics, e.g., higher affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA compared to a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild-type Fc region. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, yeast cells are analyzed by FACS and sort gates established to select for cells that show the highest affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA relative to the amount of Fc expression on the yeast cell surface. According to a preferred embodiment, four consecutive sorts are established, wherein the gates for each successive sort is 5.5%, 1%, 0.2%, and 0.1%. It is preferred that the yeast display library formed according to the methods of the invention be over-sampled by at least 10-fold to improve the probability of isolating rare clones (e.g., analyze \u02dc10cells from a library of 10clones). Alternatively, 2-5 sorts are established to select for cells of the desired phenotype. Sort gates can be established empirically by one skilled in the art.","In other preferred embodiments, mutant Fc fusion proteins displayed on the yeast cell surface are screened using solid phase based assays, for example assays using magnetic beads, e.g., supplied by Dynal, preferably in a high through put manner for binding to an Fc\u03b3R, e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA. In one embodiment, magnetic bead assays may be used to identify mutants with enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or reduced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB. An exemplary assay to identify mutants with enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and reduced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB may comprise selecting mutants by a sequential solid phase depletion using magnetic beads coated with Fc\u03b3RIIB followed by selection with magnetic beads coated with Fc\u03b3RIIIA. For example, one assay may comprise the following steps: incubating the library of yeast cells generated in accordance with the methods of the invention with magnetic beads coated with Fc\u03b3RIIB; separating yeast cells bound to beads from the non bound fraction by placing the mixture in a magnetic field, removing the non-bound yeast cells and placing them in a fresh media; binding the yeast cells to beads coated with Fc\u03b3RIIIA, separating yeast cells bound to beads from the non bound fraction by placing the mixture in a magnetic field, removing the non-bound yeast cells; removing the bound cells by rigorous vortexing; growing the recovered cells in glucose containing media; re-inducing in selective media containing galactose. The selection process is repeated at least once. Inserts containing the Fc domain are then amplified using common methodologies known in the art, e.g., PCR, and introduced into an antibody by methods already described for further characterization.","In an alternative embodiment, a non-yeast based system is used to characterize the binding properties of the molecules of the invention. One exemplary system for characterizing the molecules of the invention comprises a mammalian expression vector containing the heavy chain of the anti-fluorescein monoclonal antibody 4-4-20, into which the nucleic acids encoding the molecules of the invention with variant Fc regions are cloned. The resulting recombinant clone is expressed in a mammalian host cell line (i.e., human kidney cell line 293H), and the resulting recombinant immunoglobulin is analyzed for binding to Fc\u03b3R using any standard assay known to those in the art, including but not limited to ELISA and FACS.","Molecules of the present invention may be characterized in a variety of ways. In particular, molecules of the invention comprising modified Fc regions may be assayed for the ability to immunospecifically bind to a ligand, e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex. Such an assay may be performed in solution (e.g., Houghten, 13:412-421, 1992), on beads (Lam, 354:82-84, 1991, on chips (Fodor, 364:555-556, 1993), on bacteria (U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409), on spores (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,571,698; 5,403,484; and 5,223,409), on plasmids (Cull et al., 89:1865-1869, 1992) or on phage (Scott and Smith, 249:386-390, 1990; Devlin, 249:404-406, 1990; Cwirla et al., 87:6378-6382, 1990; and Felici, 222:301-310, 1991) (each of these references is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Molecules that have been identified to immunospecifically bind to an ligand, e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA can then be assayed for their specificity and affinity for the ligand.","Molecules of the invention that have been engineered to comprise modified Fc regions (e.g., therapeutic antibodies) or have been identified in the yeast display system to have the desired phenotype (see Section 5.1) may be assayed for immunospecific binding to an antigen (e.g., cancer antigen and cross-reactivity with other antigens (e.g., Fc\u03b3R) by any method known in the art. Immunoassays which can be used to analyze immunospecific binding and cross-reactivity include, but are not limited to, competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), \u201csandwich\u201d immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays, to name but a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al., eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","The binding affinity of the molecules of the present invention comprising modified Fc regions to a ligand, e.g., Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complex and the off-rate of the interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled ligand, such as tetrameric Fc\u03b3R (e.g., H or I) with a molecule of interest (e.g., molecules of the present invention comprising modified Fc regions) in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled ligand, such as tetrameric Fc\u03b3R, and the detection of the molecule bound to the labeled ligand. The affinity of the molecule of the present invention for the ligand and the binding off-rates can be determined from the saturation data by scatchard analysis.","In a preferred embodiment, BIAcore kinetic analysis is used to determine the binding on and off rates of molecules of the present invention to a ligand such as Fc\u03b3R. BIAcore kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding and dissociation of a ligand from chips with immobilized molecules (e.g., molecules comprising modified Fc regions) on their surface.","5.2.6 Sequencing of Mutants","Any of a variety of sequencing reactions known in the art can be used to directly sequence the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions. Examples of sequencing reactions include those based on techniques developed by Maxim and Gilbert (74:560, 1977) or Sanger (74:5463, 1977). It is also contemplated that any of a variety of automated sequencing procedures can be utilized (19:448, 1995), including sequencing by mass spectrometry (see, e.g., PCT Publication No. WO 94\/16101, Cohen et al., 36:127-162, 1996, and Griffin et al., 38:147-159, 1993).","5.2.7 Functional Assays of Molecules with Variant Fc Regions","The invention encompasses characterization of the molecules of the invention (e.g., an antibody comprising a variant Fc region identified by the yeast display technology described supra; or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies engineered according to the methods of the invention) using assays known to those skilled in the art for identifying the effector cell function of the molecules. In particular, the invention encompasses characterizing the molecules of the invention for Fc\u03b3R-mediated effector cell function. Examples of effector cell functions that can be assayed in accordance with the invention, include but are not limited to, antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity, phagocytosis, opsonization, opsonophagocytosis, C1q binding, and complement dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Any cell-based or cell free assay known to those skilled in the art for determining effector cell function activity can be used (For effector cell assays, see Perussia et al., 2000, 121: 179-92; Baggiolini et al., 1998 44(10): 841-8; Lehmann et al., 2000 243(1-2): 229-42; Brown E J. 1994, 45: 147-64; Munn et al., 1990 172: 231-237, Abdul-Majid et al., 2002 55: 70-81; Ding et al., 1998, 8:403-411, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","In one embodiment, the molecules of the invention can be assayed for Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis in human monocytes. Alternatively, the Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis of the molecules of the invention may be assayed in other phagocytes, e.g., neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leuckocytes; PMN); human peripheral blood monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, which can be obtained using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art (e.g., see Brown E J. 1994, 45: 147-164). In one embodiment, the function of the molecules of the invention is characterized by measuring the ability of THP-1 cells to phagocytose fluoresceinated IgG-opsonized sheep red blood cells (SRBC) by methods previously described (Tridandapani et al., 2000, 275: 20480-7). For example, an exemplary assay for measuring phagocytosis of the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions with enhanced affinities for Fc\u03b3RIIIA, comprises of: treating THP-1 cells with a molecule of the invention or with a control antibody that does not bind to Fc\u03b3RIIIA, comparing the activity levels of said cells, wherein a difference in the activities of the cells (e.g., rosetting activity (the number of THP-1 cells binding IgG-coated SRBC), adherence activity (the total number of SRBC bound to THP-1 cells), and phagocytic rate) would indicate the functionality of the molecule of the invention. It can be appreciated by one skilled in the art that this exemplary assay can be used to assay any of the molecules identified by the methods of the invention.","Another exemplary assay for determining the phagocytosis of the molecules of the invention is an antibody-dependent opsonophagocytosis assay (ADCP) which can comprise the following: coating a target bioparticle such as -labeled FITC (Molecular Probes) or -FITC with (i) wild-type 4-4-20 antibody, an antibody to fluorescein (See Bedzyk et al., 1989, J. 264(3): 1565-1569, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), as the control antibody for Fc\u03b3R-dependent ADCP; or (ii) 4-4-20 antibody harboring the D265A mutation that knocks out binding to Fc\u03b3RIII, as a background control for Fc\u03b3R-dependent ADCP (iii) 4-4-20 antibody carrying variant Fc regions identified by the methods of the invention and produced as exemplified in Example 6.6; and forming the opsonized particle; adding any of the opsonized particles described (i-iii) to THP-1 effector cells (a monocytic cell line available from ATCC) at a 1:1, 10:1, 30:1, 60:1, 75:1 or 100:1 ratio to allow Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis to occur; preferably incubating the cells and -FITC\/antibody at 37\u00b0 C. for 1.5 hour; adding trypan blue after incubation (preferably at room temperature for 2-3 min.) to the cells to quench the fluoroscence of the bacteria that are adhered to the outside of the cell surface without being internalized; transferring cells into a FACS buffer (e.g., 0.1%, BSA in PBS, 0.1%, sodium azide), analyzing the fluorescence of the THP1 cells using FACS (e.g., BD FACS Calibur). Preferably, the THP-1 cells used in the assay are analyzed by FACS for expression of Fc\u03b3R on the cell surface. THP-1 cells express both CD32A and CD64. CD64 is a high affinity Fc\u03b3R that is blocked in conducting the ADCP assay in accordance with the methods of the invention. The THP-1 cells are preferably blocked with 100 \u03bcg\/mL soluble IgG1 or 10% human serum. To analyze the extent of ADCP, the gate is preferably set on THP-1 cells and median fluorescence intensity is measured. The ADCP activity for individual mutants is calculated and reported as a normalized value to the wild type chMab 4-4-20 obtained. The opsonized particles are added to THP-1 cells such that the ratio of the opsonized particles to THP-1 cells is 30:1 or 60:1. In most preferred embodiments, the ADCP assay is conducted with controls, such as -FITC in medium, -FITC and THP-1 cells (to serve as Fc\u03b3R-independent ADCP activity), -FITC, THP-1 cells and wild-type 4-4-20 antibody (to serve as Fc\u03b3R-dependent ADCP activity), -FITC, THP-1 cells, 4-4-20 D265A (to serve as the background control for Fc\u03b3R-dependent ADCP activity).","In another embodiment, the molecules of the invention can be assayed for Fc\u03b3R-mediated ADCC activity in effector cells, e.g., natural killer cells, using any of the standard methods known to those skilled in the art (See e.g., Perussia et al., 2000, 121: 179-92; Weng et al., 2003, J. Clin. Oncol. 21:3940-3947). An exemplary assay for determining ADCC activity of the molecules of the invention is based on a Cr release assay comprising of: labeling target cells with [Cr]NaCrO(this cell-membrane permeable molecule is commonly used for labeling since it binds cytoplasmic proteins and although spontaneously released from the cells with slow kinetics, it is released massively following target cell necrosis); opsonizing the target cells with the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions; combining the opsonized radiolabeled target cells with effector cells in a microtitre plate at an appropriate ratio of target cells to effector cells; incubating the mixture of cells for 16-18 hours at 37\u00b0 C.; collecting supernatants; and analyzing radioactivity. The cytotoxicity of the molecules of the invention can then be determined, for example using the following formula: % lysis=( experimental cpm\u2212target leak cpm)\/(detergent lysis cpm\u2212target leak cpm)\u00d7100%. Alternatively, % lysis=(ADCC\u2212AICC)\/(maximum release-spontaneous release). Specific lysis can be calculated using the formula: specific lysis=% lysis with the molecules of the invention\u2212% lysis in the absence of the molecules of the invention. A graph can be generated by varying either the target: effector cell ratio or antibody concentration.","In yet another embodiment, the molecules of the invention are characterized for antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) see, e.g., Ding et al., 1998, 8:403-11; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Preferably, the effector cells used in the ADCC assays of the invention are peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that are preferably purified from normal human blood, using standard methods known to one skilled in the art, e.g., using Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. Preferred effector cells for use in the methods of the invention express different Fc\u03b3R activating receptors. The invention encompasses, effector cells, THP-1, expressing Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB, and monocyte derived primary macrophages derived from whole human blood expressing both Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB, to determine if Fc antibody mutants show increased ADCC activity and phagocytosis relative to wild type IgG1 antibodies.","The human monocyte cell line, THP-1, activates phagocytosis through expression of the high affinity receptor Fc\u03b3RI and the low affinity receptor Fc\u03b3RIIA (Fleit et al., 1991, J. Leuk. Biol. 49: 556). THP-1 cells do not constitutively express Fc\u03b3RIIA or Fc\u03b3RIIB. Stimulation of these cells with cytokines effects the FcR expression pattern (Pricop et al., 2000 J. Immunol. 166: 531-7). Growth of THP-1 cells in the presence of the cytokine IL4 induces Fc\u03b3RIIB expression and causes a reduction in Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RI expression. Fc\u03b3RIIB expression can also be enhanced by increased cell density (Tridandapani et al., 2002, 277: 5082-9). In contrast, it has been reported that IFN\u03b3 can lead to expression of Fc\u03b3RIIIA (Pearse et al., 1993 90: 4314-8). The presence or absence of receptors on the cell surface can be determined by FACS using common methods known to one skilled in the art. Cytokine induced expression of Fc\u03b3R on the cell surface provides a system to test both activation and inhibition in the presence of Fc\u03b3RIIB. If THP-1 cells are unable to express the Fc\u03b3RIIB the invention also encompasses another human monocyte cell line, U937. These cells have been shown to terminally differentiate into macrophages in the presence of IFN\u03b3 and TNF (Koren et al., 1979, 279: 328-331).","Fc\u03b3R dependent tumor cell killing is mediated by macrophage and NK cells in mouse tumor models (Clynes et al., 1998, 95: 652-656). The invention encompasses the use of elutriated monocytes from donors as effector cells to analyze the efficiency Fc mutants to trigger cell cytotoxicity of target cells in both phagocytosis and ADCC assays. Expression patterns of Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIIA, and Fc\u03b3RIIB are affected by different growth conditions. Fc\u03b3R expression from frozen elutriated monocytes, fresh elutriated monocytes, monocytes maintained in 10% FBS, and monocytes cultured in FBS+GM-CSF and or in human serum may be determined using common methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, cells can be stained with Fc\u03b3R specific antibodies and analyzed by FACS to determine FcR profiles. Conditions that best mimic macrophage in vivo Fc\u03b3R expression is then used for the methods of the invention.","In some embodiments, the invention encompasses the use of mouse cells especially when human cells with the right Fc\u03b3R profiles are unable to be obtained. In some embodiments, the invention encompasses the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7(ATCC) which can be transfected with human Fc\u03b3RIIIA and stable transfectants isolated using methods known in the art, see, e.g., Ralph et al., J. 119: 950-4). Transfectants can be quantitated for Fc\u03b3RIIIA expression by FACS analysis using routine experimentation and high expressors can be used in the ADCC assays of the invention. In other embodiments, the invention encompasses isolation of spleen peritoneal macrophage expressing human Fc\u03b3R from knockout transgenic mice such as those disclosed herein.","Lymphocytes may be harvested from peripheral blood of donors (PBM) using a Ficoll-Paque gradient (Pharmacia). Within the isolated mononuclear population of cells the majority of the ADCC activity occurs via the natural killer cells (NK) containing Fc\u03b3RIIIA but not Fc\u03b3RIIB on their surface. Results with these cells indicate the efficacy of the mutants on triggering NK cell ADCC and establish the reagents to test with elutriated monocytes.","Target cells used in the ADCC assays of the invention include, but are not limited to, breast cancer cell lines, e.g., SK-BR-3 with ATCC accession number HTB-30 (see, e.g., Tremp et al., 1976, 33-41); B-lymphocytes; cells derived from Burkitts lymphoma, e.g., Raji cells with ATCC accession number CCL-86 (see, e.g., Epstein et al., 1965, 34: 231-240), and Daudi cells with ATCC accession number CCL-213 (see, e.g., Klein et al., 1968, 28: 1300-10). The target cells must be recognized by the antigen binding site of the immunoglobulin to be assayed.","The ADCC assay is based on the ability of NK cells to mediate cell death via an apoptotic pathway. NK cells mediate cell death in part by Fc\u03b3RIIIA's recognition of IgG bound to an antigen on a cell surface. The ADCC assays used in accordance with the methods of the invention may be radioactive based assays or fluorescence based assays. The ADCC assay used to characterize the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions comprises labeling target cells, e.g., SK-BR-3, MCF-7, OVCAR3, Raji, Daudi cells, opsonizing target cells with an antibody that recognizes a cell surface receptor on the target cell via its antigen binding site; combining the labeled opsonized target cells and the effector cells at an appropriate ratio, which can be determined by routine experimentation; harvesting the cells; detecting the label in the supernatant of the lysed target cells, using an appropriate detection scheme based on the label used. The target cells may be labeled either with a radioactive label or a fluorescent label, using standard methods known in the art. For example the labels include, but are not limited to, [Cr]NaCrO; and the acetoxymethyl ester of the fluorescence enhancing ligand, 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2033-terpyridine-6-6\u2033-dicarboxylate (TDA).","In a specific preferred embodiment, a time resolved fluorimetric assay is used for measuring ADCC activity against target cells that have been labeled with the acetoxymethyl ester of the fluorescence enhancing ligand, 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2033-terpyridine-6-6\u2033-dicarboxylate (TDA). Such fluorimetric assays are known in the art, e.g., see, Blomberg et al., 1996, 193: 199-206; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly, target cells are labeled with the membrane permeable acetoxymethyl diester of TDA (bis(acetoxymethyl) 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2033-terpyridine-6-6\u2033-dicarboxylate, (BATDA), which rapidly diffuses across the cell membrane of viable cells. Intracellular esterases split off the ester groups and the regenerated membrane impermeable TDA molecule is trapped inside the cell. After incubation of effector and target cells, e.g., for at least two hours, up to 3.5 hours, at 37\u00b0 C., under 5% CO, the TDA released from the lysed target cells is chelated with Eu3+ and the fluorescence of the Europium-TDA chelates formed is quantitated in a time-resolved fluorometer (e.g., Victor 1420, Perkin Elmer\/Wallac).","In another specific embodiment, the ADCC assay used to characterize the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions comprises the following steps: Preferably 4-5\u00d710target cells (e.g., SK-BR-3, MCF-7, OVCAR3, Raji cells) are labeled with bis(acetoxymethyl) 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2033-terpyridine-t-6\u2033-dicarboxylate (DELFIA BATDA Reagent, Perkin Elmer\/Wallac). For optimal labeling efficiency, the number of target cells used in the ADCC assay should preferably not exceed 5\u00d710. BATDA reagent is added to the cells and the mixture is incubated at 37\u00b0 C. preferably under 5% CO, for at least 30 minutes. The cells are then washed with a physiological buffer, e.g., PBS with 0.125 mM sulfinpyrazole, and media containing 0.125 mM sulfinpyrazole. The labeled target cells are then opsonized (coated) with a molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region, i.e., an immunoglobulin comprising a variant Fc region of the invention, including, but not limited to, a polyclonal antibody, a monoclonal antibody, a bispecific antibody, a multi-specific antibody, a humanized antibody, or a chimeric antibody. In preferred embodiments, the immunoglobulin comprising a variant Fc region used in the ADCC assay is specific for a cell surface receptor, a tumor antigen, or a cancer antigen. The immunoglobulin into which a variant Fc region of the invention is introduced may specifically bind any cancer or tumor antigen, such as those listed in section 5.4. Additionally, the immunoglobulin into which a variant Fc region of the invention is introduced may be any therapeutic antibody specific for a cancer antigen, such as those listed in section 5.4. In some embodiments, the immunoglobulin comprising a variant Fc region used in the ADCC assay is an anti-fluoresceine monoclonal antibody, 4-4-20 (Kranz et al., 1982 257(12): 6987-6995) a mouse-human chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody 2H7 (Liu et al., 1987, 139: 3521-6); or a humanized antibody (Ab4D5) against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (p185 HER2) (Carter et al. (1992, 89: 4285-9). The target cells in the ADCC assay are chosen according to the immunoglobulin into which a variant Fc region of the invention has been introduced so that the immunoglobulin binds a cell surface receptor of the target cell specifically. Preferably, the ADCC assays of the invention are performed using more than one engineered antibody, e.g., anti Her2\/neu, 4-4-20, 2B6, RITUXAN, and 2H7, harboring the Fc variants of the invention. In a most preferred embodiment, the Fc variants of the invention are introduced into at least 3 antibodies and their ADCC activities are tested. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, examining at least 3 antibodies in these functional assays will diminish the chance of eliminating a viable Fc mutation erroneously.","Target cells are added to effector cells, e.g., PBMC, to produce effector:target ratios of approximately 1:1, 10:1, 30:1, 50:1, 75:1, or 100:1. In a specific embodiment, when the immunoglobulin comprising a variant Fc region has the variable domain of 4-4-20, the effector:target is 75:1. The effector and target cells are incubated for at least two hours, up to 3.5 hours, at 37\u00b0 C., under 5% CO. Cell supernatants are harvested and added to an acidic europium solution (e.g., DELFIA Europium Solution, Perkin Elmer\/Wallac). The fluorescence of the Europium-TDA chelates formed is quantitated in a time-resolved fluorometer (e.g., Victor 1420, Perkin Elmer\/Wallac). Maximal release (MR) and spontaneous release (SR) are determined by incubation of target cells with 1% TX-100 and media alone, respectively. Antibody independent cellular cytotoxicity (AICC) is measured by incubation of target and effector cells in the absence of antibody. Each assay is preferably performed in triplicate. The mean percentage specific lysis is calculated as: Experimental release (ADCC)\u2212AICC)\/(MR-SR)\u00d7100.","The invention encompasses characterization of the Fc variants in both NK-dependent and macrophage dependent ADCC assays. Fc variants of the invention have altered phenotypes such as an altered effector function as assayed in an NK dependent or macrophage dependent assay.","The invention encompasses assays known in the art and exemplified herein, to bind C1q and mediate complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). To determine C1q binding, a C1q binding ELISA may be performed. An exemplary assay may comprise the following: assay plates may be coated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. with polypeptide variant or starting polypeptide (control) in coating buffer. The plates may then be washed and blocked. Following washing, an aliquot of human C1q may be added to each well and incubated for 2 hrs at room temperature. Following a further wash, 100 uL of a sheep anti-complement C1q peroxidase conjugated antibody may be added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plate may again be washed with wash buffer and 100 ul of substrate buffer containing OPD (O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma)) may be added to each well. The oxidation reaction, observed by the appearance of a yellow color, may be allowed to proceed for 30 minutes and stopped by the addition of 100 ul of 4.5 NHSO. The absorbance may then read at (492-405) nm.","A preferred variant in accordance with the invention is one that displays a significant reduction in C1q binding, as detected and measured in this assay or a similar assay. Preferably the molecule comprising an Fc variant displays about 50 fold reduction, about 60 fold, about 80 fold, or about 90 fold reduction in C1q binding compared to a control antibody having a nonmutated IgG1 Fc region. In the most preferred embodiment, the molecule comprising an Fc variant does not bind C1q, i.e. the variant displays about 100 fold or more reduction in C1q binding compared to the control antibody.","Another exemplary variant is one which has a better binding affinity for human C1q than the molecule comprising wild type Fc region. Such a molecule may display, for example, about two-fold or more, and preferably about five-fold or more, improvement in human C1q binding compared to the parent molecule comprising wild type Fc region. For example, human C1q binding may be about two-fold to about 500-fold, and preferably from about two-fold or from about five-fold to about 1000-fold improved compared to the molecule comprising wild type Fc region.","To assess complement activation, a complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assay may be performed, e.g. as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., J. Immunol. Methods 202:163 (1996), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly, various concentrations of the molecule comprising a variant Fc region and human complement may be diluted with buffer. Cells which express the antigen to which the molecule comprising a variant Fc region binds may be diluted to a density of about 1\u00d710cells\/ml. Mixtures of the molecule comprising a variant Fc region, diluted human complement and cells expressing the antigen may be added to a flat bottom tissue culture 96 well plate and allowed to incubate for 2 hrs at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% COto facilitate complement mediated cell lysis. 50 uL of alamar blue (Accumed International) may then be added to each well and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0 C. The absorbance is measured using a 96-well fluorometer with excitation at 530 nm and emission at 590 nm. The results may be expressed in relative fluorescence units (RFU). The sample concentrations may be computed from a standard curve and the percent activity as compared to nonvariant molecule, i.e., a molecule comprising wild type Fc region, is reported for the variant of interest.","In some embodiments, an Fc variant of the invention does not activate complement. Preferably the variant does not appear to have any CDC activity in the above CDC assay. The invention also pertains to a variant with enhanced CDC compared to a parent molecule (a molecule comprising wild type Fc region), e.g., displaying about two-fold to about 100-fold improvement in CDC activity in vitro or in vivo (e.g., at the IC50 values for each molecule being compared). Complement assays may be performed with guinea pig, rabbit or human serum. Complement lysis of target cells may be detected by monitoring the release of intracellular enzymes such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as described in Korzeniewski et al., 1983 64(3): 313-20; and Decker et al., 1988, 115(1): 61-9, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; or the release of an intracellular lable such as europium, chromium 51 or indium 111 in which target cells are labeled as described herein.","5.2.8 Other Assays","The molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions may also be assayed using any surface plasmon resonance based assays known in the art for characterizing the kinetic parameters of Fc-Fc\u03b3R interaction binding. Any SPR instrument commercially available including, but not limited to, BIAcore Instruments, available from Biacore AB (Uppsala, Sweden); IAsys instruments available from Affinity Sensors (Franklin, Mass.); IBIS system available from Windsor Scientific Limited (Berks, UK), SPR-CELLIA systems available from Nippon Laser and Electronics Lab (Hokkaido, Japan), and SPR Detector Spreeta available from Texas Instruments (Dallas, Tex.) can be used in the instant invention. For a review of SPR-based technology see Mullet et al., 2000, 22: 77-91; Dong et al., 2002, 82: 303-23; Fivash et al., 1998, 9: 97-101; Rich et al., 2000, 11: 54-61; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Additionally, any of the SPR instruments and SPR based methods for measuring protein-protein interactions described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,373,577; 6,289,286; 5,322,798; 5,341,215; and 6,268,125 are contemplated in the methods of the invention, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","Briefly, SPR based assays involve immobilizing a member of a binding pair on a surface, and monitoring its interaction with the other member of the binding pair in solution in real time. SPR is based on measuring the change in refractive index of the solvent near the surface that occurs upon complex formation or dissociation. The surface onto which the immobilization occur is the sensor chip, which is at the heart of the SPR technology; it consists of a glass surface coated with a thin layer of gold and forms the basis for a range of specialized surfaces designed to optimize the binding of a molecule to the surface. A variety of sensor chips are commercially available especially from the companies listed supra, all of which may be used in the methods of the invention. Examples of sensor chips include those available from BIAcore AB, Inc., e.g., Sensor Chip CM5, SA, NTA, and HPA. A molecule of the invention may be immobilized onto the surface of a sensor chip using any of the immobilization methods and chemistries known in the art, including but not limited to, direct covalent coupling via amine groups, direct covalent coupling via sulfhydryl groups, biotin attachment to avidin coated surface, aldehyde coupling to carbohydrate groups, and attachment through the histidine tag with NTA chips.","In some embodiments, the kinetic parameters of the binding of a molecule of the invention comprising variant Fc regions, e.g., immunoglobulins comprising variant Fc region, to an Fc\u03b3R may be determined using a BIAcore instrument (e.g., BIAcore instrument 1000, BIAcore Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). Any Fc\u03b3R can be used to assess the interaction with the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions. In a specific embodiment the Fc\u03b3R is Fc\u03b3RIIIA, preferably a soluble monomeric Fc\u03b3RIIIA. For example, in one embodiment, the soluble monomeric Fc\u03b3RIIIA is the extracellular region of Fc\u03b3RIIIA joined to the linker-AVITAG sequence (see, U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/439,498, filed on Jan. 9, 2003 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/456,041 filed on Mar. 19, 2003, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). In another specific embodiment, the Fc\u03b3R is Fc\u03b3RIIB, preferably a soluble dimeric Fc\u03b3RIIB. For example, in one embodiment, the soluble dimeric Fc\u03b3RIIB protein is prepared in accordance with the methodology described in U.S. Provisional application No. 60\/439,709 filed on Jan. 13, 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","An exemplary assay for determining the kinetic parameters of a molecule comprising a variant Fc region, wherein the molecule is the 4-4-20 antibody, to an Fc\u03b3R using a BIAcore instrument comprises the following: BSA-FITC is immobilized on one of the four flow cells of a sensor chip surface, preferably through amine coupling chemistry such that about 5000 response units (RU) of BSA-FITC is immobilized on the surface. Once a suitable surface is prepared, 4-4-20 antibodies carrying the Fc mutations are passed over the surface, preferably by one minute injections of a 20 \u03bcg\/mL solution at a 5 \u03bcL\/mL flow rate. The level of 4-4-20 antibodies bound to the surface ranges between 400 and 700 RU. Next, dilution series of the receptor (Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB-Fc fusion protein) in HBS-P buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) are injected onto the surface at 100 \u03bcL\/min Antibody regeneration between different receptor dilutions is carried out preferably by single 5 second injections of 100 mM NaHCOpH 9.4; 3M NaCl. Any regeneration technique known in the art is contemplated in the method of the invention.","Once an entire data set is collected, the resulting binding curves are globally fitted using computer algorithms supplied by the SPR instrument manufacturer, e.g., BIAcore, Inc. (Piscataway, N.J.). These algorithms calculate both the Kand K, from which the apparent equilibrium binding constant, Kd is deduced as the ratio of the two rate constants (i.e., K\/K). More detailed treatments of how the individual rate constants are derived can be found in the BIAevaluaion Software Handbook (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). The analysis of the generated data may be done using any method known in the art. For a review of the various methods of interpretation of the kinetic data generated see Myszka, 1997, 8: 50-7; Fisher et al., 1994, 5: 389-95; O'Shannessy, 1994, 5:65-71; Chaiken et al., 1992, 201: 197-210; Morton et al., 1995, 227: 176-85; O'Shannessy et al., 1996, 236: 275-83; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","In preferred embodiments, the kinetic parameters determined using an SPR analysis, e.g., BIAcore, may be used as a predictive measure of how a molecule of the invention will function in a functional assay, e.g., ADCC. An exemplary method for predicting the efficacy of a molecule of the invention based on kinetic parameters obtained from an SPR analysis may comprise the following: determining the Kvalues for binding of a molecule of the invention to Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB; plotting (1) K(wt)\/K(mut) for Fc\u03b3RIIIA; (2) K(mut)\/K(wt) for Fc\u03b3RIIB against the ADCC data. Numbers higher than one show a decreased dissociation rate for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and an increased dissociation rate for Fc\u03b3RIIB relative to wild type; and possess and enhanced ADCC function.","5.3 Methods of Recombinantly Producing Molecules of the Invention","5.3.1 Polynucleotides Encoding Molecules of the Invention","The present invention also includes polynucleotides that encode the molecules, including the polypeptides and antibodies, of the invention identified by the methods of the invention. The polynucleotides encoding the molecules of the invention may be obtained, and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined, by any method known in the art.","Once the nucleotide sequence of the molecules (e.g., antibodies) that are identified by the methods of the invention is determined, the nucleotide sequence may be manipulated using methods well known in the art, e.g., recombinant DNA techniques, site directed mutagenesis, PCR, etc. (see, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 2001, 3rd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; and Ausubel et al., eds., 1998, , John Wiley & Sons, NY, which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties), to generate, for example, antibodies having a different amino acid sequence, for example by generating amino acid substitutions, deletions, and\/or insertions.","In a specific embodiment, when the nucleic acids encode antibodies, one or more of the CDRs are inserted within framework regions using routine recombinant DNA techniques. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions, and preferably human framework regions (see, e.g., Chothia et al., 1998, 278: 457-479 for a listing of human framework regions).","In another embodiment, human libraries or any other libraries available in the art, can be screened by standard techniques known in the art, to clone the nucleic acids encoding the molecules of the invention.","5.3.2 Recombinant Expression of Molecules of the Invention","Once a nucleic acid sequence encoding molecules of the invention (i.e., antibodies) has been obtained, the vector for the production of the molecules may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing the coding sequences for the molecules of the invention and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. (See, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 1990, 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Ausubel et al. eds., 1998, John Wiley & Sons, NY).","An expression vector comprising the nucleotide sequence of a molecule identified by the methods of the invention (i.e., an antibody) can be transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques (e.g., electroporation, liposomal transfection, and calcium phosphate precipitation) and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce the molecules of the invention. In specific embodiments, the expression of the molecules of the invention is regulated by a constitutive, an inducible or a tissue, specific promoter.","The host cells used to express the molecules identified by the methods of the invention may be either bacterial cells such as , or, preferably, eukaryotic cells, especially for the expression of whole recombinant immunoglobulin molecule. In particular, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for immunoglobulins (Foecking et al., 1998, 45:101; Cockett et al., 1990, 8:2).","A variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the molecules identified by the methods of the invention. Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of the molecules of the invention may be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which may, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express the molecules of the invention in situ. These include, but are not limited to, microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., and ) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing coding sequences for the molecules identified by the methods of the invention; yeast (e.g., ) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing the sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BHK, 293, 293T, 3T3 cells), lymphotic cells (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,715), Per C.6 cells (human retinal cells developed by Crucell) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter).","In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the molecule being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced, for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited, to the expression vector pUR278 (Ruther et al., 1983, 2:1791), in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye & Inouye, 1985, 13:3101-3109; Van Heeke & Schuster, 1989, 24:5503-5509); and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to a matrix glutathione-agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.","In an insect system, nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non-essential regions (e.g., the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (e.g., the polyhedrin promoter).","In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription\/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the immunoglobulin molecule in infected hosts (e.g., see Logan & Shenk, 1984, 81:355-359). Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see Bittner et al., 1987, 153:51-544).","In addition, a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO, VERY, BHK, Hela, COS, MDCK, 293, 293T, 3T3, W138, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT20 and T47D, CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.","For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines which stably express an antibody of the invention may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibodies of the invention. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the antibodies of the invention.","A number of selection systems may be used, including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al., 1977, 11: 223), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska & Szybalski, 1992, 48: 202), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy et al., 1980, 22: 817) genes can be employed in tk-, hgprt- or aprt-cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al., 1980, 77:357; O'Hare et al., 1981, 78: 1527); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan & Berg, 1981, 78: 2072); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 12: 488-505; Wu and Wu, 1991, 3:87-95; Tolstoshev, 1993, 32:573-596; Mulligan, 1993, 260:926-932; and Morgan and Anderson, 1993, 62:191-217; May, 1993, 11(5):155-215). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. (eds.), 1993, , John Wiley & Sons, NY; Kriegler, 1990, , Stockton Press, NY; and in Chapters 12 and 13, Dracopoli et al. (eds), 1994, John Wiley & Sons, NY.; Colberre-Garapin et al., 1981, 150:1; and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre et al., 1984, 30:147).","The expression levels of an antibody of the invention can be increased by vector amplification (for a review, see Bebbington and Hentschel, , Vol. 3 (Academic Press, New York, 1987). When a marker in the vector system expressing an antibody is amplifiable, increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the nucleotide sequence of the antibody, production of the antibody will also increase (Crouse et al., 1983, 3:257).","The host cell may be co-transfected with two expression vectors of the invention, the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively, a single vector may be used which encodes both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations, the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain (Proudfoot, 1986, 322:52; Kohler, 1980, 77:2197). The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.","Once a molecule of the invention has been recombinantly expressed, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of polypeptides or antibodies, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of polypeptides or antibodies.","5.4 Prophylactic and Therapeutic Methods","The molecules of the invention with conferred effector function activity are particularly useful for the treatment and\/or prevention of a disease, disorder or infection where an enhanced efficacy of effector cell function (e.g., ADCC) mediated by Fc\u03b3R is desired (e.g., cancer, infectious disease), and in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of therapeutic antibodies, the effect of which is mediated by an effector function activity, e.g., ADCC.","The invention encompasses methods and compositions for treatment, prevention or management of a cancer in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules comprising a variant Fc region engineered in accordance with the invention, which molecule further binds a cancer antigen. Molecules of the invention comprising the variant Fc regions are particularly useful for the prevention, inhibition, reduction of growth or regression of primary tumors, metastasis of cancer cells, and infectious diseases. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, molecules of the invention enhance the efficacy of cancer therapeutics by enhancing antibody mediated effector function resulting in an enhanced rate of tumor clearance or an enhanced rated of tumor reduction or a combination thereof. In alternate embodiments, the modified antibodies of the invention enhance the efficacy of cancer therapeutics by conferring oligomerization activity to variant Fc region, resulting in cross-linking of cell surface antigens and\/or receptors and enhanced apoptosis or negative growth regulatory signaling.","According to an aspect of the invention, immunotherapeutics may be enhanced by modifying the Fc region in accordance with the invention to confer or increase the potency of an antibody effector function activity, e.g., ADCC, CDC, phagocytosis, opsonization, etc., of the immunotherapeutic. In a specific embodiment, antibody dependent cellular toxicity and\/or phagocytosis of tumor cells or infected cells is enhanced by modifying immunotherapeutics with variant Fc regions of the invention. Molecules of the invention may enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy treatment by enhancing at least one antibody-mediated effector function activity. In one particular embodiment, the efficacy of immunotherapy treatment is enhanced by enhancing the complement dependent cascade. In another embodiment of the invention, the efficacy of immunotherapy treatment is enhanced by enhancing the phagocytosis and\/or opsonization of the targeted cells, e.g., tumor cells. In another embodiment of the invention, the efficacy of treatment is enhanced by enhancing antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (\u201cADCC\u201d) in destruction of the targeted cells, e.g., tumor cells. The molecules of the invention may make an antibody that does not have a therapeutic effect in patients or in a subpopulation of patients have a therapeutic effect.","Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, therapeutic antibodies engineered in accordance with the invention have enhanced therapeutic efficacy, in part, due to the ability of the Fc portion of the antibody to bind a target cell which expresses the particular Fc\u03b3Rs at reduced levels, for example, by virtue of the ability of the antibody to remain on the target cell longer due to an improved off rate for Fc\u03b3R interaction.","The antibodies of the invention with enhanced affinity and avidity for Fc\u03b3Rs are particularly useful for the treatment, prevention or management of a cancer, or another disease or disorder, in a subject, wherein the Fc\u03b3Rs are expressed at low levels in the target cell populations. As used herein, Fc\u03b3R expression in cells is defined in terms of the density of such molecules per cell as measured using common methods known to those skilled in the art. The molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions preferably also have a conferred or an enhanced avidity and affinity and\/or effector function in cells which express a target antigen, e.g., a cancer antigen, at a density of 30,000 to 20,000 molecules\/cell, at a density of 20,000 to 10,000 molecules\/cell, at a density of 10,000 molecules\/cell or less, at a density of 5000 molecules\/cell or less, or at a density of 1000 molecules \/cell or less. The molecules of the invention have particular utility in treatment, prevention or management of a disease or disorder, such as cancer, in a sub-population, wherein the target antigen is expressed at low levels in the target cell population.","The molecules of the invention may also be advantageously utilized in combination with other therapeutic agents known in the art for the treatment or prevention of diseases, such as cancer, autoimmune disease, inflammatory disorders, and infectious diseases. In a specific embodiment, molecules of the invention may be used in combination with monoclonal or chimeric antibodies, lymphokines, or hematopoietic growth factors (such as, e.g., IL-2, IL-3 and IL-7), which, for example, serve to increase the number or activity of effector cells which interact with the molecules and, increase immune response. The molecules of the invention may also be advantageously utilized in combination with one or more drugs used to treat a disease, disorder, or infection such as, for example anti-cancer agents, anti-inflammatory agents or anti-viral agents, e.g., as detailed in sections 5.4.1.2 and 5.4.2.1 below.","5.4.1 Cancers","The invention encompasses methods and compositions for treatment or prevention of cancer in a subject comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules comprising a variant Fc region. In some embodiments, the invention encompasses methods and compositions for the treatment or prevention of cancer in a subject with Fc\u03b3R polymorphisms such as those homozygous for the F\u03b3RIIIA-158V or Fc\u03b3RIIIA-158F alleles. In some embodiments, the invention encompasses engineering therapeutic antibodies, e.g., tumor specific monoclonal antibodies in accordance with the methods of the invention such that the engineered antibodies have enhanced efficacy in patients homozygous for the low affinity allele of Fc\u03b3RIIIA (158F). In other embodiments, the invention encompasses engineering therapeutic antibodies, e.g., tumor specific monoclonal antibodies in accordance with the methods of the invention such that the engineered antibodies have enhanced efficacy in patients homozygous for the high affinity allele of Fc\u03b3RIIIA (158V).","The efficacy of monoclonal antibodies may depend on the Fc\u03b3R polymorphism of the subject (Carton et al., 2002 99: 754-8; Weng et al., 2003 21(21):3940-7 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). These receptors are expressed on the surface of the effector cells and mediate ADCC. High affinity alleles, of the low affinity activating receptors, improve the effector cells' ability to mediate ADCC. The methods of the invention allow engineering molecules harboring Fc mutations to enhance their affinity to Fc\u03b3R on effector cells via their altered Fc domains. The engineered antibodies of the invention provide better immunotherapy reagents for patients regardless of their Fc\u03b3R polymorphism.","Molecules harboring the Fc variants are tested by ADCC using either a cultured cell line or patient derived PMBC cells to determine the ability of the Fc mutations to enhance ADCC. Standard ADCC is performed using methods disclosed herein. Lymphocytes are harvested from peripheral blood using a Ficoll-Paque gradient (Pharmacia). Target cells, i.e., cultured cell lines or patient derived cells, are loaded with Europium (PerkinElmer) and incubated with effectors for 4 hrs at 37\u00b0 C. Released Europium is detected using a fluorescent plate reader (Wallac). The resulting ADCC data indicates the efficacy of the Fc variants to trigger NK cell mediated cytotoxicity and establish which Fc variants can be tested with both patient samples and elutriated monocytes. Fc variants showing the greatest potential for enhancing the efficacy of the molecule are then tested in an ADCC assay using PBMCs from patients. PBMC from healthy donors are used as effector cells.","According to an aspect of the invention, molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy by conferring or increasing the potency of an antibody effector function relative to a molecule containing the wild-type Fc region, e.g., ADCC, CDC, phagocytosis, opsonization, etc. In a specific embodiment, antibody dependent cellular toxicity and\/or phagocytosis of tumor cells is conferred or enhanced using the molecules of the invention with variant Fc regions. Molecules of the invention may enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy cancer treatment by conferring or enhancing at least one antibody-mediated effector function. In one particular embodiment, a molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region confers or enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy treatment by enhancing the complement dependent cascade. In another embodiment of the invention, the molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy treatment by conferring or enhancing the phagocytosis and\/or opsonization of the targeted tumor cells. In another embodiment of the invention, the molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region enhances the efficacy of treatment by conferring or enhancing antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (\u201cADCC\u201d) in destruction of the targeted tumor cells.","The invention further contemplates engineering therapeutic antibodies (e.g., tumor specific monoclonal antibodies) for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of the therapeutic antibody, for example, by enhancing the effector function of the therapeutic antibody (e.g., ADCC), or conferring effector function to a therapeutic antibody which doesn't have that effector function (at least detectable in an in vitro or in vivo assay). Preferably the therapeutic antibody is a cytotoxic and\/or opsonizing antibody. It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, that once molecules of the invention with desired binding properties (e.g., molecules with variant Fc regions with at least one amino acid modification, which modification enhances the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA relative to a comparable molecule, comprising a wild-type Fc region) have been identified (See Section 5.2 and Table 8) according to the methods of the invention, therapeutic antibodies may be engineered using standard recombinant DNA techniques and any known mutagenesis techniques, as described in Section 5.2.2 to produce engineered therapeutic carrying the identified mutation sites with the desired binding properties. Any of the therapeutic antibodies listed in Table 9 that have demonstrated therapeutic utility in cancer treatment, may be engineered according to the methods of the invention, for example, by modifying the Fc region to confer an effector function or have an enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA compared to a therapeutic antibody having a wild-type Fc region.","The Fc variants of the invention may be incorporated into therapeutic antibodies such as those disclosed herein or other Fc fusion clinical candidates, i.e., a molecule comprising an Fc regions which has been approved for us in clinical trials or any other molecule that may benefit from the Fc variants of the instant invention, humanized, affinity matured, modified or engineered versions thereof.","The invention also encompasses engineering any other polypeptide comprising an Fc region which has therapeutic utility, including but not limited to ENBREL, according to the methods of the invention, in order to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of such polypeptides, for example, by enhancing the effector function of the polypeptide comprising an Fc region.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0423","num":"0422"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00012","num":"00012"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"294pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 9"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"THERAPEUTIC ANTIBODIES THAT CAN BE ENGINEERED"},{"entry":"ACCORDING TO THE METHODS OF THE INVENTION"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Company","Product","Disease","Target"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Abgenix","ABX-EGF\u2009\u2122","Cancer","EGF receptor"]},{"entry":["AltaRex","OvaRex\u2009\u2122","ovarian cancer","tumor antigen CA125"]},{"entry":[{},"BravaRex\u2009\u2122","metastatic","tumor antigen MUC1"]},{"entry":[{},{},"cancers"]},{"entry":["Antisoma","Theragyn\u2009\u2122","ovarian cancer","PEM antigen"]},{"entry":[{},"(pemtumomabytrrium-"]},{"entry":[{},"90)"]},{"entry":[{},"Therex\u2009\u2122","breast cancer","PEM antigen"]},{"entry":["Boehringer","Blvatuzumab","head & neck","CD44"]},{"entry":["Ingelheim",{},"cancer"]},{"entry":["Centocor\/J&J","Panorex\u2009\u2122","Colorectal","17-1A"]},{"entry":[{},{},"cancer"]},{"entry":[{},"ReoPro\u2009\u2122","PTCA","gp IIIb\/IIIa"]},{"entry":[{},"ReoPro\u2009\u2122","Acute MI","gp IIIb\/IIIa"]},{"entry":[{},"ReoPro\u2009\u2122","Ischemic stroke","gp IIIb\/IIIa"]},{"entry":["Corixa","Bexocar\u2009\u2122","NHL","CD20"]},{"entry":["CRC","MAb, idiotypic 105AD7","colorectal cancer","gp72"]},{"entry":["Technology",{},"vaccine"]},{"entry":["Crucell","Anti-EpCAM\u2009\u2122","cancer","Ep-CAM"]},{"entry":["Cytoclonal","MAb, lung cancer","non-small cell","NA"]},{"entry":[{},{},"lung cancer"]},{"entry":["Genentech","Herceptin\u2009\u2122","metastatic breast","HER-2"]},{"entry":[{},{},"cancer"]},{"entry":[{},"Herceptin\u2009\u2122","early stage","HER-2"]},{"entry":[{},{},"breast cancer"]},{"entry":[{},"Rituxan\u2009\u2122","Relapsed\/refractory","CD20"]},{"entry":[{},{},"low-grade or"]},{"entry":[{},{},"follicular NHL"]},{"entry":[{},"Rituxan\u2009\u2122","intermediate &","CD20"]},{"entry":[{},{},"high-grade NHL"]},{"entry":[{},"MAb-VEGF","NSCLC,","VEGF"]},{"entry":[{},{},"metastatic"]},{"entry":[{},"MAb-VEGF","Colorectal","VEGF"]},{"entry":[{},{},"cancer,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"metastatic"]},{"entry":[{},"AMD Fab","age-related","CD18"]},{"entry":[{},{},"macular"]},{"entry":[{},{},"degeneration"]},{"entry":[{},"E-26 (2gen.

methods of preventing or treating cancer characterized by a cancer antigen, using a therapeutic antibody that binds a cancer antigen and is cytotoxic and has been modified at one or more sites in the Fc region, according to the invention, to bind Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA with a higher affinity than the parent therapeutic antibody, and\/or mediates one or more effector functions (e.g., ADCC, phagocytosis) either not detectably mediated by the parent antibody or more effectively than the parent antibody. In another embodiment, the invention provides methods of preventing or treating cancer characterized by a cancer antigen, using a therapeutic antibody that binds a cancer antigen and is cytotoxic, and has been engineered according to the invention to bind Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA with a higher affinity and bind Fc\u03b3RIIB with a lower affinity than the parent therapeutic antibody, and\/or mediates one or more effector functions (e.g., ADCC, phagocytosis) either not detectably mediated by the parent antibody or more effectively than the parent antibody.

In other specific embodiments, sarcoma, melanoma, or leukemia is treated or prevented by the methods and compositions of the invention.","In a specific embodiment, a molecule of the invention (e.g., an antibody comprising a variant Fc region, or a therapeutic monoclonal antibody engineered according to the methods of the invention) inhibits or reduces the growth of cancer cells by at least 99%, at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 60%, at least 50%, at least 45%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 35%, at least 30%, at least 25%, at least 20%, or at least 10% relative to the growth of cancer cells in the absence of said molecule of the invention.","In a specific embodiment, a molecule of the invention (e.g., an antibody comprising a variant Fc region, or a therapeutic monoclonal antibody engineered according to the methods of the invention) kills cells or inhibits or reduces the growth of cancer cells at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 100% better than the parent molecule.","5.4.1.1 Combination Therapy","The invention further encompasses administering the molecules of the invention in combination with other therapies known to those skilled in the art for the treatment or prevention of cancer or infectious disease, including but not limited to, current standard and experimental chemotherapies, hormonal therapies, biological therapies, immunotherapies, radiation therapies, or surgery. In some embodiments, the molecules of the invention may be administered in combination with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of one or more anti-cancer agents, therapeutic antibodies (e.g., antibodies listed in Table 9), or other agents known to those skilled in the art for the treatment and\/or prevention of cancer (See Section 5.4.1.2).","In certain embodiments, one or more molecule of the invention is administered to a mammal, preferably a human, concurrently with one or more other therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of cancer. The term \u201cconcurrently\u201d is not limited to the administration of prophylactic or therapeutic agents at exactly the same time, but rather it is meant that a molecule of the invention and the other agent are administered to a mammal in a sequence and within a time interval such that the molecule of the invention can act together with the other agent to provide an increased benefit than if they were administered otherwise. For example, each prophylactic or therapeutic agent (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy or biological therapy) may be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time; however, if not administered at the same time, they should be administered sufficiently close in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Each therapeutic agent can be administered separately, in any appropriate form and by any suitable route. In various embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered less than 1 hour apart, at about 1 hour apart, at about 1 hour to about 2 hours apart, at about 2 hours to about 3 hours apart, at about 3 hours to about 4 hours apart, at about 4 hours to about 5 hours apart, at about 5 hours to about 6 hours apart, at about 6 hours to about 7 hours apart, at about 7 hours to about 8 hours apart, at about 8 hours to about 9 hours apart, at about 9 hours to about 10 hours apart, at about 10 hours to about 11 hours apart, at about 11 hours to about 12 hours apart, no more than 24 hours apart or no more than 48 hours apart. In preferred embodiments, two or more components are administered within the same patient visit.","In other embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered at about 2 to 4 days apart, at about 4 to 6 days apart, at about 1 week part, at about 1 to 2 weeks apart, or more than 2 weeks apart. In preferred embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered in a time frame where both agents are still active. One skilled in the art would be able to determine such a time frame by determining the half life of the administered agents.","In certain embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the invention are cyclically administered to a subject. Cycling therapy involves the administration of a first agent for a period of time, followed by the administration of a second agent and\/or third agent for a period of time and repeating this sequential administration. Cycling therapy can reduce the development of resistance to one or more of the therapies, avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the therapies, and\/or improves the efficacy of the treatment.","In certain embodiments, prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered in a cycle of less than about 3 weeks, about once every two weeks, about once every 10 days or about once every week. One cycle can comprise the administration of a therapeutic or prophylactic agent by infusion over about 90 minutes every cycle, about 1 hour every cycle, about 45 minutes every cycle. Each cycle can comprise at least 1 week of rest, at least 2 weeks of rest, at least 3 weeks of rest. The number of cycles administered is from about 1 to about 12 cycles, more typically from about 2 to about 10 cycles, and more typically from about 2 to about 8 cycles.","In yet other embodiments, the therapeutic and prophylactic agents of the invention are administered in metronomic dosing regimens, either by continuous infusion or frequent administration without extended rest periods. Such metronomic administration can involve dosing at constant intervals without rest periods. Typically the therapeutic agents, in particular cytotoxic agents, are used at lower doses. Such dosing regimens encompass the chronic daily administration of relatively low doses for extended periods of time. In preferred embodiments, the use of lower doses can minimize toxic side effects and eliminate rest periods. In certain embodiments, the therapeutic and prophylactic agents are delivered by chronic low-dose or continuous infusion ranging from about 24 hours to about 2 days, to about 1 week, to about 2 weeks, to about 3 weeks to about 1 month to about 2 months, to about 3 months, to about 4 months, to about 5 months, to about 6 months. The scheduling of such dose regimens can be optimized by the skilled oncologist.","In other embodiments, courses of treatment are administered concurrently to a mammal, i.e., individual doses of the therapeutics are administered separately yet within a time interval such that molecules of the invention can work together with the other agent or agents. For example, one component may be administered one time per week in combination with the other components that may be administered one time every two weeks or one time every three weeks. In other words, the dosing regimens for the therapeutics are carried out concurrently even if the therapeutics are not administered simultaneously or within the same patient visit.","When used in combination with other prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents, the molecules of the invention and the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agent can act additively or, more preferably, synergistically. In one embodiment, a molecule of the invention is administered concurrently with one or more therapeutic agents in the same pharmaceutical composition. In another embodiment, a molecule of the invention is administered concurrently with one or more other therapeutic agents in separate pharmaceutical compositions. In still another embodiment, a molecule of the invention is administered prior to or subsequent to administration of another prophylactic or therapeutic agent. The invention contemplates administration of a molecule of the invention in combination with other prophylactic or therapeutic agents by the same or different routes of administration, e.g., oral and parenteral. In certain embodiments, when a molecule of the invention is administered concurrently with another prophylactic or therapeutic agent that potentially produces adverse side effects including, but not limited to, toxicity, the prophylactic or therapeutic agent can advantageously be administered at a dose that falls below the threshold that the adverse side effect is elicited.","The dosage amounts and frequencies of administration provided herein are encompassed by the terms therapeutically effective and prophylactically effective. The dosage and frequency further will typically vary according to factors specific for each patient depending on the specific therapeutic or prophylactic agents administered, the severity and type of cancer, the route of administration, as well as age, body weight, response, and the past medical history of the patient. Suitable regimens can be selected by one skilled in the art by considering such factors and by following, for example, dosages reported in the literature and recommended in the (56ed., 2002).","5.4.1.2 Other Therapeutic\/Prophylactic Agents","In a specific embodiment, the methods of the invention encompass the administration of one or more molecules of the invention with one or more therapeutic agents used for the treatment and\/or prevention of cancer.

Molecules of the invention with such binding characteristics are useful in regulating the immune response, e.g., in inhibiting the immune response in connection with autoimmune diseases or inflammatory diseases. Although not intending to be bound by any mechanism of action, molecules of the invention with an enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB and a decreased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA may lead to dampening of the activating response to Fc\u03b3R and inhibition of cellular responsiveness.","In some embodiments, a molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region is not an immunoglobulin, and comprises at least one amino acid modification which modification increases the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIB relative to a molecule comprising a wild-type Fc region. In other embodiments, said molecule further comprises one or more amino acid modifications, which modifications decreases the affinity of the molecule for an activating Fc\u03b3R. In some embodiments, the molecule is a soluble (i.e., not membrane bound) Fc region. The invention contemplates other amino acid modifications within the soluble Fc region which modulate its affinity for various Fc receptors, including those known to one skilled in the art as described herein. In other embodiments, the molecule (e.g., the Fc region comprising at least one or more amino acid modification) is modified using techniques known to one skilled in the art and as described herein to increase the in vivo half life of the Fc region. Such molecules have therapeutic utility in treating and\/or preventing an autoimmune disorder. Although not intending to be bound by any mechanism of actions, such molecules with enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB will lead to a dampening of the activating receptors and thus a dampening of the immune response and have therapeutic efficacy for treating and\/or preventing an autoimmune disorder.","In certain embodiments, the one or more amino acid modifications, which increase the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIB but decrease the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA comprise a substitution at position 246 with threonine and at position 396 with histidine; or a substitution at position 268 with aspartic acid and at position 318 with aspartic acid; or a substitution at position 217 with serine, at position 378 with valine, and at position 408 with arginine; or a substitution at position 375 with cysteine and at position 396 with leucine; or a substitution at position 246 with isoleucine and at position 334 with asparagine. In one embodiment, the one or more amino acid modifications, which increase the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIB but decrease the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA comprise a substitution at position 247 with leucine. In another embodiment, the one or more amino acid modification, which increases the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIB but decreases the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA comprise a substitution at position 372 with tyrosine. In yet another embodiment, the one or more amino acid modification, which increases the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIB but decreases the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc\u03b3RIIIA comprise a substitution at position 326 with glutamic acid.

Any anti-inflammatory agent well-known to one of skill in the art can be used in the methods of the invention. Non-limiting examples of anti-inflammatory agents include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-agonists, anticholingeric agents, and methyl xanthines.

The vaccine compositions of the invention comprise one or more antigenic or immunogenic agents to which an immune response is desired, wherein the one or more antigenic or immunogenic agents is coated with a variant antibody of the invention that has a conferred effector function and\/or an enhanced affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIIA. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, coating an antigenic or immunogenic agent with a variant antibody of the invention that has an enhanced affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIIA, enhances the immune response to the desired antigenic or immunogenic agent by inducing humoral and cell-mediated responses. The vaccine compositions of the invention are particularly effective in eliciting an immune response, preferably a protective immune response against the antigenic or immunogenic agent.","In some embodiments, the antigenic or immunogenic agent in the vaccine compositions of the invention comprise a virus against which an immune response is desired. The viruses may be recombinant or chimeric, and are preferably attenuated. Production of recombinant, chimeric, and attenuated viruses may be performed using standard methods known to one skilled in the art. The invention encompasses a live recombinant viral vaccine or an inactivated recombinant viral vaccine to be formulated in accordance with the invention. A live vaccine may be preferred because multiplication in the host leads to a prolonged stimulus of similar kind and magnitude to that occurring in natural infections, and therefore, confers substantial, long-lasting immunity. Production of such live recombinant virus vaccine formulations may be accomplished using conventional methods involving propagation of the virus in cell culture or in the allantois of the chick embryo followed by purification.","In a specific embodiment, the recombinant virus is non-pathogenic to the subject to which it is administered. In this regard, the use of genetically engineered viruses for vaccine purposes may require the presence of attenuation characteristics in these strains. The introduction of appropriate mutations (e.g., deletions) into the templates used for transfection may provide the novel viruses with attenuation characteristics. For example, specific missense mutations which are associated with temperature sensitivity or cold adaption can be made into deletion mutations. These mutations should be more stable than the point mutations associated with cold or temperature sensitive mutants and reversion frequencies should be extremely low. Recombinant DNA technologies for engineering recombinant viruses are known in the art and encompassed in the invention. For example, techniques for modifying negative strand RNA viruses are known in the art, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,166,057, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Alternatively, chimeric viruses with \u201csuicide\u201d characteristics may be constructed for use in the intradermal vaccine formulations of the invention. Such viruses would go through only one or a few rounds of replication within the host. When used as a vaccine, the recombinant virus would go through limited replication cycle(s) and induce a sufficient level of immune response but it would not go further in the human host and cause disease. Alternatively, inactivated (killed) virus may be formulated in accordance with the invention. Inactivated vaccine formulations may be prepared using conventional techniques to \u201ckill\u201d the chimeric viruses. Inactivated vaccines are \u201cdead\u201d in the sense that their infectivity has been destroyed. Ideally, the infectivity of the virus is destroyed without affecting its immunogenicity. In order to prepare inactivated vaccines, the chimeric virus may be grown in cell culture or in the allantois of the chick embryo, purified by zonal ultracentrifugation, inactivated by formaldehyde or \u03b2-propiolactone, and pooled.","In certain embodiments, completely foreign epitopes, including antigens derived from other viral or non-viral pathogens can be engineered into the virus for use in the intradermal vaccine formulations of the invention. For example, antigens of non-related viruses such as HIV (gp160, gp120, gp41) parasite antigens (e.g., malaria), bacterial or fungal antigens or tumor antigens can be engineered into the attenuated strain.","Virtually any heterologous gene sequence may be constructed into the chimeric viruses of the invention for use in the intradermal vaccine formulations. Preferably, heterologous gene sequences are moieties and peptides that act as biological response modifiers. Preferably, epitopes that induce a protective immune response to any of a variety of pathogens, or antigens that bind neutralizing antibodies may be expressed by or as part of the chimeric viruses. For example, heterologous gene sequences that can be constructed into the chimeric viruses of the invention include, but are not limited to, influenza and parainfluenza hemagglutinin neuraminidase and fusion glycoproteins such as the HN and F genes of human PIV3. In yet another embodiment, heterologous gene sequences that can be engineered into the chimeric viruses include those that encode proteins with immuno-modulating activities. Examples of immuno-modulating proteins include, but are not limited to, cytokines, interferon type 1, gamma interferon, colony stimulating factors, interleukin -1, -2, -4, -5, -6, -12, and antagonists of these agents.","In yet other embodiments, the invention encompasses pathogenic cells or viruses, preferably attenuated viruses, which express the variant antibody on their surface.","In alternative embodiments, the vaccine compositions of the invention comprise a fusion polypeptide wherein an antigenic or immunogenic agent is operatively linked to a variant antibody of the invention that has an enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA. Engineering fusion polypeptides for use in the vaccine compositions of the invention is performed using routine recombinant DNA technology methods and is within the level of ordinary skill.","The invention further encompasses methods to induce tolerance in a subject by administering a composition of the invention. Preferably a composition suitable for inducing tolerance in a subject, comprises an antigenic or immunogenic agent coated with a variant antibody of the invention, wherein the variant antibody has a higher affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIB. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, such compositions are effective in inducing tolerance by activating the Fc\u03b3RIIB mediated inhibitory pathway.","5.6 Compositions and Methods of Administering","The invention provides methods and pharmaceutical compositions comprising molecules of the invention (i.e., antibodies, polypeptides) comprising variant Fc regions. The invention also provides methods of treatment, prophylaxis, and amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with a disease, disorder or infection by administering to a subject an effective amount of a fusion protein or a conjugated molecule of the invention, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising a fusion protein or a conjugated molecule of the invention. In a preferred aspect, an antibody, a fusion protein, or a conjugated molecule, is substantially purified (i.e., substantially free from substances that limit its effect or produce undesired side-effects). In a specific embodiment, the subject is an animal, preferably a mammal such as non-primate (e.g., cows, pigs, horses, cats, dogs, rats etc.) and a primate (e.g., monkey such as, a cynomolgous monkey and a human). In a preferred embodiment, the subject is a human. In yet another preferred embodiment, the antibody of the invention is from the same species as the subject.","Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer a composition comprising molecules of the invention (i.e., antibodies, polypeptides), comprising variant Fc regions, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the antibody or fusion protein, receptor-mediated endocytosis (See, e.g., Wu and Wu, 1987, 262:4429-4432), construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector, etc. Methods of administering a molecule of the invention include, but are not limited to, parenteral administration (e.g., intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous and subcutaneous), epidural, and mucosal (e.g., intranasal and oral routes). In a specific embodiment, the molecules of the invention are administered intramuscularly, intravenously, or subcutaneously. The compositions may be administered by any convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition, pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,019,968; 5,985,320; 5,985,309; 5,934,272; 5,874,064; 5,855,913; 5,290,540; and 4,880,078; and PCT Publication Nos. WO 92\/19244; WO 97\/32572; WO 97\/44013; WO 98\/31346; and WO 99\/66903, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The invention also provides that the molecules of the invention (i.e., antibodies, polypeptides) comprising variant Fc regions, are packaged in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of antibody. In one embodiment, the molecules of the invention are supplied as a dry sterilized lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container and can be reconstituted, e.g., with water or saline to the appropriate concentration for administration to a subject. Preferably, the molecules of the invention are supplied as a dry sterile lyophilized powder in a hermetically sealed container at a unit dosage of at least 5 mg, more preferably at least 10 mg, at least 15 mg, at least 25 mg, at least 35 mg, at least 45 mg, at least 50 mg, or at least 75 mg. The lyophilized molecules of the invention should be stored at between 2 and 8\u00b0 C. in their original container and the molecules should be administered within 12 hours, preferably within 6 hours, within 5 hours, within 3 hours, or within 1 hour after being reconstituted. In an alternative embodiment, molecules of the invention are supplied in liquid form in a hermetically sealed container indicating the quantity and concentration of the molecule, fusion protein, or conjugated molecule. Preferably, the liquid form of the molecules of the invention are supplied in a hermetically sealed container at least 1 mg\/ml, more preferably at least 2.5 mg\/ml, at least 5 mg\/ml, at least 8 mg\/ml, at least 10 mg\/ml, at least 15 mg\/kg, at least 25 mg\/ml, at least 50 mg\/ml, at least 100 mg\/ml, at least 150 mg\/ml, at least 200 mg\/ml of the molecules.","The amount of the composition of the invention which will be effective in the treatment, prevention or amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with a disorder can be determined by standard clinical techniques. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the condition, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.","For antibodies encompassed by the invention, the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.0001 mg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. Preferably, the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.0001 mg\/kg and 20 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 10 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 5 mg\/kg, 0.0001 and 2 mg\/kg, 0.0001 and 1 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 0.75 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 0.5 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg to 0.25 mg\/kg, 0.0001 to 0.15 mg\/kg, 0.0001 to 0.10 mg\/kg, 0.001 to 0.5 mg\/kg, 0.01 to 0.25 mg\/kg or 0.01 to 0.10 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. Generally, human antibodies have a longer half-life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus, lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further, the dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention or fragments thereof may be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration of the antibodies by modifications such as, for example, lipidation.","In one embodiment, the dosage of the molecules of the invention administered to a patient are 0.01 mg to 1000 mg\/day, when used as single agent therapy. In another embodiment the molecules of the invention are used in combination with other therapeutic compositions and the dosage administered to a patient are lower than when said molecules are used as a single agent therapy.","In a specific embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment; this may be achieved by, for example, and not by way of limitation, local infusion, by injection, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. Preferably, when administering a molecule of the invention, care must be taken to use materials to which the molecule does not absorb.","In another embodiment, the compositions can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (See Langer, 249:1527-1533 (1990); Treat et al., in , Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, N.Y., pp. 353-365 (1989); Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 3 17-327; see generally ibid.).","In yet another embodiment, the compositions can be delivered in a controlled release or sustained release system. Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release formulations comprising one or more molecules of the invention. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,938; PCT publication WO 91\/05548; PCT publication WO 96\/20698; Ning et al., 1996, \u201cIntratumoral Radioimmunotheraphy of a Human Colon Cancer Xenograft Using a Sustained-Release Gel,\u201d 39:179-189, Song et al., 1995, \u201cAntibody Mediated Lung Targeting of Long-Circulating Emulsions,\u201d 50:372-397; Cleek et al., 1997, \u201cBiodegradable Polymeric Carriers for a bFGF Antibody for Cardiovascular Application,\u201d 24:853-854; and Lam et al., 1997, \u201cMicroencapsulation of Recombinant Humanized Monoclonal Antibody for Local Delivery,\u201d 24:759-760, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In one embodiment, a pump may be used in a controlled release system (See Langer, supra; Sefton, 1987, 14:20; Buchwald et al., 1980, Surgery 88:507; and Saudek et al., 1989, 321:574). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used to achieve controlled release of antibodies (see e.g., Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, N.Y. (1984); Ranger and Peppas, 1983, J., 23:61; See also Levy et al., 1985, 228:190; During et al., 1989, Ann. Neurol. 25:351; Howard et al., 1989, 7 1:105); U.S. Pat. No. 5,679,377; U.S. Pat. No. 5,916,597; U.S. Pat. No. 5,912,015; U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,463; U.S. Pat. No. 5,128,326; PCT Publication No. WO 99\/15154; and PCT Publication No. WO 99\/20253). Examples of polymers used in sustained release formulations include, but are not limited to, poly(2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic acid), poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), poly(methacrylic acid), polyglycolides (PLG), polyanhydrides, poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyacrylamide, poly(ethylene glycol), polylactides (PLA), poly(lactide-co-glycolides) (PLGA), and polyorthoesters. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target (e.g., the lungs), thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)). In another embodiment, polymeric compositions useful as controlled release implants are used according to Dunn et al. (See U.S. Pat. No. 5,945,155). This particular method is based upon the therapeutic effect of the in situ controlled release of the bioactive material from the polymer system. The implantation can generally occur anywhere within the body of the patient in need of therapeutic treatment. In another embodiment, a non-polymeric sustained delivery system is used, whereby a non-polymeric implant in the body of the subject is used as a drug delivery system. Upon implantation in the body, the organic solvent of the implant will dissipate, disperse, or leach from the composition into surrounding tissue fluid, and the non-polymeric material will gradually coagulate or precipitate to form a solid, microporous matrix (See U.S. Pat. No. 5,888,533).","Controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (1990, 249:1527-1533). Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release formulations comprising one or more therapeutic agents of the invention. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,938; International Publication Nos. WO 91\/05548 and WO 96\/20698; Ning et al., 1996, 39:179-189; Song et al., 1995, 50:372-397; Cleek et al., 1997, 24:853-854; and Lam et al., 1997, 24:759-760, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","In a specific embodiment where the composition of the invention is a nucleic acid encoding an antibody, the nucleic acid can be administered in vivo to promote expression of its encoded antibody, by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular, e.g., by use of a retroviral vector (See U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox-like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus (See e.g., Joliot et al., 1991, 88:1864-1868), etc. Alternatively, a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination.","For antibodies, the therapeutically or prophylactically effective dosage administered to a subject is typically 0.1 mg\/kg to 200 mg\/kg of the subject's body weight. Preferably, the dosage administered to a subject is between 0.1 mg\/kg and 20 mg\/kg of the subject's body weight and more preferably the dosage administered to a subject is between 1 mg\/kg to 10 mg\/kg of the subject's body weight. The dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention may be reduced also by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration (e.g., into the lung) of the antibodies or fusion proteins by modifications such as, for example, lipidation.","Treatment of a subject with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of molecules of the invention can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. In a preferred example, a subject is treated with molecules of the invention in the range of between about 0.1 to 30 mg\/kg body weight, one time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, preferably between 2 to 8 weeks, more preferably between about 3 to 7 weeks, and even more preferably for about 4, 5, or 6 weeks. In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are administered once a day, twice a day, or three times a day. In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered once a week, twice a week, once every two weeks, once a month, once every six weeks, once every two months, twice a year or once per year. It will also be appreciated that the effective dosage of the molecules used for treatment may increase or decrease over the course of a particular treatment.","5.6.1 Pharmaceutical Compositions","The compositions of the invention include bulk drug compositions useful in the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., impure or non-sterile compositions) and pharmaceutical compositions (i.e., compositions that are suitable for administration to a subject or patient) which can be used in the preparation of unit dosage forms.

Preferably, compositions of the invention comprise a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","In one particular embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules of the invention comprising a variant Fc region, wherein said variant Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA with a greater affinity than a comparable molecule comprising a wild-type Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA and\/or said variant Fc region confers an effector function or mediates an effector function at least 2-fold more effectively than a comparable molecule comprising a wild-type Fc region, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules of the invention comprising a variant Fc region, wherein said variant Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA with a greater affinity than a comparable molecule comprising a wild-type Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIIA, and said variant Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIB with a lower affinity than a comparable molecule comprising a wild-type Fc region binds Fc\u03b3RIIB, and\/or said variant Fc region confers and effector function or mediates an effector function at least 2-fold more effectively than a comparable molecule comprising a wild-type Fc region, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another embodiment, said pharmaceutical compositions further comprise one or more anti-cancer agents.","The invention also encompasses pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutic antibody (e.g., tumor specific monoclonal antibody) that is specific for a particular cancer antigen, comprising one or more amino acid modifications in the Fc region as determined in accordance with the instant invention, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","In a specific embodiment, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term \u201ccarrier\u201d refers to a diluent, adjuvant (e.g., Freund's adjuvant (complete and incomplete), excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like.","Generally, the ingredients of compositions of the invention are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.","The compositions of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.","5.6.2 Gene Therapy","In a specific embodiment, nucleic acids comprising sequences encoding molecules of the invention, are administered to treat, prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms associated with a disease, disorder, or infection, by way of gene therapy. Gene therapy refers to therapy performed by the administration to a subject of an expressed or expressible nucleic acid. In this embodiment of the invention, the nucleic acids produce their encoded antibody or fusion protein that mediates a therapeutic or prophylactic effect.","Any of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used according to the present invention. Exemplary methods are described below.","For general reviews of the methods of gene therapy, see Goldspiel et al., 1993, 12:488-505; Wu and Wu, 1991, 3:87-95; Tolstoshev, 1993, 32:573-596; Mulligan, Science 260:926-932 (1993); and Morgan and Anderson, 1993, 62:191-217; May, 1993, 11(5):155-215. Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. (eds.), , John Wiley & Sons, NY (1993); and Kriegler, , Stockton Press, NY (1990).","In a preferred aspect, a composition of the invention comprises nucleic acids encoding an antibody, said nucleic acids being part of an expression vector that expresses the antibody in a suitable host. In particular, such nucleic acids have promoters, preferably heterologous promoters, operably linked to the antibody coding region, said promoter being inducible or constitutive, and, optionally, tissue-specific. In another particular embodiment, nucleic acid molecules are used in which the antibody coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the antibody encoding nucleic acids (Koller and Smithies, 1989, 86:8932-8935; and Zijlstra et al., 1989, 342:435-438).","In another preferred aspect, a composition of the invention comprises nucleic acids encoding a fusion protein, said nucleic acids being a part of an expression vector that expresses the fusion protein in a suitable host. In particular, such nucleic acids have promoters, preferably heterologous promoters, operably linked to the coding region of a fusion protein, said promoter being inducible or constitutive, and optionally, tissue-specific. In another particular embodiment, nucleic acid molecules are used in which the coding sequence of the fusion protein and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the fusion protein.","Delivery of the nucleic acids into a subject may be either direct, in which case the subject is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid-carrying vectors, or indirect, in which case, cells are first transformed with the nucleic acids in vitro, then transplanted into the subject. These two approaches are known, respectively, as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid sequences are directly administered in vivo, where it is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be accomplished by any of numerous methods known in the art, e.g., by constructing them as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that they become intracellular, e.g., by infection using defective or attenuated retroviral or other viral vectors (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection of naked DNA, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, or microcapsules, or by administering them in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the nucleus, by administering it in linkage to a ligand subject to receptor-mediated endocytosis (See, e.g., Wu and Wu, 1987, 262:4429-4432) (which can be used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors), etc. In another embodiment, nucleic acid-ligand complexes can be formed in which the ligand comprises a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes, allowing the nucleic acid to avoid lysosomal degradation. In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for cell specific uptake and expression, by targeting a specific receptor (See, e.g., PCT Publications WO 92\/06180; WO 92\/22635; W092\/20316; WO93\/14188; WO 93\/20221). Alternatively, the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, by homologous recombination (Koller and Smithies, 1989, 86:8932-8935; and Zijlstra et al., 1989, 342:435-438).","In a specific embodiment, viral vectors that contain nucleic acid sequences encoding a molecule of the invention (e.g., an antibody or a fusion protein) are used. For example, a retroviral vector can be used (See Miller et al., 1993, 217:581-599). These retroviral vectors contain the components necessary for the correct packaging of the viral genome and integration into the host cell DNA. The nucleic acid sequences encoding the antibody or a fusion protein to be used in gene therapy are cloned into one or more vectors, which facilitates delivery of the nucleotide sequence into a subject. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al., (1994, 6:291-302), which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdr 1 gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are: Clowes et al., 1994, 93:644-651; Klein et al., 1994, 83:1467-1473; Salmons and Gunzberg, 1993, 4:129-141; and Grossman and Wilson, 1993, 3:110-114.","Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus-based delivery systems are liver, the central nervous system, endothelial cells, and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non-dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson (3:499-503, 1993, present a review of adenovirus-based gene therapy. Bout et al., (5:3-10, 1994) demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al., 1991, 252:431-434; Rosenfeld et al., 1992, 68:143-155; Mastrangeli et al., 1993, 91:225-234; PCT Publication W094\/12649; and Wang et al., 1995, 2:775-783. In a preferred embodiment, adenovirus vectors are used.","Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has also been proposed for use in gene therapy (see, e.g., Walsh et al., 1993, 204:289-300 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,146).","Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in tissue culture by such methods as electroporation, lipofection, calcium phosphate mediated transfection, or viral infection. Usually, the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a subject.","In this embodiment, the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art, including but not limited to, transfection, electroporation, microinjection, infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector, containing the nucleic acid sequences, cell fusion, chromosome-mediated gene transfer, microcellmediated gene transfer, spheroplast fusion, etc. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells (See, e.g., Loeffler and Behr, 1993, 217:599-618, Cohen et al., 1993, 217:618-644; and 29:69-92, 1985) and may be used in accordance with the present invention, provided that the necessary developmental and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell, so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny.","The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a subject by various methods known in the art. Recombinant blood cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells) are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect, patient state, etc., and can be determined by one skilled in the art.","Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired, available cell type, and include but are not limited to epithelial cells, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, muscle cells, hepatocytes; blood cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, granulocytes; various stem or progenitor cells, in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, e.g., as obtained from bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, fetal liver, etc.","In a preferred embodiment, the cell used for gene therapy is autologous to the subject.","In an embodiment in which recombinant cells are used in gene therapy, nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody or a fusion protein are introduced into the cells such that they are expressible by the cells or their progeny, and the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect. In a specific embodiment, stem or progenitor cells are used. Any stem and\/or progenitor cells which can be isolated and maintained in vitro can potentially be used in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention (See e.g., PCT Publication WO 94\/08598; Stemple and Anderson, 1992, 7 1:973-985; Rheinwald, 1980, 21A:229; and Pittelkow and Scott, 1986, 61:771).","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid to be introduced for purposes of gene therapy comprises an inducible promoter operably linked to the coding region, such that expression of the nucleic acid is controllable by controlling the presence or absence of the appropriate inducer of transcription.","5.6.3 Kits","The invention provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with the molecules of the invention (i.e., antibodies, polypeptides comprising variant Fc regions). Additionally, one or more other prophylactic or therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of a disease can also be included in the pharmaceutical pack or kit. The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.","The present invention provides kits that can be used in the above methods. In one embodiment, a kit comprises one or more molecules of the invention. In another embodiment, a kit further comprises one or more other prophylactic or therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of cancer or infectious disease, in one or more containers. In another embodiment, a kit further comprises one or more cytotoxic antibodies that bind one or more antigens associated with cancer or infectious disease. In certain embodiments, the other prophylactic or therapeutic agent is a chemotherapeutic. In other embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agent is a biological or hormonal therapeutic.","5.7 Characterization and Demonstration of Therapeutic Utility","Several aspects of the pharmaceutical compositions, prophylactic, or therapeutic agents of the invention are preferably tested in vitro, in a cell culture system, and in an animal model organism, such as a rodent animal model system, for the desired therapeutic activity prior to use in humans. For example, assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific pharmaceutical composition is desired, include cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample is grown in culture, and exposed to or otherwise contacted with a pharmaceutical composition of the invention, and the effect of such composition upon the tissue sample is observed. The tissue sample can be obtained by biopsy from the patient. This test allows the identification of the therapeutically most effective prophylactic or therapeutic molecule(s) for each individual patient. In various specific embodiments, in vitro assays can be carried out with representative cells of cell types involved in an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder (e.g., T cells), to determine if a pharmaceutical composition of the invention has a desired effect upon such cell types.","Combinations of prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents can be tested in suitable animal model systems prior to use in humans. Such animal model systems include, but are not limited to, rats, mice, chicken, cows, monkeys, pigs, dogs, rabbits, etc. Any animal system well-known in the art may be used. In a specific embodiment of the invention, combinations of prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents are tested in a mouse model system. Such model systems are widely used and well-known to the skilled artisan. Prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents can be administered repeatedly. Several aspects of the procedure may vary. Said aspects include the temporal regime of administering the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents, and whether such agents are administered separately or as an admixture.","Preferred animal models for use in the methods of the invention are, for example, transgenic mice expressing human Fc\u03b3Rs on mouse effector cells, e.g., any mouse model described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,396 (which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) can be used in the present invention. Transgenic mice for use in the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIIA; mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIA; mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIB and human Fc\u03b3RIIIA; mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIB and human Fc\u03b3RIIA.","Preferably, mutations showing the highest levels of activity in the functional assays described above will be tested for use in animal model studies prior to use in humans. Sufficient quantities of antibodies may be prepared for use in animal models using methods described supra, for example, using mammalian expression systems and IgG purification methods disclosed and exemplified herein.","Mouse xenograft models may be used for examining efficacy of mouse antibodies generated against a tumor specific target based on the affinity and specificity of the CDR regions of the antibody molecule and the ability of the Fc region of the antibody to elicit an immune response (Wu et al., 2001, Trends Cell Biol. 11: S2-9). Transgenic mice expressing human Fc\u03b3Rs on mouse effector cells are unique and are tailor-made animal models to test the efficacy of human Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions. Pairs of Fc\u03b3RIIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIIB and Fc\u03b3RIIA transgenic mouse lines generated in the lab of Dr. Jeffrey Ravetch (Through a licensing agreement with Rockefeller U. and Sloan Kettering Cancer center) can be used such as those listed in the Table 11 below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0525","num":"0524"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00015","num":"00015"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 11"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Mice Strains"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Strain Background","Human FcR"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Nude\/CD16A KO","none"]},{"entry":[{},"Nude\/CD16A KO","Fc\u03b3RIIIA"]},{"entry":[{},"Nude\/CD16A KO","Fc\u03b3R IIA"]},{"entry":[{},"Nude\/CD16A KO","Fc\u03b3R IIA and IIIA"]},{"entry":[{},"Nude\/CD32B KO","none"]},{"entry":[{},"Nude\/CD32B KO","Fc\u03b3R IIB"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Preferably Fc mutants showing both enhanced binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIA and reduced binding to Fc\u03b3RIIB, increased activity in ADCC and phagocytosis assays are tested in animal model experiments. The animal model experiments examine the increase in efficacy of Fc mutant bearing antibodies in Fc\u03b3RIIIA transgenic, nude mCD16A knockout mice compared to a control which has been administered native antibody. Preferably, groups of 8-10 mice are examined using a standard protocol. An exemplary animal model experiment may comprise the following steps: in a breast cancer model, \u02dc2\u00d710SK-BR-3 cells are injected subcutaneously on day 1 with 0.1 mL PBS mixed with Matrigel (Becton Dickinson). Initially a wild type chimeric antibody and isotype control are administered to establish a curve for the predetermined therapeutic dose, intravenous injection of 4D5 on day 1 with an initial dose of 4 \u03bcg\/g followed by weekly injections of 2 \u03bcg\/g. Tumor volume is monitored for 6-8 weeks to measure progress of the disease. Tumor volume should increase linearly with time in animals injected with the isotype control. In contrast very little tumor growth should occur in the group injected with 4D5. Results from the standard dose study are used to set an upper limit for experiments testing the Fc mutants. These studies are done using subtherapeutic doses of the Fc mutant containing antibodies. A one tenth dose was used on xenograft models in experiments done in Fc\u03b3RIIB knockout mice, see, Clynes et al., 2000, 6: 443-6, with a resultant block in tumor cell growth. Since the mutants of the invention preferrably show an increase in Fc\u03b3RIIIA activation and reduction in Fc\u03b3RIIB binding the mutants are examined at one tenth therapeutic dose. Examination of tumor size at different intervals indicates the efficacy of the antibodies at the lower dose. Statistical analysis of the data using t test provides a way of determining if the data is significant. Fc mutants that show increased efficacy are tested at incrementally lower doses to determine the smallest possible dose as a measure of their efficacy.","The anti-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can be determined by using various experimental animal models of inflammatory arthritis known in the art and described in Crofford L. J. and Wilder R. L., \u201cArthritis and Autoimmunity in Animals\u201d, in Arthritis and Allied Conditions: A Textbook of Rheumatology, McCarty et al. (eds.), Chapter 30 (Lee and Febiger, 1993). Experimental and spontaneous animal models of inflammatory arthritis and autoimmune rheumatic diseases can also be used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention. The following are some assays provided as examples, and not by limitation.","The principle animal models for arthritis or inflammatory disease known in the art and widely used include: adjuvant-induced arthritis rat models, collagen-induced arthritis rat and mouse models and antigen-induced arthritis rat, rabbit and hamster models, all described in Crofford L. J. and Wilder R. L., \u201cArthritis and Autoimmunity in Animals\u201d, in Arthritis and Allied Conditions: A Textbook of Rheumatology, McCarty et al. (eds.), Chapter 30 (Lee and Febiger, 1993), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The anti-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can be assessed using a carrageenan-induced arthritis rat model. Carrageenan-induced arthritis has also been used in rabbit, dog and pig in studies of chronic arthritis or inflammation. Quantitative histomorphometric assessment is used to determine therapeutic efficacy. The methods for using such a carrageenan-induced arthritis model is described in Hansra P. et al., \u201cCarrageenan-Induced Arthritis in the Rat,\u201d 24(2): 141-155, (2000). Also commonly used are zymosan-induced inflammation animal models as known and described in the art.","The anti-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can also be assessed by measuring the inhibition of carrageenan-induced paw edema in the rat, using a modification of the method described in Winter C. A. et al., \u201cCarrageenan-Induced Edema in Hind Paw of the Rat as an Assay for Anti-inflammatory Drugs\u201d 111, 544-547, (1962). This assay has been used as a primary in vivo screen for the anti-inflammatory activity of most NSAIDs, and is considered predictive of human efficacy. The anti-inflammatory activity of the test prophylactic or therapeutic agents is expressed as the percent inhibition of the increase in hind paw weight of the test group relative to the vehicle dosed control group.","Animal models for autoimmune disorders can also be used to assess the efficacy of the combination therapies of invention. Animal models for autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes, thyroid autoimmunity, systemic lupus eruthematosus, and glomerulonephritis have been developed (Flanders et al., 1999, 29:235-246; Krogh et al., 1999, 81:511-515; Foster, 1999, 19:12-24).","Further, any assays known to those skilled in the art can be used to evaluate the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic utility of the combinatorial therapies disclosed herein for autoimmune and\/or inflammatory diseases.","Toxicity and efficacy of the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic protocols of the instant invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD\/ED. Prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.","The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage of the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents for use in humans. The dosage of such agents lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any agent used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC(i.e., the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.","The anti-cancer activity of the therapies used in accordance with the present invention also can be determined by using various experimental animal models for the study of cancer such as the SCID mouse model or transgenic mice or nude mice with human xenografts, animal models, such as hamsters, rabbits, etc. known in the art and described in (1999, eds. Fiebig and Burger); (1999, Karger); (1991, eds. Boven and Winograd); and (1997 ed. Teicher), herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.","Preferred animal models for determining the therapeutic efficacy of the molecules of the invention are mouse xenograft models. Tumor cell lines that can be used as a source for xenograft tumors include but are not limited to, SKBR3 and MCF7 cells, which can be derived from patients with breast adenocarcinoma. These cells have both erbB2 and prolactin receptors. SKBR3 cells have been used routinely in the art as ADCC and xenograft tumor models. Alternatively, OVCAR3 cells derived from a human ovarian adenocarcinoma can be used as a source for xenograft tumors.","The protocols and compositions of the invention are preferably tested in vitro, and then in vivo, for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in humans. Therapeutic agents and methods may be screened using cells of a tumor or malignant cell line. Many assays standard in the art can be used to assess such survival and\/or growth; for example, cell proliferation can be assayed by measuring H-thymidine incorporation, by direct cell count, by detecting changes in transcriptional activity of known genes such as proto-oncogenes (e.g., fos, myc) or cell cycle markers; cell viability can be assessed by trypan blue staining, differentiation can be assessed visually based on changes in morphology, decreased growth and\/or colony formation in soft agar or tubular network formation in three-dimensional basement membrane or extracellular matrix preparation, etc.","Compounds for use in therapy can be tested in suitable animal model systems prior to testing in humans, including but not limited to in rats, mice, chicken, cows, monkeys, rabbits, hamsters, etc., for example, the animal models described above. The compounds can then be used in the appropriate clinical trials.","Further, any assays known to those skilled in the art can be used to evaluate the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic utility of the combinatorial therapies disclosed herein for treatment or prevention of cancer, inflammatory disorder, or autoimmune disease.","5.8 Diagnostic Assay","The invention encompasses molecules, e.g., antibodies, with altered affinities and avidities for one or more Fc\u03b3Rs. The antibodies of the invention with enhanced affinity and avidity for one or more Fc\u03b3Rs are particularly useful in cellular systems (for example for research or diagnostic purposes) where the Fc\u03b3Rs are expressed at low levels. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, the molecules of the invention with enhanced affinity and avidity for a particular Fc\u03b3R are valuable as research and diagnostic tools by enhancing the sensitivity of detection of Fc\u03b3Rs which are normally undetectable due to a low level of expression.","Using a yeast display system, mutant human IgG1 heavy chain Fc regions were screened for modified affinity to different Fc receptors. In particular, a mutant Fc library was generated by error prone PCR (Genemorph, Stratagene), and then the mutant Fc proteins were fused to the Aga2p cell wall protein, which allowed the fusion protein to be secreted extracellularly and displayed on the yeast cell wall.","Soluble forms of the human receptors (Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB) were cloned. Detection of the IgG1 Fc domains on the yeast cell surface, however, is hindered due to the low affinity of Fc\u03b3R for its ligand. In order to circumvent this limitation, soluble Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complexes were formed using an AVITAG sequence which could be enzymatically biotinylated and subsequently reacted with streptavidin conjugated to phycoerythrin (SA-PE; Molecular Probes) to form soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complexes. ELISA assays confirmed that the soluble Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complexes had a higher avidity for human IgG1 relative to the monomeric Fc\u03b3R. Fc fusion proteins on the yeast cell surface also bound the soluble Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complexes as assessed by FACS analysis.","The differential binding of the Fc fusion proteins expressed on the yeast cell surface to soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complexes was monitored by a FACS analysis. Fc fusion proteins with altered affinities for one or more soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complexes were thus identified and were then incorporated into a complete immunoglobulin and expressed in mammalian cells. The mammalian expressed product was used in ELISA assays to confirm the results obtained in the yeast surface display system. Finally, the mutant Fc regions were sequenced to confirm the altered residue(s).","6.1 Cloning, Expression and Purification of Fc\u03b3RIIIA","Materials and Methods","Soluble Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b3RIIIA were cloned as follows. The cDNA clones for the human Fc\u03b3R genes (Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b3RIIIA) were obtained (gift from Ravetch lab). Soluble region of the Fc\u03b3RIIIA gene (amino acids 7-203) was amplified by PCR (Table 12), digested with BamHI\/HindIII and ligated into the pET25vector (Novagen). This vector was digested with Sall\/Notl and a 370 by fragment was gel isolated. The vector hu3A, (gift from J.

As shown in , soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA (, lane 1) had the expected apparent molecular weight of \u02dc35 KDa and soluble rFc\u03b3RIIB (, lane 4) had the expected apparent molecular weight of \u02dc20 KDa. As shown in , soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA migrates as a diffuse \u201cfuzzy\u201d band which has been attributed to the high degree of glycosylation normally found on Fc\u03b3RIIIA (Jefferis, et al., 1995 44, 111-117).","6.1.1 Characterization of Purified Recombinant Soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA","Materials and Methods","Purified soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA, which was obtained as described above, was analyzed for direct binding against human monomeric or aggregated IgG using an ELISA assay. The plate is coated with 10 ng of soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA overnight in 1\u00d7 PBS. Subsequent to coating, the plate is washed three times in 1\u00d7 PBS\/0.1% Tween 20. Human IgG, either biotinylated monomeric IgG or biotinylated aggregated IgG, is added to the wells at a concentration ranging from 0.03 mg\/mL to 2 mg\/mL, and allowed to bind to the soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA. The reaction is carried out for one hour at 37\u00b0 C. The plate is washed again three times with 1\u00d7 PBS\/0.1% Tween 20. The binding of human IgG to soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA is detected with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate by monitoring the absorbance at 650 nm. The absorbance at 650 nm is proportional to the bound aggregated IgG.","In a blocking ELISA experiment, the ability of an Fc\u03b3RIIIA monoclonal antibody, 3G8, a mouse anti-Fc\u03b3RIIIA antibody (Pharmingen), to block the binding of the receptor to aggregated IgG is monitored. The washing and incubation conditions were the same as described above, except that prior to IgG addition, a 5-fold molar excess of 3G8 was added and allowed to incubate for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C.","Results","Purified, recombinant soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA binds aggregated IgG specifically","The direct binding of purified recombinant soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA to aggregated and monomeric IgG was tested using an ELISA assay (). At an IgG concentration of 2 \u03bcg\/ml, strong binding to the aggregated IgG was observed. However, at a similar concentration, no binding was detected to the monomeric IgG. The binding to aggregated IgG was blocked by 3G8, a mouse anti-Fc\u03b3RIIIA monoclonal antibody that blocks the ligand binding site, indicating that the aggregated IgG binding is via that of the normal Fc\u03b3RIIIA ligand binding site (). Soluble rFc\u03b3RIIB was also characterized and shown to bind to IgG with similar characteristics as the soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA (data not shown).","6.2 Formation of Soluble Fc\u03b3R Tetrameric Complexes","Materials and Methods","Construction of Plasmids for Expression of Soluble FcR\u03b3IIIA and FcR\u03b3IIB Fused to the AVITAG Peptide.","To generate soluble Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complexes, the soluble region of the human FcR\u03b3IIIA gene (amino acids 7-203) was amplified by PCR (Table 12), digested with BamHI\/HindIII and ligated into the pET25b(+) (Novagen).

Both of these fragments were co-ligated into pcDNA3.1, which had been digested with BamHI\/Notl to create pcDNA3-FcR\u03b3IIB (amino acids 1-180). Subsequently, the linker-AVITAG\u2122 peptide sequence was fused to the C-terminus of both Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB. To generate the Fc\u03b3RIIIA-linker-avitag and Fc\u03b3RIIB-linker-AVITAG\u2122 peptide constructs, the pcDNA3.1 Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB constructs were digested with Not I and XbaI (both cut in the vector sequence) and a 86 base pair double stranded oligonucleotide consisting of NotI site at the 5\u2032 end and XbaI at the 3\u2032 end was ligated into the vector. This 86 bp fragment was generated by annealing two 5\u2032 phosphorylated reverse complement oligonucleotides (shown in Table 12 as 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 linker.avitag primers) with the restrictions sites for NotI and XbaI already pre-designed. Equal volumes of each primer at 100 ng per ul were mixed and the DNA heated to 90\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes and cooled at room temperature for an hour to anneal. This created a double-stranded DNA fragment ready to be ligated to the pcDNA3.1-Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB constructs digested with the respective enzymes.

J., 1993, 11:1138-1143) at the C-terminus of the protein cloned into pcDNA3.1 were generated by transiently transfecting 293H cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, CA). Supernatants were collected from the cultures and soluble FcR proteins were purified by passing the supernatants over an IgG sepharose column. Concentration of the soluble FcR-AVITAG\u2122 peptide fusion protein was quantitated by absorbance at 280 nm. The AVITAG\u2122 peptide present on the soluble FcR proteins was biotinylated according to the manufacturer's protocol (Avidity, CO) with the BirA enzyme, a biotin ligase. A 1:100 final dilution of a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma catalog #P8849) and 1 mg\/ml final concentration of Leupeptin (Sigma L-8511) were added to the mixture to prevent degradation of the proteins. The BirA reaction was incubated at room temperature overnight, following which the solution was concentrated using a Biomax 10K-ultrafiltration device (Millipore) by centrifugation at 3500 rpm at 4\u00b0 C. The protein was loaded onto an FPLC Superdex 200 HR 10\/30 column (Pharmacia Biotech) in Tris-HCl (20 mM, pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl to separate the labeled soluble Fc\u03b3R from free biotin.","Determination of the Extent of Biotinylation by Streptavidin Shift Assay","Approximately 80-85% of the protein was biotinylated by the BirA enzyme (Avidity, CO). The streptavidin-shift assay was used to determine the extent of biotinylation of the protein. Biotinylated protein was incubated with streptavidin (MW 60,000 Daltons) in different ratios. Unbiotinylated protein alone and streptavidin alone are included as controls to determine the extent of biotinylation. The incubation is carried out either on ice for 2 hours or overnight at 4\u00b0 C. Samples are analyzed on a 4-12% SDS-PAGE Bis-Tris (Invitrogen, CA) with reducing agent and without boiling of the samples. Streptavidin bound biotinylated protein migrates as a high molecular weight band. The extent of biotinylation is estimated by the amount of monomeric protein left in the sample. Absence of monomeric low molecular weight species and presence of a complex with molecular weight greater than streptavidin alone indicates a high degree of biotinylation.","Formation of Fc\u03b3R Tetrameric Complexes","Formation of Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complexes was performed according to previously established methodologies for MHC class I tetramers (See Busch, D. H. et al., 1998 8:353-362; Altman, J. D. et al., 1996, 274: 94-96). The concentration of the biotinylated monomeric Fc\u03b3R was calculated based on absorbance at 280 nm. One molecule of streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SA-PE) (Molecular Probes, OR) has the capacity to bind 4 molecules of biotin. A 5:1 molar ratio of monomeric biotinylated Fc\u03b3R to SA-PE (5\u00d7 monomeric biotinylated Fc\u03b3R: 1\u00d7 SA-PE) was used to ensure an excess of biotinylated protein. The calculated molecular weight of SA-PE is 300,000 Daltons, therefore 303 mL of a 1 mg\/mL solution of streptavidin-PE has 1 nmole of SA-PE, which was added to 5 nmole of protein. Efficient formation of tetrameric protein requires SA-PE to be added in step-wise increments. Half the amount of SA-PE was added upfront, and the remaining SA-PE was added in small aliquots every 20-30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. in the dark. The intervals for the addition of the remaining SA-PE is flexible. After the addition of SA-PE was complete, the solution was concentrated and loaded over an FPLC size exclusion column as above in phosphate buffered saline, at pH 7.4. The fraction that eluted in the void volume with a molecular weight greater than SA-PE alone was collected. Protease inhibitors were replenished to prevent protein degradation. The solution was concentrated and additional protease inhibitors were added to the final complex for storage. The final concentration of the soluble Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complex was calculated based on the starting concentration of the biotinylated monomeric protein. For example, if 500 \u03bcg of biotinylated protein was used to make the tetrameric complex and the final concentrated tetramers were in a volume of 500 \u03bcL, the concentration is estimated to be approximately 1 mg\/mL (The losses incurred during concentration are not taken into account as it is difficult to accurately determine how much is lost during each step of the formation of the tetramers. It is also not possible to take an absorbance at 280 nm to measure the concentration due to interference from the PE). Soluble Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complexes were dispensed in small aliquots at \u221280\u00b0 C. for long term storage with protease inhibitors. Sodium azide was not added to these preparations as the tetramers were used for screening a yeast display library. On thawing an aliquot, the tetramers were stored at 4\u00b0 C. for up to 1 week.","ELISA Assay for Characterizing the Tetrameric Fc\u03b3R Complexes","An ELISA was used to characterize the tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complexes. Maxisorb F96 well plate (Nunc) was coated with 25 ng of human IgG in PBS buffer, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The plates were washed with PBS\/0.5% BSA\/0.1% Tween 20 (wash and diluent buffer) before adding the combination of Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetramers and test antibodies to determine blocking with 3G8, a mouse anti-human Fc\u03b3RIIIA antibody as described below: The blocking step was performed as follows: soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetramers at a fixed 0.5 mg\/ml final concentration were pre-incubated with antibodies for 1 h at room temperature in buffer, PBS\/0.5% BSA\/0.1% Tween 20. The final concentrations of the antibodies ranged from 60 mg\/mL to 0.25 mg\/mL. 3G8 is a mouse anti-human Fc\u03b3RIIIA antibody, and for the purpose of this experiment, a chimeric version was used, i.e., the variable region of the antibody is a mouse anti-human Fc\u03b3RIIIA and the constant region of the heavy and light chains is from the IgG1 human region. A chimeric 4.4.20. D265A was also used in this experiment, which is an anti-fluorescein antibody, such that the Fc region contains a mutation at position 265, where an aspartic acid is substituted with alanine in the human IgG1, which results in a reduced binding to Fc\u03b3R. This antibody has been characterized previously (See Clynes et al., 2000, 6:443-446; Shields et al., 2001, 276:6591-6604). This antibody was used as negative isotype control.","The antibodies were allowed to bind to Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetramers, by pre-incubation for 1 hour at room temperature. The mixture was then added to the IgG on the washed plate and incubated for and additional hour at room temperature. The plate was washed with buffer and DJ130c (a mouse anti-human Fc\u03b3RIIIA antibody available from DAKO, Denmark; its epitope is distinct from that of the 3G8 antibody) at 1:5000 dilution was added and allowed to incubate for 1 hr. at room temperature in order to detect the bound Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetramers. Unbound antibodies were washed out with buffer and the bound DJ130c was detected with goat anti-mouse peroxidase (Jackson laboratories). This reagent will not detect the human Fc. After washing out the unbound peroxidase-conjugated antibody, the substrate, TMB reagent (BioFx), was added to detect the extent of blocking with 3G8 versus the isotype control and the developed color was read at 650 nm.","For direct binding of soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3RIIIA to IgG by ELISA, maxisorb plates were coated with 25 ng IgG as described above. The soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3RIIIA were added from 20 mg\/mL to 0.1 mg\/mL and the biotinylated monomeric soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3RIIIA were added at concentrations ranging from 20 mg\/mL to 0.16 mg\/mL. Detection was the same as above with DJ130c, followed by goat anti-mouse-peroxidase antibody. Color developed with the TMB reagent and the plate was read at 650 nm.","Results","Soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA Tetrameric Complex Binds Monomeric Human IgG via its Normal Ligand Binding Site","Soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA-AVITAG\u2122 peptide fusion proteins were generated, isolated, and analyzed as described in the Material and Methods section using an ELISA assay and were shown to have similar properties as the non-AVITAG\u2122 peptide soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA protein (data not shown). The fusion proteins were biotinylated, and the tetrameric complexes were generated as described above.","The soluble Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complex was then assessed for binding its ligand, monomeric human IgG, using an ELISA assay. Analysis by ELISA showed the soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complexes bind monomeric human IgG specifically. As shown in , binding of soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3RIIIA to monomeric human IgG is blocked by 3G8, a mouse anti-human Fc\u03b3IIIA monoclonal antibody, as monitored by the absorbance at 650 nm. On the other hand, the 4-4-20 monoclonal antibody harboring the D265A mutation was not able to block the binding of soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3RIIIA to monomeric human IgG (). This experiment thus confirms that binding of the soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3RIIIA complex occurs through the native ligand binding site.","Soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA Tetrameric Complex Binds Monomeric Human IgG with a Greater Avidity than Monomeric Soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA","The direct binding of soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3RIIIA to aggregated human IgG was assessed using an ELISA assay and compared to the direct binding of soluble monomeric Fc\u03b3RIIIA to monometic human IgG. As shown in , soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3RIIIA binds human IgG with a higher avidity (8-10 fold) than the soluble monomeric receptor, as monitored by the absorbance at 450 nm.","The binding of soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex was also assayed using magnetic beads coated with Fc Fragment purified from IgG1 (). Soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex binds to the IgG1 Fc-coated beads, under conditions in which monomer binding is not detected. Specificity of binding was shown by pre-incubating the receptor complex, with an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIIA monoclonal antibody, LNK16, which blocks Fc binding. This assay further confirms that soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex binds monomeric IgG through its normal ligand binding site, and the avidity of the receptor is increased due to multiple binding sites within the complex.","6.3 Construction of Yeast Strain for Display of Mutant IgG1 Fc Domains","Materials and Methods","The pYD1 vector (Invitrogen) is derived directly from a yeast replicating vector, pCT302 (Shusta, et al., 2000 18:754-759, that has been successfully used to display T-cell receptors and a number of scFVs. This plasmid is centromeric and harbors the TRP1 gene enabling a relatively constant copy number of 1-2 plasmids per cell in a trpl yeast strain. Directional cloning into the polylinker places the gene of interest under the control of the GALL promoter and in-frame with AGA2. Fusion of the IgG Fc domain to the yeast Aga2p results in the extracellular secretion of the Aga2-Fc fusion protein and subsequent display of the Fc protein on the cell wall via disulfide bonding to the yeast Aga lp protein, which is an integral cell wall protein.","In order to optimize the display levels, different fragments from the IgG1 heavy chain were amplified by PCR and cloned into pYD1. Specifically, the Fc region of the IgG1 heavy chain (allotype IG1m(a); amino acids 206-447) was amplified by PCR (Table 1) from the IMAGE clone 182740, digested with EcoRI\/SaII and ligated into the pYD1 vector (Invitrogen). The initial clone from IMAGE contained a deletion of a single nucleotide at position 319 which was corrected by in vitro site directed mutagenesis to construct pYD-GIF206 (Quickchange, Stratagene).","The CH1-CH3 fragment (amino acids 118-447) was amplified from the heavy chain clone of the MAb B6.2 in the pCINEO vector using a 5\u2032 oligo (mcr025;chl(f)) and a 3\u2032 oligo (H021) (See Table 8). The fragment was digested with BamHI\/NotI and ligated into the pYD1 vector to construct pYD-CH1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0575","num":"0574"},"figref":"FIG. 6","i":"J. Immunol. Meth. "},"6.4 Immunolocalization and Characterization of Fc Domains on the Yeast Cell Wall","Materials and Methods","Constructs containing the Aga2p-Fc fusion proteins and a control vector, pYD1, lacking any insert, were transformed into the yeast strain EBY100 (Invitrogen), MAT\u03b1 ura3-52 trpl leu2\u0394l his3\u0394200 pep4::HIS3 prb1\u03941.6R can1 GAL::GAL-AGA1, using a standard lithium acetate yeast transformation protocol (Gietz et al., 1992 20: 1425) Subsequently, tryptophan prototrophs were selected on defined media. Amplification of independent cell populations and induction of Agalp and the Aga2p-Fc fusion proteins were accomplished by growth in glucose, followed by growth in media containing galactose as the primary carbon source for 24-48 hrs at 20\u00b0 C. Growth in galactose induces expression of the Aga2-Fc fusion proteins via the GAL1 promoter, which subsequently leads to the display of the Fc fusion proteins on the yeast cell surface.","Results","FACS Analysis of Fc Fusion Proteins","Expression of Fc fusion proteins on the yeast cell surface was analyzed by immunostaining using a PE-conjugated polyclonal F(ab)goat anti-human Fc\u03b3R and HP6017 (Sigma) antibody (Jackson Immununoresearch Laboratories, Inc.). Fluorescence microscopy shows peripheral staining for the three Fc fusion proteins. The control strain, harboring vector alone, shows little or no staining (data not shown). FACS analysis was used to quantitate the staining (). The yeast strain containing the CH1-CH3 fusion demonstrated the highest percentage of cells stained with both antibodies ( and F). The GIF227 construct showed the greatest mean fluorescence intensity (, panels C and G).","Characterization of the Binding of Fc Fusion Proteins Expressed on the Yeast Cell Surface","The natural context of the Fc and Fc\u03b3R proteins places the receptor on the cell surface and the Fc as the soluble ligand; however, the yeast Fc surface display reverses the geometry of the natural interaction. Detection of the IgG1 Fc proteins on the surface of the yeast cell wall is complicated by both the low affinity of the Fc\u03b3R for its ligand and the reverse geometry inherent in the display system. Although the latter point cannot be altered, the avidity of the ligand was improved as explained above by forming soluble Fc\u03b3R tetrameric complexes, which allows detection of Fc\u03b3R binding to the Fc fusion proteins expressed on the surface yeast cell wall.","To characterize the binding of soluble tetrameric Fc\u03b3R complexes to the surface displayed Fc fusion proteins, yeast cells expressing different Fc constructs were incubated with the soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex and analyzed by FACS. Yeast cells harboring pYD-CH1, displaying the wild type CH1-CH3 construct were bound by the soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex as shown by FACS analysis. The GIF206 and GIF227 strains, however, showed little or no binding to the soluble rFc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex as shown by FACS analysis (data not shown).","Mutations in the Fc region that block binding to the Fc\u03b3Rs have been identified (Shields et al., 2001; 276: 6591-6604). One of these mutations, D265A, was incorporated into pYD-CH1 and this mutant was expressed on the yeast cell surface. These cells were incubated with the soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex using a high concentration of ligand (0.15 mM of Fc; 7.5 mM of D265A) FACS analysis indicated that soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex bound to wild type Fc () but soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex did not bind to the D265A-Fc mutant indicating that Fc\u03b3R is interacting with the normal FcR binding site in the lower hinge-CH2 region ().","Antibodies against the Fc\u03b3RIIIA ligand binding site blocked binding of the soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex to the wild type Fc protein displayed on the yeast cell surface wall, as analyzed by FACS (). The binding of soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex was blocked by the 3G8 antibody, as well as the LNK16 antibody, another anti-Fc\u03b3RIIIA monoclonal antibody (Advanced Immunological) (Tam et al., 1996 157:, 1576-1581) and was not blocked by an irrelevant isotype control. Therefore, binding of soluble Fc\u03b3RIIA tetrameric complex to the Fc proteins displayed on the yeast cell surface occurs through the normal ligand binding site. The limited binding of the Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex indicates that a subpopulation of cells have a correctly folded Fc that is accessible to Fc\u03b3R. There are numerous reasons why only a subpopulation of cells may be able to bind the ligand, for example, they may be at different stages of cell cycle or the fusion proteins may not have been exported.","In order to determine the dissociation constant of the Fc\u03b3RIIIA-tetramer binding to the Fc fusion proteins on the yeast cell surface, the binding of a range of Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex was analyzed using FACS. Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex was titrated at concentrations of 1.4 \u03bcM to 0.0006 \u03bcM. Using the mean fluorescence intensity as a measure of binding affinity and nonlinear regression analysis, the Kwas determined to be 0.006 \u03bcM (+\/\u22120.001) (data not shown).","6.5 Construction of Fc Mutant Library","A mutant Fc library was constructed using primers flanking the Fc fragment in the Fc-CH1 construct and error-prone PCR (Genemorph, Stratagene). The CH1-CH3 insert in vector pYD-CH1 was amplified using a mutagenic PCR (Genemorph, Stratagene). Five reactions were carried out using the pYD-upstream and pYD-downstream primers (Invitrogen). The resultant amplified fragment was digested with XHOI\/BamHI and ligated into pYD1. The ligation reaction was then transformed into XL10 ultracompetent cells (Stratagene), which resulted in \u02dc1\u00d710transformants, with 80% of the transformants containing inserts.","Sequence analysis of 28 random plasmids from the library indicated a mutation frequency \u02dc2-3 mutations\/kb with a breakdown of 40% conserved nucleotide changes and 60% of the mutations resulting in amino acid changes.","The library was transformed into the yeast strain EBY100, MAT\u03b1 ura3-52 trp l leu2\u03941 his3\u0394200 pep4::HIS3 prb1\u03941.6R can l GAL GAL-AGA 1::URA3 to a high efficiency, \u02dc3.3\u00d710transformants\/ug, in 30 independent transformation reactions to create a total of \u02dc10yeast transformants (Gietz, et al., 1992, 20: 1425).

Plates were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS\/0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) 3 times. 200 ml\/well of PBST\/0.5% BSA was added and the plates were incubated for 30 mins at room temperature. Plates were washed three additional times with PBST. 50 ml\/well of 1:4 diluted 4-4-20 antibody (approximately 3 mg\/mL which would lead to a final concentration of 0.7-0.8 mg\/well) either wild type or containing an Fc mutant, was added from conditional medium in PBST\/0.5% BSA and allowed to incubate for 2 hrs at room temperature. Plates were washed with PBST three times. Purified, biotinylated monomeric Fc\u03b3RIIIA at 3 mg\/ml (in PBST\/0.5% BSA) was added (50 \u03bcl\/well) to the plates and allowed to incubate for 1.5 hours at room temperature. Plates were washed with PBST three times. 50 ml\/well of a 1:5000 dilution of Streptavidin-HRP (Pharmacia, RPN 123v) in PBST\/0.5% BSA was added and the plates were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Plates were washed with PBST three times. 80 ml\/well of TMB reagent (BioFX) was then added to the plates, and allowed to incubate for 10-15 minutes at room temperature in a dark place. The reactions were finally stopped by adding 40 ml\/well of stop solution (0.18 M sulfuric acid). Plates were then monitored for absorbance at 450 nm. After the first screen, the interesting candidates were further confirmed by serial titration of 4-4-20-Fc mutants in the immuno-complex based binding ELISA. A few modifications were made in this ELISA. For coating the plates, 2 mg\/ml BSA-FITC was used. Based on IgG quantitation results, diluted 4-4-20Fc (wild type or mutants) from conditional medium was added to a final concentration of 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.063, and 0 mg\/ml in PBST-\/0.5% BSA.","FACS Screen for the Cell Surface Displayed Fc Proteins","Cells were grown in at least 10 mls of HSM-Trp-Ura pH 5.5 with glucose for 16-24 hrs or until ODwas greater than 2.0. Cells were spun down at \u02dc2000 rpm for 5 minutes. Cells were resuspended in an equal volume of HSM-Trp-Ura, pH 7.0 with galactose. In a 125 ml flask, 36 mls of galactose media was added, and inoculated with 9 mls of culture, which was incubated at 20\u00b0 C. with shaking for 24-48 hrs. Growth was monitored by measuring ODat 8-16 hr intervals. Cells were harvested at 2K rpm for 5 minutes, and resuspended in an equal volume of 1\u00d7 PBS, pH 7.4.","Equilibrium screen: An appropriate amount of cells was incubated while maintaining an excess of ligand. For example, it is preferred to start with a number of cells needed to ensure 10-fold coverage of the library. For the first sort with a library containing 10transformants, 10cells should be used. In fact it is best to start with 10cells to compensate for loss during the staining protocol.","Incubation was typically done in a 1.5 mL tube in volumes of 20-100 mls for 1 hour at 4\u00b0 C. in the dark on a rotator (incubation buffer: 1\u00d7PBS pH7.4;1 mg\/ml BSA). Cells were washed once in 500 ml of incubation buffer and spun down at 4K rpm for 2.5 minutes. Cells were resuspended in 100 ml incubation buffer and incubated with the second staining reagent. For Fc-CH1, a F(ab)goat anti-hFc F(ab)-FITC antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.) can be used to stain for CH1 expression. Staining was done with 1 mL for 30 minutes.

Cells were analyzed by FACS and sort gates were used to select the cells that showed the highest affinity for the soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex relative to the amount of Fc expression on the cell surface (). For example, a cell containing a mutant Fc that binds better to the soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex may express fewer Fc fusion proteins on the yeast cell surface, and this cell will be in the lower left hand corner of the sort gate.","Four consecutive sorts were done to enrich for those mutants that showed the highest affinity for the soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex. The gates for each successive sort were 5.5% , 1% , 0.2% and 0.1% . After the last sort, cells were plated onto selective media and individual colonies were isolated. Each individual colony represented a clonal population of cells harboring a single Fc mutant within the Aga2-Fc fusion protein. Initially 32 independent colonies were picked and tested by FACS for binding to soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex (). Eighteen mutants showed an increase in binding intensity as measured by the percentage of cells bound by soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex and the mean fluorescence intensity of the bound cells.","Mutations showing an increase in binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIA were also tested for binding to soluble Fc\u03b3RIIB tetrameric complex (). Most mutations that lead to an increase in binding to the soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex also resulted in detection of Fc\u03b3RIIB tetrameric complex staining (). Based on both previous physical and genetic data, some mutations that increase binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIA, are expected to also increase binding to Fc\u03b3RIIB (Shields et al., 2001, 276: 6591-6604; Sondermann et al., 2000, 406: 267-273).","Analysis of Mutants in a 4-4-20 MAb Produced in a Human Cell Line.","Isolation and analysis of mutations in the yeast system allows for fast identification of novel mutant alleles. The use of a heterologous system to isolate mutations could result in the identification of mutations that enhance binding through an alteration that results in misfolding or alteration in glycosylation that is specific to yeast. To analyze the Fc mutations in an immunoglobulin molecule that is produced in human cells, the mutants were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, containing the heavy chain of the anti-fluorescein monoclonal antibody, 4-4-20 (Kranz et al., 1982 257(12): 6987-6995). The mutant 4-4-20 heavy chains were transiently coexpressed with the light chain clones in the human kidney cell line (293H). Supernatants were collected and analyzed by ELISA ().","According to the ELISA assay, the majority of the mutants that were identified as having an enhanced affinity for the soluble monomeric Fc\u03b3RIIIA complex, in the secondary FACS analysis, also showed an increase in binding to the soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA tetrameric complex when present in the Fc region of the 4-4-20 monoclonal antibody produced in the human cell line (). Two mutants, number 16 and number 19, however, showed a decrease in binding to the soluble Fc\u03b3RIIIA monomeric complex.","Table 14, summarizes the mutations that have been identified and their corresponding binding characteristics to Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB, as determined by both yeast display based assays and ELISA.

After incubation, the cells were spun at 1000 rpm in a Beckman centrifuge (about 220\u00d7g) for five minutes at 10\u00b0 C. 20 \u03bcl of supernatant was collected; 200 \u03bcL of Eu solution was added and the mixture was shaken for 15 minutes at room temperature at 120 rpm on a rotary shaker. The fluorescence was quantitated in a time resolved fluorometer (Victor 1420, Perkin Elmer)","Results","As described above, the variant Fc regions were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, containing the heavy chain of the anti-fluoresceine monoclonal antibody, 4-4-20 (Kranz et al., 1982 257(12): 6987-6995). The variant 4-4-20 heavy chains were transiently coexpressed with the light chain clones in the human kidney cell line (293H). Supernatants were collected and analyzed using the ADCC assay.  shows that ADCC activity of the mutants is concentration-dependent. As summarized in Table 8, five immunoglobulins with variant Fc regions had an enhanced ADCC activity relative to wild type ch 4-4-20. The five mutants were as follows: MGFc-27 (G316D, A378V, D399E); MGFc-31 (P247L, N421K); MGFc-10 (K288N, A330S, P396L); MGFc-28 (N315I, V379M, T394M); MGFc-29 (F243I, V379L, G420V).","Additional 4-4-20 immunoglobulins with variant Fc regions were assayed for their ADCC activity relative to a 4-4-20 immunoglobulin with a wild-type Fc region. These results are summarized in Table 15.","ADCC assays were also carried out using the same protocol as previously described for the 4-4-20 antibody, however, the variant Fc regions were cloned into a humanized antibody (Ab4D5) which is specific for the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2\/neu). In this case, SK-BR-3 cells were used as the target cells that were opsonized with a HER2\/neu antibody carrying a variant Fc region. HER2\/neu is endogenously expressed by the SK-BR-3 cells and therefore present on the surface these cells.  shows the ADCC activity of HER2\/neu antibodies carrying variant Fc regions. Table 16 summarizes the results of ADCC activity of the mutants in the context of the HER2\/neu antibody. Normalization was carried out by comparing the concentration of the mutant to the wild type antibody required for a specific value of percent cell lysis.","As shown in , MGFc-5 (V379M), MGFc-9 (P243I, V379L), MGFc-10 (K288N, A330S, P396L), MGFc-13 (K334E, T359N, T366S), and MGFc-27 (G316D, A378V, D399E) mutants that were cloned in to the humanized anti-HER2\/neu antibody exhibited a higher %

parameters of the binding of ch4-4-20 antibodies harboring Fc mutants to Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB were analyzed using a BIAcore assay (BIAcore instrument 1000, BIAcore Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). The Fc\u03b3RIIIA used in this assay was a soluble monomeric protein, the extracellular region of Fc\u03b3RIIIA joined to the linker-AVITAG sequence as described in Section 6.2 supra. The Fc\u03b3RIIB used in this assay was a soluble dimeric protein prepared in accordance with the methodology described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/439,709 filed on Jan. 13, 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, the Fc\u03b3RIIB used was the extracellular domain of Fc\u03b3RIIB fused to the hinge-CH2-CH3 domain of human IgG2.","BSA-FITC (36 \u03bcg\/mL in 10 mM Acetate Buffer at pH 5.0) was immobilized on one of the four flow cells (flow cell 2) of a sensor chip surface through amine coupling chemistry (by modification of carboxymethyl groups with mixture of NHS\/EDC) such that about 5000 response units (RU) of BSA-FITC was immobilized on the surface. Following this, the unreacted active esters were \u201ccapped off\u201d with an injection of 1M Et-NH2. Once a suitable surface was prepared, ch 4-4-20 antibodies carrying the Fc mutations were passed over the surface by one minute injections of a 20 \u03bcg\/mL solution at a 5 \u03bcL\/mL flow rate. The level of ch-4-4-20 antibodies bound to the surface ranged between 400 and 700 RU. Next, dilution series of the receptor (Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB-Fc fusion protein) in HBS-P buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% Surfactant P20, 3 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) were injected onto the surface at 100 \u03bcL\/min Antibody regeneration between different receptor dilutions was carried out by single 5 second injections of 100 mM NaHCOpH 9.4; 3M NaCl.","The same dilutions of the receptor were also injected over a BSA-FITC surface without any ch-4-4-20 antibody at the beginning and at the end of the assay as reference injections.","Once an entire data set was collected, the resulting binding curves were globally fitted using computer algorithms supplied by the manufacturer, BIAcore, Inc. (Piscataway, N.J.). These algorithms calculate both the Kand K, from which the apparent equilibrium binding constant, Kis deduced as the ratio of the two rate constants (i.e., K\/K). More detailed treatments of how the individual rate constants are derived can be found in the BIAevaluaion Software Handbook (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.).","Binding curves for two different concentrations (200 nM and 800 nM for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and 200 nM and 400 nM for Fc\u03b3RIIB fusion protein) were aligned and responses adjusted to the same level of captured antibodies, and the reference curves were subtracted from the experimental curves. Association and dissociation phases were fitted separately. Dissociation rate constant was obtained for interval 32-34 sec of the dissociation phase; association phase fit was obtained by a 1:1 Langmuir model and base fit was selected on the basis Rand chicriteria.","Results",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0623","num":"0622"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 16","FIG. 17","FIG. 18","FIG. 19"],"sub":["off ","D ","off ","off ","D ","off "]},"The kinetic parameters (Kand K) that were determined from the BIAcore analysis correlated with the binding characteristic of the mutants as determined by an ELISA assay and the functional activity of the mutants as determined in an ADCC assay. Specifically, as seen in Table 17, mutants that had an enhanced ADCC activity relative to the wild-type protein, and had an enhanced binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIA as determined by an ELISA assay had an improved Kfor Fc\u03b3RIIIA (i.e., a lower K). Therefore, a lower Kvalue for Fc\u03b3RIIIA for a mutant Fc protein relative to a wild type protein may be likely to have an enhanced ADCC function. On the other hand, as seen in Table 18, mutants that had an enhanced ADCC activity relative to the wild-type protein, and had a reduced binding for Fc\u03b3RIIB-Fc fusion protein as determined by an ELISA assay had a higher Kfor Fc\u03b3RIIB-Fc fusion protein.","Thus, the Kvalues for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB can be used as predictive measures of how a mutant will behave in a functional assay such as an ADCC assay. In fact, ratios of Kvalues for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB-Fc fusion protein of the mutants to the wild type protein were plotted against ADCC data (). Specifically, in the case of Kvalues for Fc\u03b3RIIIA, the ratio of K(wt)\/K(mutant) was plotted against the ADCC data; and in the case of Kvalues for Fc\u03b3RIIB, the ratio of K(mut)\/ K(wt) was plotted against the ADCC data. Numbers higher than one (1) show a decreased dissociation rate for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and an increased dissociation rate for Fc\u03b3RIIB-Fc relative to wild type.

identifying additional sets of mutants that show improved binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIA and reduced binding to Fc\u03b3RIIB. Secondary screening of selected Fc variants was performed by ELISA followed by testing for ADCC in the 4-4-20 system. Mutants were than selected primarily based on their ability to mediate ADCC via 4-4-20 using Fluorescein coated SK-BR3 cells as targets and isolated PBMC from human donors as the effector cell population. Fc mutants that showed a relative increase in ADCC, e.g., an enhancement by a factor of 2 were than cloned into anti-HER2\/neu or anti-CD20 chAbs and tested in an ADCC assay using the appropriate tumor cells as targets. The mutants were also analyzed by BIAcore and their relative Kwere determined.","Screen 1: Sequential solid phase depletion and selection using Magnetic beads coated with Fc\u03b3RIIB followed by selection with magnetic beads coated with Fc\u03b3RIIIA. The aim of this screen was identification of Fc mutants that either no longer bind Fc\u03b3RIIB or show reduced binding to Fc\u03b3RIIB. A 10-fold excess of the na\u00efve library (\u02dc10cells) was incubated with magnetic beads (\u201cMy One\u201d, Dynal) coated with Fc\u03b3RIIB. Yeast bound to beads were separated from the non-bound fraction by placing the tube containing the mixture in a magnetic field. Those yeast cells that were not bound to the beads were removed and placed in fresh media. They were next bound to beads that were coated with Fc\u03b3RIIIA. Yeast bound to beads were separated from the nonbound fraction by placing the tube containing the mixture in a magnetic field. Nonbound yeast were removed and the bound cells were removed by vigorous vortexing. The recovered cells were regrown in glucose containing media and reinduced in selective media containing galactose. The selection process was repeated. The final culture was than used to harvest DNA. Inserts containing the Fc domain were amplified by PCR and cloned into 4-4-20. Approximately 90 Fc mutants were screened by 4-4-20 ELISA and ADCC assays and the resultant positive mutants are shown in Table 19.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0630","num":"0629"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00023","num":"00023"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 19"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Mutants selected by sequential solid phase depletion and"},{"entry":"selection using Magnetic beads coated with Fc\u03b3RIIB"},{"entry":"followed by selection with magnetic beads coated with"},{"entry":"Fc\u03b3RIIIA."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Mutant","Amino Acid changes"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"MgFc37","K248M"]},{"entry":[{},"MgFc38","K392T, P396L"]},{"entry":[{},"MgFc39","E293V, Q295E, A327T"]},{"entry":[{},"MgFc41","H268N, P396LN"]},{"entry":[{},"MgFc43","Y319F, P352L, P396L"]},{"entry":[{},"MgFc42","D221E, D270E, V308A, Q311H, P396L,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"G402D"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Screens 2&3: Mutants Selected by FACS, Equilibrium and Kinetic Screening: The first library screen identified a mutation at position 396, changing the amino acid from Proline to Leucine (P396L). This Fc variant showed increased binding to both Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB. A second library was constructed using P396L as a base line. PCR mutagenesis was used to generate \u02dc10mutants each of which contained the P396L mutation and contained additional nucleotide changes. The P396L library was screened using two sets of conditions.","An equilibrium screen was performed using biotinylated Fc\u03b3RIIIA-linker-avitag as a monomer, using methods already described. Approximately 10-fold excess of library (10cells) was incubated in a 0.5 mL of approximately 7 nM Fc\u03b3RIIIA for 1 hr. The mixture was sorted by FACS, selecting top 1.2% of binders. Selected yeast cells were grown in selective media containing glucose and reinduced in selective media containing galactose. The equilibrium screen was repeated a second time and the sort gate was set to collect the top 0.2% of binders. The selected yeast cells were then grown under selective conditions in glucose.

Cultured cells were stained with Fc\u03b3R specific antibodies and analyzed by FACS to determine MDM Fc\u03b3R profiles. Conditions that best mimic macrophage in vivo Fc\u03b3R expression, i.e., showed the greatest fraction of cells expressing CD16 and CD32B were used in a monocyte derived macrophage (MDM) based ADCC assay.

In vivo antibody mediated cytotoxicity can occur through multiple mechanisms. In addition to ADCC other possible mechanisms include complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and apoptosis. The binding of C1q to the Fc region of an immunoglobulin initiates as cascade resulting in cell lysis by CDC. The interaction between C1q and the Fc has been studies in a series of Fc mutants. The results of these experiments indicate that C1q and the low affinity FcR bind to overlapping regions of the Fc, however the exact contact residues within the Fc vary.","Mutants that showed improved ADCC in the PBMC based assay were examined for their effect in CDC. Antibodies were analyzed in the anti CD20 Ch-mAb, 2H7. We detected improved CDC for each mutant ch-mAb tested. Interestingly even though these mutants were selected for their improved ADCC they also show enhanced CDC","MATERIALS AND METHODS. CDC assay was used to test the Fc mutants using anti-CD20 and Daudi cells as targets. Guinea Pig Serum was used as the source for complement (US Biological). The CDC assay was similar to PBMC based ADCC. Target cells were loaded with europium and opsonized with ChMAb. However complement, guinea pig serum, was added instead of effector cells.  shows a flow chart of the assay. Anti-CD20 ChMab over 3 orders of magnitude was titrated. % lysis was calculated. Daudi cells, (3\u00d710) were labeled with BADTA reagent. 1\u00d710cells were aliquoted into wells in a 96 well plate. Antibodies were titrated into the wells using 3 fold dilutions. The opsonization reaction was allowed to proceed for 30-40 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO. Guinea pig serum was added to a final conc. of 20% . The reaction was allowed to proceed for 3.5 hrs at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO. Subsequently, 100 uls of cell media was added to the reaction and cells were spun down. For detection 20 uls of the supernatant was added to 200 uls of the Europium solution and the plates were read in the Victor2(Wallac).","RESULTS: All mutants that show improved binding for either activating FcR or C1q were placed in the CDC assay (). Fc mutants that showed enhanced-binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIA also showed improved complement activity Each of the mutants show enhanced complement activity compared to wild type. The mutants tested are double mutants. In each case one of the mutations present is P396L.","To determine whether the increase in CDC correlated with increased binding of C1q to IgG1 Fc binding between the two proteins was measured in realtime using surface plasmon resonance. In order to examine the binding between C1q and an IgG1 Fc the Fc variants were cloned into an anti-CD32B ch-mAb, 2B6. This allowed us to capture the wt and mutant antibodies to the glass slide via soluble CD32B protein (). Three of the four mutants tested in CDC were also examined in the Biacore. All 3 showed greatly enhanced Kcompare to wild type Fc (). Biacore format for C1q binding to 2B6 mutants demonstrate enhanced binding of mutants with P396L mutation ().

Similarly, effector function can be introduced by Fc mutations. Where the wild-type antibody has no detectable effector function, Fc mutations can result in a gain-of-function phenotype.

The introduction of the mutation variant 55\/60 into RITUXIN\u2122 anti-CD20 antibody, as in 4D5, was, however, able to confer effector function to the modified antibody ().","Possible mechanisms by which the mutated antibodies were able to improve both binding and effector function were observed when the binding affinities of variant ch2B6 antibodies to Fc\u03b3RIIB were correlated with their ability to bind Ramos cells (). For example, variant 55\/60 had both the highest kand binding affinity to Ramos cells. It is theorized the limited ability of the wild-type antibody to bind Fc\u03b3RIIB is due to Fc-Fc\u03b3RIIB interaction, effectively withdrawing the additional cell surface receptors from further antibody binding. The theory was investigated by challenging opsonized Ramos cells with CD16A, an activating Fc\u03b3R. In accord with the theory, at low antigen density, Fc-engineered ch2B6, but not wild type Fc, was able bind the activating receptor ().","6.15 Effect of Light-Chain Glycosylation on Fc Binding to Fc\u03b3R and Mediation of ADCC and Compliment Activity","As demonstrated in Sections 6.8 and 6.14, Fc mutations can introduce or improve both the binding and effector function of antibodies.

Ramos cells (ATCC, CRL 1596) are maintained in culture using RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and glutamine at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO. To increase tumorigenicity of the cell line, Tumors are first initiated in female nude mice approximately 7-10 weeks old by subcutaneous injection of 1.7\u00d710Ramos cells in a volume of 0.10 ml (HBSS) using a 1 cc syringe fitted with 25 g needle. All animals are manipulated in a laminar flow hood and all cages, bedding, food and water are autoclaved. Tumor cells are passaged by excising tumors and passing these through a 40 mesh screen; cells are washed twice with 1\u00d7 HBSS (50 ml) by centrifugation (1300 RPM), resuspended in 1\u00d7 HBSS to 10\u00d710cells\/ml, and frozen at \u221270\u00b0 C. until used.","The one-passaged tumor cells from several frozen lots are thawed, pelleted by centrifugation (1300 RPM), washed twice with 1\u00d7 HBSS, and resuspended to approximately 2.0\u00d710cells\/ml in HBSS. Mice in the study groups are injected with 0.10 ml of the cell suspension (s.c.) using a 1 cc syringe fitted with a 25 g needle; injections are made on the animal's left side, approximately mid-region. Tumors will develop in approximately two weeks.","Study groups are assigned to separate study groups based on the creation of a comparable tumor size distribution in each group (average tumor size, expressed as a product of length x width of the tumor, was approximately 80 mm). 200 mg of the Fc engineered rituximab antibodies is used for treatment. The groups are treated via tail-vein injections using a 100 \u03bcl Hamilton syringe fitted with a 25 g needle.","Tumor measurements are made every two or three days using a caliper.","6.18 Clinical Studies of Fc Engineered Rituximab","Fifteen patients having histologically documented relapsed non-Hodgkins B cell lymphoma will be treated with Fc engineered rituximab in a clinical trial.

Initial rate will be 50 cc\/hr for the first hour; if no toxicity was seen, dose rate will be escalated to a maximum of 200 cc\/hr.","Toxicity (as indicated by the clinician) will be judged on a range from \u201cnone\u201d, to \u201cfever\u201d to \u201cmoderate\u201d (two patients) to \u201csevere\u201d (one patient).
