title: Correction of radar beam refraction using electro-optical measurements
abstract: A method determines the atmospheric refraction of a radar beam by utilizing a stabilized optical telescope directed toward a star near the radar target location. This allows measuring the target refraction as observed from ships at sea without a-priori knowledge of the local refraction index or weather conditions in the target area. The telescope may employ an infra-red (IR) sensor and is capable of imaging stars. The atmospheric refraction of the star light is determined by pointing the telescope based on star ephemeris data, and measuring the star image deviation from the center of the telescope's field-of-view (FOV). The corresponding refraction of the radar beam can be determined by employing a conversion factor relating the IR-to-RF atmospheric propagation characteristics. This conversion factor can be obtained by dedicated tracking measurements.

The Government has certain rights in this invention.","Radar is used for detection and tracking of distant objects. In some cases it is important to know the location of a target with great accuracy, as might be the case when tracking a hostile incoming missile (a \u201ctarget\u201d in radar parlance). Under such conditions, various factors can adversely affect the radar-indicated location of the target. Among these factors are refraction of radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic radiation by the atmosphere through which the electromagnetic signals propagate.","Traditional methods of determining atmospheric refraction include the use of a refractive index. This index can be determined based on the radar location and atmospheric conditions, and is usually available in a table. However, atmospheric conditions can change frequently, and up-to-date information may not always be available. Improved, real-time methods for determining atmospheric refraction are desired. Once the refraction is deemed to be known, the radar-indicated location of the target can be corrected for the refraction.","Improved or alternative methods are desired for determining the effects of refraction on a radar RF beam.","A method according to an aspect of the disclosure is for determining radio-frequency (RF) beam refraction in the direction of a target. The method comprises the step of determining the location of a radio-frequency target. Ephemeris information relating to a star near the expected location is obtained. An optical telescope is pointed toward the star using the ephemeris data. The deviation of the star from the boresight of the optical telescope is deemed to be an indication of the optical refraction in the direction of the location. The indicated optical refraction is converted into radio-frequency refraction.","A method according to an aspect of the disclosure is for determining radio-frequency beam refraction in the direction of a target. The method comprises the step of pre-calibrating the pointing of an optical or infrared telescope. The expected location of a radio-frequency target is determined, and ephemeris information relating to a star near the expected target location is obtained. The optical telescope is pointed toward the star near the expected target location using the ephemeris data. The image of the star is observed in the field-of-view of the optical telescope. The deviation of the star from the boresight of the optical telescope is noted, and deemed to be an indication of the optical refraction in the direction of the expected target location.

The conversion may be based on predetermined conversion factors.","A method according to another aspect of the disclosure is for correcting for radio-frequency refraction of a radar beam.

The DST is used inter alia for ship navigation, but the salient aspect of the DST  for purposes of the disclosure is the controllable infrared viewer or camera having a field of view (FOV). The camera aspect of the infrared telescope allows angle measurements to be automated, but the principles of the disclosure may be achieved with manual observations. The infrared telescope is mounted for azimuth (AZ) and elevation (EL) motion, and can be automatically pointed and maintain the pointing in the face of, or in spite of, ship motion.","In , the field of view (FOV) of telescope  is illustrated as  for the case in which the telescope line-of-sight axis  is directed toward the zenith. This is the orientation which is used to calibrate the DST telescope against systemic or systematic errors. As illustrated, a star  is illustrated as being found in the FOV  at a location spaced away from the line-of-sight intercept . The spacing of the star  from the FOV intercept point is by an azimuth amount dand an elevation amount h. If the pointing of the telescope follows the commanded pointing direction, the location of a star with known ephemeredes should be at a given location in the FOV . Any deviation from the expected location in the FOV can be considered to be a systemic error, which can be compensated for.","Also in , a field-of-view (FOV)  of the telescope  is centered about a telescope line-of-sight  which is directed toward the location, as established by ephemeris data, of a known star  which is close to the expected location of the RF target. With line-of-sight , in theory the FOV  should image the star  at its center. It must be understood that the light beam will be refracted, so there is no actual \u201cstraight line\u201d extending from DST telescope  to the star . The curved or refracted light ray is designated . The actual star  location in FOV  is spaced away from the center of the FOV by an amount which is designated h in elevation and d in azimuth. This deviation represents the optical or infrared refraction immediately adjacent the anticipated location of the RF target .
