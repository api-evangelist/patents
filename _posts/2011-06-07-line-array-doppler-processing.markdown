The Doppler effect or Doppler shift expresses the apparent change in the frequency and wavelength of an acoustic wave perceived by an acoustic receiver that is moving relative to the source of the acoustic wave. This relative motion can be caused by the movement of the emitter, the receiver or both the emitter and the receiver. For example, a receiver having velocity \u03bdrelative to a source having velocity \u03bdintroduces a Doppler shift as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["f","d"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"c","mo":"+","msub":{"mi":["v","r"]}},{"mi":"c","mo":"-","msub":{"mi":["v","s"]}}]},"mo":"."}}}}}},"The Doppler shift can be derived for a plane wave from a stationary source having a pressure field of the form p(x,t)=Pe. A stationary receiver at x=0 measures the field p(x,0)=Pe, while a receiver moving according to x=\u2212\u03bdt, i.e., opposite to the propagation direction of the plane wave, measures the field p(x,t)=Pe=Pe.","The Doppler effect produces a frequency shift when an object emitting acoustic waves is moving relative to an acoustic receiver such as a hydrophone. In the context of a sonar system, the Doppler effect is typically used only to determine the speed of the emitter along the line connecting the emitter and the receiver. When a line array of multiple receivers is used, however, there is the potential for extracting more information about the velocity of the emitter.","It is a general purpose and object of the present invention to determine the actual velocity of a moving acoustic wave emitter as detected by a line array of hydrophones.","This object is accomplished by a method of determining the Doppler shift across the entire line array of hydrophones through the use of a narrow band continuous wave pulse at a known frequency directed at a moving acoustic wave emitter, and then using the variation in the Doppler shifts across the multiple hydrophones in the array together with the a range measurement of the emitter to calculate the emitter's velocity.","Referring now to  there is illustrated an implementation of the method of the present invention, which makes use of a long line array  of N hydrophones that is part of a sonar system  (not shown) to determine the velocity v of a moving object  that is emitting acoustic waves and that is located parallel to the line array . The sonar system  will have as part of the system components signal processors and data processors capable of receiving signals from the hydrophones in line array  and performing calculations on these received signals and plotting data. In the ideal situation, when the moving object  is aligned with the center of the line array  at point x, the Doppler Shift measured at xis zero. However, the Doppler shift at the two ends (xand x) is not zero. Measurement of the frequency shift is initiated with a narrowband non-continuous wave pulse of a known frequency f.

For active sonar, the procedure involves first making contact with an object  with the line array  by pinging on it with a narrowband continuous wave pulse at a frequency f. A shorter pulse is used to estimate the distance R. A sufficient amount of data is acquired to estimate the Doppler shift. For example, if the Doppler shift is 1 Hz, approximately 1 second of continuous wave time series data is needed for resolution of the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift is then determined at the two end elements xand xof the line array . Measured Doppler shifts at the interior elements allow for confirmation of the estimate of any difference in frequency (by fitting them to a line, e.g., with a least-squares fit), leading to improved accuracy.","The advantage of the present invention over the prior art is that in sonar, normally, the motion of an object parallel to a line array can only be detected when the object moves from one beam to another.
