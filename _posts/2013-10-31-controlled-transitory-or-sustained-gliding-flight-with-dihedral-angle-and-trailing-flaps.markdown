title: Controlled transitory or sustained gliding flight with dihedral angle and trailing flaps
abstract: A micro aerial vehicle capable of controlled transitory or sustained gliding flight. The vehicle includes a fuselage. A pair of articulated wings are forward of a center of gravity of the vehicle, the wings being articulated and having trailing edge flaps, and having actuators for controlling the dihedral angles of the wings and the flaps for effective yaw control across the flight envelope. The dihedral angles can be varied symmetrically on both wings to control the aircraft speed independently of the angle of attack and flight-path angle, while an asymmetric dihedral setting can be used to control yaw and the actuators control the dihedral settings of each wing independently. The aircraft lacks a vertical tail or other vertical stabilizer.

No. 61\/726,663, which was filed Nov. 15, 2012, and which is incorporated by reference herein.","This invention was made with government support under contract number FA95500910089 awarded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. The government has certain rights in the invention.","A field of the invention is flight and flying devices, and particularly articulated wing micro aerial vehicles. Example applications of the invention include bio-inspired flight devices.","The dihedral angle is the upward angle measured from horizontal of the wings or tailplane of an aircraft. If there are multiple sections of a wing having different angles from horizontal, then the wing can be referred to as polyhedral. Wing dihedral angle is known to play a role in lateral-directional stability. In standard aircraft including almost all large commercial and private aircraft, the wings are typically set at a fixed positive dihedral angle for stability. Aircraft such as the Lockheed Martin F-104 and AV-8B Harrier use a negative dihedral (anhedral) setting for improved agility. These basic aspects have been well-studied, and are covered in many textbooks related to flight. A flexible wing deforms in a way that the effective dihedral of the wing increases. This only adds to the stabilizing effect of the dihedral. The changes resulting from flexibility have also been documented.","Unlike fixed wing aircraft, flapping wing aircraft possess the ability to change the dihedral angle on demand. An asymmetric wing setting naturally produces a yawing moment, however. Others have investigated the use of articulated wings for roll and yaw control. The approach studied has focused on controllable winglets. An example of this type of control is found in various papers published by Friswell, Bourdin et al. See, e.g., Bourdin et al., \u201cAircraft Control via Variable Cant-Angle Winglets,\u201d Journal of Aircraft, Vol. 45, No. 2, March-April 2008. In this approach, the canted winglet in the inner wing is deflected upward to induce a turn. This reduces the net lift on the inner wing to induce the desired rolling moment, while the upward deflected winglet acts like a vertical tail and produces a proverse yawing moment in response to the rolling moment. This approach requires a segmented wing, and that only the winglet be deflected. With a monolithic wing, this approach can impair turning because the side force from the deflected wing may adversely dominate the side force required for turn (in a right turn, the deflected winglet produces a leftward force, whereas a rightward force is required to sustain\/aid the turn).","Prior work by the present inventors and colleagues has advanced the state of micro aerial craft with articulated wings. Paranjape, A. A., Chung, S.-J., and Selig, M. S., \u201cFlight Mechanics of a Tailless Articulated Wing Aircraft,\u201d Bioinspiration & Biomimetics, Vol. 6, No. 2, (12 Apr. 2011) discloses a micro aerial aircraft with articulated wings and a horizontal tail (no vertical \u201ctail\u201d, and thus the reference to \u201ctailless\u201d aircraft in the title). This paper discloses that the wing dihedral can be varied symmetrically, along with the horizontal tail, to control the flight path angle independently of the fight speed. The micro aerial aircraft in the paper used dihedral angles that could be set asymmetrically for executing rapid zero sideslip turns. This work showed that the sign of the yaw moment derivative with respect to anti-symmetric dihedral depends strongly on the angle of attack and the angular rates. The primary demonstration of this work was to show that the yaw control effectiveness of the anti-symmetric dihedral depends primarily on the angle of attack, and also on the angular rates. When the angular rates are zero, the sign of the effectiveness depends on the sign (xC\/c+C), where x\/c is the non-dimensional distance between the center of gravity and the quarter-chord line. Furthermore, C<0 for wings with a positive camber, and therefore, at small angles of attack, the control effectiveness is negative and it is positive at higher angles of attack. For an intermediate range of angles of attack, the sign depends on the angular rates as well. This can cause immense problems for yaw control, particularly when the angle of attack varies across the three regions in the course of a maneuver. There was not a solution proposed for these problems in this paper. This unresolved problem had to do with yaw control effectiveness changing its sign inside the routinely flown flight envelope. The sign was seen to be sensitive to the angle of attack as well as the angular rates. Basically, every control law assumes that the sign of control effectiveness is known; if it changes sign inside the envelope and does so as a function of several variables, it is virtually impossible to design a robust, reliable controller. Thus, this paper did not provide a practical solution for a tailless micro aerial aircraft.","An embodiment of the invention is a micro aerial vehicle capable of controlled transitory or sustained gliding flight. The vehicle includes a fuselage. A pair of articulated wings are forward of the center of gravity of the vehicle, the wings being articulated and having trailing edge flaps, and having actuators for controlling the dihedral angles of the wings and the flaps for effective yaw control across the flight envelope. The dihedral angles can be varied symmetrically on both wings to control the aircraft speed independently of the angle of attack and flight-path angle, while an asymmetric dihedral setting can be used to control yaw and the actuators control the dihedral settings of each wing independently. The aircraft lacks a vertical tail or other vertical stabilizers.","An embodiment of the invention is a vertical tailless micro aerial vehicle with a pair of articulated wings. The aircraft is controlled using wing articulation, together with trailing edge flaps, for effective yaw control across the flight envelope. The dihedral angles can be varied symmetrically on both wings to control the aircraft speed independently of the angle of attack and flight-path angle, while an asymmetric dihedral setting can be used to control yaw in the absence of a vertical tail. Actuators control the dihedral settings of each wing independently, and according to the mathematical formulation of closed loop control in the attachments, to achieve controlled sustained or transitory gliding flight. The wings are set ahead of the vehicle's center of gravity. Wing dihedral alone can be varied asymmetrically to perform rapid turns and regulate sideslip. The wings include trailing edge flaps. The trailing edge flaps are deflected downwards by a predetermined minimum amount.","Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be discussed with respect to the drawings.

It follows that a positive rolling moment (wherein the lift on the left wing is higher than the right wing) is accompanied by a positive yawing moment if the wings have a positive dihedral deflection. In aircraft which lack a vertical tail, a positive rolling moment is accompanied by a negative yawing moment which leads to an increase in sideslip, with the consequence that the aircraft faces an increased drag and potential reduction in lateral-directional stability. This yawing moment which acts in a sense opposite to the rolling motion is called adverse yaw.

Even then, the flight dynamics of aircraft with articulated wings are nonlinear and non-affine-in control. However, recognition of and accounting for the following flight dynamics is used in the invention to simplify control design:","1) The pitch dynamics can be controlled entirely by the elevator, and almost always independently of the lateral directional dynamics. This is true for most aircraft, except those that lack a horizontal tail;","2) For the micro aerial vehicles of the invention, the pitch dynamics (q, \u221d) are stable. The only source instability is the lateral-directionals dynamics involving the yaw rate r and sideslip \u03b2;","3) The roll dynamics are stable, and they are not controlled directly, since the wing dihedral primarily controls yaw with very little roll control effectiveness.","With these factors in mind, the control laws are determined as follows. Consider the problem of controlling the yaw (\u03b2 and r) dynamics. For the purpose of controlling the yaw dynamics, can be cast into the following control non-affine form\n\n{dot over (\u03b7)}()=(,\u03b7(),\u03ba(),())\u2003\u2003(18)\n\n{dot over (\u03ba)}()=\u03b6(,\u03b7(),\u03ba(),(),())\u2003\u2003(19)\n","where \u03b7(t)=\u03b2(t),r(t))\u03b5represents the yaw dynamics, while u\u03b5 is the control input, viz., the asymmetric dihedral deflection (\u03b4). The term p(t) represents other control inputs, namely the elevator deflection (\u03b4) and symmetric dihedral deflection (\u03b4) which are used for longitudinal flight control. Finally \u03ba\u03b5=[V,\u03b1,p,q,\u03b8,\u03c6] represents the rolling and pitching motion, as well as translation in the plane of symmetry. The flight dynamic modes corresponding to these six states are to be stable. One of the control objectives is to stabilize \u03b7(t)=\u03b2(t),r(t) in Equation (19), and ensure that it track a desired trajectory.","In embodiments of the invention, dynamic inversion laws are simplified to provide proportional-integral (PI) or proportional-integral derivative (PID) controllers.

It has five control surfaces:","1) An elevator, which is a movable flap attached to the horizontal tail, and whose deflection is denoted by \u03b4.","2) The dihedral angles (\u03b4and \u03b4) of the outboard segments of the right and left wing can be changed independently of each other. The actuators for changing the wing dihedral angle were attached on the lower surface of the center (non-rotating) wing section, along with the radio receiver.","3) The outboard segments were equipped with flaps which are capable of being actuated independently. In the experiments, both flaps were deflected by the same amount \u03b4. Flaps are used for ensuring uniform yaw control effectiveness. These flaps, when deflected in an anti-symmetric manner, can also act as the traditional ailerons.","Both wings in the experimental aircraft can rotate from a maximum 45 deg dihedral to minimum \u221215 deg for a total arc range of 60 deg. The actuators for wing dihedral, are controlled independently on both wings. Digital actuators with a torque rating of 0.29 kg-cm are used to maneuver the wings. The time required for the wings to rotate from the minimum \u221215 deg to maximum 45 deg is about 0.05 s, and the actuators have a time-delay of 200 ms.","While not bound by this theory and not needed to demonstrate patentability, the experiments demonstrate that the invention provides what is believed to be the first perching demonstration on a laterally unstable aerial robot. In experiments, the lateral-directional motion of the aircraft was controlled actively for the entire duration of the maneuver. This complements and advances the state of the art experiments reported in the literature which were concerned almost exclusively with the longitudinal motion of stable aircraft.","The experimental aircraft used variable, asymmetric wing dihedral effectively to control the flight path as well as the heading of the aerial robot. Trailing edge flaps ensure that the wing dihedral provided uniform yaw control effectiveness across the flight envelope. The closed loop guidance laws of the invention provide perching through control developed by rewriting the equations of motion in the spatial domain and applying dynamic inversion-motivated PID control. Experiments demonstrate the ability for the aircraft to conduct controlled guided flight and perch on hand, which is a significant advance in developing micro aerial vehicles capable of close operational interaction with humans.","The above example aircraft has been flight-tested. During flight, the dihedral angles of the two wings are controlled independently of each other. A left-right asymmetry in the wing dihedral angles and\/or the force distribution on the wings leads to a net side force which, by the virtue of a non-zero distance between the aircraft center of gravity and the line of action of the force, translates into a yawing moment. Due to wing camber, the sign of the yawing moment for a given dihedral configuration depends on the angle of attack and the angular rates of the aircraft. Deflecting the trailing edge flaps on the articulated segments of the wing removes this non-uniformity.","The deflection of trailing edge flaps symmetrically in methods and aerial vehicle of the invention, achieves an increase in the sectional lift coefficient to the extent that the yaw control effectiveness is uniformly positive across the flight envelope. It is well-known that trailing edge flaps increase the sectional lift coefficient, and calculations from thin airfoil theory show that this increase in lift is much more than the increase in the magnitude quarter chord pitching moment coefficient. However this use of trailing edge flaps runs counter to intuition for improving the yaw control authority, and would have been generally viewed: flap deflection increases the wing camber which is, in principle, responsible for a non-zero quarter-chord pitching moment in the first place.","While specific embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it should be understood that other modifications, substitutions and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.
