More particularly, the present disclosure relates to margin-based optimization systems and methods in optical networks.","Optical network modeling and engineering are concerned with placing viable services (on wavelengths) into a network. Conventionally, link modeling and engineering is performed for forecast tolerant engineering, i.e., all wavelengths, in a Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) are treated equally and any wavelength placed in the network is guaranteed to work (based on the engineering), regardless of conditions, i.e. a worst-case engineering approach. The corollary to this is that initial wavelengths in new deployments will have a large amount of excess margin or wavelengths in a fully-utilized (not all wavelengths present on all links due to contention or blocking) system have excess margin. As optical networks progress, conventional transmitters\/receivers (TX\/RX), which typically utilized simple on-off keying, are evolving to advanced optical Modulators\/Demodulators (modems) with adaptable modulation formats. Other modems (e.g., cell phones, digital subscriber loop modems, cable modems, etc.) perform optimization to provide additional capacity based on current conditions. However, conventionally, optical networks have not performed optimization except for the initial viability determination during link modeling and engineering. Note, while the other modems listed above can perform their optimization with tradeoffs independently on multiple wavelengths (owing to a linear medium), optical networks must perform these optimizations for a full set of wavelengths due to nonlinear interactions in optical fiber and to ensure proper operation at worst case, i.e. full-fill. Stated differently, optical network optimization is vastly different from optimizing in the other modems described above. Additionally, optical networks can differentiate between wavelengths that may or may not need additional capacity (based on the underlying optical modem and service being transported) while the other modems seek to maximize capacity on their linear medium.","It is expected that optical network deployment will move away from up-front engineering for worst-case, end-of-life conditions towards automatic optimization for current conditions, a process that can continually run over the life of the deployment. This will provide additional opportunities for more bandwidth, without increasing capital costs, as optical equipment is run based on a current optimization rather than a forecast tolerant, end-of-life optimization. In this manner, it is important to determine systems and methods for hour-by-hour optimization of optical networks across 15+ years of change (or whatever time period the equipment is engineered and deployed to). This problem statement can be summarized as how to understand mechanisms to optimize all parameters available in highly nonlinear optical networks.","Accordingly, there is a need for margin-based optimization systems and methods based on the characteristics of optical networks and understanding how these can be used to maximize bandwidth based on current conditions.","In an exemplary embodiment, a method of optimizing capacity of an optical network includes identifying a first wavelength with an associated target capacity; determining that the first wavelength has insufficient capability to operate at the associated target capacity; and adjusting one or more wavelengths to increase capability of the first wavelength such that the first wavelength can operate at the associated target capacity. The adjusting can utilize any one of modifying average power, changing wavelength, changing modulation, and changing precompensation. The determining the insufficient capacity can be comparing one or more link parameters associated with the first wavelength to thresholds and deriving a Net System Margin. one or more link parameters are any of additive noise, Cross-Phase Modulation, Cross-Polarization Modulation, and spectral width. The one or more link parameters can be measured by a modem associated with the first wavelength. The insufficient capability can be based on any of noise margin and spectral width. The insufficient capability can be not enough to either presently meet a performance for the associated target capacity or to meet a performance for the associated target capacity at a future time. The adjusting can utilize changing modulation to achieve any one of reduced nonlinear aggression, reduced spectral width, and changed spectral shape. The method can include performing a nonlinear optimization to determine adjustments to the one or more wavelengths by modeling modem bit rate, Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR), and whether or not a signal can support additional capacity as real functions in the nonlinear optimization. The adjusting can be simulated in an application prior to operation on nodes in the optical network.","In another exemplary embodiment, a controller for optimizing capacity of an optical network a processor communicatively coupled to a network interface; and memory storing instructions that, when executed, cause the processor to identify a first wavelength with an associated target capacity, determine that the first wavelength has insufficient capability to operate at the associated target capacity, and cause or simulate adjustment of one or more wavelengths to increase capability of the first wavelength such that the first wavelength can operate at the associated target capacity. The adjustment can utilize any of modifying average power, changing wavelength, changing modulation, and changing precompensation. The insufficient capacity can be determined by comparing one or more link parameters associated with the first wavelength to thresholds and deriving a Net System Margin. The one or more link parameters can be any of additive noise, Cross-Phase Modulation, Cross-Polarization Modulation, and spectral width. The one or more link parameters can be measured by a modem associated with the first wavelength. The insufficient capability can be based on any of noise margin and spectral width. The insufficient capability can be not enough to either presently meet a performance for the associated target capacity or to meet a performance for the associated target capacity at a future time. The adjustment can utilize changing modulation to any of reduce nonlinear aggression, reduce spectral width, and change spectral shape. The memory storing instructions that, when executed, further cause the processor to: perform a nonlinear optimization to determine adjustments to the one or more wavelengths by modeling modem bit rate, Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR), and whether or not a signal can support additional capacity as real functions in the nonlinear optimization.","In a further exemplary embodiment, an optical network a plurality of nodes interconnected by a plurality of links; and a controller communicatively couple to one or more of the plurality of nodes, wherein the controller is configured to identify a first wavelength, between two of the plurality of nodes, with an associated target capacity, determine that the first wavelength has insufficient capability to operate at the associated target capacity, and cause or simulate adjustment of one or more wavelengths, on some or all links associated with the first wavelength, to increase capability of the first wavelength such that the first wavelength can operate at the associated target capacity.","In another exemplary embodiment, a method of optimizing capacity of an optical network, through intentionally reducing margin on one or more wavelengths includes identifying a first wavelength capable of using excess capacity; determining the one or more wavelengths that have extra margin; adjusting at least one of the one or more wavelengths to reduce associated margin to a nominal margin so as to increase supportable capacity of the first wavelength; and increasing capacity of the first wavelength based on the supportable capacity. The adjusting can utilize any one of modifying average power, changing wavelength, changing modulation, and changing precompensation. The reduction to the nominal margin can be based on comparing one or more link parameters associated with one or more wavelengths used to derive a Net System Margin. The one or more link parameters can be any of additive noise, Cross-Phase Modulation, Cross-Polarization Modulation, and spectral width. The one or more link parameters can be measured by a modem associated with the one or more wavelengths. The adjusting can utilize changing modulation to achieve any one of reduced nonlinear aggression, reduced spectral width, and changed spectral shape. The method can further include performing a nonlinear optimization to determine adjustments to the one or more wavelengths by modeling modem bit rate, Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR), and whether or not a signal can support additional capacity as real functions in the nonlinear optimization. The adjusting can be simulated in an application prior to operation on nodes in the optical network.","In another exemplary embodiment, a controller for optimizing capacity of an optical network, through intentionally reducing margin on one or more wavelengths, the controller includes a processor communicatively coupled to a network interface; and memory storing instructions that, when executed, cause the processor to identify a first wavelength capable of using excess capacity, determine the one or more wavelengths have extra margin, adjust the one or more wavelengths to reduce associated margin to a nominal margin amount so as to increase supportable capacity of the first wavelength, and increase capacity of the first wavelength based on the supportable capacity. The one or more wavelengths can be adjusted through any of modifying average power, changing wavelength, changing modulation, and changing precompensation. The reduction to the nominal margin can be based on comparing one or more link parameters associated with one or more wavelengths used to derive a Net System Margin. The one or more link parameters can be any of additive noise, Cross-Phase Modulation, Cross-Polarization Modulation, and spectral width. The one or more link parameters can be measured by a modem associated with the one or more wavelengths. The one or more wavelengths can be adjusted by changing modulation to any of reduce nonlinear aggression, reduce spectral width, and change spectral shape. The memory storing instructions that, when executed, can further cause the processor to: perform a nonlinear optimization to determine adjustments to the one or more wavelengths by modeling modem bit rate, Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR), and whether or not a signal can support additional capacity as real functions in the nonlinear optimization. The adjusting can be simulated in an application prior to operation on nodes in the optical network. The controller can be a Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller.","In another further exemplary embodiment, an optical network includes a plurality of nodes interconnected by a plurality of links; and a controller communicatively couple to one or more of the plurality of nodes, wherein the controller is configured to identify a first wavelength capable of using excess capacity, determine the one or more wavelengths have extra margin, adjust the one or more wavelengths to reduce associated margin to a nominal margin amount so as to increase supportable capacity of the first wavelength, and increase capacity of the first wavelength based on the supportable capacity.

The controller can be a Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller.","In yet another exemplary embodiment, a method of increasing the supportable capacity from a first point to a second point in an optical network includes identifying a first optical signal that occupies a first portion of optical spectrum from the first point to the second point; identifying a second optical signal that occupies a second portion of the optical spectrum from the first point to the second point, wherein the second portion is adjacent to the first portion; adjusting the second optical signal to minimize part of or remove all of the second portion that is adjacent to the first optical signal to provide a freed up portion of the second portion; and adjusting the first optical signal to occupy some or all of the freed up portion. The second optical signal can co-propagate with the first optical signal through a first node of the optical network and separately propagates through a second node of the optical network. The adjusting the first optical signal can be one of converting the first optical signal to a superchannel and increasing a modulation symbol rate. The adjusting the second optical signal can be one of moving the second optical signal to a disjoint portion of the spectrum from the first portion and reducing a spectral width of the second optical signal. The adjusting the second optical signal can include identifying a new path, increasing supported capacity on the new path, and transferring the freed up portion to the new path. The increasing supported capacity on the new path can be any one of reducing nonlinear effects, increasing spectral width, and increasing power. The increasing supported capacity on the new path can be achieving any one of reducing nonlinear effects, increasing spectral width, and increasing power. The new path can be partially disjoint with a route previously taken by the second optical signal. The method can further include performing a nonlinear optimization to determine adjustments to the first optical signal and the second optical signal by modeling modem bit rate, Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR), and whether or not a signal can support additional capacity as real functions in the nonlinear optimization.

The systems and methods can not only attempt to increase capacity, but also freezes capacity and even reduces optical footprint with a reduction of impact function. That is, the systems and methods propose to optimize as well as penalize (de-optimize) wavelengths for the overall benefit in the optical network, i.e., consume as much margin as possible for additional capacity where it can be harvested. The systems and methods improve specific wavelengths and penalize other wavelengths to improve overall mesh network capacity, treat modems that look the same differently based on an ability to provide additional revenue generating services by providing network capacity, apply a different optical network optimization criteria based on modem traffic carrying potential, and use optical modem traffic carrying potential as a mechanism to determine whether to improve or penalize a specific wavelength service. Note, as described herein, a wavelength, a signal, or an optical signal can be used interchangeably to denote light having been modulated to carry information over a medium within a channel or optical channel. The various optimizations described herein contemplate adjustments to the wavelength (signal) as well as to the channel (optical channel). For example, adjustments to the wavelength include changes to the parameters of the signal such as optical power, bit rate, baud rate, modulation format, etc. Adjustments to the channel include changes to the parameters associated with the path the signal traverses such as frequency spacing, amount of spectrum, amplifier\/WSS\/VOA settings, etc. That is, anything associated with the signal or the channel can be modified with the objective to carry as much data as possible given current constraints.","Key takeaways for the margin-based optimization systems and methods include: 1) networks can be more efficient than they are conventionally operated; flexible Layer 0 (photonics and modems) can be programmed to increase network capacity; advanced control, modeling and management can take advantage of the increased network capacity; and hybrid packet-optical systems can exploit the increased network capacity for additional opportunities, e.g. both guaranteed and best effort bandwidth. The margin-based optimization systems and methods can introduce equalization\/optimization into existing photonic control systems and methods.","In an exemplary embodiment, a method determining for a plurality of wavelength services in a network which support additional network capacity; computing or retrieving Required Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (ROSNR) for each of the plurality of wavelength services; and performing an equalization on the plurality of wavelength services to maximize capacity for those which support the additional network capacity.","Exemplary Optical Network","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment, a network diagram illustrates an exemplary network  with five interconnected sites , , , , . The sites  are interconnected through a plurality of links . Each of the sites  can include a switch  and one or more WDM network elements . The switch  is configured to provide services at Layers 1 (e.g., OTN\/SONET\/SDH) and\/or Layer 2 (e.g., Ethernet). The WDM network elements  provide the photonic layer (e.g., Layer 0) and various functionality associated therewith (e.g., multiplexing, amplification, optical routing, wavelength conversion\/regeneration, local add\/drop, etc.) including photonic control. Of note, while shown separately, those of ordinary skill in the switch  and the WDM network elements  may be realized in a same network element. The photonic layer and the photonic control operating thereon can also include intermediate amplifiers and\/or regenerators on the links  which are omitted for illustration purposes. The network  is illustrated, for example, as an interconnected mesh network, and those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the network  can include other architectures, with additional sites  or with less nodes sites, with additional network elements and hardware, etc. The network  is presented herein as an exemplary embodiment for the margin-based optimization systems and methods.","The sites  communicate with one another optically over the links . The sites  can be network elements which include a plurality of ingress and egress ports forming the links . Further, the nodes  can include various degrees, i.e. the site is a one degree node, the sites , are two degree nodes, the site is a three degree node, and the site is a four degree node. The number of degrees is indicative of the number of adjacent nodes at each particular node. The network  includes a control plane  operating on and\/or between the switches  at the sites , , , , . The control plane  includes software, processes, algorithms, etc. that control configurable features of the network , such as automating discovery of the switches , capacity of the links , port availability on the switches , connectivity between ports; dissemination of topology and bandwidth information between the switches ; calculation and creation of paths for connections; network level protection and restoration; and the like. In an exemplary embodiment, the control plane  can utilize Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON), Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS), Optical Signal and Routing Protocol (OSRP) (from Ciena Corporation), or the like. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the network  and the control plane  can utilize any type control plane for controlling the switches  and establishing connections therebetween.","Service routing in the control plane  is well known. A path (e.g., a subnetwork connection (SNC) or label switched path (LSP)) is considered valid for connection setup based on the availability of the switch , the links , and sufficient bandwidth available thereon. Photonic networks, i.e. Layer 0 and the wavelength interconnectivity of the WDM network elements , introduce additional complexity of successfully setting up a service up. This can require that all Layer 0 services are pre-planned and\/or managed manually. For example, potential paths for services at the photonic layer can be pre-planned by modeling them offline using a static snapshot of the network state to ensure that the computed paths are optically viable in terms of reach, nonlinear effects, dispersion, wavelength contention\/blocking, etc. Here, the forecast tolerant engineering ensures that each wavelength placed into service will work in a worst case Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR) leading to potential excess margin.","The network  can include photonic control  which can be viewed as a control plane and\/or control algorithm\/loop for managing wavelengths from a physical perspective at Layer 0. In one aspect, the photonic control  is configured to add\/remove wavelengths from the links in a controlled manner to minimize impacts to existing, in-service wavelengths. For example, the photonic control  can adjust modem launch powers, optical amplifier gain, variable optical attenuator (VOA) settings, wavelength selective switch (WSS) parameters, etc. In the systems and method described herein, the photonic control  is adapted to also perform network optimization on the links . This optimization can also include re-optimization where appropriate. In the systems and methods, the photonic control  can adjust the modulation format, baud rate, frequency, wavelength, spectral width, etc. of the modems in addition to the aforementioned components at the photonic layer.","The network  can also include a Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller . SDN allows management of network services through abstraction of lower level functionality. This is done by decoupling the system that makes decisions about where traffic is sent (SDN control through the SDN controller ) from the underlying systems that forward traffic to the selected destination (i.e., the physical equipment in the network ). Work on SDN calls for the ability to centrally program provisioning of forwarding on the network  in order for more flexible and precise control over network resources to support new services. The SDN controller  is a processing device that has a global view of the network . Additionally, the SDN controller  can include or connect to SDN applications which can utilize the data from the SDN controller  for various purposes. In an exemplary embodiment, the SDN applications include a margin optimization application which is described in detail herein.","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment, a logical network diagram illustrates the network  of  with the links  logically shown carrying various wavelengths. The links  are shown with an optical fiber  which can include any type of optical fiber. For example, the optical fiber  can include a useable optical spectrum of 1530 nm to 1565 nm (C-Band). Of course, other spectrums are contemplated. The optical fiber  can be a flexible grid, a fixed grid, or a combination across the optical spectrum. Thus, each of the links  and their associated optical fiber  can support a fixed or variable number of wavelengths  (wavelengths can also be referred to as optical signals). The wavelengths  traverse a channel which carries an underlying service between two of the sites  in the network. Each of the wavelengths  is formed by optical modems at two sites  where the channel is added\/dropped (or regenerated). Since the network  is an interconnected mesh, the wavelengths  may be different on each of the links . Parameters associated with each of the wavelengths  can include\u2014A-Z path in the network, spectrum allocation (e.g., fixed spectrum, flexible spectrum, amount of spectrum, location on the spectrum, etc.), modulation format, baud rate, FEC parameters, optical power, etc.","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment, a logical network diagram illustrates a subset of the network  showing the sites , , , and three exemplary wavelengths -, -, -. In the subset , there is a fiber - connecting the sites , , a fiber - connecting the sites , , and a fiber - connecting the sites , . The wavelengths -, - are between the sites , and through the fibers -, - with an express through at the site , and the wavelength - is between the sites , through the fibers -, - with an express through at the site . The site includes modems -, -, the site includes modems -, -, -, and the site includes a modem -. Thus, the wavelength - is formed by the modems -, -, the wavelength - is formed by the modems -, -, and the wavelength - is formed by the modems -, -. The various wavelengths -, -, - can carry any type of traffic such as, without limitation, Optical Transport Network (OTN), SONET, SDH, Ethernet, Frame Relay, IP, MPLS, and the like as well of combinations thereof.","Generally, Wavelength Selective Switches (WSSs) and the like are essentially a polychrometer device with multiple output\/input ports. Individual wavelengths (i.e., signals) can be switched by such a device and relatively sharp roll-offs can be achieved. That is, the WSS may be utilized to provide a demultiplexer function. The WSS can provide significantly improved roll-off portions from other technologies such as arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) or thin film filters (TFFs), however a significant dead band is still needed for the WSS to separate two signals. In contrast, coherent modems can separate signals in the electrical domain which eliminates almost all of the dead band. Advantageously, through such a configuration, deadbands or guardbands may be reduced or eliminated.","Superchannels","In an exemplary embodiment, using concatenated optical spectrum transmission systems and methods and a flexible grid, wavelengths may be configured to group A-Z demands together and place signals in the spectrum going on the same path without deadbands between the channels in the same path. In this manner, such a grouping can be referred to as a \u201csuperchannel.\u201d The superchannel grouping is an exemplary technique that may be used by the margin-based optimization systems and methods to achieve more bandwidth (higher spectral efficiency) at the expense of routing constraints.","Generally, one optical modem is associated with the optical signal which is the result of modulating an electrical signal onto one optical carrier. That electrical signal may have a single carrier such as with a single Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) stream of QPSK symbols, a plurality of carriers such as with Nyquist Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM), or a very large number of carriers such as with Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM).","In the more straightforward applications, one optical modem communicates a bidirectional digital service from a first geographic location to a second geographic location. A superchannel can be formed by grouping into a contiguous region of optical spectrum the signals from a plurality of modems that are all following the same path.","The \u201cradio ROADM\u201d technique can be used to coherently multiplex and then demultiplex a superchannel at a plurality of geographic locations, while the superchannel is switched as a single entity by the intermediate WSS.","In an exemplary embodiment, each modem  is tunable so that it can selectively generate a wavelength centered at a desired carrier wavelength (or frequency). In exemplary embodiments in which tunable modem  are used, the wavelength range of each modem  may be wide enough to enable the modem  to generate any wavelength in the optical spectrum. In other exemplary embodiments, the wavelength range of each modem  may be wide enough to enable the modem  to generate anyone of a subset of wavelengths in the optical spectrum. The modem  may be configured to use any of duo-binary, quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), differential phase shift keying (DPSK), differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK), orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), polarization multiplexing with any of the foregoing, and any other type of coherent optical modulation and detection technique. It is understood that for electronic channel discrimination, a tunable Rx is required. In nQAM and nPSK it is achieved using a linear receiver, i.e. a receiver where frequency mixing is taking place between a local oscillator and the incoming signal. The Local Oscillator (LO) needs to be tuned at the right frequency such that the mixing product can be at base band where all the necessary filtering will occur. If a receiver is not operating like above, it requires a tunable optical filter prior to the optical detector.","Modems","The margin-based optimization systems and methods recognize the ability of each of the wavelengths  to be optimized is based on 1) the underlying modem's  abilities to adjust and 2) the service's need being carried by the wavelength . The modems  can be classified as either supporting additional capacity or requiring a fixed capacity based on the functionality of the modem . For example, the modems  can support various different baud rates through software-programmable modulation formats. The modems  can support programmable modulation, or constellations with both varying phase and\/or amplitude. In an exemplary embodiment, the flexible optical modem can support multiple coherent modulation formats such as, for example, i) dual-channel, dual-polarization (DP) binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) for 100 G at submarine distances, ii) DP quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) for 100 G at ultra long haul distances, iii) 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) for 200 G at metro to regional (600 km) distances), or iv) dual-channel 16QAM for 400 G at metro to regional distances. Thus, in an exemplary embodiment, the same modem  can support 100 G to 400 G. With associated digital signal processing (DSP) in the modem  hardware, moving from one modulation format to another is completely software-programmable.","In another exemplary embodiment, the modem  can support N-QAM modulation formats with and without dual-channel and dual-polarization where N can even be a real number and not necessarily an integer. Here, the modem  can support non-standard speeds since N can be a real number as opposed to an integer, i.e. not just 100 G, 200 G, or 400 G, but variable speeds, such as 130 G, 270 G, 560 G, etc. These rates could be integer multiples of 10 Gb\/s, or of 1 Gb\/s. Furthermore, with the DSP and software programming, the capacity of the flexible optical modem can be adjusted upwards or downwards in a hitless manner so as to not affect the guaranteed rate. In other exemplary embodiments, the modem  can include hardware which lacks the aforementioned functionality and thus supports a single modulation format\/baud rate which cannot be adjusted (but other parameters can be adjusted like power, spectrum location, etc.). Additionally the modems  can tune and arbitrarily select spectrum; thus no optical filters are required. Additionally, the modem  can support various aspects of nonlinear effect mitigation and dispersion compensation (both for chromatic and polarization mode) in the electrical domain, thus eliminating external dispersion compensation devices, filters, etc. Modems can also adapt the forward error correction coding that is used, as another method to trade-off service rate vs noise tolerance.","In general, the bit rate of the service provided by a modem is proportional to the amount of spectrum occupied, and is a function of the noise tolerance. As shown in the examples of , more bits communicated generally means less noise tolerance.","In addition to the modem  functionality, the optimization can be based on the service's need being carried by the wavelength . For example, a time-division multiplexed (TDM) service being offered at a fixed capacity may have no requirement to increase its bandwidth. On the other hand, a packet service may need to expand to support more bandwidth, etc. Of course, the packet service could be carried in a TDM service, e.g., Ethernet over ODUflex. For example, in the subset , assume the wavelengths -, - are carrying a service which does not need additional capacity or the modems -, -, -, - are incapable of adjusting capacity upwards in the field. Also, assume the wavelength - is a service that can take advantage of additional capacity, such as by changing the modulation format, increasing baud rate, etc. Again, conventional engineering of the wavelengths -, -, - focuses on forecast tolerance\u2014will the wavelength  work at worst case (e.g., full-fill and under end-of-life operating conditions). In this example, assume the wavelength - cannot adjust upwards because of the wavelengths -, -, the margin-based optimization systems and methods propose techniques to optimize these wavelengths -, -, - such that the wavelength - can use additional capacity at the expense of the margin of the wavelengths -, -.","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment, a graph illustrates three exemplary configurations of the modem  showing relative noise tolerance (dB) versus bits per dual polarization symbol. Additionally, a line illustrates the Shannon capacity. For illustration purposes herein, the modems  are assumed to support 50 GB\/s with BPSK, 100 GB\/s with QPSK and 200 GB\/s with 16QAM, all with the same hardware, i.e. software provisionable. Also, as described above, the modems  can achieve other rates such as in-between 50 GB\/s, 100 GB\/s, and 200 GB\/s as well as below 50 GB\/s and above 200 GB\/s. This is illustrated with a dotted line in .","The modems  can include coherent receivers which require no optical dispersion compensation or optical filters (multiplexers and demultiplexers). Also, the modems  can support advanced Performance Monitoring (PMs) for feedback such as Bit Error Rate (BER), Polarization Dependent Loss (PDL), Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD), and the like to provide accurate modeling of optical characteristics. The modems  include coherent transmitters which can provide spectral shaping allowing for more efficient spectrum use and flexible grid placement. Also, the coherent transmitters support software selectable modulation format, providing more bits\/s\/Hz.","Wavelengths that are spaced closer together provide improved spectral efficiency, as discussed. However, nonlinearities such as Cross-Phase-Modulation (XPM) generally cause greater degradations when there is less channel separation for walk-off. This will reduce the capacity of each channel. As described herein, a channel or optical channel refers to the medium, including switching, filters (WSSs), etc., which are set up in a network to carry a signal or optical signal between two points. A signal or optical signal refers to light having been modulated to carry information which traverses the medium within the channel. Also, a wavelength is sometimes used to mean signal or optical signal. Note, sometimes the term channel is equated to a signal or wavelength, through an implied one-to-one correspondence. The term superchannel, as used herein, is used to mean multiple signals traversing a single channel. Superchannel can also be used to refer to a channel, typically wider in frequency than is normally used for one signal, which carries multiple signals.","A higher power in a given signal (wavelength) will improve its optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR). However, higher powers also cause stronger nonlinear effects which are generally degradations to the signal itself and to other signals. Optical amplifiers, or other optical elements, may limit the average total output power from that element.","At a given power, a higher Baud rate signal will generally cause less XPM. The modulation applied to the signal can be designed to induce less nonlinear degradation in the other signals present on the fiber, generally at a cost of a portion of the bitrate or noise tolerance of that modulation.","Depending upon the type of fiber, and any optical dispersion compensation present, higher Baud rates or lower Baud rates will be advantageous for minimizing self phase modulation (SPM), at a constant composite average power level.","Some kinds of fibers, such as Dispersion Shifted (DS) fiber generate severe degradations due to Four Wave Mixing (FWM), as a strong function of the wavelength locations relative to the fiber dispersion zero.","The separation between channels can be squeezed to be less than the Baud rate, and the inevitable resulting linear intersymbol and interchannel interference reduces the system margin. DSP methods such as MLSE or multiple channel co-detection can be used to mitigate some of this reduction. Optical CDMA methods attempt to superimpose multiple wavelengths onto the same spectrum.","Metrics","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment, a diagram illustrates a dashboard  showing metrics associated with the optical network . The margin-based optimization systems and methods require various metrics to determine where optimization is needed. With the modems , an associated controller communicatively coupled to the modems  is configured to compute real-time margin, an estimation, prediction, and\/or calculation, showing non-linear impairments, link loss, dispersion, error rates, etc. This information is provided to the photonic control  and\/or the SDN controller . The photonic control  uses the information to set associated parameters including per channel power, amplifier gain, etc. An associated SDN application can be used to adjust and optimize various optimization metrics to see how noise can be allocated in the network  to improve capacity.","The dashboard  can be implemented in the SDN application, an EMS, an NMS, etc. to provide instant feedback on the state of the network  based using the various optimization metrics. In this exemplary embodiment, the dashboard  presents four metrics\u2014health, throughput, excess bandwidth (BW), and Net System Margin (NSM). Health gives an operator a view of non-blocked restoration paths, how resilient the network  is to failures, and restorability in the network . Throughput shows how much data is being transported in the network , i.e. how much client traffic. The excess bandwidth shows how much excess capacity is available, e.g. if only 10 GB\/s is provisioned on a 100 Gbs line, there is 90% excess.","The margin-based optimization systems and methods can include a Net System Margin (NSM). Note, even in a \u201ccritically\u201d designed network, it is normal to have excess margin since the network is designed for full-fill, end of life, fixed modulation formats, safety margin (user defined with such things as fiber repair and ageing etc.), etc. (i.e., forecast tolerant). Of note, most of a network's life is spent in a condition which has fewer wavelengths and fewer impairments. Therefore, there is extra margin in most operating conditions and this extra margin can be mined to turn it into capacity to support even more revenue generating services. The NSM shows the operator a view of the excess margin available in the network . The NSM can be dB\/OSNR and provide a view of how much more noise can be handled until the FEC limit. As an analogy, NSM can be viewed as gas in an automobile gas tank. If there is leftover gas, the automobile (the network ) can still travel further.","Guaranteed capacity can be defined as that amount that would be present under worst-case, end of life, full fill conditions, and Excess capacity is defined as the amount of additional capacity which can be achieved \u201cright now\u201d with acceptable margin. With the margin-based optimization systems and methods can include a throughput=total of Guaranteed+Excess; Excess BW=amount exceeded of Guaranteed (in %).","Optimization Metrics","In various exemplary embodiments, the margin-based optimization systems and methods contemplate using various optimization metrics to adjust the NSM such that the throughput is maximized. The various optimization metrics can be viewed as \u201cknobs\u201d which can be turned having an associated effect on the dashboard . The optimization metrics include anything that is adjusted with the modems  and\/or the photonic control . The optimization metrics can be applied to a single wavelength, multiple wavelengths, and\/or all wavelengths, and different techniques can be applied to different wavelengths.","The following is a non-limiting exemplary list of optimizations:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Increasing\/Decreasing launch power"},{"entry":"Modifying wavelength"},{"entry":"Modifying modulation format including, for example, changing the"},{"entry":"coding, shaping, power balance, polarization balance, and\/or"},{"entry":"precompensation"},{"entry":"Changing precompensation"},{"entry":"Increasing\/Decreasing spectral width"},{"entry":"Increasing\/Decreasing spectral shape"},{"entry":"Increasing\/Decreasing spectral spacing"},{"entry":"Adjusting wavelengths across an interconnected mesh for optimization"},{"entry":"Creating superchannels"},{"entry":"Adjusting amplifier and\/or VOA settings"},{"entry":"Changing baud rate (which also could change the spectral width, but"},{"entry":"does not have to)"},{"entry":"Changing FEC parameters (more FEC overhead increased performance,"},{"entry":"but lowers client data rate)"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"A good metric captures what is important to the customer in their particular optical network, and is amenable to optimization as discussed below under \u201cAlgorithm\u201d.

The flexible grid or gridless spectrum allows for more dense packing of channels, but comes at a cost to margin due to channel interference, i.e., can pack channels closer together, but the wavelengths cannot go as far, and can reduce their power to reduce interference, but not below the required OSNR. Specifically, the first spectrum  illustrates channels with more frequency separation and hence higher OSNR whereas as second spectrum  illustrates the same channels packed denser with lower OSNR. The second spectrum  can be a fixed grid or a flexible grid\/gridless spectrum with less frequency separation between the channels.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0153"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0154"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 4","FIG. 9"]},"Finally,  illustrates a margin-based optimization process that can use an estimate or measurement of NSM each signal has, and penalize signals who cannot use their margin for the benefit of others.

In the event of a failure of a signal that is stretched to the limit, attempt to use excess bandwidth in other signals to provide restoration capacity.","For example, assume  includes the wavelengths -, -, - and  is the optical spectrum for the fiber -.

The time  shows an intermediate point in the margin-based optimization, and the time  shows an end point in the margin-based optimization.","Margin-Based Optimization Method","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment, a flow chart illustrates a margin-based optimization method . The margin-based equalization method  can be implemented in the network , via the modems , with the photonic control , the SDN controller , etc. as well as in other networks and components. The margin-based equalization method  includes, for a given network of wavelength services, determining which of the modems  could provide additional network capacity (bandwidth) and can actually use the additional capacity (typically a switched node with packet services, but not limited to a switched node.) Each of the wavelength services is categorized as either margin_increase or margin_decrease (step ).","Next, the margin-based equalization method  computes or retrieves, for each service, its current Required OSNR (ROSNR) and computes or retrieves its forecast tolerant ROSNR (step ). The ROSNR is the OSNR currently required, based on current network conditions, to provide the service whereas the forecast tolerant ROSNR is the OSNR required, based on worst case network conditions to provide the service. The OSNR measurements can be automatically provided through the modems  as described herein.","Next, the margin-based equalization method , for all margin_increase services, computes current ROSNR and computes its forecast tolerant ROSNR for current and higher capacity services and determines constraints of the optical line system (step ). Note, this step can be constrained to compute values only for services the modem  can carry as well if it is either system limited or switch limited. Next, the margin-based equalization method , for every margin_decrease service, computes current ROSNR and computes its forecast tolerant ROSNR for current and alternate modulation schemes that provide equivalent capacity (step ).","The margin-based equalization method  can include the customer or system setting a minimum safety margin to stay away from target ROSNR, and the customer or system determining what ROSNR target margin to optimize each service against (current network, forecast tolerant or some other network metric) (step ). In the margin-based equalization method , decreasing OSNR can be achieved, for example, by changing optical power, altering spectral occupancy on the spectrum, and\/or altering a modulation scheme. Thus, the margin-based equalization method  can include, for every margin_decrease service well above its target OSNR for an alternate modulation scheme with a smaller optical footprint, performing an adjustment or marking for adjustment its OSNR by altering spectral occupancy and\/or modulation scheme. In the margin-based equalization method , improving OSNR can be achieved, for example, by changing optical power, altering spectral occupancy, and\/or altering a modulation scheme.","The margin-based equalization method  performs a loop which includes: for every margin_increase service not able to achieve its highest capacity and not at max target output power, applying a small increase to OSNR (e.g. increase power 0.5 dB); for every margin_decrease service with an OSNR greater than the target ROSNR, applying a small decrease to OSNR (e.g. decrease power 0.5 dB); computing or retrieving SNR for all services; noting whether each current OSNR supports a higher capacity and marking for adjustment; providing a small improvement to OSNR for margin_decrease services if needed; if no margin_increase service was able to improve its OSNR, then the method  stops; and continue looping until all adjustments are less than a nominal hysteresis factor (e.g. 1 dB) or a maximum number of iterations is reached (e.g. ) (step ).","If the computed adjustments were performed with an offline tool (not on a live system), then with user intervention or an appropriate interval or time-of-day, the margin-based equalization method  can include implementing adjustment of the services. The offline tool can be the SDN application. Also, as demand profiles change or system conditions change, then the margin-based equalization method  can be rerun.","Optimization Application and Exemplary Operation","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment, a network diagram illustrates a network  with an interconnected photonic mesh of nodes A-K.

More generally, they are nonlinear, discrete, or piece-wise continuous. And then there are the optical nonlinear effects.","The margin-based optimization systems and methods can also include optimization of the optical nonlinear effects. The basic idea is to employ a multi-channel, non-linear aware, link modeling routine as part of an objective function for optimization. In addition, one could include the channel capacity as a continuous function (e.g., modem\/transponder modeled Shannon Limit) in the objective function. After the optimization, one would then choose the nearest, better margin, option for the modulation\/encoding. Once all of the inputs are cast in continuous functions, one can run a non-linear multi-variable optimizer with constraints (e.g., sequential quadratic programming).","Sequential quadratic programming (SQP) is an iterative method for nonlinear optimization. SQP methods are used on problems for which the objective function and the constraints are twice continuously differentiable. SQP methods solve a sequence of optimization sub-problems, each of which optimizes a quadratic model of the objective subject to a linearization of the constraints. If the problem is unconstrained, then the method reduces to Newton's method for finding a point where the gradient of the objective vanishes. If the problem has only equality constraints, then the method is equivalent to applying Newton's method to the first-order optimality conditions, or Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, of the problem. SQP methods have been implemented in many packages, including NPSOL, SNOPT, NLPQL, OPSYC, OPTIMA, MATLAB and SQP.","Convex optimization eliminates the differentiability constraint. Genetic algorithms, and other such heuristics, side-step the need for analysis of the problem space.","It is often useful in nonlinear optimization to be able to model various system parameters as fully defined real functions. (More precisely: having compact support.) Examples of such are continuous functions and piece-wise continuous functions of real variables; as opposed to only being defined upon integer values. Specifically, modem bit rate, OSNR, even whether or not a signal can support additional capacity, etc. can be chosen to be modeled as real functions. One can transform the nonlinear optimization problem into something which is solvable by a given type of algorithm by expressing all inputs to the objective function in a way that meets the constraints of that method. (e.g. locally convex, piece-wise continuous, differentiable, or doubly differentiable.) A unique aspect here, with the advent of the optical modems described herein, is that one of the inputs is the capacity of the channel using those modems, which approximately follows parallel to Shannon's limit. For the purpose of this optimization, one could just ignore the granularity of the bit-rate adjustment, and transform it to a fully defined real function which can be fed into the optimizer. Then, after achieving a solution, one could just pick the nearest implemented point in the modem.","Depending upon the problem definition and the transformation chosen, optimization methods such as these can be used:","Non-convex methods\n\n","Convex methods that may be applicable to sub-problems\n\n","Stochastic programming","Nonlinear programming","Heuristics\n\n","Some simplifying assumptions can be made to constrain the inputs to the algorithms such as, for example, no optical dispersion compensation, specific fiber parameters, digital precompensation and post compensation of dispersion, maximum span losses between amplifiers, Erbium-doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFA) with optional Raman counter-propagating preamplifiers, homogeneous model of the EDFAs including ripple and tilt and ignoring spectral hole burning and polarization hole burning, coherent transmission systems, only consider Self-Phase Modulation (SPM) and Cross-Phase Modulation (XPM)\u2014no cross-polarization modulation or Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) that grow along the amplified line on a linear basis rather than on a power basis, digital precompensation to mitigate some of the SPM, complete power control on a 6.25 GHz granularity, the required E\/N(the energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio) does not change within a product family as a function of Baud rate, wavelengths can be considered as at most two disjoint subsets, set A and set B, with priorities or specs or capacities defined for each, control and transient effects can be lumped into simple margin offsets or can be modeled as a statistical uncertainty on the per channel power, line maintenance, temperature, and aging effects will be ignored, predictions from a model of the margin for unequipped wavelengths have a specified inaccuracy (Gaussian mean zero in dB), measured margin from a deployed signal will have noise and small magnitude discontinuities or hysteresis such as 0.1 dB, and the margin available in any one signal is a function of both the power of that signal and the powers of other WDM signals that share at least part of the optical path. Under these assumptions, the Poggiolini model is a reasonable approximation to the XPM nonlinearity.","There is a fine granularity set of shaped modulations that trade-off capacity vs. Gaussian noise tolerance. Beyond the tolerance to \u201ctotal Gaussian noise\u201d expressed as E\/N, different modulations have different tolerances to phase noise from XPM based upon their constellation. The contribution of XPM to the total Gaussian noise depends upon the carrier recovery bandwidth, which is proportional to the Baud rate. Simplified curves can be provided for this. Different modulations have different levels of aggression as interferers on other WDM signals, as a function of the amount of shaping that is present. Simplified curves can be provided for this.","In an exemplary embodiment, the minimum optical spectrum that one modem signal requires is 8\/7 of the Baud rate, and which can be varied from 5 GBaud to 100 GBaud in 5 GBaud increments.","Capacity Boosting Method","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment, a flow chart illustrates a capacity boosting method .

Here, the first wavelength is carrying some service such as a packet service that can use excess capacity. The method  includes determining the one or more wavelengths have extra margin (step ). The excess margin can be based on the NSM described herein. The method  includes adjusting the one or more wavelengths to reduce associated margin to a nominal margin amount so as to increase supportable capacity of the first wavelength (step ). For example, the nominal margin can be 3-5 dB. The method  includes increasing capacity of the first wavelength based on the supportable capacity (step )).","The adjusting can utilize any of modifying average power, changing wavelength, changing modulation, and changing precompensation.

The first optical signal is identified based on needing additional capacity, and the identification can be through any of the various algorithms described herein. The method  includes identifying a second optical signal that occupies a second portion of the optical spectrum from the first point to the second point, wherein the second portion is adjacent to the first portion (step ). Here, the second optical signal can be viewed as preventing future growth of the first optical signal. The method  includes adjusting the second optical signal to minimize part of or remove all of the second portion that is adjacent to the first optical signal to provide a freed up portion of the second portion (step ); and adjusting the first optical signal to occupy some or all of the freed up portion (step ).","The second optical signal can co-propagate with the first optical signal through a first node of the optical network and can separately propagate through a second node of the optical network. The adjusting the first optical signal can be one of converting the first optical signal to a superchannel and increasing a modulation symbol rate. The adjusting the second optical signal can be one of moving the second optical signal to a disjoint portion of the spectrum from the first portion and reducing a spectral width of the second optical signal. The new path can be a third portion of the optical spectrum, which is disjoint from the first portion. The adjusting the second optical signal can be identifying a new path; increasing supported capacity on the new path; and transferring the freed up portion to the third path.

The increasing supported capacity on the new path can be any of reducing nonlinear effects, increasing spectral width, and increasing power. The new path can be partially disjoint with a route previously taken by the second optical signal. The method can further include performing a nonlinear optimization to determine adjustments to the first optical signal and the second optical signal by modeling modem bit rate, Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR), and whether or not a signal can support additional capacity as real functions in the nonlinear optimization. Optionally, the adjusting is simulated in an application prior to operation on nodes in the optical network. Also, the method can be implemented in a controller or in an optical network.","In another exemplary embodiment, a method of increasing the supportable capacity from a first point to a second point in an optical network includes identifying a first optical signal that occupies a first portion of optical spectrum from the first point to the second point; identifying a second optical signal occupying a second portion of optical spectrum that co-propagates with the first signal through a first element of the optical network, and separately propagates through at a second element of the optical network; identifying a third path; increasing the supportable capacity of the third path; transferrin at least a portion of the traffic from the second optical signal to the third path; freeing up at least a portion of the second optical spectrum through the first element; changing the first optical signal to occupy at least some of that freed up-portion; and increasing the capacity of the first optical signal.","The change to the first optical signal cam include the addition of a carrier to a superchannel or an increase in modulation symbol rate. Increasing the supportable capacity of the third path can include a reduction of nonlinear effects, an increase in spectral width, and\/or an increase in optical power. The third path can include a route that is at least partially disjoint with the route of the second optical signal. The third path can include a portion of the spectrum that is least partially disjoint with the portion of the spectrum occupied by the second optical signal. The transferring at least a portion of the traffic can include moving the wavelength of the second optical signal to the third path, moving the second optical signal away from the first element, reducing the traffic carried by the second optical signal, or increasing the traffic carried by a third optical signal. The freeing up at least a portion of the spectrum can include reducing the spectral width of the second optical signal or moving the wavelength of the second optical signal.","Planning Wavelength Assignments","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment, a flow chart illustrates a method  of planning wavelength assignments in a WDM mesh optical network, such as the network , . The method  includes identifying a first pair of endpoints where there is an expectation of the traffic demand between those endpoints being greater than that which can be directly carried on one carrier (step ) and allocating spectrum between those endpoints for a first superchannel (step ). The allocated spectrum has a significant frequency separation from other superchannels and a signal between a second pair endpoints occupies spectrum between the first superchannel and another superchannel. Optionally, the allocated spectrum is not presently occupied by signals. A signal that at least partially overlaps the allocated spectrum can be moved or removed within a month or can remain for longer than a month.","The expected traffic demand can be greater than that which can be directly carried on three carriers or a reasonable maximum of what may occur from now until the end of a planning window. The amount of traffic which can be directly carried on one carrier is the amount that equipment presently used in the network could reliably carry between the endpoints on one carrier. The superchannel allocation has room for a plurality of modulated carriers or room for a broader modulation than presently exists between those endpoints. The significant frequency separation can be approximately the maximum possible given an anticipated number of superchannels. Optionally, the first superchannel is the only superchannel between the first endpoints.","Minimizing the Cost of a WDM Mesh Optical Network","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment, a flow chart illustrates a method  of minimizing the cost of a WDM mesh optical network. The method  includes identifying a pair of endpoints (step ); identifying a plurality of optical signals between those endpoints (step ); adjusting the modulation of a first set of the optical signals to increase its traffic capacity (step ); moving at least a portion of traffic from a second set of the optical signals to the first set (step ); and deleting one of the plurality of optical signals from the second set (step ). The method  can include improving wavelengths in the first set. The improving can include altering a third optical signal, raising the power, and\/or increasing the spectral width.","Adjustment of the modulation of the first set can be controlled remotely by the endpoints. The portion of traffic can be all of the traffic on the second set, and the second set can be deleted. Optionally, another portion of traffic from the second optical signal is moved to a third optical signal. Deleting one the plurality of optical signals can include switching to distinct endpoints, switching the wavelength of the signal, shutting down an output of a transmitter, etc.","Exemplary Network Element","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment, a block diagram illustrates an exemplary network element  for use with the systems and methods described herein.

Commonly-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14\/176,908, filed Feb. 10, 2014, and entitled, \u201cSYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR MANAGING EXCESS OPTICAL CAPACITY AND MARGIN IN OPTICAL NETWORKS,\u201d the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein, describes various exemplary techniques for managing the new capacity provided by the margin-based optimization systems and methods in the network , . In an exemplary embodiment, a method for managing the excess capacity includes determining excess margin relative to margin needed to insure performance at a nominal guaranteed rate associated with a flexible optical modem configured to communicate over an optical link; causing the flexible optical modem to consume most or all of the excess margin, wherein capacity increased above the nominal guaranteed rate in the flexible optical modem comprises excess capacity; and mapping the excess capacity to one or more logical interfaces for use by a management system, management plane, and\/or control plane. This leverages the POTS capability as a L0, L1, and\/or L2 device which can create excess capacity at LO using the various techniques described herein and logically mapping this excess capacity in L1 and\/or L2 for additional opportunities.","Shelf Controller","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment, a block diagram illustrates a controller  to provide control plane processing and\/or operations, administration, maintenance, and provisioning (OAM&P) for the network element . The controller  can be part of common equipment, such as common equipment  in the network element , or a stand-alone device communicatively coupled to the network element  via the DCN . The controller  can include a processor  which is a hardware device for executing software instructions such as operating the control plane. The processor  can be any custom made or commercially available processor, a central processing unit (CPU), an auxiliary processor among several processors associated with the controller , a semiconductor-based microprocessor (in the form of a microchip or chip set), or generally any device for executing software instructions. When the controller  is in operation, the processor  is configured to execute software stored within memory, to communicate data to and from the memory, and to generally control operations of the controller  pursuant to the software instructions. The controller  can also include a network interface , a data store , memory , an input\/output (I\/O) interface , and the like, all of which are communicatively coupled therebetween and with the processor .","The network interface  can be used to enable the controller  to communicate on the DCN , such as to communicate control plane information to other controllers, to the management system , to the SDN controller , and the like. The network interface  can include, for example, an Ethernet card (e.g., 10BaseT, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet) or a wireless local area network (WLAN) card (e.g., 802.11). The network interface  can include address, control, and\/or data connections to enable appropriate communications on the network. The data store  can be used to store data, such as control plane information, provisioning data, OAM&P data, measured metrics, etc. The data store  can include any of volatile memory elements (e.g., random access memory (RAM, such as DRAM, SRAM, SDRAM, and the like)), nonvolatile memory elements (e.g., ROM, hard drive, flash drive, CDROM, and the like), and combinations thereof. Moreover, the data store  can incorporate electronic, magnetic, optical, and\/or other types of storage media. The memory  can include any of volatile memory elements (e.g., random access memory (RAM, such as DRAM, SRAM, SDRAM, etc.)), nonvolatile memory elements (e.g., ROM, hard drive, flash drive, CDROM, etc.), and combinations thereof. Moreover, the memory  may incorporate electronic, magnetic, optical, and\/or other types of storage media. Note that the memory  can have a distributed architecture, where various components are situated remotely from one another, but may be accessed by the processor . The I\/O interface  includes components for the controller  to communicate with other devices. Further, the I\/O interface  includes components for the controller  to communicate with the other nodes, such as using overhead associated with OTN signals.","In an exemplary embodiment, the controller  is configured to communicate with other controllers  in the network ,  to operate the control plane for control plane signaling. This communication may be either in-band or out-of-band. For SONET networks and similarly for SDH networks, the controllers  may use standard or extended SONET line (or section) overhead for in-band signaling, such as the Data Communications Channels (DCC). Out-of-band signaling may use an overlaid Internet Protocol (IP) network such as, for example, User Datagram Protocol (UDP) over IP. In an exemplary embodiment, the controllers  can include an in-band signaling mechanism utilizing OTN overhead. The General Communication Channels (GCC) defined by ITU-T Recommendation G.709 are in-band side channels used to carry transmission management and signaling information within Optical Transport Network elements. The GCC channels include GCC0 and GCC1\/2. GCC0 are two bytes within the Optical Channel Transport Unit-k (OTUk) overhead that are terminated at every 3R (Re-shaping, Re-timing, Re-amplification) point. GCC1\/2 are four bytes (i.e. each of GCC1 and GCC2 include two bytes) within the Optical Channel Data Unit-k (ODUk) overhead. In the present disclosure, GCC0, GCC1, GCC2 or GCC1+2 may be used for in-band signaling or routing to carry control plane traffic. Based on the intermediate equipment's termination layer, different bytes may be used to carry control plane signaling. If the ODU layer has faults, it has been ensured not to disrupt the GCC1 and GCC2 overhead bytes and thus achieving the proper delivery control plane signaling. Other mechanisms are also contemplated for control plane signaling.","The controller  can be configured to operate the control plane in the network , . That is, the controller  is configured to implement software, processes, algorithms, etc. that control configurable features of the network , , such as automating discovery of the nodes, capacity on the links, port availability on the nodes, connectivity between ports; dissemination of topology and bandwidth information between the nodes; path computation and creation for connections; network level protection and restoration; and the like. As part of these functions, the controller  can include a topology database that maintains the current topology of the network ,  based on control plane signaling and a connection database that maintains available bandwidth on the links again based on the control plane signaling. Again, the control plane is a distributed control plane; thus a plurality of the controllers  can act together to operate the control plane using the control plane signaling to maintain database synchronization. In source-based routing, the controller  at a source node for a connection is responsible for path computation and establishing by signaling other controllers  in the network . For example, the originating node and its controller  can signal a path through various techniques such as Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) (G.7713.2), Private Network-to-Network Interface (PNNI), Constraint-based Routing Label Distribution Protocol (CR-LDP), etc. and the path can be signaled as a Designated Transit List (DTL) in PNNI or an Explicit Route Object (ERO) in RSVP-TE\/CR-LDP. As described herein, the connection refers to a signaled, end-to-end connection such as an SNC, SNCP, LSP, etc. Path computation generally includes determining a path, i.e. traversing the links through the nodes from the source node to the destination node based on a plurality of constraints such as administrative weights on the links, bandwidth availability on the links, etc.","In an exemplary embodiment, the controller  can be configured to compute, calculate, estimate, store, etc. the metrics based on data from the modems . The controller  can store these metrics in the data store  and\/or provide the metrics to external devices such as the SDN controller  via the network interface . The metrics can be updated periodically as well to provide current, up-to-date information about the photonic layer.","SDN Controller\/Service for the Application","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment, a block diagram illustrates s server .

The local interface  can have additional elements, which are omitted for simplicity, such as controllers, buffers (caches), drivers, repeaters, and receivers, among many others, to enable communications. Further, the local interface  can include address, control, and\/or data connections to enable appropriate communications among the aforementioned components.","The processor  is a hardware device for executing software instructions.

The data store  can include any of volatile memory elements (e.g., random access memory (RAM, such as DRAM, SRAM, SDRAM, and the like)), nonvolatile memory elements (e.g., ROM, hard drive, tape, CDROM, and the like), and combinations thereof. Moreover, the data store  can incorporate electronic, magnetic, optical, and\/or other types of storage media. In one example, the data store  can be located internal to the server  such as, for example, an internal hard drive connected to the local interface  in the server . Additionally in another embodiment, the data store  can be located external to the server  such as, for example, an external hard drive connected to the I\/O interfaces  (e.g., SCSI or USB connection). In a further embodiment, the data store  can be connected to the server  through a network, such as, for example, a network attached file server.","The memory  can include any of volatile memory elements (e.g., random access memory (RAM, such as DRAM, SRAM, SDRAM, etc.)), nonvolatile memory elements (e.g., ROM, hard drive, tape, CDROM, etc.), and combinations thereof.

The SDN controller  can also include an Application Programming Interface (API) which allows additional applications to interface with the SDN controller  for data associated with the optical network. In an exemplary embodiment, the application  can be implemented on the server  (or on the server  operating as the SDN controller ) and receive data through the API. Other configurations are also contemplated.","Additionally, it will be appreciated that some exemplary embodiments described herein may include one or more generic or specialized processors (\u201cone or more processors\u201d) such as microprocessors, digital signal processors, customized processors, and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and unique stored program instructions (including both software and firmware) that control the one or more processors to implement, in conjunction with certain non-processor circuits, some, most, or all of the functions of the methods and\/or systems described herein.
