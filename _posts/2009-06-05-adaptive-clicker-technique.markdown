Many modern classrooms now employ polling to increase student participation and interest. Polling can also be designed to collect instant feedback from students, so a teacher can adapt the teaching pace.","Most classroom polling systems have students use personal response system \u201cclickers\u201d to respond to poll questions. A personal response system is one which allows instructors to pose questions to students which students can answer by entering a response into their clicker device.","There are many types of clicker devices employed in personal response systems to date. For example, hardware clicker devices exist which typically have a keyboard with or without a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). These hardware clicker devices also have a receiver which is typically either an infrared (IR) receiver or a radio frequency (RF) receiver. Infrared receivers typically operate via line of sight and have a more limited range than RF receivers. Infrared receivers are not portable, and typically have to be installed in a class room. RF receivers are more popular and can support a larger number of clickers than can an IR receiver.","Besides hardware clicker devices, virtual clicker devices also exist. Virtual clickers are created by installing clicker software on a laptop computer or other computing device which lets the device act as a clicker device. For example, most virtual clickers employ a web-based poll response keypad that is downloadable from a web or other site. Virtual clickers do not need a receiver because typically a web service is used to send a response to a poll question over the Internet. With the revolution of mobile technology and the increasing penetration of laptops and mobile phones among students, it has become popular to use mobile devices as virtual clickers for polling in schools.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","In general, the adaptive clicker technique described herein provides a standardized polling control and registration system to support mixed types of clickers and integrate polling data. The adaptive clicker technique employs a polling controller. The polling controller allows multiple different types of clickers to be used by a software polling application without having to write hardware specific software for each type of clicker device. The polling controller also provides program interfaces for applications (e.g., application programming interfaces or APIs) to communicate with each other using polling data and can integrate the polling data with a Learning Management System or Service if so desired.","More specifically, one general embodiment of the adaptive clicker technique operates as follows. User inputs from more than one type of clicker device (e.g., personal interactive response system device) are obtained or received, for example, in response to polling. The inputs from the more than one type of clicker device are formatted with a clicker adapter for each type of clicker device to adapt the user inputs to a common polling controller. The adapted inputs are then processed with the common polling controller to interface the adapted inputs with a personal response system software application to allow user polling data to be collected.","In the following description of embodiments of the disclosure, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which are shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the technique may be practiced. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the disclosure.","In the following description of the adaptive clicker technique, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part thereof, and which is shown by way of illustration examples by which the adaptive clicker technique may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Although there are many types of clicker devices used for polling currently there is no standardized polling service which can support disparate types of clickers at the same time. Current polling services currently can support only one type of clicker device.","Additionally, most current polling services and systems require registration for a clicker device to be used with the system. When students are registered with a system, a teacher can assign credit for participation and use the data in other manners. To date, different clickers have totally different registration systems and no systems can support mixed clicker types.","The adaptive clicker technique provides a standardized polling control and registration system to support mixed types of clickers. The adaptive clicker technique employs a polling controller. The polling controller allows multiple different types of clickers to be used by a software application that employs polling without having to write hardware specific software for each type of clicker device. The polling controller also provides program interfaces for applications to communicate with polling data and can integrate the polling data with a Learning Management Service or System (LMS) if so desired. For example, the typical LMS is used for delivering, tracking and managing training. Learning management systems can manage training records and distribute courses over a network, such as, for example, the Internet. The polling controller can also provide program interfaces for managing attendance, class participant and assessment.","Although much of the following description presents the applicability of the adaptive clicker technique with respect to an education system, it should be noted that the technique is not limited to only the educational realm. For example, the technique could equally well be applied to an enterprise space.","The adaptive clicker technique provides a multi-device adapter model for talking to disparate clickers. In one embodiment of the technique, this adapter model 1) gets the readiness of clicker receiver; 2) gets the name of the clicker receiver; 3) gets the properties of the poll data; 4) initiates poll start\/end messages and 5) updates poll data.","The adaptive clicker technique also provides easy to use APIs for adding polling to applications. In one embodiment these APIs include 1) set session name; 2) start polling; 3) end polling; 4) get poll data; and 5) set\/update poll data.","The adaptive clicker technique also can employ a device registration interface (for example, a user interface with a device registration page) that allows clicker devices to be registered and provides functionality to interface with a Learning Management System if desired. This device registration interface: 1) submits poll data to a LMS; 2) gets class ID; 3) get student name; 4) get device ID and 5) get LMS ID, as well as providing other functionality.","An exemplary schematic of overview of one embodiment of the adaptive clicker technique is shown in . As shown in , one embodiment of the technique employs a personal response system software application  that can be used for polling users using clicker devices or clickers, commonly termed personal interactive response devices. The clicker devices are used to respond to poll questions issued by the software application . These clickers can come in many types such as virtual clickers on laptop computers  or other mobile devices . Traditional RF or IR clickers  or a cell phone  can also be employed as clicker devices. Each of these types of clickers have some type of receiver ,  or service  that allows these types of clickers to communicate with a computing device  (to be discussed later with respect to ) which hosts the software application  that issues the polling.","In the one embodiment of the adaptive clicker technique described herein the inputs received from the clicker devices , , , , as received from the receivers ,  or service  can interface with device drivers ,  that would typically be provided with that type of device to interface the device to a computing device . The inputs from the clicker devices, are input into clicker adapters , , , one for each type of clicker device.

The technique also includes a registry  which includes a list of all of the clicker devices registered with the system along with clicker ID and optionally user ID. The poll data is stored in a poll data database  and can also be sent to a LMS if so desired.","The following paragraphs describe an exemplary architecture  in which the adaptive clicker technique can be practiced. As shown in , the architecture  employs a personal response system software application module  that includes a module to create a poll  that is used by a teacher or other poll administrator to start and stop a poll which is responded to by users' clicker devices , , . The software application  also includes a device registration page  where users , ,  register their clicker devices. Such registry information  can include, for example, a student's class ID, name, clicker remote ID, if the software application interfaces with a greater learning management system, a learning management system ID. Additionally, if the software application  interfaces with a learning management system , the software application  or a polling controller  can submit the poll results  to the learning management system.","The software application  starts and ends a poll by sending start and end poll messages through a polling controller  and to the clicker devices , ,  via their receivers ,  or web service , and applicable device drivers. Users , ,  respond to the poll questions via their respective clicker devices , , . The clicker device responses are input into a set of respective clicker adapters, , ,  which convert the clicker device inputs , ,  from the different types of clickers into a common format compatible with the polling controller . It should be noted that there can also be more than one type of clicker device for a given clicker hardware device, such as, for example and IR clicker or RF clicker. The types of clickers would also have their own adapter type. The polling controller  reformats the outputs from the adapters ,  and  to be in a format usable by the software application  and stores the data in the poll result database . This poll result data can also be made accessible to the learning management system via interface .","One general embodiment  of a process for employing the adaptive clicker technique is shown in . This embodiment  operates as follows. User inputs from more than one type of clicker device (e.g., personal interactive response system device) are obtained, as shown in block . The inputs from the more than one type of clicker device are formatted with a clicker adapter for each type of clicker to adapt the user inputs to a common polling controller, as shown in block . The adapted inputs are then processed with the common polling controller to interface the adapted inputs with a personal response system software application to allow user polling data to be collected, as shown in block .","Another exemplary embodiment  of a process for employing the adaptive clicker technique is shown in . In this embodiment of the technique, one or more clickers of different types are registered in a registry, each clicker being associated with a different clicker ID and user ID, as shown in block . A poll is started from a personal response system software application, as shown in block . A poll input is received from a clicker device, as shown in block . This poll input is associated with a clicker device ID and a user ID. The poll input from the clicker is formatted with a clicker adapter associated with the type of clicker to interface the poll input with a common polling controller, as shown in block . The polling controller is used to format the adapted poll input to be assessed by the personal response system software application, as shown in block . The clicker ID can be used to identify the clicker user by using the registry. The poll is then stopped by the personal response software application, as shown in block . At this point the poll results can be assessed and\/or forwarded to a learning management system for assessment, as shown in block . For either assessment by the LMS or by the software application, the poll results can be associated by student or user ID. Additionally, the poll data format or one embodiment is also described.","An exemplary architecture and exemplary processes of the technique having been described the following paragraphs describe details and various embodiments of the technique. The application programming interfaces (APIs) of one exemplary embodiment of the adaptive clicker technique are described in greater detail, as is the format of the polling data.","The adaptive clicker technique provides various APIs to support the polling controller and clicker adapters.

This format for one embodiment of the adaptive clicker technique is shown in . The polling controller  provides various APIs to the poll data database. These can include, for example, the \u201ccreate poll data\u201d , \u201cupdate poll data\u201d , \u201cdelete poll data\u201d  and \u201cget poll data\u201d  APIs. An exemplary table of poll data stored in the poll data database  is also shown in . The table includes the question ID , and device ID  and an associated response . Optionally a student ID could be added to this table or the student ID could be obtained from the registry by cross-correlating the student ID with the clicker ID.","In one embodiment the adaptive clicker technique provides a clicker device registration page. For example, in one embodiment, the device registration page is used to collect and act on information related to a LMS. Such information could include, for example, means to 1) submit poll data to LMS; 2) get class ID; 3) get student ID; 4) get student name; 5) get device ID; and 6) get LMS ID.","The adaptive clicker technique is designed to operate in a computing environment.
