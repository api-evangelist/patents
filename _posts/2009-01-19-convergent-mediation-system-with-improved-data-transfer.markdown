{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION","DEFINITIONS","BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a U.S. National Stage patent application of PCT\/F12009\/050044, which designated the United States, filed Jan. 19, 2009 which claims priority to European Patent Application No. 08150558.8, filed Jan. 23, 2008, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/006,639, filed Jan. 24, 2008, the entire disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.","The present invention relates to convergent mediation systems.","Convergent mediation systems are computer systems operating between a source system and a target system. A typical example of the source system is a telecommunications network and a typical target system is an OSS\/BSS (Operations Support System\/Business Support System) system of a telecom operator.","The present invention relates particularly to a method, system and computer program product of mediating data records made in communication networks. The present invention is especially suitable for billing and charging calls and services used in communication networks. The billing and charging can be done simultaneously for both pre-paid and post-paid methods. The term convergent mediation specifically refers to the applicability of the method and system for both pre-paid and post-paid charging.","The increasing demand for tailored life style services in the telecom domain is changing the service landscape. Telecom service providers must rethink their offering to create a service palette that their subscribers can control and manage in real time. As a vital link in the supply chain for these services, Operations Support Systems (OSS) must also be flexible and convergent. The main driver for convergence comes naturally from the need to maximise the business potential by the implementation of service and payment convergence, that is, unifying the service offering to all subscribers independently of the payment type (prepaid or postpaid).","In order to achieve service and payment convergence, service providers have to face and solve many technical challenges. Firstly, there is the challenge of network convergence; new networks being implemented along side of the old ones. Service providers' infrastructure very often comprises different vendors' equipment and various protocols, creating challenges of vendor and technology convergence, that is, the need to integrate with different protocols, standards and several vendors' equipment. With service and payment convergence, an increasing number of service providers are also facing the challenge of billing system convergence; the challenge of handling all services, payment and account types, and rating of services with their often complicated system setups.","Thus, one of the technical challenges is the requirement to provide low latency time for prepaid processing.","Another challenge is the reliability of the convergent mediation system: No data should be lost even in error situations.","The above-mentioned two challenges set contrary requirements to the convergent mediation system and therefore constitute a real technical problem. An extremely reliable system appears to be slow such that the latency time is unacceptable. And vice versa, streamlining the data handling processes to shorten the latency time of the system tends to weaken the reliability.","The prior art discloses several convergent mediation solutions that can meet the above challenges with varying degrees of success.","Convergent mediation solutions in the market are typically real-time collection based systems that are integrated with legacy pre-paid systems. These \u2018convergent solutions\u2019 are mainly a collection of different sets of known devices and systems. An example of such a system is described in .","Traditional off-line mediation, also called as billing mediation, solution contains functionalities like collection of usage data from network elements, aggregation, conversion of data format to unified format, correlation, etc. This all has been ready for years and most likely will be used for years to come.","On the other hand, online mediation solutions are used, for example for charging the non-voice services of prepaid customers, executing charging for a multimedia session between a mobile terminal and a remote host on both an application\/media level and on an IP\/access bearer level, and for minimizing credit losses caused by subscribers, while at the same time maintaining good performance of the system.","Also the traditional IN-based Prepaid Systems have been designed for charging the voice calls of prepaid customers. Already today prepaid subscribers form the majority of the total worldwide customer base and they want to be able to use the same services as the postpaid users. Until now, the lack of open, real-time charging solution has been slowing down the service deployment for prepaid subscribers.","In a preferred online mediation solution an end user session management, especially for charging, is required. In most of the prior art systems, operations requiring faster end user session charging cannot be performed, and operations desiring faster end user charging are performed inconveniently. An example of operations that require faster end user session charging is online service offered to an unknown subscriber. An example of an operation that is performed inconveniently is one where subscriber has to give one's credit card number to unreliable host for charging Internet purchases.","Patent application publication WO 2004\/095326 discloses a real-time and continuous off-line mediation method for event records generated by telecommunications network.","Patent application publication WO 2005\/027409 discloses an online charging method in communications network.","Patent application publication EP 1761021 A1 discloses one kind of convergent pre- and post-paid billing architecture. The principle idea of EP 1761021 is that pre- and post-paid billing systems are combined together with rating and customer management facilities.","Patent application publication WO 2007\/020499 discloses an online charging management server used with account management system. These kinds of solutions are also determined by different standardisation organisations like 3GPP, ETSI, etc.","Patent application publication WO 2007\/002577 discloses a converged off-line and converged online charging systems with a common rating and charging gateway function.","It is an object of the present invention to create a new convergent mediation system and method that solve the technical problem of providing both reliability and low latency time for data processing.","According to an aspect of the invention, these objects are achieved by providing a convergent mediation system that comprises a plurality of independent processing nodes adapted to form processing streams for the online processing and off-line processing of data. Each of the processing streams comprises at least two independent nodes in sequence and buffers between the nodes. Furthermore, random access memory is utilized such that at least one of the buffers in each of the online processing streams is formed by a dedicated memory area in the random access memory.","According to another aspects of the invention, there is provided a convergent mediation method, wherein the data processing in an online processing stream includes passing data from a preceding node in the steam to the succeeding node in the steam via said buffer formed by the dedicated memory area in the random access memory.","According to the present invention, there is also provided a computer program product for running a mediation system in accordance with the above-described method.","The present invention makes it possible to construct a convergent mediation system that can simultaneously provide a low latency time and very good reliability of online processing. Division of the mediation process into a plurality of part processes in independent processing nodes contributes to both reliability and processing speed. This is because the possible errors are localized to particular independent part processes in the respective nodes. At the same time, the system is scalable as the number of independent processing nodes can be increased in order to meet increasing processing load, for instance. Furthermore, even the possible problems caused by such localized error points are minimized by means of buffering the data between the processing nodes using a low latency buffering mechanism utilizing random access memory.","The inventive concept allows also several useful and advantageous embodiments, which provide further advantages.","For example, it is possible to provide all of said independent processing nodes on a single platform such that both online processing and off-line processing is performed on one common platform. In such an embodiment, the processing power of the platform can be allocated to the respective processes according to their needs such that the system can offer both a low latency time for online processing and a high throughput for off-line processing. Furthermore, the common-platform embodiment provides the above benefits without compromising interoperability and ease of administration of the system. Indeed, the prior are problems with interoperability and administration of the system can be alleviated by these embodiments as there is only one platform for both of said processing types. Consequently, there is not anymore need to administrate two or more different processing platforms and try to guarantee their interoperation.","An embodiment of the invention providing a node manager that can start up new nodes, when required, offers scalability to the mediation system.","Invention offers also embodiments that can be operated continuously once started, because all of the configurations can be made while the system is on production.","The invention allows even such embodiments that overcome all the challenges of different types of billing, charging and payment convergence. These embodiments help the service providers to differentiate in highly competitive markets by offering smooth evolution of the current networks\u2014and BSS\/OSS\u2014environments into a fully convergent solution, with the best-of-breed components for convergent mediation solutions.","Furthermore, there are embodiments that are designed for rapid deployment and fast adaptation to new demands. These embodiments enable service providers to launch new and exciting services to the market fast while assuring accurate charging. These embodiments provide reliable usage collection and charging that ensure that the subscribers can be satisfied with the accuracy of their bills or their credit management. A system according to the embodiments is scalable and works equally well irrespective of whether the service provider has 10 000 or 100 million subscribers.","According to embodiments, a further advantage is that the mediations system may play a pivotal role both in revenue assurance and in fraud detection. These embodiments can ensure that all usage data is collected and charged online accurately, which is fundamental to a mobile service provider's revenue generation. Online capabilities are required to close the revenue leakage that is caused by, e.g. hot billing based solutions. There are also embodiments with provisioning capabilities that help also reduce fraud, especially in a prepaid environment, thus reducing service provider losses. As mobile services and technologies evolve, so too should charging models be tailored to a diversifying range of individual needs. There are also embodiments that meet new requirements, for example in the migration path to 3G, 4G, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA), IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), Voice over IP (VoIP), IP group calls, Push-To-Talk (PTT), content service sessions, multiplayer interactive game sessions, etc.","According to an embodiment of the invention, the convergent mediation is processed within a truly one platform. Any distinct processing platforms or devices are not needed. An advantage of this embodiment is that operators' need not to process and support several different billing and charging platforms that may be very difficult to adapt together. Today's convergent platforms in the market are integrated collections of existing billing, legacy prepaid and account management systems. Typically convergent mediation solution in the market can handle network convergence by supporting multiple access networks (e.g. mobile, fixed and broadband) and related services but does not support payment convergence (e.g. online and offline mediation) with the same platform. The present invention offers embodiments that provide a truly one, solid and efficient convergent mediation platform for online and offline mediation that supports all kinds of billing and charging applications, i.e. online cost control, IP prepaid, Rating and Balance Management. Furthermore, the convergent mediation system according the embodiment that is powered with the truly one technology platform can give extremely reliable, scalable and vendor independent environment with high throughput, high availability and low latency facilities for both online and off-line processing.","According to further embodiments, operators' can handle very cost efficiently their billing and charging though the network and OSS\/BSS is complex. One aspect of an embodiment of the invention is that the platform is totally and continuously controlled by the system manager which also divides the system capacity to online and off-line sub processes.","By means of embodiments, the operators and service providers are able in a very innovative way to construct several billing and charging services for their customers, e.g. offering balance management services for subscribers. An example of such balance management services is that the pre-paid account is used first and after it is empty, the charge is made to postpaid. Business logic for this service is managed by the mediation solution. Another example of balance management service is that the convergent mediation solution uses both pre-paid and post-paid methods parallel so that, e.g. access is charged by postpaid but all or some of the services is charged by pre-paid.","As is apparent from the above disclosure, the present invention can be applied in a great variety of applications requiring fast and reliable processing of both online data and off-line data.","Event, event record, call detail record, usage record, transaction or service request are the items of data, or data items, equivalently processed in convergent mediation. Event is a transaction occurring in a telecommunications network or a service delivery platform, for instance. One event may contain all the information needed in e.g. account management or billing. Typically in modern networks where events are generated by all or most of the network elements, an event contains only a part of the information needed in e.g. account management or billing. Events are typically caused by actions taken by a subscriber while using telecommunication services. Events may also be based on actions taken by the telecommunication network or equipment connected to it, while executing telecommunications services. Some events may be even generated automatically while executing service programs and performing other functions for providing services to the customers.","Off-line mediation: Off-line mediation manages batch and real-time data streams and controls data collection, storing and processing routines for data items obtained from a communication network or from a service delivery platform. An efficient embodiment of an off-line mediation implementation can operate between any two systems that need to communicate with each other but are not directly integrated with one another. In most cases, the implementation operates between the communications network producing usage data and the destination OSS\/BSS systems utilising this information framework, such as billing systems, fraud management systems and statistical analysis systems.","Online mediation: Interactive connectivity between communications network elements or service delivery platforms and Business Support Systems. One transaction in an online mediation environment is, for instance, a request-response message pair. An efficient embodiment of an online mediation implementation can use delivery control functionality and mid-session online metering for different control nodes. In an online mediation, processing of the data is performed before or during the user session or service usage. The mediation system prepares a response on the basis of the processed data and sends the prepared response to the system providing services to the user. This response is sent during, or preferably before, the user session or service usage. In other words, the term online mediation means that a response to a request is given during, or preferably before, the requested service is provided.","Convergent mediation: A single solution for collecting and processing of usage data, and managing service usage and charging for data items obtained from a communication network and\/or a service delivery platform. The solution supports the processing of usage data in batch, real-time collection and online transactional modes. Service management and charging are supported online over a transactional interface. Network usage data and service management can be leveraged consistently from all voice and data services for end user with multiple applications including service control, rating, balance management, cost control, prepaid, billing, charging, interconnect, marketing and service assurance, for instance.","Communication network: Communication network includes all network elements in access and core networks as well as service delivery systems or platforms, which are involved in service delivery for end-customer. Access network can be mobile, fixed, broadband, cable network with any technology. Service delivery can be related to any services including voice, data, video, messaging and content services.","The embodiment of  described below provides a totally new kind of convergent mediation system  that has been especially designed for simultaneous online  and off-line  processing of streams of data items, such as event records, transactions and service requests. Usage data flows through the mediation solution as individual data items, which are passed to billing, traffic engineering, network planning, balance management, fraud detection and\/or other OSS\/BSS systems. The embodiment of  ensures that the OSS\/BSS systems can be sure that their operations are based on accurate real-time information.","The billing system  receives event records from the convergent mediation system  in an instantly billable form. The convergent mediation system  allows various applications like Rating, Service Catalog and Policy Control . Billing can be based for example on volume, content value, QoS (Quality of Service) or time, or any combination of these. This applies also to other applications like rating, balance management and cost control. The convergent mediation system  enables charging for content and MMS services (Multimedia Messaging Service) by being capable of transmitting usage data for example from MMSC (Multimedia Messaging Service Center), content proxies and application servers. It enables also usage-based billing of VPNs (Virtual Private Network) and Internet connections, allowing for example charging on the basis of QoS and bandwidth. With aid of Service Catalog function  online rating of different and even complex product bundles is possible in the convergent mediation system . Policy Control  enables dynamic controlling mechanism in IMS and other broadband services. Typically the Policy Control provides dynamic bandwidth assignments for the data sessions. Another typical use case is access control to certain sites based on subscriber profile. Furthermore together with Service Catalog  the convergent mediation system provides powerful Policy Control which empowers operators to design their service offering efficiently.","Online mediation , off-line mediation  and various charging options and other functionalities  are processed and controlled by one common platform  including all the needed functionalities for processing data.","Real-time usage information allows OSS\/BSS systems  to see in real-time what services subscribers have used and how the network resources are being used. This information can be analysed to find more competitive tariff structures and reduce customer churn. It can also help in defining end-user characteristics and planning how to better serve individual customers. Convergent Mediation applications such as balance management for customers' cost and credit control and fraud detection can use the information for controlling service usage.","The convergent mediation system  according to the embodiment has been designed to interface  with any network element in access and core network and service delivery systems  and to serve any OSS\/BSS system . It can be used for both packet and circuit switched networks by all types including GSM, CDMA, 3G, 4G, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA), IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), Voice over IP (VoIP), IP group calls, Push-To-Talk (PTT), content service sessions, multiplayer interactive game sessions. Convergent Mediation can be used by any type of operators including Network Operator, Service Provider, Virtual Network Operator (VNO) as well as Virtual Network Enablers (VNE). It provides numerous off-the-shelf standard and proprietary interfaces  to different OSS\/BSS systems. The convergent mediation system  can handle any type of records generated by different types of network elements . Furthermore, the embodiment can handle and process these records despite differences in their structure or delivery method.","Embodiments of the invention relate to a convergent mediation system  for online processing  and off-line processing  of data obtained from a communications network  and\/or a service delivery platform .","Generally speaking, in one of the general embodiments the convergent mediation system  comprises a common platform  for both of said online processing  and off-line processing  of data, and a system controller  adapted to dynamically allocate the processing power of the common platform  for the online processing  and off-line processing  of data. When both online  and off-line  processing are performed on a single platform , the processing power of the platform may be directed to the use of online processes  and off-line processes  according to the needs defined by the amount of data to be processed. This means also that the same hardware can be used for both of said processing types. As the online processing  aims at low latency, the online processing  capacity should be sized according to the estimated peak load. On the contrary, off-line processing  is not so time-critical but should preferably be very efficient in terms of throughput. In the embodiment using a single software platform and common hardware resources, it is possible to utilize some of the processing power both for online processing  during peak load times and for off-line processing  during off-peak times. Thus, there is no more need to dimension the hardware resources according to the peak-requirements of both online  and off-line  processes and it is possible to save in investment.","In another of the general embodiments, the convergent mediation system  comprises a plurality of independent nodes ,  adapted to form processing streams  for the online data and off-line data. Each of the processing streams  comprises at least two independent nodes ,  in sequence and a buffer  between each of the sequential nodes , . In the embodiment at least one, but preferably all, of the buffers  in the online processing streams  are formed by dedicated memory areas in random access memory. This embodiment provides fast processing, which is still very fail-proof.","In a further general embodiment, the convergent mediation system  comprises a plurality of independent nodes ,  adapted to form processing streams  for the online data and off-line data. In this embodiment, each of the processing streams  comprises at least two nodes ,  in sequence such that the first node in each of the online processing streams  is an online interface node , which is adapted to receive online data from the communications network  and send a response to the communications network . Furthermore, the system  is adapted to selectively form the content of the response to the communications network  in an online processing stream . This embodiment can provide an online stream  such that at least part of the processing is performed before the system responds to the network  or service delivery platform . A significant advantage provided by such an online stream  over a conventional real-time mediation is that there is no fraud window left due to the mediation system latency time, as the service fulfilment continues only after said delayed response that is given after the response from the online processing stream .","The above general embodiments are independent from each other but can be used all in the same convergent mediation system as well. These general embodiments, or any combination thereof, can be complimented with one or several further embodiments and system features which are described in the following.","In an embodiment, each of the independent nodes ,  comprises a node application  and a node base . The node application  contains the logical rules according to which the independent node ,  processes the data obtained from the communication network  and the node base  is adapted to provide basic functionalities for the processing node , . The node applications  and node bases  are typically software components running in a computer system including a host or a plurality of hosts.","In an embodiment, the basic functionalities provided by the node base  include external interfaces of the processing node ,  and an interface to the node application .","In an embodiment, the node bases  of all of the independent nodes ,  are identical to each other. This embodiment contributes to a truly one platform architecture  as all of the node applications  are running on top of identical node bases .","In a corresponding fashion, the system can also include a group or groups of processing nodes ,  having also their node applications identical to each other.","According an embodiment, the system  comprises at least one online processing stream , which includes at least three independent nodes ,  in sequence and buffers  between each of the sequential nodes ,  such that the buffers  are formed by dedicated memory areas in at least one random access memory.","According a further embodiment using an online interface node , the system  is adapted to perform an access control operation when selectively forming the content of the response to the communications network  or the service delivery platform . The selectively formed content of the response is adapted to signify either a positive clearance allowing the communications network to provide a service or a negative clearance preventing the communications network  from providing the service. In an embodiment, the online interface node  is responsive to the received online data to forward it to the next node in one of the online processing streams  and wait for a response from the online processing stream  before sending the response to the communications network .","The system can also be provided with an off-line interface node , which is used as the first node in at least one of the off-line processing streams . This kind of an off-line interface node  is adapted to collect off-line data from the communications network  in the form of event records. Furthermore, the system can be provided with combined interface nodes ,  capable of both receiving data and collecting data. Then, the combined interface node preferably includes a routine for identifying the type of processing (online or off-line) required by the obtained data in order to select a proper stream to which to forward the data for processing. In an embodiment providing separate nodes ,  for receiving data for online processing  and collecting data for off-line processing , the system's interfaces  have already been configured to perform the selection of the processing type on the basis of the route of incoming data.","In an embodiment, the system comprises an internode transport layer including the buffers  between each of the sequential nodes , . Such an internode transport layer can comprise a plurality of buffers , which can be sockets, shared random access memories and\/or disk memories. In such embodiments, it is preferable that the basic functionalities of the node base  includes an interface to the internode transport layer allowing the processing node ,  to read data from at least one of the buffers  and write data in at least one of the buffers . Furthermore in an embodiment, the node applications  and the internode transport layer are independent from each other.","In a further embodiment using the internode transport layer, the system is adapted to process an item of data under processing in a processing stream  such that the internode transport layer keeps a copy of the item of data in a preceding buffer  until a corresponding item of data has been successfully written in a succeeding buffer  in the processing stream . Thus, the system  is adapted to remove any data from the buffer  only after successfully performing the processing operation in the succeeding processing node ,  in the processing stream . This prevents data losses due to process failures in the system . This is because the system  can, in case of a processing node shut-down, replace the shut-down node in the processing stream  with a new processing node , , which starts to process the data in the preceding buffer .","The system  has further embodiments also in view of the dynamical allocation of the processing power. In this context, the dynamical allocation may occur instantly or may be performed during certain intervals depending on the embodiment used. Such intervals may be during each night, once a week or once a month, for instance. The system  may also be provided with triggers triggering the dynamical allocation or re-allocation. The triggered allocation can be done instantly or performed during the next expected off-peak time of the system, for instance. In a preferred dynamical allocation embodiment, the system  performs the allocation or re-allocation automatically without human intervention under the control of the program components of the system. Embodiments utilizing directions of a human operator are also possible.","In an embodiment with dynamic allocation, the allocation is controlled by a system controller , which is a computer process run in the mediation system . In an embodiment, the functions of the system controller , or at least part of them, are performed by a Node Manager  described in greater detail in context of specific examples part of this document.","In an embodiment, the system controller  is adapted to prioritize the online processing  of data over the off-line processing  of data when allocating the processing power of the common platform . This provides for the low latency for the online processing .","In a further embodiment, the system controller  is adapted to monitor  a reception rate of the obtained data and use the reception rate as a parameter in the dynamical allocation of the processing power. Such an embodiment can react quickly to sudden changes in the amount of received data.","In an embodiment, the system controller  is adapted to monitor  a processing load caused by the online processing  of data and use the processing load as a parameter in the dynamical allocation of the processing power. Such an embodiment can base the allocation decision on the actual processing load caused by the processed data. In a further embodiment, the system  may also produce estimates of such a processing load as a function of time of day or day of the week and allocate processing power based on such estimates, too.","In an embodiment, the system  has a determined minimum reserve threshold and the system controller  is adapted to use the minimum reserve threshold as a parameter in the dynamical allocation. In such an embodiment, the system controller  allocates more processing power for the online processing  of data when the current processing power allocated to the online processing  of data exceeds the current processing load caused by the online processing  of data by a value less than the minimum reserve threshold. This embodiment helps the system  in keeping a sufficient reserve processing power for possible online processing  bursts. Further, this embodiment can be provided with a determined maximum reserve threshold whereby the system controller  is adapted to use the maximum reserve threshold as a parameter in the dynamical allocation such that the system controller  allocates less processing power for the online processing  of data when the current processing power allocated to the online processing  of data exceeds the current processing load caused by the online processing  of data by a value greater than the maximum reserve threshold. This embodiment ensures that the reserve processing power for possible online processing  bursts is not excessive thus freeing the system resources for other processes, e.g. off-line processing  of data. Indeed, in an embodiment, the system controller  is adapted to allocate as much of the free processing power as is necessary to the off-line processing  of data, wherein the free processing power refers to the processing power of the common platform  not allocated to the online processing  of data. This embodiment aims at maximizing the throughput of off-line data without compromising low latency for online data processing.","In an embodiment, the allocation of processing power is done by controlling the number of processing nodes performing online processing  and\/or the number of processing nodes performing off-line processing . In another embodiment, the allocation of processing power is done by controlling the number of whole online processing streams  and\/or the number of off-line processing streams .","In a further embodiment, the system controller  is adapted to replace  a defective node ,  in a processing stream  with a properly functioning processing node ,  in case of a processing node malfunction situation. In an embodiment, this function is performed by a Node Manager  described in greater detail in context of specific examples part of this document.","An embodiment seeks to guarantee high availability of service by providing the system with parallel processing streams  and controlling the system  such that, in case of a malfunction in a processing stream , at least one of the parallel processing streams  immediately takes the place of the defective processing stream . In an embodiment, wherein at least one of the processing streams  comprises parallel processing nodes , , the system  is adapted to guarantee high availability of service such that, in case of a malfunction of a processing node , , the parallel processing node immediately takes the place of the defective processing node , .","According to embodiments, the system comprises also an interface to an OSS\/BSS system  for submitting the processed data to said OSS\/BSS system . In a further embodiment, the interface  to the OSS\/BSS system  is a two-way interface  and the convergent mediation system  is responsive to the data received from the OSS\/BSS system  via said two-way interface .","After the above discussion of some of the embodiments of our invention on a higher system level, we will in the following discuss several specific examples and product embodiments that utilize some or all of the above system-level features. Hence, the following examples and embodiments can include the above embodiments in any combination and also in itself discloses several other embodiments and features that can be combined with the above-described ones.","Features and Benefits of an Embodiment","In the following, arguments are presented for the profitability of a solution according to an embodiment of the invention, together with presentation of some of the novel features of the embodiment.","Prepaid Charging and Fraud Control","Many service providers seek the possibility to introduce prepaid charging for data and voice services utilising their existing billing based systems, that is, by collection and processing of event records. It should be noted that this type of solution can be seen as a hot billing solution for prepaid charging and it is never online as it always has a fraud window. At the first glance, this seems to be the easiest and most cost-effective approach, but a further analysis reveals several problems:\n\n","In brief, service convergence means that all subscribers, regardless of their payment method, are offered the same services. Today, most service providers use separate mediation and charging solutions for prepaid and post-paid subscribers. This increases operator costs and the time it takes to launch new services. When both subscriber segments are supported by a same convergent mediation solution, significant improvements are achieved in time-to-market for new services. There are technical reasons why there typically are separated environments for prepaid and postpaid subscribers:\n\n","Further, an embodiment of the invention enables service providers to manage their mediation and charging needs with single solution for both prepaid and postpaid charging. This saves time for service providers when they implement new service configurations or modifications as they are done in one place. Graphical tools that the solution offers also make the configuration of new services easier and faster when everything can be visualised.","Powerful Cost Control\u2014Value for Operator and End-Users","According to an embodiment of the invention, the convergent mediation system  supports cost control with balance management functionality. With the solution, service providers are able to avoid postpaid users' credit overruns. This is important especially in 3rd party services, where the service provider needs to make payments to 3rd party partners according to service usage. Also end-users value cost control, but from a spending management point of view. With embodiments, end-users are able to manage their spending, for example, with service specific balances. The convergent mediation system  is based on the concept of pre-delivery charging and controlling. This means that a customer's validity can be verified before the service is delivered. Therefore, as subscribers are authorised before their service usage, there is no revenue leakage.","With embodiments, end-users are able to manage their spending, for example with service specific balances. The solutions are based on the concept of pre-delivery charging and controlling. This means that a customer's validity can be verified before the service is delivered. Therefore, as subscribers are authorised before their service usage there is no revenue leakage.","Convergent Rating with Service Convergence\u2014Enabling Competitive Charging Models","The convergent mediation system  with rating application provides advanced and flexible rating of any type of service for prepaid and postpaid accounts. Examples include rating of voice, data, multimedia messaging and content services carrying out product packaging, bundles as well as enhancing marketing with promotions and bonuses for these services. Variables such as campaigns, subscription types, times and day types and specific pricing schemes can be combined in virtually any possible way. In addition, specific pricing schemes can be calculated for each combination to reach a high level of sophistication. These advanced and attractive charging models will increase service usage and service revenue for operators and service providers.","Being competitive in the service provider market space requires more than a good service offering. It requires flexible and innovative charging models and careful consideration of customer segment price sensitivity.","Convergent rating with service convergence enables the same services for all subscribers. Service convergence is provided by the convergent mediation functionality, bringing together the different services from various types of networks and services. This enables flexible rating rules for all services and linking of subscriber profiles, product packages and bundles for competitive charging models.","Managing Change in the Charging Infrastructure","Currently, the common way to handle the rating and account management of prepaid and postpaid subscribers is by running two separate billing systems: one for prepaid and one for postpaid billing. In the long run, with the requirements for service and payment convergence this causes a huge challenge as the operator has to manage several systems and be able to apply the same billing and charging models for all services and payment types.","This raises the following challenges:\n\n","An embodiment of the invention overcomes the challenges of convergent charging. Convergent Mediation solution enables operators to make smooth transition from existing separated postpaid and prepaid system environments to fully convergent charging environment.","Cost Efficiency","The convergent mediation system  provides reliability and cost savings that are needed in today's billing and charging environments. When all the mediation requirements are managed in a single solution for both prepaid and postpaid subscribers, cost savings are clear. With a single solution new mediation and charging rules can be configured in a single place. Embodiments of the present invention are reliable and the convergent mediation system  can meet the high availability requirements that are needed in today's telecom environment.","An embodiment of the invention is also very hardware efficient. The solution performance is among the best in convergent mediation world. With the convergent mediation system  according to such an embodiment, operators and service providers are able to reduce their hardware costs.","An aspect of an embodiment of the invention is that the convergent mediation system  closes the fraud window of a hot billing based solution while providing the flexibility and functionality of typical postpaid environment, thus adding value to the service provider's investment.","Vendor Independence\u2014Focus on Performance and Cost-Efficiency","With complex network  and business support systems  in a multiswitch\/system type of environment, it is beneficial to be able to make cost and performance comparisons between different players. The embodiment enables a vendor independent choice. Operators and service providers need to consider the performance and cost-efficiency. Due to these points, the convergent mediation solution  can be easily updated in a highly complex, multi-vendor environment. Adding new network element  and OSS\/BSS  interfaces  is fast, which allows rapid and cost-efficient launching of new services.","Ability to Create a Best-of-Breed, Convertible Customer Care and Billing System","A convergent mediation system  according to the embodiment is truly independent from any network element  and billing system  vendor. The convergent mediation system  is capable of processing online  and off-line  data from any communications network  or service delivery platform  (3G, 4G, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA), IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), Voice over IP (VoIP), IP group calls, Push-To-Talk (PTT), content service sessions, multiplayer interactive game sessions, etc.) and of delivering it to any Operations or Business Support System \u2014regardless of operators' or service providers' network or OSS\/BSS vendor.","Future Proof Solution","The convergent mediation system  is easily expandable to any new network  or service technology  that arises. With the support of new and existing technologies, the embodiments enable a phased approach for full convergent charging environment.","Scalability and Distributability","A convergent mediation system  according to the embodiment is extendable from handling a small number of event records up to billions of events per day. Scalability can be reached simply by multiplying mediation processes (e.g. balance check, analysis, aggregation, rating) within the host. If the processing power of a single host is not sufficient, the mediation processes can be distributed to one or more additional hosts, in which case the system automatically takes care of transferring the event record data to the host it is next processed in. The hosts are typically UNIX, LINUX or suchlike efficient computers. Hosts from different system vendors can be mixed without restrictions.","Easier Management and Monitoring of Processing with Large Networks","Prior art batch-based processing is very difficult to monitor with large networks. The solution according to the embodiment collects and stores all events and other data related to the mediation processes into a single, centralised storage, and allows a possibility to send them to e.g. a third party network management system. This allows easy, centralised management and monitoring of the system independently of the size of the network.","Reliability","According to the embodiment the convergent mediation system  is highly available and scales up to the needs that even the largest service providers have for mediation and charging systems. The various embodiments of the present invention can be implemented in many kinds of networks and technology environments. When services are available for the subscribers and they are billed and charged accurately, also the service provider's image becomes more reliable.","The convergent mediation system  according to the embodiment has a functional structure that is based on totally new elements for processing events in an inventive environment. The processes can function independently of each other and the managing system. All data is buffered for any kind of error and system overload situations.","The system  is designed so that there is no single point of failure. This means that as long as the host server is running, and there is free space in the host's file system or shared memory, neither the online data processing  nor off-line record processing  is interrupted.","The convergent mediation system  according to the embodiment is a system with online configuration that is available 24\/7. It is ready to receive data items, such as service requests or records, from the network any time. All mediation processes of the convergent mediation system , such as data analysis and correlation, run independently of each other. Even if one of the processes is affected for example by a network error, all the other processes continue running as before. The mediation processes of the convergent mediation system  run independently of the process management system. They can function temporarily without system critical resources, such as the system database . All data is automatically buffered  to ensure that no event records are lost in any kind of error situation.","Configurability","Users can define freely which processes to include in a convergent mediation process chain . There can be several process chains (streams)  functioning concurrently. Each process is fully configurable, making it possible to define accurate rules for usage data handling. The order of the mediation processes is fully configurable and same processes can be multiplied if needed.","The configuration of the process chains can be done without disturbing the ongoing processing, and the user can decide when to activate the changes into the configuration. The version control of the configurations allows returning to an earlier working configuration version in case of problems.","Functionality of an Embodiment","Embodiments of the present invention provide online  and offline  mediation. They also provide an excellent ground for offering a convergent mediation solution for service providers who tackle the challenges of the convergent environment they face today. The present invention is based on two main modules or main streams\u2014online mediation stream  and off-line mediation stream  as illustrated in the .","Operators can provide versatile charging models, end users can be informed of the actual cost of service purchase and credit losses can be controlled. Chargeable online service can be offered to an unknown client. It is not practically necessary to give credit card number to unreliable party for charging Internet purchases.","The main modules can provide different processes like collection, network interfacing, validation, enrichment, filtering, aggregation, correlation, decoding, encoding, error correction, session control, authorisation, balance operations such as debit, credit, check, reservation and microbalance; rating, re-rating, charging, recharging, usage history recording, conversion and distribution. Furthermore an embodiment of the invention can also provide several additional functionalities such as auditing, revenue sharing, billing data reporting, correction and collection; pricing, testing, revenue assurance, voucher management and top-upping; CRM, service catalog; account, balance, service, subscriber and retention management. The varied functionality allows OSS\/BSS systems to receive usage data just as they want it.","Also arrangements for managing end-user session online charging are presented. In an embodiment of the invention, online charging is performed in a system independent online mediation system. It aims to provide a complete set of charging models and capabilities. These are obtained by combining and managing access, media and service level charging under a pricing plan mechanism which enables the changing of charging rules within an active charging session.","An embodiment of the present invention makes it possible to construct a reliable convergent mediation system  and method with effective control of services and fraud prevention. The inventive concept allows also several useful and advantageous embodiments, which provide further advantages.","An embodiment of the invention supports different types of network elements (such as MSC, IN, IN-Prepaid, content and multimedia servers, SMSC, MMSC, mobile soft switches, media gateway controllers, routers, LDAP servers, packet analyzers, VAS platforms, Radius AAA servers, FTP servers, GGSN, SGSN, CG, Push-To-Talk Over Cellular, IMS platforms, Ducont, STARHOME, INFO2CELL and In-house service delivery platforms), protocols (such as Diameter, Parlay, Radius, X.25, FTM, FTAM, SFTP, SCP, GTP\u2032, SNMP, LFAP, DDP, LDAP, SQL, CORBA, HTTP\/HTTPS, SS7) and data formats (such as XML, CSV, ASN.1, TAP3, TLV, XDR, IPDR, (IAC)AMA, IACHASTA, BCD (straight, swapped, reversed, telephony), any separator supported variable length, blocked, structured, positional). This means that one event or request may comprise e.g. access\/bearer, service or media requests that are combined together in the convergent mediation system .","Some of the main functions of a convergent mediation solution  according to an embodiment of the invention are described below. Each of these functions is configurable.","Convergent Mediation\u2014Featuring Online Mediation and Delivery Control","Convergent Mediation  enables the connectivity to different type of networks  and business support systems  for prepaid charging and postpaid billing. An embodiment of the invention hides the network complexity from the charging point of view and links services, subscribers and payment types in an intelligent manner.","From the charging point of view, Convergent Mediation  provides Online Delivery Control (pre-delivery charging and controlling) meaning that\n\n","In addition, the convergent mediation system  provides online-, real-time- and batch-mode connectivity for all services and it supports correlation and other typical mediation functionalities for different operation modes. The solution is vendor, network and service independent and it enables change management and phase-based solution deployment.","In an embodiment, all of these features are built-in features requiring no additional components to be introduced.","Off-Line Mediation\u2014Robust Backbone for Convergent Mediation","Off-line Mediation function hides the complexity of networks from the billing and other BSS systems. It has full mediation capabilities for service providers with any type of network. The solution has flexible and modular architecture with a rich set of tools for system configuration. The tools enable quick and effective reconfiguration of business logic for changing charging of services and creating new services. It enables usage based charging of all services by separating the infrastructure and network architecture. Usage data is instantly billable and the billing can be based on transactions, content, service, quality, time, volume or any combination of these.","Off-line mediation functionality provides:\n\n","The convergent mediation system  includes a rating application designed primarily for rating modern operator services, irrelevant of the payment method chosen by the subscriber. The rating function supports a number of rating scenarios from simple call rating to rating subscriber-specific services with the usage history on a corporate level.","The convergent mediation system  with rating application rates transaction based on both the information in the transaction itself and according to the predefined rules in the rating function.","Rating provides the following functionality:\n\n","The convergent mediation system  provides balance management application for subscriber, subscriber groups or service specific convergent accounts. With balance management, service providers can offer the following prepaid and postpaid account functionalities from the charging point of view:\n\n","In addition to convergent accounts, the balance management includes features for voucher handling and secure handling of monetary value. Therefore, with the above-mentioned convergent account functionality a service provider can replace the existing expensive and rigid legacy prepaid systems as well as the postpaid accounts in the billing system side.","The convergent account functionality offers service providers tools to offer their subscribers a possibility to pay for different telecom services the way they choose. At the same time it offers both subscribers and the service provider control for customer service usage with competitive charging models.","Convergent account functionality supports several balances per subscriber and it can handle grouping of balances as well as balance hierarchies. Additionally, there are notification service features enabling low balance and Advice of Charge (AoC) type of notifications for the subscribers.","Service Implementation","When business rules or business logic for new services are implemented or changed, it should impact existing service charging operation as little as possible. In addition, configuration should be easy enough to enable fast introduction of new services. The convergent mediation system  offers several tools that enable fast and reliable configuration of new business logics and charging rules.","For creating business logic for mediation and charging processes, the convergent mediation system  offers a graphical tool  that helps users to configure business logics in a controlled way. When using the tool, the user is able to visualise the business logic, which helps ensure that configuration is correct and optimised. The tool also allows the user to modify the business logics later, if needed. A mediation and charging process stream typically requires business logic in order to process the event records for billing. Typical business logic includes filtering, validation, correlation, and authorisation, conversion, rating and mapping functions.","In addition to business logic configuration, integration to operator environment is essential part of the service implementation. Integration should be done so that there are minimum changes to existing billing, prepaid and network equipment. Business logics are not tied to any particular interfaces so all network elements can share the same logic if required.","An embodiment of the convergent mediation system  can provide productised support for over 400 different interfaces for both online and off-line protocols.","Testing Support","Once all the integrations and business logic configurations are done, it is always essential to test the logics to ensure that they work as planned. The convergent mediation system  provides automated testing that is part of the business logic tool. It helps users to prepare test cases, execute and compare tests and their results. This process helps operators to verify that the new configuration works and has not had an impact on existing functions.","Another aspect that smoothens the testing phase is Library management. It provides the deployment of pre-configured mediation and charging streams for different services and interfaces. This way testing and comparing of existing streams for new services is straightforward. When the operator can reuse existing streams and logics, time is saved when testing a new service implementation.","Service request tracking is another aspect that helps operators to debug and analyse their business logic implementations. Tracking helps operators to view graphical step-by-step request execution trace and analyse in-depth analysis for testing and debugging results.","High Availability and Scalability","When operating in prepaid mode, low latency and high availability are critical factors when measuring the success of service. The convergent mediation system  is very focused on these two items. High availability is ensured by an N+M configuration where N represents the number of nodes processing transactions and M the number of standby nodes in case of any of the active nodes goes down. In addition to node configuration, all interfaces can be duplicated to ensure that no transactions or events are lost.","Scalability is another aspect that the convergent mediation system addresses. The system  has been designed for online applications  while maintaining extremely high throughput for off-line events . The requirements for system performance include low latency and extremely high tolerance for parallel transactions. Together these two features ensure that the end user's Quality of Service (QoS) is not compromised and the system is able to serve masses of subscribers with sensible hardware\u2014even when the external systems might be slow.","There are three ways how to increase the capacity of the convergent mediation system :\n\n","Low latency is required in request-response type streams, for example when a user is waiting for authentication. The convergent mediation system  achieves very low latencies by using shared memory transport mechanism  between the processing nodes , . The shared memory transport mechanism  makes it possible to build large streams  where the processing ,  has been logically divided into the nodes ,  and still simultaneously achieve high throughput by using the scalability features of the system .","Post-Launch Follow-Up","According to an embodiment of the invention, the convergent mediation system  capabilities do not stop at running of the system. The system also provides reports on how services have been used and how accurate billing and charging are. This helps to analyse, for example, what were the popular services and when were they used. The reports can then be used to plan next service offering and how their charging will be done.","Charging Rule Provisioning","When a new subscription, service package or charging model is created, the customer care system normally sends an activation request to the management application programming interface (API) of Convergent Mediation Solution.","Embodiments store the charging rule data to the configuration database and further enable the charging rule provisioning towards control nodes in the network if necessary.","The convergent mediation system management API is an open interface to all applications that must have access to subscription hierarchies and balance information. The management API supports, for example, the following request types:\n\n","All subscription and balance management functions provided by the management API are also available via the user interface. However, when using the UI to perform subscription or balance operations, it is important to configure the convergent mediation system so that it sends the event records or notifications to external systems in a manner that ensures that systems such as the billing system or CRM database are maintained synchronised with the convergent mediation system.","Recognition of Incoming Data in Convergent Mediation System","An embodiment of the invention recognizes the incoming data whether it needs online  or off-line  processing.","Collection","The convergent mediation system  according to the embodiment is capable of interfacing with any network or service\u2014e.g. 3G, 4G, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA), IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), Voice over IP (VoIP), IP group calls, Push-To-Talk (PTT), content service sessions, multiplayer interactive game sessions\u2014or any combination of presented network technologies.","Validation and Analysis","When receiving event records from the network, the mediation solution checks them for duplicates and verifies their sequence. By doing this, it ensures that the numerous event records stream into the system in correct order and that none of them are missing or delayed or tries to enter the system for the second time.","After collection, the mediation solution carefully examines and analyses the contents of the event records. It checks that all values included in the event record fields are applicable and in a correct format. It can join fields and insert additional values to them when necessary.","Enrichment","The mediation solution according to the embodiment is able to enrich event records by completing them with information from external sources. It can, for example, fetch the information on which customer category a specified service user belongs to, and add this information to the event record. Marking of customer category helps other processes such as billing.","Aggregation and Correlation","In aggregation, the mediation solution according to the embodiment merges partial event records produced by a single service usage and coming from the same network source. Aggregation thus allows the OSS\/BSS systems to receive only one billable record from each service usage.","Correlation involves combining event records also, but the records to be correlated come from different sources. A GPRS session, for example, produces S-CDRs (Call Detail Record) in SGSN and G-CDRs in GGSN that the mediation solution is able to correlate into one output record.","The records to be correlated may come at the same time from access network and content platform, which is the case in a content usage session. The mediation solution then completes the event records from content platform with the user identification fetched from access network. The correlated records contain all the information needed for content charging: who the user was, what services he used and for how long, as well as the value of the services.","Rating","The rating functionality of the mediation solution according to the embodiment allows pricing of event records in the mediation system. Flexible rating criteria and various pricing models can be used as rating bases. Also subscriber specific rating is possible. The rated event records can be sent directly from the mediation solution to balance management and other applications without any intervention from billing system.","Storing","All records of the mediation solution according to the embodiment can be stored into a long-term event database. The event records can be stored into the database during different mediation processes, for example before and after aggregation, correlation or rating.","The long-term storage capability allows to view and fetch records from the database at all times and check how different mediation processes have modified them. The stored event data gives valuable information about subscribers' network usage in the long run.","Formatting","Before delivering the fully processed event records to the OSS\/BSS systems, the mediation solution according to the embodiment converts them to formats compatible with these systems. The mediation solution is able to convert the records either to a standard format or to operators' proprietary formats. Due to conversion, an OSS\/BSS system receives all usage information from the network in a uniform, predefined form. It should be noticed that the formatting of event records may be done also in any point or points through the processing chain (stream) of the mediation process.","Distribution","The mediation solution according to the embodiment is able to simultaneously interface with multiple different OSS\/BSS systems. Even if it performs all its collection and other processes in real-time, it is able to deliver the processed records to the OSS\/BSS systems either through a configured real-time protocol or a file interface.","Architecture of a Mediation Solution According to an Embodiment","The keywords of the convergent mediation system  architecture are simplicity and straightforwardness. The truly one platform  ideology and modular design of the solution according to an embodiment of the invention enables real-time and distributable processes, reliable operation, low latency and high performance for both online processing  and off-line processing  of data.","The convergent mediation system  according to the embodiment includes mediation processes , managers controlling the processes , system database  and web-based user interface . Mediation processes  such as balance check, cost control, collection, analysis, pre-delivery control, duplicate checking, aggregation, correlation and conversion are linked together to construct processing streams . Streams are fully customisable and there can be multiple streams simultaneously active.","According to the embodiment, all processes are controlled  by process managers , which start up, monitor, stop and configure them when so instructed. This is presented in . Managers  give configurations  to the processes during start-up. Once started, the processes can function independently from the manager, also in case the manager is temporarily unavailable.","The present architecture  is an \u201calways on\u201d architecture, wherein, in the best case, all the processes are doing work simultaneously.","Node , ","Nodes ,  are functional components specialised in different mediation processes , such as balance check, cost control, collection, aggregation, pre-delivery control, validation, correlation and formatting, or a combination of these. Nodes are linked together to form processing streams for handling data items, such as event records and service requests. Each stream , both online mediation stream  and off-line mediation stream , is fully configurable through the web user-interface of the mediation solution according to the embodiment. presents the nodes and their interaction in the system  in more detail. A node ,  comprises its basic functionality in a node base , which is used for transferring data between the nodes ,  in system's internal format. In addition, the node ,  comprises a node application  that performs the actual usage data processing.","Nodes  run independently of each other. This means that even if one of them is temporarily unavailable, the other nodes continue as before. This, in addition to their independence from the manager , adds to the reliability of the system. Also, any data that cannot be transferred from one node to another, due to for example a network failure, is buffered . Buffers  are file, socket or memory based solutions. In a typical embodiment of the invention, the online processing streams  comprise memory-based buffers  due to the nature of online processing  that requires very fast action. On the contrary, the typical off-line processing streams  use file or socket based buffers .","Node Manager ","While nodes ,  take care of the actual processing of the events, Node Manager  makes sure they function in a controlled way . Node Manager  configures  the nodes  into correct processing order, starts them up, monitors and stops them when so ordered. Before starting up a new node , Node Manager  retrieves its configuration information from the system database  and configures  the node . Since the node  itself contains the configuration, it is able to function properly even if Node Manager  and system database  are temporarily unavailable.","Some of the properties and features of the Node Manager  are:\n\n","System database  stores node configuration, audit trail information as well as status information of nodes , streams  and Node Managers . Also orders for Node Managers  are stored within the system database .","Examples of Using an Embodiment of the Invention","Convergent Voice and Data Charging Solution","The convergent mediation system  provides mediation and charging functionality for all voice and data services for both prepaid and postpaid subscribers with one single solution. The solution is connected to network over both online and file based interfaces, irrespective of the technology used. It supports Diameter and IP interfaces, and also SS7 based signalling interfaces. Correlation, duplicate checking and other typical mediation functionalities are also available in the online charging side. When same modules are used for all aspects of the solution, roll out of services is smoother. For voice control, an embodiment of the invention can provide voice SCP if so required as part of Convergent Mediation Solution, fulfilling a truly convergent mediation solution.","Online Cost Control","Another use case example for the convergent mediation system  is Online Cost Control. It provides a prepaid like ability for postpaid subscribers to control their spenditure in telecom services. When there is control of usage also for postpaid users, subscribers manage their spending and service providers can ensure the credit worthiness of their subscribers. Different limits can be subscriber specific and they are easy to control and manage with the tools that the solution provides.","The solution enables operators and service providers to offer new and innovative service concepts like family and business concepts. For example, parents can control how much their children spend on telecom services while still paying their monthly bills as usual.","IP Prepaid","A third example of the convergent mediation system  is IP prepaid. In IP prepaid, all prepaid functionalities that are typically managed by IN switches are provided in an all IP environment that is based on the convergent mediation system. The solution has a convergent mediation layer that hides the different network technologies and environments from the rating and account functionalities. Then convergent rating and balance management functionalities provide all rating features that are needed in today's and tomorrow's rating requirements. Balance management holds the subscribers accounts, which they can top up by using an existing top-up mechanism. This way operators and service providers can extend their existing investment from their top-up mechanisms while extending the rating functionality that they have.","According to an embodiment of the invention, the subscription-based functions contain at least following aspects. Multiple MSISDNs are associated with a single subscription. Further, single subscription may access 0 . . . n services in 0 . . . n service domains. System supports activation of services (provisioning) to both all subscribers and to individual subscribers based on some predefined criteria. The system supports even removing of active services from subscriber's access both from all subscribers and individual subscribers based on some predefined criteria.","Another embodiment of the invention supports also following rating and charging related functions. System supports rating and charging based on time, destination, location, volume, bandwidth, access technology, quality or used value added service. System also supports sending information about chargeable events to operator accounting\/billing system. Examples of these are:","a) immediately after event is completed","b) at regular intervals","c) before completing event.","Furthermore, the system supports flexible billing system that enables use of stored value cards, credit cards or other similar devices. System supports indication of the price\/cost of the service. An example is Advise of Charge. Subscriber is able to make decision of acceptable charge either dynamically or based on personal profile settings. System supports rating and charging of subscriber that receives service event or call. Subscriber is able to accept the service dynamically or based on personal profile.","According to an embodiment of the invention, the system supports off-line rating and charging. This is typically collecting CDR files from the network elements. Further, the system supports online rating and charging. This is typically subscriber authorization, real-time charging and control of network resource usage. Even more, the system supports event based (stateless) charging functionality, such as MMS message sending, WAP page retrieval etc. The system supports also session based (stateful) charging functionality, such as GPRS usage.","IMS Mediation","IMS enables rich, conversational multimedia services delivered on a standard network infrastructure. In IMS, all network usage data is by default available in real-time. To charge effectively for IMS, the access (bearer) network data has to be collected and possibly correlated with IMS usage data.","Convergent Mediation Solution  offers an easy choice for charging of IMS services by off-the-shelf interfaces and highly configurable processing logic. Convergent Mediation implements both offline and online charging functions as specified by 3GPP. Implementation of new business logics with Convergent Mediation Solution as new services are rolled out offers the operator an ease on the service launch project, for time and cost to support the billing of the service.","In this example, a video sharing service is charged by collecting bearer data from GPRS network elements and service, and session data from IMS network elements. It is assumed that an operator bills subscribers monthly for 3G service usage. The invoicing of the subscriber is handled by the billing system, which receives all usage data from Convergent Mediation Solution . The underlying network architecture can serve both fixed line and mobile subscribers, as IMS can offer services to both types of access networks","Convergent Mediation Solution  hides the technical implementation of charging from the billing system  by interfacing the network :\n\n","Typical functionality configured especially for IMS mediation in Convergent Mediation Solution is:\n\n","This means the identification of the GPRS tickets belonging to the same PDP context and forming a single billable item for the billing cycle. Typically total bytes in and out and duration of the connection are summed together.\n\n","Reprocessing of records is very common in the mobile mediation, due to usage of lookup tables in the identification of the subscriber group or other details. As lookup tables might not always be synchronised with the information in the billing system, the records where the subscriber was not identified are rejected. After the lookup table update, the subscriber group is found and records are released to billing. Convergent Mediation solution also provides a record correction facility for more complex correction and reprocessing scenarios.","In the example above, the use case was based on collection. Similar type of functionality can be based also for online processing. In such scenario the service usage is authorised before the actual usage takes place. Authorisation can include prepaid balance check and subscription validity for the used services.","In addition to charging functionality, Convergent Mediation Solution  enables Policy Control for IMS and broadband services. Charging and policy control functionalities are closely tied together and the solution leverages the same platform for both and thus keeps the total cost of ownership low.","Mediation of VPN Service Usage","The most logical way to charge an ISP or a corporate user for the usage of broadband or VPN service is to bill based on consumption of bandwidth. However, without proper automation, tracking down and calculating the usage of a VPN or broadband service is complicated and time-consuming task.","An automated usage-based billing of broadband or VPN services gives additional revenue as well as unifies the billing process of the operator. This is realised by taking advantage of the flexible and extensive network interfacing and data processing capabilities of Convergent Mediation Solution.","In providing information for the rating process, Convergent Mediation Solution  is able to provide details of, for example, bandwidth usage, type of service, volume of traffic, and amount of connections. Because of this, it enables the rating process to apply several different types of discounting options that can be applied for each type of service as well as for the total provided service, in addition to any Service Level Agreement (SLA) discounting options.","In this example, the operator needs to bill a subscriber for the usage of an international VPN connection. The network is based on IP, and the VPN is based on MPLS. The operator expects to send a monthly bill via a corporate Customer Financial Management system.","The operator is selling two services with two different kinds of pricing models:\n\n","Direct charging of the customer based on its usage of the network either by total volumes used or through the 95-percentile calculation method.\n\n","The service is charged based on a flat fee, but the flat fee has a limit to usage. For example, 3000 \u00a3 per month per 10 Mb\/s connection, plus all usage exceeding total usage limit is charged based on price of 1\u00a3\/GB.\n\n","Convergent Mediation Solution  receives usage records from routers of the VPN or broadband service and takes care of the following tasks:\n\n","Convergent Mediation Solution  can be distributed so that the collection and aggregation functions are near the edge routers and a centralised processing server is located at a data centre. Distribution might be required since routers produce a wealth of information, and the amount of data should be minimised close to network before sending it to the data centre.","An Example of Environment According to an Embodiment of the Invention","Convergent Charging Functions","According to an embodiment of the invention, an overview diagram in  shows a high-level view of the different charging (online and off-line) functions as described in the following.","The convergent mediation system  provides all the functions of the online  and offline  charging systems as well as functions to communicate between the different charging systems (mainly by generating records in the OCS that will be processed by the offline charging system).","Charging Trigger Function ","The Charging Trigger Function (CTF)  generates charging events based on network resource usage concurrently with the resource usage. The different network resources can be anything from network\/bearer level resources such as GPRS and PS gateways\/switches (CN Domain) , MMS and WAP gateways (Service Elements)  or for example IMS resources (Subsystem) .","The difference between the online and off-line Charging Trigger Function  is that the off-line charging mechanism  does not effect the service usage in real-time. In online charging, the mechanism  has to provide functions to control the network resource usage in real-time.","Depending on the network resources that are generating the charging events, the information sent and the protocols that are used may differ between online and off-line charging functions. However, the following information may flow between the both charging systems and network resources that generate the charging events:\n\n","The protocols used to communicate between the systems support following capabilities:\n\n","The Charging Data Function (CDF)  creates Charging Data Records (CDR) based on the charging events received from the Charging Trigger Function . The CDRs may be generated based on following conditions:\n\n","The resulting CDRs are in a well-defined content and format. The content and format of the CDRs depends upon the domain, service or subsystem in question.","Charging Gateway Function ","The Charging Gateway Function (CGF) receives the CDRs generated by one or more Charging Data Function's. The Charging Gateway Function acts as a gateway between the network and the Billing Domain. Following list contains the main functions of the Charging Gateway Function:\n\n","The interaction protocol between Charging Data Function  and Charging Gateway Function  supports:\n\n","The interaction between the Charging Gateway Function  and Billing Domain  is based on passing CDR files from system to another. A common standard secure file transfer protocol (e.g. SFTP) is used including the transport specified for the selected protocol.","CDR Transfer Between CDF  and CGF ","If the Charging Data Function  and the Charging Gateway Function  are not integrated or are separate implementations, then the transport of CDRs between the functions are implemented by using e.g. the GTP\u2032 protocol.","If the functions are integrated, then it is possible to use some other (proprietary) protocol for communications between the functions.","CDR Processing ","According to an embodiment of the invention, whether or not the Charging Data Function  and Charging Gateway Function  are integrated, the CDRs are passed between them in near real-time as soon as they have been closed by the Charging Data Function .","Once the CDRs have been received by the Charging Gateway Function  they undergo a semantic or syntactical analysis and based on the analysis the Charging Gateway Function  executes any of the following operations:\n\n","According to an embodiment of the invention, the CDR processing complies with following requirements:\n\n","According to an embodiment of the invention, Charging Gateway Function  routes CDRs to different files that are kept open concurrently. The routing of the CDRs to different files can be based on different routing filters and those CDRs that don't match any routing filter are placed e.g. in the \u2018default\u2019 CDR file that collects all non-matching CDRs.","The routing of CDRs is based on CDR parameter information or the origin of the CDR. The file name contains indication of the used routing filter if possible.","According to an embodiment of the invention, Charging Gateway Function  implementation supports routing based on:\n\n","The files may contain any combination of CDRs described in the following list:\n\n","Other implementations that the Charging Gateway Function  supports are:\n\n","The system supports following ways of closing CDR files written by the CGF :\n\n","When CDR file is closed, the next matching CDR is written to new CDR file that is \u2018next in the chain\u2019. The exact time when the new CDR file is generated physically may be any time between:\n\n","If there are no matching CDRs between the closure of the previous CDR file and configured file closure trigger time, then an empty CDR file is generated. After CDR file closing the file is immediately ready for transfer to the Billing Domain .","The CDR files from the Charging Gateway Function  may be removed in the following ways:\n\n","The file transport between Charging Gateway Function  and the Billing Domain  is implemented with two different mechanisms:","Basic File Transport Mechanism is supported by all CGF  implementations and complies with following requirements:\n\n","File Transfer IRP can be used optionally. If File Transfer IRP is used it may comply with 3GPP TS 32.341, 3GPP TS 32.342, 3GPP TS 32.343 and 3GPP TS 32.344, for instance.","File Transfer Modes ","According to an embodiment of the invention, files are transferred to Billing Domain  in push or pull modes or by using both modes at the same time.","In push mode, the CDR files from Charging Gateway Function  are written to the defined Billing Domain  file store at time\/frequency controlled by the Charging Gateway Function . If the Charging Gateway  generates concurrent CDR files based on some routing filters, then it can send different files to different Billing Domains .","The file push from the CGF  is triggered by the following events:\n\n","If the file transfer fails, the Charging Gateway Function  logs the event and raises an appropriate alarm.","In pull-mode transfer, the Billing Domain  reads the CDR files from the Charging Gateway Function  directories. The time\/interval of the file transfer is controlled by the Billing Domain . The Billing Domain  requests files from the Charging Gateway Function  at any given time or frequency. If the file transfer fails, then any further actions are up to the Billing Domain . In this case, the Charging Gateway Function  also logs the event and raises appropriate alarms.","CDR File Format","The CDR file format follows the principles\/standards described in the Charging Data Record (CDR) file format and transfer specification.","Online Charging System ","Online Charging Function ","The Online Charging Function (OCF)  consists of two distinct functions: Session Based Charging Function (SBCF)  and Event Based Charging Function (EBCF) .","The Session Based Charging Function  is responsible for charging of network\/user session. For example voice calls, GPRS PDP contexts or IMS sessions.","The Event Based Charging Function  is responsible for event or content charging such as ring tone or logo downloads or other Value Added Service usage.","Rating Function ","According to an embodiment of the invention, the Rating Function (RF)  determines the value of the network resource usage. Online Charging Function  passes the charging event in a form recognized by the Rating Function  and receives in return the rating output (monetary or non-monetary units). The Rating Function  may handle wide variety of rateable services, events etc.","Rating function  is implemented in three classes:\n\n","The class A rating function is stateless and class B and C are statefull. This means that the class B and C rating functions can do the value reservation of counters and accounts.","The class C rating function supports a mechanism for account balance management function towards external account management servers.","Depending on the class of the rating function it supports the following function before and\/or after service consumption;\n\n","Rating function  supports the following properties in rating, balance management and charging:\n\n","Rating function  supports the following interface methods:\n\n","The Account Balance Management Function  is the location of the subscriber's account balance within the online mediation system .","CDR Generation for Online Subscribers","In addition to basic Online Charging Functions  described above, the online mediation system  generates charging events to off-line mediation system  and act as Charging Trigger Function  for the system. The online mediation system  also includes Charging Gateway Function  as described above and generates CDR files for the Billing or Mediation Systems in the Billing Domain .","Charging Principles","In general both off-line  and online  charging systems comply with following principles:\n\n","The purpose of off-line charging is to transform the charging information collected during the network resource usage to CDRs that are then further processed to the final billing information \u2018off-line\u2019 as in after the network resource usage has finished. The off-line charging does not impact the network resource usage in any way.","Event Based Charging in Off-Line Mediation","In off-line charging the charging event is processed as described above. Even though there are no real-time requirements for any parts of the procedure, the system should be capable of completing the whole process from detection of chargeable event up to transferring of the CDR to Billing Domain  in near real-time.","Session Based Charging in Off-Line Mediation","In off-line charging the session based charging is done by collecting the initial, interim and end charging requests by the Charging Data Function  which then upon completion of the network resource usage passes the corresponding CDR(s) forward to Charging Gateway Function . The system should complete the processing of the chargeable event as close to real-time as possible.","Online Charging ","The purpose of online charging is to perform credit control before the network usage is permitted. For this reason the prepaid subscriber account has to exist in the online mediation system  or external system so that the network usage can be billed before or during the network resource usage. All activities that are needed to assess the requested resource usage in monetary or other units and to debit these units from subscriber account must occur prior or during the resource usage. Depending on the situation the charging can be done in two different ways:\n\n","For online charging the event based charging must occur in real-time. Depending on the implementation of the service the charging may occur immediately or by reserving an amount of units from subscriber account and then debiting\/returning the units after successful\/failed delivery of service.","In both cases the authorization of the charging event has to occur before delivering the service. The authorization may contain authorization for one or more chargeable event at a time.","Session Based Charging in Online Mediation","In online charging the session based charging always involves reservation of units from the subscriber's account after successful authorization of the initial charging event. During the network resource usage, the Network Element is responsible of supervising the reserved unit\/quota usage and of requesting additional interim charging events from the online mediation system  when needed or terminating the session. Once the session is terminated the Network Element reports the actual quota usage to the online mediation system  and the used\/unused quota\/units are debited\/returned from\/to the subscriber account.","The whole procedure of receiving and responding to a session based charging event must occur in real-time. It also has to be noticed that one subscriber may have several concurrent services running on one user session at any given time.","Other Functions","Service Identification","Service identification is a function identifying the service(s) which the request (e.g. CDR) represents. Identification is based on the parameters (i.e. fields' values) of the request.","Service identification is based on predefined identification rules. The rules are logical expressions referring to one or several parameters. The rule can define identification values by fixed or dynamic values. Dynamic values can be a relation of two parameters or an external value e.g. from database. All value types can be used in the same identification rule. The final identification value can be formed from several values by an arithmetic statement.","The result of service identification must be unambiguously one service identifier (true) or unsuccessful identification (false). If the request represents more than one service, the identifier is the service group (product) identifier, which may include a list of detailed services of the request.","Correlation","In situations when several Network Elements generate charging events that are for the same event\/session, correlation has to occur either in the Online Charging System or the Billing Domain. For example, IMS correlation functions are following:\n\n","These are presented in the standard specifications e.g. 3GPP TS 32.260.","Credit Pooling","When granting separate quotas it may be possible that the user's credit may be totally reserved when starting to use new services. The new service usage may then be denied even though the user still has credit left (but reserved to other services). To avoid this kind of fragmentation of credit it is possible to create a pool of quota\/credit from which all services draw quota. The credit pool also holds service specific rating information so that it can define the amount of pooled quota\/credit versus requested quota\/credit. This can be done e.g. with Diameter or similar protocol.","Advice of Charge","The advice of charge functionality is designed to supply to mobile user information to allow real-time estimate to be made about the amount charged from the user. The advice of charge functionality can be used for example to following services:\n\n","These are presented in the standard specifications e.g. 3GPP TS 23.086 and 3GPP TS 22.024.","The embodiments mentioned above have also several common technological issues such as connectivity, platform functionality, scalability, high availability, and so on. The system supports both circuit and packet based protocols build on top of SS7, TCP, UDP and SCTP. There is also an easily extendable protocol framework that can be used to implement different service protocol adapters\/parsers. Further, the system supports file based protocols. Depending on the protocol the system supports reading single line, multiline and structured records as well as single or multiple records from single file. According to an embodiment of the invention service protocols and I\/O (network & file) protocol implementations are separated.

Different aspects of High availability are hardware availability, hardware clustering and failover , data storage availability , network availability , Application availability  and Service availability . In this context the Service availability  is the key issue and the goal is to make Services available up to 99.999% of the time.","The Service Availability  can be thought from the end user point of view for example so that when making a call, the call can be made even if the charging of the call is not done online because of some business support system failure. So the service is up and running even though some parts of the whole rating and\/or billing chain or business logic are not functioning. The level of Service Availability  and the strategies how to cope with different error situations depend on what the situation is. The customer must be able to configure the system so that they can guarantee the agreed level of service availability in all situations.","The convergent mediation platform is able to implement convergent charging applications that allow the system to function during planned or unplanned network, hardware and software downtimes in a well designed and predictable manner.","It is also possible to prioritize the services and\/or parts of the system that are even more highly available. For example, the system may be configured such that in case of failure (database corruption, hardware failure, . . . ) or disaster (earthquake, flood, . . . ) all emergency\/selected authority (police, army, . . . ) calls are connected in all situations and all other non-emergency calls and services are dropped.","Application Distribution","The distribution of the convergent charging applications and logical functions also contribute to High Availability.  highlight the ideas and effects of different availability issues as an example. As described in , the service availability can be increased by adding distributed Application Servers (preferably on dedicated hosts) and by introducing a load balancing or failover mechanism to Network Element that can automatically re-route the request from AS  to AS  in case of failure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0334","num":"0541"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},"Failover","Failover is the term used about the situation when the Network Element , , ,  or load balancer detects that a primary server or application is not available and re-routes the service requests to a secondary server.","The failover time depends on the High Availability configuration of the system and\/or how long it takes for the secondary server to be able to service the requests send from the Network Element.","Recovery Times","Recovery time is closely related to high availability. Recovery time is the total time required for a planned outage or the time required to fully recover from an unplanned outage.","The recovery time of the system depends upon many different factors, such as:\n\n","The convergent mediation platform enables implementation of Convergent Charging Application that can minimize the expected recovery time by cutting down the amount dependencies to systems such as database, for example.","The Convergent mediation platform enables implementation of such Convergent Charging Applications that minimize the amount of lost data in case of failure in the network, hardware or the software components. The Convergent mediation platform provides tools for maximizing the data availability when needed.","It should be noted that the data availability and the service availability (from end users perspective) are different issues. Maximum data availability of an Application (e.g minimizing the amount of lost data in all cases) may also be ensured in the expense of service availability if so required.","System Operation and Data Processing Principles in an Embodiment","The system configuration is stored and maintained in the System Database . There is one Node Manager  installed in each host  and started as an independent process. The configurations are changed and the system managed via the User Interface .","Upon the system start-up, Node Managers  read the Processing Chain configurations from the system database  and start up the Processing Chains. A Processing Chain  includes a plurality of Nodes , . Each of the system components executes independently once started. The Processing Chains  process the data until they are shut down. The Node Manager  shuts down the Processing Chains  or Nodes ,  upon user's request.","The usage data flows between the Nodes ,  in internal data files or other data format used in disk based, socket based or shared memory transport. When using disk based buffers, each Node checks its input data sources constantly for new data files. When a new data file is detected, it is immediately processed and delivered to the output destinations. Usage data is processed file by file. When an input file is processed and the possible corresponding output data file is created, the input file is removed. This way no data is lost if a Node ,  crashes during data processing. Each Node locks the input file it is reading. This way no other Node can erroneously read the same file. A corresponding mechanism is used in shared memory and socket based buffers.","At a crash recovery the Node will start writing to the beginning of the existing temporary data buffer. This ensures that no duplicate records are generated and no temporary data is left permanently in the buffer or cause memory leaks.","If a Processing Chain  is distributed to several hosts, the system  will automatically take care of usage data transmission between hosts. This is done by an application that is divided into the sender and receiver processes, which reside in the separate hosts.","There is a mechanism for discarding usage data that is identified to be invalid by the usage data processing logic. It is possible to feed the invalid usage data back to the data processing chain.","System Monitoring According to an Embodiment","The Node Manager  constantly monitors the status of the nodes , , and:\n\n","Restarting is tried a few times. If the first restart does not succeed, the current block of input records for the Node is discarded as faulty data to a storage directory, and the processing continues from the next record block in the queue.","Node Managers can send SNMP traps to inform Network Management System about the statuses of the Nodes and possible problems such as low disk space, database and network connection trouble. The status information is also stored to the System Database from where the information is collected and shown in the User Interface.","Node Applications According to an Embodiment of the Invention","Different types of Node Applications  that are responsible of the usage data processing are listed in this chapter. Some of the Node Applications are common for most of the product installations and some are customer specific.","Online Interface Node (Interactive Interfaces) ","Online Interface Nodes  receive data that needs online processing .

The memory-based buffers have strong availability and low latency. It should be noted that the memory-based buffers can be used also in off-line mediation streams.","Data Collection & Data Parsing (Input Interfaces) ","Collector Nodes collect usage data either as files or through a real-time protocol. There are generic Collectors and Network Element specific Collectors.","Collector Nodes parse the usage data collected. It is possible to define rules how data is parsed in the application configuration. A typical Collector converts the usage data into internal format for the next Node in the Processing Chain. It is also possible that the Collector Node is the only Node in the Processing Chain: in this case the Node collects, parses, processes and delivers the usage data. An example of this is a Node that acts as a protocol converter.","Data Processing ","Standard data processing functionality includes:\n\n","When Node Application operates based on the internal data format, no data parsing and formatting functionality is needed.

For file-based delivery, file-naming functionality is available. In case of file\/batch type delivery, it is possible to schedule the delivery application.","Increasing Throughput by Multiplying Mediation Processes According to an Embodiment of the Invention","In case of insufficient processing capacity of a mediation function or functions within a processing stream, an embodiment starts up an identical copy of the node in question to scale up the processing capacity of the system.  shows an example, in which the node  has insufficient performance in scenario A. In scenario B, the node  has been duplicated to run in nodes and , which are running in parallel and sharing workload between them. Because the embodiment uses buffers  between the consecutive nodes , the parallel nodes and can use the same buffers  from which to read and to which to write the processed data items, such as event records. In such an arrangement, the preceding node  need not be modified when duplicating node , as node  can continue writing its output to the one and same buffer . In a corresponding manner, node  can read from the same buffer  regardless of the number of nodes  that write to the buffer .","If the processing capacity of a single host is the bottleneck, the sharing of the workload can be done between hosts.  describes an embodiment, which is able to enhance processing capacity of the system in this way. In , nodes  and  have been multiplied into nodes , , and running in one host, and nodes , , , running in another host, all processing the event records or other data items in parallel. In online mediation process  the buffers  between the processing nodes ,  (i.e. online interface node, processing node, encode, decode, etc.) are memory based.","The node duplication can also be used in dynamical allocation of the processing power of the system between online processing  and off-line processing . For example, the system  can duplicate an online stream  in case a latency time of the online processing  tends to increase. The duplicate stream  may then be removed if the amount of online processing  load decreases. Similarly, the number of parallel off-line streams  may be increased, for example, during times of low online processing  load, and thereby the throughput of the system  may be increased. The same principles apply also to host multiplication if the system  has an auxiliary host available.","Buffers  are placed between the nodes ,  to ensure reliability of the mediation process. Reliability measures with the buffers  include a certain processing order of event records within the node , , outgoing buffer  and incoming buffer . In an embodiment, event records are stored within the buffers  as groups. Number of records in each group can dynamically vary during runtime from one record to any number of records, as long as there is free storage space available. Event records are not deleted from incoming buffer  before the node ,  has processed all information relating to a record group, and has written the processed event records to outgoing buffer , thus ensuring data integrity in failure situations. In case of multiplied mediation process where one incoming buffer  feeds several nodes , , the first node available for process takes the first available event record group for processing. The system  is provided with a locking mechanism to ensure that each event record is processed by one of the multiplied nodes ,  only. When a node ,  takes an event record group for processing, the node ,  marks (locks) the event record group with \u201cunder processing\u201d status. Hence, the other nodes ,  know that the particular group is reserved for another node ,  and they can take the next one from the buffer  for processing. As already described above, the processing node ,  removes the copies of the event records in a group from the incoming buffer  only after processing and successfully writing the processed event records into the outgoing buffer . Thus, no data is lost in case the processing node ,  shuts down in an uncontrolled way due to failure of the node or external system, and the lock of the input event record group is automatically released by the underlying UNIX operating system, for instance. When the node ,  recovers, it removes any incomplete record groups in output buffer(s)  and restarts processing from the start of the input record group. In case of multiple nodes ,  reading from the same input buffer , another node ,  will take care of processing the interrupted input record group as soon as it is unlocked.","Buffers  also guarantee that in case the system or a part of it breaks down, the whole mediation process need not be started from the beginning. Instead, the process can continue from the point wherein the break-down happened. The system keeps an audit trail of records read and written by each node to ascertain that no records are lost or duplicated, even if failure occurs.","An embodiment of the invention utilizes shared memory transport in online charging, rating, balance management and account update functionalities . The shared memory transport is useful in online mediation environment  where the service usage message is processed at once and online e.g. within the active session. This kind of request-response functionality requires extremely low latency in order to function properly. The normal buffering techniques, i.e. file based buffering, are not fast enough for online mediation. It would be possible to do without the buffers but as described above, there are considerable advantages attainable by means of a buffering mechanism. Therefore in an embodiment, the service usage messages are transported between the execute functions (nodes , , node applications ) by memory-based buffers , also called shared memory transport, or by a useful and fast enough protocol e.g. TCP.","Further in an embodiment of the invention, off-line data  is processed as one-way stream  from network elements  through the process of convergent mediation system  to different OSS\/BSS elements . Typically there is a huge amount of off-line data to be processed. Further, a unit of off-line data is typically much bigger than a unit of online data. At the same time, online data should be processed as quickly as possible. This is required by the nature of online use (prepaid). Typically, the prepaid account has to be checked and credited before the service is given to the subscriber. This functionality is also called pre-delivery control. The pre-delivery control prevents all kind of fraudulent use. It should be noted that the online stream  also generates data for off-line processing  in some cases, for example information for billing. This does not affect the actual online processing  i.e. the request-response mechanism.","Furthermore in an embodiment of the invention, the one platform technology  provides a stream loopback functionality. This functionality enables visualizing and configuring the online mediation stream  in the convergent mediation system . In an embodiment of the invention, a node  implements both collector and distributor functionalities to enable the request-response type synchronous collection or front-end interfaces.","Some useful functionalities of the convergent mediation system  are presented below.","Node Functionality","According to an embodiment, the architecture uses interactive nodes  to manage the processes of online mediation . These nodes  are called interface nodes . Further, the interface nodes  have the responsibility of carrying out the request-response actions, they are connected to network elements  or devices near network elements  or devices responsible of proxying or controlling the actual communication.","In some embodiments, the node functionality is made by e.g. C, Perl or Java languages. The embodiment fits for normal hardware platforms such like SunOS, LINUXintel, HP-UX, AIX and Itanium.","In another embodiment of the invention, a shared memory transport is used. The transfer of records between nodes ,  can also be through files in a buffer directory . Each file contains a number of records which are processed within a transaction. When transaction is at end, the node ,  flushes files and commits. Creating, opening, flushing and scanning for files is slow, so the bigger the input files are, the better the node's throughput is. Latency is, however, bad when using file based buffer mechanism .","To greatly improve the latency, the records are passed between nodes ,  in a more efficient way than files. Most efficient buffer mechanism  for inter-process communication is shared memory, so an embodiment uses shared memory as a record buffer container .","According to an embodiment, a buffer  includes a record queue, data area and memory allocator data. When a writer writes a record into the buffer , it allocates memory from the data area, stores the prepared record into the allocated data block and inserts information about the record into the record queue. The reader processes the records from the queue in order. When the writer runs out of data area memory, it will free old, processed records from the queue and data area. The data areas may be arranged such that each buffer  has a single reader and writer. To enable scalability, each reader and writer can access multiple buffers .","An embodiment of the invention allows threads and locking mechanism. To enable low latency processing of records, the writer and reader nodes must be synchronized. According to an embodiment, this problem is solved as follows: the writer node holds a lock in the record queue for the next record it is going to write. The reader always tries to acquire a lock from the queue\u2014if it can acquire a lock, it either means that a record is available for processing or that the writer node is dead since no lock is being held. If the writer is dead, reader will sleep until a writer becomes available. Due to the locks used through the shared memory, the reader process is woken up immediately when the writer has finished writing a record.","In embodiments wherein the readers are able to read from multiple input buffers  and so try to acquire a lock from multiple buffers simultaneously, a multithreading support is added to Node Base . Each input buffer  has its own reader thread which will signal the main Node Base  thread when there are records to be processed.","Performance of the Embodiment","The performance of the shared memory transport has been tested for several types of nodes such like C, Perl and Java based nodes. Some performance tests were executed to find out the throughput and latency of the architecture . Two streams were tested, one with separated decoders and encoders, one with a single business logic node. Note that no actual encoding\/decoding is done, the collector simply generates records and sends them through the stream and calculates the time it took for the record to come back.","In both streams, the interface node initiates the test by generating 2 records for the Stream A and 5 records for the Stream B. Those records will then cycle through the stream\u2014when the record arrives back to the interface node, the node will write a new record. In effect there is a total of 2 or 5 records in the stream being processed at all times. Adding more records causes queues which does not improve performance but does increase latency.","Results","The streams were run for a short while, and performance was measured. Average latency for a batch of 1000-5000 records, the number of records per CPU second used for the interface and the business logic nodes, and the whole stream throughput in records per real-time second.","In order to measure the latency, the interface node inserts the current time into the record before writing it out, and when the record arrives back into the interface node, it reads the timestamp from the record and compares it to the current time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0382","num":"0604"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Interface","Business Logic",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"CDRs\/CPU","CDRs\/CPU","Throughput",{}]},{"entry":["Stream","second","second","CDRs\/second","Latency"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Test host 1"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Stream A","11000","13000","11000","0.16 ms"]},{"entry":["Stream B","10000","12000","9000","0.55 ms"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Test host 2"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Stream A","20000","21000","20000","0.09 ms"]},{"entry":["Stream B","17000","20000","16000","0.30 ms"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Test host 3"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Stream A","42000","43000","36000","0.05 ms"]},{"entry":["Stream B","28000","30000","20000","0.23 ms"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"According to an embodiment of the invention, the scalability of the shared memory transport implementation can be used with multiple IN\/OUT streams between the nodes ,  to enable faster response times per transaction and higher throughput in overall. Also nodes ,  are able to start in any order if some of the nodes have been stopped or crashed. A recovery for shared memory buffer  can be done when a node has crashed. Further, inspecting buffers  from command line, flushing buffers  to files makes the operability of the mediation system easier. Node Base  supports also multithreading. This means that Node Base  allow reader threads to process the records themselves instead of synchronizing with a \u201cmain\u201d thread. Furthermore, a configuration of the shared memory mode through user interface and XML is possible. By these means it is possible to enable\/disable per link, configure buffer size, inform fault detection, etc. The fault detection notices when any node in the stream fails, pausing the processing and resuming when stream is back in working order.","An embodiment of the invention enables a functionality of stream loopback. To be able to visualize and configure the online mediation stream  there is provided a node  that can act as a Collector and Distributor to enable request\/response type synchronous communication between the Network Elements  and the online collection\/front-end interfaces . The loopback feature is implemented by defining an interface node . The interface node  contains both a collector and a business logic node and further it can read records from input buffer , but it also can efficiently read and send records to an outside system. This allows a creation of streams  that have multiple interfaces  to outside systems , . This is also presented in .","The following example describes one kind of minimal online mediation type of stream  build on top of the one platform architecture . This example shows one possible implementation to build a stream  using node architecture that is capable of providing high enough performance and low latency that is required for the convergent mediation system . In the example, there are three components involved: client application, online stream and AAA functionality.","The node application  creates a Diameter credit control like traffic for multiple sessions. Each session is started with ccr-init request. It is followed by ten ccr-update request. The sessions are ended with ccr-final request. This makes a total of 12 messages for each session. The average packet size is 200 bytes. One client establishes one physical connection to stream. The window size is 10; there is a maximum of 10 messages in processing concurrently.","Online Stream  implements microbalancing credit control application . When it receives a ccr-init request for a session, it will request new quota from accounting system (AAA functionality) and store the reserved quota to session cache (non-persistent). Each ccr-update request decrement the quota in the session cache. The cc-final request will return the unused quota to accounting system.","AAA functionality is a Java echo server application. It simulates accounting systems  quota reservation and return by echoing back the ccr-init and ccr-final packets received from the stream .","An embodiment of the invention executes separate thread and when there is something to process the node base  is notified. This could be a service provided by the node base , e.g. we could have a callback defined where node ,  developer may include a blocking operation. When callback function returns the node base will invoke the process( )method with the main thread.","High Availability","An embodiment of the invention has a high availability feature, which is shown in this setup as two interface nodes  installed on two hosts. For example two hosts can be physically located far away from each other for disaster control. Network elements  are connected to both hosts. The nodes  are in active-active mode, meaning that both nodes receive traffic all the time. The traffic is distributed based on the subscriber IMSI, therefore the traffic of one IMSI should always go to the same node. However, in case of interface node failure (NE detects these as described in diameter documentation), all the traffic will be routed to other, surviving node. The traffic will be routed back once the crashed node is up and running. The business support system  has two interfaces; primary and secondary. Secondary is only used if primary is down (detected as described in diameter documentation).","The business logic does micro balancing and the flow for one IMSI user session is roughly following:\n\n","Additionally, there is at least one delivery where the interface node generates mid-call charging events to the business logic flow:\n\n","An embodiment of the invention presents the following setup examples. Two interface nodes  share the local cache for micro balancing (e.g. the user session state identified by the IMSI is known by both nodes). If the other interface node  crashes, the other one is able to function independently. When the failed node is back on-line, the system is able to start operating normally. The system updates are possible so that the service level is not affected. Interface nodes can be updated independently. If a shared resource, such as a local cache (in-memory database) or session control (ordinary database), requires an update, the system update is done without affecting service level. One solution would be to add new interface nodes  that use the new shared resource. The new traffic (e.g. new user sessions) is routed to new updated nodes. The old nodes are not removed from the system until the old traffic has been handled.","A further embodiment of the invention provides the following session control issues. Session control is basically a persistent and clustered scheduler. It has the following requirements. The scheduled event is executed only once in the cluster (e.g. if you scheduled a job that should be invoked every minute, it is invoked once per minute in one node only). Scheduler makes sure that all the events get executed even if they were a bit late. However, there is configurable misfire threshold that defines how old missed jobs are still triggered. Jobs rejected due to misfire threshold raise an alarm. Scheduler supports one time only and recurring tasks. The scheduler supports rescheduling if there is a temporary error e.g. in resources. When there is a temporary error in one of the nodes, the scheduler should route the jobs to currently working node and execute scheduled and re-scheduled tasks there until the failing node has recovered from the errors.","An embodiment provides a visual picture for the operator as to how the logic is implemented.
