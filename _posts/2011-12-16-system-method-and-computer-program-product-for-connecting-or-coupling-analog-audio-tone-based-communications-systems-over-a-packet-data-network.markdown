This application also has common inventorship and is of common assignee to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/270,697, filed Nov. 13, 2008, the contents of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to the transmission of analog audio tone based communications, and more particularly to such transmission over a packet data network.","2. Related Art","Many older \u2018legacy\u2019 telecommunications systems use dial-up telephone lines with analog modems to send data between equipment and digital computer systems. The modulator of a modulator\/demodulator (modem) at one end of the telephone line converts digital data into an audio tone sequence that can be transmitted within the audio band of the standard telephone channel. At the other end of the line the demodulator of a second modem may decode the signal and convert it back into digital data.","In electronics and telecommunications, modulation is the process of varying one or more properties of a high-frequency periodic waveform, called the carrier signal, with a modulating signal which typically contains information to be transmitted. This is done in a similar fashion to a musician modulating a tone (a periodic waveform) from a musical instrument by varying its volume, timing and pitch. The three key parameters of a periodic waveform are its amplitude (\u201cvolume\u201d), its phase (\u201ctiming\u201d) and its frequency (\u201cpitch\u201d). Any of these properties can be modified in accordance with a low frequency signal to obtain the modulated signal. Typically a high-frequency sinusoid waveform is used as carrier signal, but a square wave pulse train may also be used.","In telecommunications, modulation may include the process of conveying a message signal, for example, a digital bit stream or an analog audio signal, inside, e.g., another signal that can be physically transmitted. Modulation of a sine waveform may be used to transform a baseband message signal into a passband signal, for example a low-frequency audio signal into a radio-frequency signal (RF signal). In radio communications, cable TV systems or the public switched telephone network for instance, electrical signals can only be transferred over a limited passband frequency spectrum, with specific (non-zero) lower and upper cutoff frequencies. Modulating a sine-wave carrier makes it possible to keep the frequency content of the transferred signal as close as possible to the center frequency (typically the carrier frequency) of the passband.","A device that performs modulation is known as a modulator and a device that performs the inverse operation of modulation is known as a demodulator (sometimes detector or demod). A device that can do both operations is a modem (from \u201cmodulator-demodulator\u201d).","There are many standard modem protocols for communicating in this way over analog telephone lines. These standard protocols transfer information at speeds ranging from less than 75 to 56,000 bits\/second or more. Typically the lower speed modems use Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) and are used by older equipment or in cases where the quality of the analog line is very poor. Higher speed modems also use Phase Shift Keying (PSK) or Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) but depend on a high quality audio connection and are much more susceptible to noise and small disturbances on the line than is FSK.","Because the quality of dial up lines still varies enormously, there are important legacy applications still in widespread use today for which a very low data rate modem is automatically chosen in order to minimize the possibility of errors during transmission.","For example, facsimile machines typically attempt to operate at a maximum speed of 14.4 Kbps, and start their communication by testing the quality of the line. In many cases they will negotiate a final transmission speed of 9,600 bps or slower. As a second example, many Point of Sale (POS) terminals and Automatic Teller Machines (ATM) always connect at the relatively slow speed of 2400 bps regardless of the quality of the connection. By connecting at low speed, the chance of errors that might cause a failure mid way through the transaction are minimized. A third example of low data rate legacy applications is alarm systems that use Dual Tone Multiple Frequency bursts of audio to send data at a data rate of less than 50 bits\/second, but remain very resilient to line disturbances and noise. Alarm systems also sometimes use pulse modulation which operates by turning an audio carrier signal on or off at a very low rate, typically between 10 and 40 times a second.","Regardless of the data rate being used, all modems described above are designed to operate in real time when directly connected over the public switched telephone network (PSTN). In some cases the modems generate and receive a constant audio stream with no breaks in the signal. They are designed to operate within predefined line-quality and signal quality limits that are not always achieved. At the receiving end of a modem link any break in signal or short-term distortion in signal quality may result in data errors from which the application being run over the link may not recover.","A common requirement in telecommunications systems is to replace the dial up connection with an alternative connection, such as a wireless or terrestrial data packet network, without disturbing the equipment at either end of the dial up link. For example, it may be desirable to connect an existing alarm system to a cellular wireless data IP network in order to provide service in an area where landlines are unreliable. Such an application may be for use as the primary link or as an emergency backup to the dial network. In such cases it may be desirable to avoid the expense of upgrading the existing system to one that is \u201cIP ready\u201d but rather to use the IP network to transparently connect the two ends of the link. Often a modem is embedded in an expensive end device and cannot be bypassed without replacing the whole unit, for example in an ATM machine or in a Commercial HVAC system. At the other end of the link, access to the Legacy host or server system may also only be through dial-in lines. It is desirable under these circumstances for the legacy equipment at both ends of the link to operate substantially as each had previously with the PSTN line attached and that users of the equipment would experience no major changes in operation.","The general literature describes two conventional methods for attaching dial modems to packet data networks so that they may operate transparently to the attached equipment. These are known as Modem Passthrough and Modem Relay.","In the first method, modem passthrough, the analog signal from the modems at each end of the link is converted directly into a digital stream using an analog to digital converter at the analog input of a packet router or gateway. This digital representation of the audio signal normally takes the form of Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) and is passed over the network to the other end of the link in packet form without any decoding. Using modem passthrough, the receiving end of the link, the signal is regenerated exactly as it was received from the sending modem as if the two modems were still directly connected. The audio stream thereby generated normally conforms to the G.711 standard and has a data rate of 64 Kbps. G.711 is the digital audio standard used by the digital hierarchy of the PSTN, sometimes known as full rate voice, or toll quality voice. In this mode of operation the packet network effectively performs exactly the same functions as a standard digital telephone network, the primary difference being that the packet network introduces a substantial transmission delay that varies from packet to packet. This variation in delay is called jitter. Buffers in the end-point routers may absorb jitter to some extent, but there is always a trade-off between the magnitude of jitter that can be absorbed and the delay that can be tolerated by the applications running over the network. For many applications the delay and jitter of an IP network can exceed the operational response and timeout limitations of the attached systems and modem passthrough will not operate successfully, even for low data rate modems. Additionally, any significant packet loss during the call is likely to be fatal to the transmission. The problem is particularly acute where the packet network experiences relatively long delays, such as over satellite links, or where there is a wide variation in delay and a possibility of packet loss, such as with some wireless data services.","A common method of using modem passthrough is to connect an analog modem to an analog voice port on an IP router. IP routers designed to carry voice traffic using Voice over IP standards (VoIP) often work in the mode described above, where the incoming analog signal is converted directly to a G.711 compatible digital stream without any further processing. However many VoIP devices also compress the G.711 data to minimize the amount of data sent over the packet network, which may typically reduce the delay and jitter experienced. G.723, G.726, G.728, G.729 are examples of voice compression standards that are commonly used in VoIP systems, but there are a large number of other algorithms and standards in use. Using such voice compression techniques the data rate is reduced from full rate to a fraction. Many commonly used algorithms operate at an eighth rate or less. G.729 Annex B, for example, operates at 8 Kbps. All commonly used VoIP compression algorithms function by discarding information during the compression process with the result that the audio signal output at the receiving end of the link is a distortion of the input audio signal to some extent. The algorithms are structured to retain those qualities that optimize voice recognition by the human ear and not to retain the exact frequency and phase qualities of the incoming signal. As a result, the decoders of analog modems normally cannot decode signals that have been transmitted over VoIP systems that use compression. Even the very slowest DTMF and FSK modems do not operate when an attempt is made to use Modem Passthrough over a VoIP network with voice compression enabled.","In the second conventional method, modem relay maybe used to transfer dial modem traffic over a packet network. With Modem Relay the modem output is demodulated at the local router or gateway and is converted back to the original digital data before transmitting over the packet network. At the receiving router or gateway, the process is reversed and the modem signal is recreated converting the data stream back into the modem format required by the host or server system. A benefit of modem relay is the reduced amount of data that needs to be sent over the packet network. For this reason alone, modem relay systems are less likely to suffer from lost packets, which increase the likelihood of a transaction being successful. Nevertheless, the operational response and timeout limits of an application may cause a Modem Relay communication to fail, simply due to the unavoidable delay and jitter introduced by the use of the packet data network.","The wide deployment of embedded dial modems and similar communications devices that rely on tone based communications over PSTN lines makes it desirable to find an alternative method of connection that is easily deployed and more dependable. IP networks, and cellular wireless data services in particular, are the most widely deployed with very competitive pricing for relatively low bandwidth applications such as those described above. They are also ideal for emergency and backup applications. However IP networks, and cellular wireless data networks in particular, are not geared to support the transportation of frequency and phase sensitive communications signals or to supporting an analog system with critical timing windows, with the result that the conventional techniques of modem passthrough and modem relay do not work successfully for many such applications.","An alternative solution is needed to overcome shortcomings of conventional solutions.","The present invention sets forth various exemplary embodiments of apparat(us\/i), system(s), method(s) and computer program product(s) for the transmission of audio tone based communications over a packet based data network.","An exemplary embodiment sets forth an automated system that may include a first system that may analyze the incoming signal from a first analog communications device operable to decode the incoming signal and may transmit the decoded information over a packet data network according to rules defined for the first system, and may further include a second system that may receive the information from the packet data network operable to generate an analog signal and transmit the signal to a second analog communications device, where such analog signal maybe generated according to the received data and rules defined for the second system.","In an exemplary embodiment, the second system may also receive an incoming signal from the second analog communications device operable to decode the incoming signal and may transmit the decoded information over a packet data network according to rules defined for the second system, and the first system may receive information from the packet data network operable to generate an analog signal to the first communications device, where such analog signal maybe generated according to the received data and rules defined for the first system.","In an exemplary embodiment, the packet data network may be any network, such as, e.g., but not limited to, an internet protocol (IP) network that may operate over a terrestrial, a cable, a wireless and\/or a satellite link and may have varying delay depending on the network performance at any particular time.","In an exemplary embodiment, the rules for the system may include a mechanism whereby decoded tone information may be held prior to transmission according to, e.g., but not limited to, a learned and\/or pre-programmed timer value, and\/or held indefinitely, and\/or transmitted immediately upon recognition, dependent on operational parameters programmed into the exemplary system.","In another exemplary embodiment, the the first and second systems may be combined at the second location and the first analog communications device may connect to a packet data network using, e.g., but not limited to, a VoIP connection such that tone sequences may be received by the first system directly from a packet data network as compressed voice (VoIP) data and\/or from a PSTN connection after passing through a VoIP to PSTN gateway device.","An exemplary embodiment sets forth an automated system, method, and\/or computer program product for transmitting and receiving public switched telephone network (PSTN) compatible audio signals over a packet data network, which may include, in an exemplary embodiment, a first system operative to: receive incoming PSTN-compatible audio frequency signals;

Packet data networks, such as X.25, Frame Relay and most recently IP (Internet Protocol), are widely accessible using terrestrial cable, wireless and satellite connections. They provide immediate, enhanced capability and are generally more cost effective than dial up telephone lines.","Whereas voice and modern computer communications can be easily moved from analog connections to digital packet networks, dial modems and similar tone based analog communications equipment is not so easily transferred. Although there are some standard methods employed to move systems from dial-up lines to packet data services, problems often arise that prevent the transfer being successful. In many cases the only dependable solution is for the analog equipment to be completely removed from the network, with a significant upgrade necessary to the installed equipment.","However the substantial investments in embedded dial modems and similar devices that rely on tone based communications often may make it impractical and\/or cost prohibitive to replace the installed equipment with newer data technology. The present invention addresses this problem by providing a transparent and dependable system and method of transporting analog communications signals over a packet data network such that the attached systems operate as the systems did prior to the incorporation of use of the packet data network, with none of the significant and often expensive changes and\/or upgrades required by conventional solutions.","Overview of Exemplary Embodiments","The exemplary embodiments may provide an apparatus, a method and\/or computer program product for the transmission of analog and\/or audio tone based communications over a packet based data network.

Thus, the data rate is four times the baud rate.","In the case of PSK, ASK or QAM, where the carrier frequency of the modulated signal is constant, the modulation alphabet is often conveniently represented on a constellation diagram, showing the amplitude of the I signal at the x-axis, and the amplitude of the Q signal at the y-axis, for each symbol.","Modulator and Detector Principles of Operation","PSK and ASK, and sometimes also FSK, are often generated and detected using the principle of QAM. The I and Q signals can be combined into a complex-valued signal I+jQ (where j is the imaginary unit). The resulting so called equivalent lowpass signal or equivalent baseband signal is a complex-valued representation of the real-valued modulated physical signal (the so called passband signal or RF signal).","Exemplary general steps and\/or features, which may be used by the modulator to transmit data may include, e.g., but not limited to:\n\n","At the receiver side, the demodulator may typically perform, e.g., but not limited to:\n\n","As is common to all digital communication systems, the design of both the modulator and demodulator must be done simultaneously. Digital modulation schemes are possible because the transmitter-receiver pair have prior knowledge of how data is encoded and represented in the communications system. In all digital communication systems, both the modulator at the transmitter and the demodulator at the receiver are structured so that they perform inverse operations.","Non-coherent modulation methods do not require a receiver reference clock signal that is phase synchronized with the sender carrier wave. In this case, modulation symbols (rather than bits, characters, or data packets) are asynchronously transferred. The opposite is coherent modulation.","List of Common Digital Modulation Techniques","The most common digital modulation techniques are:\n\n","MSK and GMSK are particular cases of continuous phase modulation. Indeed, MSK is a particular case of the sub-family of CPM known as continuous-phase frequency-shift keying (CPFSK) which is defined by a rectangular frequency pulse (i.e. a linearly increasing phase pulse) of one symbol-time duration (total response signaling).","OFDM is based on the idea of frequency-division multiplexing (FDM), but is utilized as a digital modulation scheme. The bit stream is split into several parallel data streams, each transferred over its own sub-carrier using some conventional digital modulation scheme. The modulated sub-carriers are summed to form an OFDM signal. OFDM is considered as a modulation technique rather than a multiplex technique, since it transfers one bit stream over one communication channel using one sequence of so-called OFDM symbols. OFDM can be extended to multi-user channel access method in the orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) and multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) schemes, allowing several users to share the same physical medium by giving different sub-carriers or spreading codes to different users.","Of the two kinds of RF power amplifier, switching amplifiers (Class C amplifiers) cost less and use less battery power than linear amplifiers of the same output power. However, they only work with relatively constant-amplitude-modulation signals such as angle modulation (FSK or PSK) and CDMA, but not with QAM and OFDM. Nevertheless, even though switching amplifiers are completely unsuitable for normal QAM constellations, often the QAM modulation principle are used to drive switching amplifiers with these FM and other waveforms, and sometimes QAM demodulators are used to receive the signals put out by these switching amplifiers.","First Exemplary Embodiment for Connecting or Coupling Analog Audio Tone Based Communications Systems over a Packet Data Network","In an exemplary embodiment, devices  (i.e., , ) may provide the ability to receive PSTN  signals, such as, for example, e.g., but not limited to, from an analog line or from a TDM link, and decode these signals. While exemplary attributes such as PSTN  line, analog line, FXS, FXO, E&M, TDM link, or T1 and E1 trunks may be described, the foregoing terminology are employed for illustrative purposes only and are in no way to be construed as limitations of the present embodiments.","In an exemplary embodiment, devices , may provide the ability to convert between transmission protocols, such as, e.g., but not limited to, from a TDM data structure to IP, and back again. An exemplary feature of the equipment described may be the ability to provide a connection path for TDM links as transparently as possible to the systems connected at both ends, regardless of the transport medium and any intermediate protocols used to provide the connection. Two variables that may be accommodated in order for the proposed solution to be flexible and operate with a wide variety of potential network solutions include, e.g., but are not limited to, (i) accommodation for a wide potential variation in time delay across the network path, and (ii) buffering to allow the continuous operation of the transmission protocol, such as, e.g., exemplary TDM circuits, while receiving and transmitting discontinuous data packets over the network, such as, e.g., exemplary IP connection or coupling (for example, to compensate for gaps between blocks of information received from the IP packet data network  that need to be continuously transmitted without a break over the TDM circuit).","As outlined above, the basic method of operation of an IP packet based data network ,  may include that of accumulating information for a period of time and then transmitting it in a burst of data known as a packet. There is therefore a period of accumulation during which time the data may be stored at the transmitting end of the link, a processing delay while the \u201cpacket\u201d is created, a period of packet transmission, a period of accumulation at the receiving end of the link, a period of processing at the receiving end of the link and finally a period of transmission to the local equipment. The actual delays incurred may vary considerably from packet to packet. In addition to the variations in packet delay incurred during the process described above, additional very significant delays may be incurred traversing the network architecture, specifically in the case of some wireless and satellite links but also over international links such as, e.g., but not limited to, through gateways between public IP data networks (not shown).","In an exemplary embodiment, device  (, , or collectively \u201c\u201d) can receive audio tones from PSTN lines and decode these tones as DTMF, FSK, PSK, QAM or other encoded signal types and which signal types are all considered analog audio tones or signals for the current description. Device  can also transmit audio tones to PSTN  lines and encode these tones as DTMF, FSK, PSK, QAM or other encoded signal types and which signal types are all considered analog audio tones or signals for the current description.","Referring to , in this embodiment both the alarm system  and alarm monitoring center  equipment may be connected or coupled to the described devices and may exchange transmissions by operating as Modem Relay. In Modem Relay, analog tones may be received by device , decoded, converted to a symbol stream and may be transmitted to the other device over the network . At the receiving side of network  the received symbols, and at device may be buffered in an exemplary jitter buffer (not shown) within device for a period of time to accommodate variations in delay over network , after which the symbols may be transmitted to the attached system  as PSTN audio tones using the appropriate modem protocol for the modem  of system .","In Modem Relay, decoded tone information may be transmitted between the devices in the order they are received and with sufficient information that the tone sequences may be regenerated at the receiving side of network  to duplicate the timing and modem format of the original PSTN signal received from the attached system . Any delay beyond that accommodated by the exemplary jitter buffer of , or any loss of symbol data at a receiving device may lead to a break in the timely transmission of the modem signal to the attached system , which may in turn cause an interruption and eventual failure in the application. Such failure in the application may typically be caused by irrecoverable loss of critical application data and\/or a procedural timeout during the call.","In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention conventional Modem Relay may be modified to prevent procedural timeouts in some applications. In the applications of interest, which may include some exemplary alarm systems, among other systems, the first communication may be initiated by an event at the alarm system  which may cause a PSTN call to be made to the alarm monitoring center . In the following description the TRANSMITTER shall therefore be considered the alarm system  and the RECEIVER shall be considered the monitoring center  although persons skilled in the art will recognize that \u201ctransmitter\u201d and \u201creceiver\u201d are terms that could correctly be applied to multiple locations within the systems or alternatively both transmitter and receiver could be transceivers in an exemplary embodiment.","Referring again to , in the exemplary system  (of ) including the elements Alarm Panel , one or more connections , and one or more Dial Modems  of , (collectively referred to as the TRANSMITTER )in , may go off hook to initiate a PSTN call to the RECEIVER . Upon receipt of a dial tone from the PSTN  the TRANSMITTER may send a dial stream to the PSTN  to connect the two dial modems , . After the dial string has been output by the TRANSMITTER the TRANSMITTER may wait for a fixed time period T for the connection to be established. The signal to the TRANSMITTER that the connection has been established may be a handshake sequence of one or more tones from the RECEIVER, which may indicate to the TRANSMITTER that the RECEIVER is on line and the communication channel is open. If the TRANSMITTER does not receive the expected handshake response from the RECEIVER within the time period T, the TRANSMITTER may hang up the call.","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment  the TRANSMITTER  may go off hook to initiate a PSTN call to the RECEIVER , which event may be recognized by the first device . In this embodiment, device may return dial tone to the TRANSMITTER while also establishing a communication with the second device . Upon communication between devices the second device may go off hook with the RECEIVER, which in this exemplary embodiment may be a PSTN connection or coupling. Upon the first device returning dial tone to the TRANSMITTER, the TRANSMITTER may send a dial string to the device which may be decoded by the device . Each decoded digit may be transmitted to the second device by the first device , for example, immediately upon decoding, which may be before the tone has completed. The second device may immediately dial each digit as it arrives such that the difference between connections may approximate to the delay over the network .","In the above exemplary embodiment a first PSTN connection may be established between the TRANSMITTER and the first device and a second PSTN connection may be established between the RECEIVER and the second device with a time difference that may vary based on factors which may include the delay over the network  and the exemplary attributes of the connection.","In an alternative exemplary embodiment  the TRANSMITTER  may go off hook to initiate a PSTN call to the RECEIVER,  which event may be recognized by the first device . In this embodiment device  may return dial tone to the TRANSMITTER while also establishing a communication with the second device . In this embodiment the second device  may be directly connected to the RECEIVING modem device such that no dial string is necessary and in which case the second device  may delay establishing contact with the locally attached modem until all dialed digits have been received by the first device .","In an alternative exemplary embodiment  the TRANSMITTER may go off hook to initiate a PSTN call to the RECEIVER, which event is recognized by the first device . In this embodiment, extended delays over the network  may create the potential for a timeout due to T. In an embodiment of the invention designed to minimize the likelihood of timeout T due to delay in responses to the TRANSMITTER, previously learned and\/or stored information regarding the next event to take place may be utilized by the devices . In this exemplary embodiment, upon recognition by the first device that the line is off hook, the device  may delay returning dial tone to the TRANSMITTER for a pre-programmed or learned period T that may approximate to the delay over the network. Messages between the devices may include the previously called PSTN number such that the RECEIVING device may go off hook and start dialing the stored PSTN number in approximate synchronization with the TRANSMITTING device returning dial tone and accepting incoming dial string from the TRANSMITTER. In the event that the dial stream received from the TRANSMITTING device and previously learned or stored information do not match the call may be terminated by the devices ","In various exemplary embodiments, upon connection of the RECEIVER  to the second device the RECEIVER  may transmit a sequence of one or more signals to confirm to the TRANSMITTER  that the communications channel is open. Upon first detection and decoding of this signal the second device may immediately send a message to the first device before the signal has completed to indicate that such a signal is being received so that the first device may start to send the appropriate handshake signal to the TRANSMITTER before time T is expired. Messages may be transmitted between the devices to indicate parameters of the signals to be transmitted and received such as, for example, but not limited to, start, stop, time or parameters of modulation. Defaults for such parameters may also be learned or preconfigured in the devices ","In the exemplary system , in  and  upon receipt of handshake confirmation that the communications channel is open the TRANSMITTER  may start to send data according to the format of the data protocol being used. In the exemplary embodiment of system  the direct real time connection between modems ,  ensures that there is no network delay between the TRANSMITTER  and the RECEIVER . Accordingly, after completing transmission of the opening handshake signal the RECEIVER  may expect a response from the TRANSMITTER  within a relatively short waiting period T. If the RECEIVER  does not receive a response within the period T it may hang up the call.","In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, to minimize the likelihood of time T being exceeded at the RECEIVER  it may be necessary for decoded tone information to be transmitted between devices immediately when the decoded information is available, rather than waiting for the completion of a tone or tone sequence. Exemplary immediate transmission may be accomplished by using fast DSP techniques that can analyze incoming tone frequencies and other potential attributes within a very short period of time compared with the duration of the tone itself. In a more conventional store and forward arrangement, each tone or tone sequence may complete prior to forwarding, such that delays may accumulate and timers are more likely to expire. Expiration of timers may be of particular significance to the handshake responses, which typically may use longer symbol lengths than other data exchanges. Typical relay systems may await the duration of such signals to ensure that they meet the requirements of the underlying data protocol prior to forwarding the information. In embodiment of the present invention, early detection and forwarding of start information may minimize such delay.","Although tone information may be sent in advance of completion, it should be noted that the integrity of the communication is not generally compromised using the methods according to exemplary embodiment, because information is only transmitted after valid detection of a signal has been decoded. This is in contrast to alternative methods that may provide automatic local acknowledgement of communications and thereby take responsibility for delivery using for example, a store and forward system to deliver messages to the intended recipients.","In an exemplary embodiment, data sequences may also be forwarded in this manner. However, timing may be more tightly controlled, and received symbols may be stored in an exemplary jitter buffer by the receiving device prior to retransmission to the RECEIVER  to prevent a break in mid transmission caused by jitter across the network. In accordance with embodiment the present invention the length of the exemplary jitter buffer may be set to a preprogrammed value or a learned value that may be determined from, for example, the performance of the network or other system parameters.","Referring back to  and , in an exemplary system , the TRANSMITTER  may send a data message to the RECEIVER  over the PSTN  network and expect an acknowledgement or so-called \u201cKissoff\u201d message from the RECEIVER  within a time period T. If such acknowledgement is not received within this time period the TRANSMITTER  may retransmit the message.","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment of system , the TRANSMITTER  may send a data message to the RECEIVER  over the network and expect an acknowledgement or \u201cKissoff\u201d message from the RECEIVER  within a time period T. The above described methods of forwarding tone information between devices  as early as possible, including the kissoff message, may help avoid a timeout T from occurring. Nevertheless, the combination of extended network delays, and\/or jitter compensation added to the time required for host computer turnaround, may still cause timeouts to occur in practical applications.","In the event that T timer expires and in accordance with the present invention, the first device connected or coupled to the TRANSMITTER  may recognize that notification of a kissoff signal has not been received from the second device and that the previous data sequence is being repeated. Under such circumstances the first device may decode and hold the repeated data sequence and not transmit this to the second device Additionally, should the first device receive the kissoff notification while the TRANSMITTER  is resending the data message, the first device may hold off sending the kissoff tone to the TRANSMITTER  until the second data transfer is completed. In the event that this occurs, the kissoff acknowledgment when received by the TRANSMITTER  may be accepted as acknowledgement of the second, repeated data sequence rather than acknowledgement of the first data sequence. In the event that kissoff does not arrive at the first device prior to expiration of the second T timer, the device may discard and not transmit the second data sequence to the second device and may either wait for additional transmissions from the TRANSMITTER  or for the call to be ended by the TRANSMITTER .","It should be noted that the integrity of the kissoff process is not compromised using these methods, since kissoff is only transmitted to the TRANSMITTER  after valid decoding of an incoming kissoff signal by the second device has been determined and been forwarded to the first device . An advantage of this method is that it is fail-safe in the sense that the TRANSMITTER may not be erroneously notified that the data message has been accepted by the RECEIVER based on a local response from the first device . This may be in contrast to other methods that may provide automatic local acknowledgement of communications and thereby taking responsibility for delivery of the message using for example, a store and forward system to deliver critical messages to the intended recipients.","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment, diagram  illustrates that upon receipt of kissoff acknowledgement, the TRANSMITTER  may send a subsequent data message according to the format of the data protocol being used and repeat the data transfer and kissoff sequence multiple times. Provided the RECEIVER does not exceed any timer thresholds and end the call prematurely, the data transfer and kissoff sequence may occur multiple times, each of which may be handled by the devices , in the same manner as the first data message. Eventually the TRANSMITTER may end the call when the final kissoff message has been received, at which time the second device will end the call with the RECEIVER.","Second Exemplary Embodiments for Connecting Analog Audio Tone Based Communications Systems Over a Packet Data Network","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment , device provides the ability to receive VoIP packets directly, such as, for example, but not limited to from a VoIP service provider, and act as a VoIP gateway converting these packets to PSTN  compatible signals (not illustrated), or as illustrated, receive the regenerated audio signal directly from the PSTN  as an analog line or a TDM link. While exemplary attributes such as VoIP and compression may be described, the foregoing terminology is employed for illustrative purposes only and is in no way to be construed as limitations of the present embodiments.","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment, operation of the TRANSMITTER  and RECEIVER  systems may be identical to the descriptions already given with reference to . In the exemplary embodiment of , an audio signal received by the device across the network  (including , , , and ) may have been compressed and decompressed by, for example, a VoIP or cellular telephone system. Referring to , a direct connection or coupling of the PSTN  link  to the dial modem link  may cause modem communications to fail due to the inability of the modems  to correctly decode the incoming audio signals, such failure to decode the incoming signals being due to the reduced quality in the audio caused by, for example, but not limited to, lost or delayed packets, and\/or loss of signal, or signal fidelity from the VoIP compression and decompression processes.","In an exemplary embodiment of , device may combine functions of the two devices , described in previous text. An addition, devices may decode the incoming tones from the PSTN  using exemplary advanced digital signal processing (DSP) techniques that may overcome the distortion created by the VoIP systems, and may regenerate clean tones that the modem at the RECEIVER  can decode.","Referring to , in an exemplary embodiment data tone sequences in the direction from the TRANSMITTER  to the RECEIVER  may be more complex and may be shorter in duration than the handshake and kissoff tones sent in the reverse direction. As a result, these longer response tones from RECEIVER  to TRANSMITTER  may be more successfully decoded without using a second device  at the TRANSMITTER , in an exemplary embodiment. However if the received signal quality and other operational characteristics of the system cause the modem at the TRANSMITTER  to fail to decode signals correctly, a second device (not shown) may be located in link  to provide clean signal regeneration and\/or other previously described functions at both the RECEIVER  and TRANSMITTER  sides of the network .","An Exemplary Computer System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0221","num":"0270"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","114"]},"The present embodiments (or any part(s) or function(s) thereof) may be implemented using hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof and may be implemented in one or more computer systems or other processing systems.
