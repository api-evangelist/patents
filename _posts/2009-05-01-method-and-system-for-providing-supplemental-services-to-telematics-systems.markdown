Companies with a large number of mobile assets frequently track their mobile assets in order to efficiently manage them. One of the areas that is becoming increasingly important in mobile asset management is the exchange of information. The exchange of information allows business owners to obtain information regarding the mobile assets, such as mileage, location, diagnostics, fuel, etc. The exchange of information can be between the mobile assets and the asset managers, between mobile assets and other mobile assets, or between mobile assets and other entities that provide asset management or information services. Furthermore, the exchange of information may be between portable devices and asset managers to provide further services to the mobile asset owners or customers.","In a typical telematics system, the telematics hardware is a proprietary system that communicates information (e.g., vehicle location, diagnostic information, device specific information, etc.) in a proprietary format. The proprietary nature of existing telematics systems generally limits communications to communications between an asset, a user (customer), and the telematics provider; communication of information to third parties is not typical. In order for a third party to communicate with these proprietary telematics systems, the third party must typically implement costly and complex software to enable communications with existing proprietary software. Moreover, different types of software are needed for each type of proprietary system.","Thus, there is a need for a solution and method for more easily exchanging telematics information that is inclusive of vehicle information, global positioning system (GPS) information, and other information that is relevant to telematics solutions.","The embodiments of the present invention relate to a method and system for providing supplemental services to telematics systems.","The method and system for providing supplemental services to telematics systems may be used in conjunction with any existing telematics system (hardware and software) already used for one or more assets. In one exemplary embodiment, telematics data needed for the supplemental services may be received by a third party provider of supplemental services directly from a telematics hardware provider, OEM, or any other data provider via a business-to-business (B2B) exchange of information using a predetermined data format such as Extensible Markup Language (XML). The data may then be processed and\/or analyzed by the third party provider of supplemental services, or the data may be routed to other third party providers of supplemental services, or the data may be routed to one or more customers. Data routed to third parties or customers may be reformatted to the particular data format preferred by the third parties or customers.","In another exemplary embodiment, the system comprises one or more telematics hardware devices, one or more telematics hardware providers, and one or more telematics directdata processes. A telematics directdata process may act as a data receiving, processing, and\/or routing tool for the exchange of telematics data that may be in multiple formats or contain multiple attributes. In another exemplary embodiment, a telematics directdata process may provide functionality above and beyond telematics by integrating additional information or data with telematics data, then routing that additional data and\/or telematics data to a third party of supplemental services or to a third party application that uses the data to provide supplemental services, to provide better analysis and functionalities to customers. One exemplary embodiment may be illustrated by . In accordance with the following description, a technical effect of the system  is to receive telematics data, process and\/or route the telematics data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","105","110","105","110","115","120"]},"As further shown in , the telematics hardware provider  and  may transmit and\/or receive data to and\/or from the telematics directdata process  through a network . Network  may be any type of network such as local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), wireless network, the internet, or any other types of network that may be used for transmitting and\/or receiving data. In this exemplary embodiment, the network  is the internet. Any type of telematics data may be transmitted by the telematics hardware to or from the telematics provider. For example, the telematics data may include speed or location data, diagnostics data such engine temperature, asset fuel level, and diagnostic trouble codes typical in vehicles, and data related to other sensors on an asset that are not part of the vehicle's diagnostic system.","When the telematics hardware providers  and  transmit data through the network , the data is transmitted in a specified directdata format. The directdata format may be any data format predetermined or agreed upon between the telematics hardware providers and the telematics directdata process . For example, the telematics directdata format may be non-proprietary, such as XML. The telematics directdata process  may reside on a computer, microprocessor, server or any other devices with computing capabilities. In an exemplary embodiment, the telematics directdata process  may reside on a server with one or more storage medium. The software that is required for the telematics directdata process  may be stored in the storage medium. The telematics directdata process may comprise one or more application programming interface (API) and\/or any other software. In addition, the storage medium may also store one or more databases such as the datawarehouse  and routing table . However, the datawarehouse  and the routing table  may not necessarily reside on the same server as the telematics directdata process . The datawarehouse  or the routing table  may be stored in separate servers, computers, or storage mediums, even at one or more remote locations. If the datawarehouse  or the routing table  is located at a remote location, the telematics directdata process  may communicate with the datawarehouse  or the routing table  through any wired or wireless communication network. For example, a LAN, WAN or the internet may be utilized.","After the telematics directdata process  receives data in the predetermined directdata format from the telematics hardware providers, the telematics directdata process  may begin processing the data. For example, the telematics directdata process  may parse the data, then store the data in datawarehouse . For example, if the telematics directdata process  receives data in XML format, the directdata process  may then parse the data according to the XML attributes, then store the data in the datawarehouse  according to the structure of the datawarehouse . For example, datawarehouse may comprise one or more relational databases, and the telematics directdata process  may update one or more databases with the data that has been parsed. In addition to receiving data from the telematics hardware providers, the system may also receive additional data from one or more customers that is necessary to perform certain analyses.","The telematics directdata process  may also route data to third-party applications (not shown) that perform analysis to the telematics data. The application or applications may be local to the directdata process server or computer, or the application may be located remotely and the data transmitted to the remote location via a suitable connection such as a LAN, WAN, or the internet. By way of example, an application may perform statistical analysis based on data it receives from the datawarehouse . Such statistical analysis may include fuel consumption, distance traveled, average speed, arrival statistics, etc. Alternatively, the application may be able to retrieve data from the datawarehouse  as needed to perform the statistical analysis or other function that is performed by the application.","For example, the telematics directdata process  may route the data to third party applications according to the instructions stored in the routing table  or the datawarehouse . In one embodiment, the telematics directdata process  may transmit the data through the network  to third party applications  in the predetermined data format or other data format specified in the routing table  or datawarehouse . The third party applications  may reside on the datawarehouse , or the third party applications may reside on other servers or computers locally or remotely. After the third party applications  have performed analysis or data processing, the third party applications  may transmit the output of the application, the additional services, to the customers directly, or the output can be made available to the customers through a user interface such as through the Internet. This interface can be through an interface for the third party application specifically, or even through an interface used by the existing telematics provider, in which case the output is sent to the provider. These customer preferences may be stored in the routing table  or datawarehouse  such that the telematics directdata process  may route data according to the stored customer preferences. Multiple third party applications may be sent data or may be allowed to obtain data from the datawarehouse through the directdata process. For example, an exemplary third party application may handle accident reports and another exemplary third party application may handle fuel efficiency analysis. Other third party applications may determine safety conditions or provide statistical analysis regarding the safety conditions of a particular asset. Other examples of third party applications may include applications that analyze performance of an asset, desirable and undesirable vehicle events, vehicle routing or vehicle scheduling. Examples of third party applications may also include, but not limited to, third party applications that determine modifiable conditions related to safety, modifiable use conditions related to fuel economy, performance indicator for an asset, undesired vehicle events, optimal routing of vehicles, optimal schedule of service stops. Exemplary output of the third party applications may include, but not limited to, statistical metrics of the relatively safety of an asset or fleet, statistical metrics of the relatively fuel economy of an asset or fleet, actionable metrics that affect the performance indicator, undesired vehicle events of an asset or fleet, directions showing the optimal routing of a vehicle in a fleet, or a schedule of service stops for a vehicle or fleet.","Datawarehouse  may store additional information that may be used in performing further analysis of data received from customers, telematics providers, or other sources such as other devices that are able to communicate with the directdata process server. For example, the datawarehouse  may include data such as expected vehicle stops for deliveries, stop times, load, etc. That data may be used by third party applications to perform fleet scheduling and\/or routing optimization, i.e. the application may analyze the additional data regarding vehicle stops, stop times, load, etc. and the telematics data regarding location, speed, etc. and calculate the optimal schedule and route for that particular vehicle. In another exemplary embodiment, vehicle data such as fuel level, speed, and\/or location may be integrated with other data such as fuel card purchases, accident data, scheduling data and\/or routing data to provide better route planning, scheduling, and\/or fuel efficiency analysis.","The additional data may be provided by one or more customers using any data transfer techniques and\/or protocols. For example, the additional data may be uploaded by the customer using file transfer protocol (FTP), or alternatively, a user interface may be provided for the customer to enter the additional data. In one embodiment, the customer may be able to upload that data directly to the third party in possession of the datawarehouse  through the directdata process. In another embodiment, the customer may upload the data to the existing telematics provider, which then transmits the data to the datawarehouse  through the directdata process.","In addition, the system  may also comprise a routing table . In an exemplary embodiment, the routing table  may be stored in one or more databases. The routing table  may store information regarding how the data should be transmitted. For example, the routing table may include information such as the data format to be used for transmission, the frequency of the data transfers, the destination for the data, any encryption that may be used in transmitting or receiving data, etc. In other words, the data in the routing table  may provide information to instruct the telematics directdata process  on how the data should be transmitted, where the data should be transmitted, how often the data should be transmitted, what types of data should be transmitted, how the data should be encrypted, etc.","Another exemplary embodiment of the system and method of providing supplemental services to telematics systems may be illustrated by the diagram shown in . As shown in , the system  may comprise one or more telematics hardware devices , one or more telematics hardware providers , one or more networks  and , one or more telematics directdata process , one or more routing tables , one or more third party applications , and one or more customers . In this exemplary embodiment, each telematics hardware device  may transmit and\/or receives data to and\/or from its corresponding telematics hardware provider . The data received from or transmitted to the telematics hardware provider  may be in one or more proprietary data formats. Each telematics hardware provider may have its own proprietary data formats and different from other telematics hardware providers.","As further shown in , the telematics hardware provider  may transmit and\/or receive data to and\/or from the telematics directdata process  through a network . The network may be any wired or wireless network that has data transfer capabilities. For example, a LAN, WAN, the internet, or any other network may be used. The telematics hardware provider  may receive or transmit data in a specified predetermined directdata format. The directdata format may be any data format predetermined or agreed upon; for example, the predetermined directdata format may be XML format.","After the telematics directdata process  receives data in the predetermined directdata format, the telematics directdata process  may then process the data. For example, the telematics directdata process  may parse the data, then store the data in datawarehouse . For example, if the telematics directdata process  receives data in XML format, the directdata process  may then parse the data according to the XML attributes, then store the data in the datawarehouse  according to the structure of the datawarehouse . The datawarehouse may comprise one or more relational databases, and the telematics directdata process  may update one or more databases with the data that has been parsed. Then the telematics directdata process  may also route data to customers or third-party applications through a network . Similar to the network , the network  may be any wired or wireless network capable of transferring data. In this example, the network  is the internet, but any other types of network may be used. In addition, although the example shows third party application being remote from the telematics directdata process, the application or applications may be local to the directdata process server or computer, or some applications may be local and some may be remote. As an example, one the third party application may be local and provide statistical reports based on accident data received and\/or stored, while another third party application that is remote may provide fuel usage statistics, average speed, schedule adherence evaluation, and other types of data analysis.","Continuing the exemplary illustration in , the routing table  may store information regarding how the data should be transmitted. For example, the routing table  may contain information such as data format, destination, frequency of data transfer, types of data being transferred, etc. In other words, the routing table may provide instructions for the telematics directdata process  regarding how the data should be transmitted, where the data should be transmitted, what types of data should be transmitted, in what data format the data should be transmitted, how often the data should be transmitted, etc. The routing table  may reside in one or more databases, and may reside on the same computer or server as the telematics directdata process , or the routing table  may reside on a different computer or server, or, as another alternative, the routing table  may be stored at one or more remote locations. If the routing table  is stored at a remote location, the telematics directdata process  may communicate with the routing table  through any wired or wireless network. For example, a LAN, WAN, the internet or any other data transfer network may be used.","The telematics directdata process  may transmit the processed data through the network  to one or more destinations specified in the routing table . For example, the telematics directdata process  may transmit the processed data through the network  to one or more customers  and\/or one or more third party applications . Alternatively, the telematics directdata process  may transmit the processed data back to one or more telematics hardware providers . The telematics directdata process  may transmit the data in the predetermined directdata format, or the telematics directdata process  may convert the data into other formats as specified in the routing table .","For example, the customer  may have a preferred data format that the customer may prefer to receive data in. In one example, the predetermined directdata format may be XML format, and the customer  may prefer to receive data in binary. Thus, the telematics directdata process  may convert and\/or encode the data from XML format to binary before transmitting the data to customer . In addition, the telematics directdata process  may also encrypt the data before transmitting to provide further data integrity and security measures. The routing table  may store information as to how the customer  may prefer the data to be encrypted. For example, if the customer  may prefer the data to be encrypted using a particular algorithm, the telematics directdata process  may read the encryption instruction from the routing table , then encrypt the data with the algorithm specified in the routing table , and transmit the data to the customer .","Similar to the datawarehouse , data stored in the routing table  may be provided by one or more customers using any data transfer techniques and\/or protocols. For example, the routing table data may be uploaded by the customer using file transfer protocol (FTP), or alternatively, a user interface may be provided for the customer to enter the routing table data. In another alternative, a user interface may be provided by the existing telematics provider for the customer to upload data.","In addition to customers , the telematics directdata process  may transmit data to one or more third party applications  as specified in the routing table . The third party applications  may reside on the same computer or server as the telematics directdata process  or otherwise locally to the directdata process through a LAN; alternatively, the third party applications  may reside on a different computer or server as the telematics directdata process  or even at one or more remote locations. Moreover, a number of third party applications  may reside on the same computer or server as the telematics directdata process  while other third party applications  may reside on different computers, servers, or at one or more remote locations.","The telematics directdata process  may transmit data in the predetermined directdata format, or as an alternative, the telematics directdata process  may convert and\/or encode the data from the predetermined directdata format to another format before transmitting the data. For example, the predetermined directdata format may be XML format, and the third party application  may prefer data input in plain text format. The telematics directdata process  would then convert and\/or encode the data from XML format to plain text format. In addition, the telematics directdata process  may also encrypt the data before transmitting to provide further data integrity and security measures.","Any third party applications may be used in the system . For example, scheduling applications, usage optimization applications, route optimization applications, diagnostics evaluation applications alert applications, etc. may be used. After the third party applications perform further processing and\/or analysis to the data, the processed data and\/or data output may be transmitted to the customer . Alternatively, a user interface may be provided for the customer to access the processed data and\/or data output.","Furthermore, the telematics directdata process  may transmit data back to the telematics hardware provider  as specified in the routing table . The telematics directdata process  may transmit data back to the telematics hardware provider  through the network , and as previously discussed, the network  may be any wired or wireless network with data transfer capabilities. For example, a LAN, WAN, the internet or any other data transfer network may be used.","The telematics directdata process  may transmit data to the telematics hardware provider  in the predetermined directdata format, or as an alternative, the telematics directdata process  may convert and\/or encode the data from the predetermined directdata format to another format specified in the routing table  before transmitting the data. For example, the predetermined directdata format may be XML format and the telematics hardware provider  may prefer data input in its own proprietary format. The telematics directdata process  would then convert and\/or encode the data from XML format to the proprietary format. In addition, the telematics directdata process  may also encrypt the data before transmitting to provide further data integrity and security measures.","In another exemplary embodiment, the telematics directdata process  may process and transmit data in \u201creal-time,\u201d i.e. the telematics directdata process  may process and transmit data as the telematics directdata process  receives the data. In other words, immediately after the telematics directdata process  receives the data, the telematics directdata  may process and transmit the data. In another exemplary embodiment, the telematics directdata  may process and transmit data according to a particular schedule as defined by the customer and stored in the routing table  or datawarehouse . For example, the customer may prefer to receive data every two hours. In this case, the instruction (to send data every two hours) may be stored in the routing table  or datawarehouse , and the telematics directdata process  may process and transmit data for this customer every two hours. In another exemplary embodiment, the telematics directdata process  may process data immediately after the data is received, stored the processed data or data output but only transmit the processed data or data output according to a schedule defined by the customer and stored in the routing table  or datawarehouse . In another example, the telematics directdata  may process data whenever resources in the computing device or server is available, store the processed data or data output, and transmit the processed data or data output at a certain time of the day as defined by the customer and stored in the routing table  or datawarehouse . The customer may define any type of schedule of receiving data according to its preference. Furthermore, the customer may define different schedule for different types of vehicles, devices or data analysis. For example, the customer may prefer to receive processed data every three hours for tractors but receive processed data for reefers every hour. As another example, the customer may prefer to receive fuel usage statistics every week but receive accident reports every month. Any customer preference may be stored in the routing table  or datawarehouse , and the telematics directdata  may process data according to the preferences stored.","Another exemplary embodiment may be illustrated in . As shown in , the system and method for providing supplemental services to telematics systems may receive and\/or transmit data to and\/or from not just telematics hardware, but also various other devices. Following , the system  may comprise one or more telematics hardware devices , one or more telematics hardware providers , one or more devices ,  and , one or more networks , one or more telematics directdata processes , one or more datawarehouses , and one or more routing tables .","Similar to the exemplary embodiment shown in , in the exemplary embodiment of , the telematics hardware  transmits and\/or receives data to and\/or from its corresponding telematics hardware provider . The data received from or transmitted to the telematics hardware provider  may be in one or more proprietary data formats. Each telematics hardware provider may have its own proprietary data formats and different from other telematics hardware providers.","As further shown in , the telematics hardware provider  may transmit and\/or receive data to and\/or from the telematics directdata process  through a network . The network may be any wired or wireless network that has data transfer capabilities. For example, a LAN, WAN, the internet, or any other network may be used. The telematics hardware provider  may receive or transmit data in a specified predetermined directdata format. The directdata format may be any data format predetermined or agreed upon; for example, the predetermined directdata format may be XML format.","Continuing the exemplary embodiment illustrated in , other types of devices , ,  may also transmit and\/or receive data to and\/or from the telematics directdata process  through the network . Any types of devices that are capable of transmitting and\/or receiving data may be used. For example, the devices may be personal navigation devices (PND), RFID devices, cellular phones, personal digital assistant devices (PDAs), bar code scanners, and any other devices that have communication capabilities. In addition, devices with short range communication capabilities, such as radio or Bluetooth, may also be used in the system  by communicating with other devices with long range communication capabilities. For example, a device with only short range Bluetooth capabilities may communicate using Bluetooth with a cellular phone, and the cellular phone may then communicate the information with the telematics directdata process  through the network .","The devices , , and  may receive or transmit data in a specified predetermined directdata format, or alternatively, the devices , , and  may receive or transmit data in any formal, including any proprietary formats. The specified data format may be stored in the routing table  or datawarehouse , such that the telematics directdata process  may process the received data according to the particular format specified in the routing table  or datawarehouse . For example, the device  may transmit data to the telematics directdata process  in a proprietary format A; the device  may transmit data to the telematics directdata process  using binary format; and the device  may transmit data to the telematics directdata process  using XML. Upon receipt of the data, the telematics directdata process  may look up the device in the datawarehouse  or routing table , then decode or parse the data received from device  according to the proprietary format A, decode or parse the data received from device  according to the binary format, and decode or parse the data received from device  according to the XML format.","After the telematics directdata  decodes or parses the data received from telematics hardware provider , devices ,  or , the telematics directdata process  may store the data in the datawarehouse , process the data according to the instructions stored in the datawarehouse  or the routing table , and transmit the data according to the instructions stored in the datawarehouse  or routing table .","The telematics directdata process  may integrate data received from the telematics hardware provider  and data received from other devices , , and  and provide further analysis. For example, the telematics directdata process  may receive telematics data such as speed, location, diagnostics, etc. from the telematics hardware provider  and other data from the devices ,  and  such as inventory information, product information, employee schedules, work schedules etc. After gathering the data from the telematics hardware provider  and the devices ,  and , the telematics directdata process  may analyze the received data and provide analysis such as whether work vehicles have reported to work sites on time, whether particular deliveries arrived on time, or other statistical report or analysis.","In a different exemplary embodiment, the devices ,  or  may act as a substitute for telematics hardware . For example, many devices such as Personal Navigation Devices, mobile phones, and PDAs are GPS-enabled and can provide location-related information. Thus, these devices can be used as a substitute source for obtaining certain telematics data, and can be used in place of telematics hardware  or as a back up to telematics hardware in case of failure. For example, if the telematics hardware  fails for any reason, the telematics directdata process  may still remain in communication with other devices , , or  and may be able to obtain useful data from other devices that may be carried by the personnel within the vehicle. In another example, these devices can be used in lieu of telematics hardware .","Similar to the system illustrated in , in addition to the data received from the telematics hardware provider  and the data received from devices ,  and , the datawarehouse  and\/or routing table  may store additional information that may be used in performing further analysis of the telematics data. The telematics directdata process  may then integrate all different types of data received from the telematics hardware provider , the devices ,  or , and the additional information stored in the datawarehouse  or routing table , and provide further supplemental analysis of data and services for the customers.","After the data is processed, the telematics directdata process  may then transmit the processed data through a network . The network  may be any wired or wireless network capable of transferring data. In this example, the network  is the internet, but any other types of network may be used. In addition to sending data to third party applications, customers or telematics hardware providers, as illustrated in , the telematics directdata process  may send data to other devices ,  or . For example, the telematics directdata process send alert data to a supervisor's PDA, cellular phone or pager.","The telematics directdata process  may transmit the data in the predetermined directdata format, or the telematics directdata process  may convert the data into other formats as specified in the routing table . For example, the particular device may only receive data in binary format. In this case, the telematics directdata process  may convert the data to binary format before sending the data to the device.","Examples of the types of additional telematics services that may be provided by the system and method of the invention are shown in four applications previously filed by the Applicant: United States Patent Application Publication No. 20070173991, filed on Jan. 23, 2006, entitled, \u201cSystem and method for identifying undesired vehicle events;\u201d United States Patent Application Publication No. 20070173993, filed on Jan. 23, 2006, entitled, \u201cMethod and system for monitoring fleet metrics;\u201d United States Patent Application Publication No. 20070203637, filed on Jan. 23, 2006, entitled, \u201cSystem and method for identifying operational usage of fleet vehicles related to accident prevention;\u201d and United States Patent Application Publication No. 20070174004, filed on Jan. 23, 2006, entitled, \u201cSystem and method for identifying fuel savings opportunity in vehicles.\u201d As noted above, this application incorporates by reference in their entity the four previously filed applications.","It is understood that the herein described apparatus and methods are susceptible to various modifications and alternative constructions.
