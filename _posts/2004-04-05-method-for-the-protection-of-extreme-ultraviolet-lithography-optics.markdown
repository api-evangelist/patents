title: Method for the protection of extreme ultraviolet lithography optics
abstract: A coating for the protection of optical surfaces exposed to a high energy erosive plasma. A gas that can be decomposed by the high energy plasma, such as the xenon plasma used for extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL), is injected into the EUVL machine. The decomposition products coat the optical surfaces with a protective coating maintained at less than about 100 Å thick by periodic injections of the gas. Gases that can be used include hydrocarbon gases, particularly methane, PHand HS. The use of PHand HS is particularly advantageous since films of the plasma-induced decomposition products S and P cannot grow to greater than 10 Å thick in a vacuum atmosphere such as found in an EUVL machine.

DE-AC04-94AL85000 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy to Sandia Corporation. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","Not applicable.","This invention is directed generally to the use of a thin layer or coating, such as a carbon layer that can be produced by plasma decomposition of a hydrocarbon gas, or other film-forming gas, for protection of the optics, and particularly the plasma-facing condenser optics used in extreme ultraviolet lithography.","Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) uses 10-14 nm photons to print integrated circuit features having dimensions in the range of 100 nm or smaller. The photons are generated by illuminating xenon with a laser system in a source chamber. A complete description of an EUVL machine can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,031,598, issued to Tichenor et al. Feb. 29, 2000.","Referring now to  that illustrates the arrangement of the source chamber . Laser beam  is directed by turning mirror  into the source chamber that is at sub-atmospheric pressure. Xenon, at high density, as a liquid or molecular clusters, created by cooling of the gas as it expands through a nozzle, is injected into a plasma generator . Interaction of laser beam  with the xenon gas creates a plasma that produces the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation used for EUVL. The EUV radiation is collected by segmented collector  and directed toward pupil optics .","Segmented collector  is composed of a plurality of segments, typically six, each which is a Mo\/Si multilayer mirror (MLM). A typical Mo\/Si MLM used in EUVL is made by sputter depositing 40 pairs of alternating Mo and Si thin films, with a total (Si+Mo) bilayer thickness of \u02dc7 nm and a ratio of (Mo)\/(Mo+Si) thickness of \u02dc0.4. It is preferred that the topmost layer be Si in order to minimize surface oxidation during routine handling. The thickness of this topmost or \u201ccapping\u201d layer is \u22484.3 nm. However, these MLM segments, being proximate the region where the xenon plasma is generated , are exposed to energized atoms, ions, and particles from the plasma that erode, oxidize and thereby degrade the mirror quality and shorten its useful life. A method is required for protecting the plasma-facing optics used in EUVL from the degrading effects of the proximate plasma.","Accordingly, the present invention is directed generally to a method for protecting optical surfaces from the degrading effects of plasma interaction by depositing and maintaining a thin protective layer on the surface of plasma-facing optics. The protective layer must be thin enough so as not to substantially degrade the reflectivity of the optic and, yet, provide protection from the degrading effects of the nearby plasma. A carbon layer produced by the decomposition of methane can be used to provide a protective layer.","The present invention pertains to the use of a gas, preferably a hydrocarbon gas, and most preferably methane, that can be decomposed by an energetic plasma, such as the xenon plasma used for EUVL, to form a coating for optical surfaces. The purpose of this coating is to protect the optical surfaces from the degrading effects of the proximate xenon plasma.","The present invention will be illustrated and exemplified by the following example.","As discussed above, xenon, at high density, as a liquid or a molecular cluster, created by cooling of the gas as it expands through a nozzle, is injected into a plasma generator where interaction of a laser beam with the xenon gas creates a plasma that produces the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation used for EUVL. Methane gas in a partial pressure of about 2% of the xenon pressure was injected into the plasma generator along with the xenon gas. The lithography machine was run for a total of about 1\u00d710shots. The results of that run are shown in . A carbon layer about 500 \u212b thick was produced on the MLM surface. There was no evidence of either erosion or sputtering of the terminal Si layer, as indicated by the approximately 80 \u212b spacing between the first and second Si peaks. Moreover, there was no indication that the terminal Si layer had been oxidized beyond that originally present.","As shown above, a carbon film is produced on surfaces exposed to a combination of a hydrocarbon gas and a plasma. If the plasma is not present a carbon film will not be produced. By way of example, a MLM was exposed to about 1\u00d710T of methane and 13.4 nm radiation (5 mW\/mm) for about 6 hours. No change in EUV reflectivity was observed and Auger, analysis of the MLM surface showed no accumulated carbon. Thus, the invention offers additional advantage in that surfaces exposed to the hydrocarbon gas but not to the plasma will not have a carbon deposited thereon.","It is known in the art that a carbon film about 100 \u212b thick on a MLM will absorb about 6% of incident EUV radiation, thus any carbon film formed on the surface of a MLM should be thinner than 100 \u212b. The process disclosed herein is completely flexible in that the thickness of the protective carbon layer produced by plasma decomposition of the hydrocarbon gas can be controlled by controlling the influx of the hydrocarbon gas. When a carbon layer of desired thickness has been built up the hydrocarbon gas flow can be turned off. After time, the carbon film will be eroded away by the action of the plasma and the flow of hydrocarbon gas can be periodically resumed to restore the carbon film. The thickness of the carbon film can be monitored by thickness monitoring means adjacent the MLM. For example, a quartz crystal thickness monitor can be used to gauge the thickness of the carbon film and a signal from the quartz crystal apparatus can be used to control hydrocarbon gas flow.","In the example above, a hydrocarbon gas (methane) was used to produce a protective carbon film, wherein the partial pressure of the methane gas can be in the range of from about 0.001% to 2%. However, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, other gases can be used to produce protective films that can have the desired protective properties. By way of example, HS and PHwill deposit films of P and S onto surfaces in the presence of a plasma. Moreover, both S and P are less absorptive of EUV radiation that carbon. A 10 \u212b film of P will absorb less than about 0.02% of incident EUV radiation. A S film of the same thickness will absorb less than about 0.04% of the same radiation, while a 10 \u212b film of carbon will absorb greater than 0.6% of the incident EUV radiation. Furthermore, in a system at sub-atmospheric pressure such as would be encountered in an EUVL machine, S or P films greater than 10 \u212b in thickness cannot be grown making the process for growing protective films disclosed herein self terminating."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
