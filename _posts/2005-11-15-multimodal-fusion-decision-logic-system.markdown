abstract: The present invention includes a method of deciding whether a data set is acceptable for making a decision. A first probability partition array and a second probability partition array may be provided. A no-match zone may be established and used to calculate a false-acceptance-rate (“FAR”) and/or a false-rejection-rate (“FRR”) for the data set. The FAR and/or the FAR may be compared to desired rates. Based on the comparison, the data set may be either accepted or rejected. The invention may also be embodied as a computer readable memory device for executing the methods.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","REFERENCES"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60\/643,853, filed on Jan. 14, 2005.","The United States government provided finding related to this invention via US Army, under contract W911NF-04-C-0067, and the United States government may have certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to the use of multiple biometric modalities and multiple biometric matching methods in a biometric identification system. Biometric modalities may include (but are not limited to) such methods as fingerprint identification, iris recognition, voice recognition, facial recognition, hand geometry, signature recognition, signature gait recognition, vascular patterns, lip shape, ear shape and palm print recognition.","Algorithms may be used to combine information from two or more biometric modalities. The combined information may allow for more reliable and more accurate identification of an individual than is possible with systems based on a single biometric modality. The combination of information from more than one biometric modality is sometimes referred to herein as \u201cbiometric fusion\u201d.","Reliable personal authentication is becoming increasingly important. The ability to accurately and quickly identify an individual is important to immigration, law enforcement, computer use, and financial transactions. Traditional security measures rely on knowledge-based approaches, such as passwords and personal identification numbers (\u201cPINs\u201d), or on token-based approaches, such as swipe cards and photo identification, to establish the identity of an individual. Despite being widely used, these are not very secure forms of identification. For example, it is estimated that hundreds of millions of dollars are lost annually in credit card fraud in the United States due to consumer misidentification.","Biometrics offers a reliable alternative for identifying an individual. Biometrics is the method of identifying an individual based on his or her physiological and behavioral characteristics. Common biometric modalities include fingerprint, face recognition, hand geometry, voice, iris and signature verification. The Federal government will be a leading consumer of biometric applications deployed primarily for immigration, airport, border, and homeland security. Wide scale deployments of biometric applications such as the US-VISIT program are already being done in the United States and else where in the world.","Despite advances in biometric identification systems, several obstacles have hindered their deployment. Every biometric modality has some users who have illegible biometrics. For example a recent NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) study indicates that nearly 2 to 5% of the population does not have legible fingerprints. Such users would be rejected by a biometric fingerprint identification system during enrollment and verification. Handling such exceptions is time consuming and costly, especially in high volume scenarios such as an airport. Using multiple biometrics to authenticate an individual may alleviate this problem.","Furthermore, unlike password or PIN based systems, biometric systems inherently yield probabilistic results and are therefore not fully accurate. In effect, a certain percentage of the genuine users will be rejected (false non-match) and a certain percentage of impostors will be accepted (false match) by existing biometric systems. High security applications require very low probability of false matches. For example, while authenticating immigrants and international passengers at airports, even a few false acceptances can pose a severe breach of national security. On the other hand false non matches lead to user inconvenience and congestion.","Existing systems achieve low false acceptance probabilities (also known as False Acceptance Rate or \u201cFAR\u201d) only at the expense of higher false non-matching probabilities (also known as False-Rejection-Rate or \u201cFRR\u201d). It has been shown that multiple modalities can reduce FAR and FRR simultaneously. Furthermore, threats to biometric systems such as replay attacks, spoofing and other subversive methods are difficult to achieve simultaneously for multiple biometrics, thereby making multimodal biometric systems more secure than single modal biometric systems.","Systematic research in the area of combining biometric modalities is nascent and sparse. Over the years there have been many attempts at combining modalities and many methods have been investigated, including \u201cLogical And\u201d, \u201cLogical Or\u201d, \u201cProduct Rule\u201d, \u201cSum Rule\u201d, \u201cMax Rule\u201d, \u201cMin Rule\u201d, \u201cMedian Rule\u201d, \u201cMajority Vote\u201d, \u201cBayes' Decision\u201d, and \u201cNeyman-Pearson Test\u201d. None of these methods has proved to provide low FAR and FRR that is needed for modern security applications.","The need to address the challenges posed by applications using large biometric databases is urgent. The US-VISIT program uses biometric systems to enforce border and homeland security. Governments around the world are adopting biometric authentication to implement National identification and voter registration systems. The Federal Bureau of Investigation maintains national criminal and civilian biometric databases for law enforcement.","Although large-scale databases are increasingly being used, the research community's focus is on the accuracy of small databases, while neglecting the scalability and speed issues important to large database applications. Each of the example applications mentioned above require databases with a potential size in the tens of millions of biometric records. In such applications, response time, search and retrieval efficiency also become important in addition to accuracy.","The present invention includes a method of deciding whether a data set is acceptable for making a decision. For example, the present invention may be used to determine whether a set of biometrics is acceptable for making a decision about whether a person should be allowed access to a facility. The data set may be comprised of information pieces about objects, such as people. Each object may have at least two types of information pieces, that is to say the data set may have at least two modalities. For example, each object represented in the database may by represented by two or more biometric samples, for example, a fingerprint sample and an iris scan sample. A first probability partition array (\u201cPm(i,j)\u201d) may be provided. The Pm(i,j) may be comprised of probability values for information pieces in the data set, each probability value in the Pm(i,j) corresponding to the probability of an authentic match. Pm(i,j) may be similar to a Neyman-Pearson Lemma probability partition array. A second probability partition array (\u201cPfm(i,j)\u201d) may be provided, the Pfm(i,j) being comprised of probability values for information pieces in the data set, each probability value in the Pfm(i,j) corresponding to the probability of a false match. Pfm(i,j) may be similar to a Neyman-Pearson Lemma probability partition array.","A method according to the invention may identify a no-match zone. For example, the no-match zone may be identified by identifying a first index set (\u201cA\u201d), the indices in set A being the (i,j) indices that have values in both Pfm(i,j) and Pm(i,j). A second index set (\u201cZ\u221e\u201d) may be identified, the indices of Z\u221e being the (i,j) indices in set A where both Pfm(i,j) is larger than zero and Pm(i,j) is equal to zero. FAR may be determined, where FAR=1\u2212\u03a3P(i,j). FAR may be compared to a desired false-acceptance-rate (\u201cFAR\u201d), and if FAR is greater than the desired false-acceptance-rate, than the data set may be rejected for failing to provide an acceptable false-acceptance-rate. If FAR is less than or equal to the desired false-acceptance-rate, then the data set may be accepted, if false-rejection-rate is not important.","If false-rejection-rate is important, further steps may be executed to determine whether the data set should be rejected. The method may further include identifying a third index set ZM\u221e, the indices of ZM\u221e being the (i,j) indices in Z\u221e plus those indices where both Pfm(i,j) and Pm(i,j) are equal to zero. A fourth index set (\u201cC\u201d) may be identified, the indices of C being the (i,j) indices that are in A but not ZM\u221e. The indices of C may be arranged such that",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"msub":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["P","fm"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["i","j"],"mo":","}}},"mi":"k"},{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["P","m"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["i","j"],"mo":","}}},"mi":"k"}]},{"msub":[{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["P","fm"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["i","j"],"mo":","}}},{"mi":"k","mo":"+","mn":"1"}]},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["P","m"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["i","j"],"mo":","}}},{"mi":"k","mo":"+","mn":"1"}]}]}],"mo":">="}}},"br":{},"sub":["Z",{"sub2":"\u221e"},"\u222aC",{"sub2":"N"},"(i,j)\u2208Z",{"sub2":"\u221e"},"fm","(i,j)\u2208C",{"sub2":"N"},"fm","(i,j)\u2208C",{"sub2":"N"},"m"]},"In another method according to the invention, the false-rejection-rate calculations and comparisons may be executed before the false-acceptance-rate calculations and comparisons.

Biometric fusion may be viewed as an endeavor in statistical decision theory [1] [2]; namely, the testing of simple hypotheses. This disclosure uses the term simple hypothesis as used in standard statistical theory: the parameter of the hypothesis is stated exactly. The hypotheses that a biometric score \u201cis authentic\u201d or \u201cis from an impostor\u201d are both simple hypotheses.","In a match attempt, the N-scores reported from N<\u221e biometrics is called the test observation. The test observation, x\u2208S, where S\u2282R(Euclidean N-space) is the score sample space, is a vector function of a random variable X from which is observed a random sample (X,X, . . . ,X). The distribution of scores is provided by the joint class-conditional probability density function (\u201cpdf\u201d):\n\n\u0192(x|\u03b8)=\u0192(\u03c7,\u03c7, . . . ,\u03c7|\u03b8)\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere \u03b8 equals either Au to denote the distribution of authentic scores or Im to denote the distribution of impostor scores. So, if \u03b8=Au, Equation (1) is the pdf for authentic distribution of scores and if \u03b8=Im it is the pdf for the impostor distribution. It is assumed that \u0192(x|\u03b8)=\u0192(\u03c7, \u03c7, . . . ,\u03c7|\u03b8)>0 on S.\n","Given a test observation, the following two simple statistical hypotheses are observed: The null hypothesis, H, states that a test observation is an impostor; the alternate hypothesis, H, states that a test observation is an authentic match. Because there are only two choices, the fusion logic will partition S into two disjoint sets: R\u2282S and R\u2282S, where R\u2229R=\u00d8and R\u222aR=S. Denoting the compliment of a set A by A, so that R=Rand R=R.","The decision logic is to accept H(declare a match) if a test observation, x, belongs to Ror to accept H(declare no match and hence reject H) if x belongs to R. Each hypothesis is associated with an error type: A Type I error occurs when His rejected (accept H) when His true; this is a false accept (FA); and a Type II error occurs when His rejected (accept H) when His true; this is a false reject (FR). Thus denoted, respectively, the probability of making a Type I or a Type II error follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":"FAR","mo":"=","msub":{"mi":"P","mrow":{"mi":["Type","I"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}}}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2208","msub":{"mi":["R","Au"]}},"mo":"|","mi":"Im"}}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":"=","mrow":{"msub":{"mo":"\u222b","msub":{"mi":["R","Au"]}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["x","Im"],"mo":"|"}}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"x"}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}}}]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":"FRR","mo":"=","msub":{"mi":"P","mrow":{"mi":["Type","II"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}}}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2208","msub":{"mi":["R","Im"]}},"mo":"|","mi":"Au"}}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":"=","mrow":{"msub":{"mo":"\u222b","msub":{"mi":["R","Im"]}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["x","Au"],"mo":"|"}}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"x"}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}}}]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}]}}},"br":{}},"The class-conditional pdf for each individual biometric, the marginal pdf, is assumed to have finite support; that is, the match scores produced by the ibiometric belong to a closed interval of the real line, \u03b3=[\u03b1,\u03c9], where \u2212\u221e<\u03b1<\u03c9<+\u221e.

Furthermore, it would be beneficial if the fusion scheme could handle the general problem, so there are no restrictions on the underlying statistics. That is to say that:\n\n","A number of combination strategies were examined, all of which are listed by Jain [4] on page 243. Most of the schemes, such as \u201cDemptster-Shafer\u201d and \u201cfuzzy integrals\u201d involve training. These were rejected mostly because of the difficulty in analyzing and controlling their performance mechanisms in order to obtain optimal performance. Additionally, there was an interest in not basing the fusion logic on empirical results. Strategies such as SUM, MEAN, MEDIAN, PRODUCT, MIN, MAX were likewise rejected because they assume independence between biometric features.","When combining two biometrics using a Boolean \u201cAND\u201d or \u201cOR\u201d it is easily shown to be suboptimal when the decision to accept or reject His based on fixed score thresholds. However, the \u201cAND\u201d and the \u201cOR\u201d are the basic building blocks of verification (OR) and identification (AND). Since we are focused on fixed score thresholds, making an optimal decision to accept or reject Hdepends on the structure of: R\u2282S and R\u2282S, and simple thresholds almost always form suboptimal partitions.","If one accepts that accuracy dominates the decision making process and cost dominates the combination strategy, certain conclusions may be drawn. Consider a two-biometric verification system for which a fixed FAR has been specified. In that system, a person's identity is authenticated if His accepted by the first biometric OR if accepted by the second biometric. If His rejected by the first biometric AND the second biometric, then manual intervention is required. If a cost is associated with each stage of the verification process, a cost function can be formulated. It is a reasonable assumption to assume that the fewer people that filter down from the first biometric sensor to the second to the manual check, the cheaper the system.","Suppose a fixed threshold is used as the decision making process to accept or reject Hat each sensor and solve for thresholds that minimize the cost function. It will obtain settings that minimize cost, but it will not necessarily be the cheapest cost. Given a more accurate way to make decisions, the cost will drop. And if the decision method guarantees the most powerful test at each decision point it will have the optimal cost.","It is clear to us that the decision making process is crucial. A survey of methods based on statistical decision theory reveals many powerful tests such as the Maximum-Likelihood Test and Bayes' Test. Each requires the class conditional probability density function, as given by Equation 1. Some, such as the Bayes' Test, also require the a priori probabilities P(H) and P(H), which are the frequencies at which we would expect an impostor and authentic match attempt. Generally, these tests do not allow the flexibility of specifying a FAR\u2014they minimize making a classification error.","In their seminal paper of 1933 [3], Neyman and Pearson presented a lemma that guarantees the most powerful test for a fixed FAR requiring only the joint class conditional pdf for Hand H. This test may be used as the centerpiece of the biometric fusion logic employed in the invention. The Neyman-Pearson Lemma guarantees the validity of the test. The proof of the Lemma is slightly different than those found in other sources, but the reason for presenting it is because it is immediately amenable to proving the Corollary to the Neyman Pearson Lemma.

Neyman-Pearson Test Accuracy Improves with Additional Biometrics: The fact that accuracy improves with additional biometrics is an extremely important result of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma. Under the assumed class conditional densities for each biometric, the Neyman-Pearson Test provides the most powerful test over any other test that considers less than all the biometrics available. Even if a biometric has relatively poor performance and is highly correlated to one or more of the other biometrics, the fused CAR is optimal. The corollary for N-biometrics versus a single component biometric follows.","Corollarn to the Neyman Pearson Lemma: Given the joint class conditional probability density functions for an N-biometric system, choose \u03b1=FAR and use the Neyamn-Pearson Test to find the critical region Rthat gives the most powerful test for the N-biometric system",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0083"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00022","num":"00022"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"CAR","msub":{"mi":["R","Au"]}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msub":{"mo":"\u222b","msub":{"mi":["R","Au"]}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["x","Au"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":"\u2758"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"x"},"mo":"."}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"17"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sup":["th ","1 "],"sub":"Au"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0084"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00023","num":"00023"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"CAR","msub":{"mi":["I","Au"]}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msub":{"mo":"\u222b","mi":"IAu"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","i"]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":"\u2758"},"mi":"Au"}}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"x"}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"18"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"sub":["R",{"sub2":"Au"},"I",{"sub2":"Au"},"i","Au","1","2","N","k "],"sup":"N"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0085"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00024","num":"00024"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mo":"\u222b","msub":{"mi":["R","i"]}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["x","\u03b8"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":"\u2758"}}}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"x"}],"mo":"\u2062"}},{"msub":{"mo":"\u222b","msub":{"mi":"I","mrow":{"mi":["A","u"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","i"]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":"\u2758"},"mi":"\u03b8"}}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"x"}],"mo":"\u2062"}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"20"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["Au","i","Au","i ","Au","i","R",{"sub2":"Au"},"1",{"sub2":"Au"},"R",{"sub2":"Au"},"I",{"sub2":"Au "},"Au","i","R",{"sub2":"Au"},"I",{"sub2":"Au"},"Au","i","Au","i ","Au","i","R",{"sub2":"Au"},"I",{"sub2":"Au"}],"sup":["C","C","C \u2229R"]},"Examples have been built such that CAR=CARbut it is hard to do and it is unlikely that such densities would be seen in a real world application.

Functions for Optimal Verification and Identification: In the discussion above, it is assumed that all N biometric scores are simultaneously available for fusion. The Neyman-Pearson Lemma guarantees that this provides the most powerful test for a fixed FAR. In practice, however, this could be an expensive way of doing business. If it is assumed that all aspects of using a biometric system, time, risk, etc., can be equated to a cost, then a cost function can be constructed. The inventive process described below constructs the cost function and shows how it can be minimized using the Neyman-Pearson test. Hence, the Neyman-Pearson theory is not limited to \u201call-at-once\u201d fusion; it can be used for serial, parallel, and hierarchal systems.","Having laid a basis for the invention, a description of two cost functions is now provided as a mechanism for illustrating an embodiment of the invention. A first cost function for a verification system and a second cost function for an identification system are described. For each system, an algorithm is presented that uses the Neyman-Pearson test to minimize the cost function for a second order biometric system, that is a biometric system that has two modalities. The cost functions are presented for the general case of N-biometrics. Because minimizing the cost function is recursive, the computational load grows exponentially with added dimensions. Hence, an efficient algorithm is needed to handle the general case.","First Cost Function\u2014Verification System. A cost function for a 2-stage biometric verification (one-to-one) system will be described, and then an algorithm for minimizing the cost function will be provided. In a 2-stage verification system, a subject may attempt to be verified by a first biometric device. If the subject's identity cannot be authenticated, the subject may attempt to be authenticated by a second biometric. If that fails, the subject may resort to manual authentication. For example, manual authentication may be carried out by interviewing the subject and determining their identity from other means.","The cost for attempting to be authenticated using a first biometric, a second biometric, and a manual check are c, c, and c, respectively. The specified FARis a system false-acceptance-rate, i.e. the rate of falsely authenticating an impostor includes the case of it happening at the first biometric or the second biometric. This implies that the first-biometric station test cannot have a false-acceptance-rate, FAR, that exceeds FAR. Given a test with a specified FAR, there is an associated false-rejection-rate, FRR, which is the fraction of subjects that, on average, are required to move on to the second biometric station. The FAR required at the second station is FAR=FAR=FAR. It is known that P(A\u222aB)=P(A)+P(B)\u2212P(A)P(B), so the computation of FARappears imperfect. However, if FAR=P(A\u222aB) and FAR=P(A), in the construction of the decision space, it is intended that FAR=P(B)\u2212P(A)P(B).","Note that FARis a function of the specified FARand the freely chosen FAR; FARis not a free parameter. Given a biometric test with the computed FAR, there is an associated false-rejection-rate, FRRby the second biometric test, which is the fraction of subjects that are required to move on to a manual check. This is all captured by the following cost function:\n\nCost=+FRR(FRR)\u2003\u2003(30)\n","There is a cost for every choice of FAR\u2266FAR, so the Cost in Equation 30 is a function of FAR. For a given test method, there exists a value of FARthat yields the smallest cost and we present an algorithm to find that value. In a novel approach to the minimization of Equation 30, a modified version of the Neyman-Pearson decision test has been developed so that the smallest cost is optimally small.","An algorithm is outlined below. The algorithm seeks to optimally minimize Equation 30. To do so, we (a) set the initial cost estimate to infinity and, (b) for a specified FAR, loop over all possible values of FAR\u2266FAR. In practice, the algorithm may use a uniformly spaced finite sample of the infinite possible values. The algorithm may proceed as follows: (c) set FAR=FAR, (d) set Cost=\u221e, and (e) loop over possible FARvalues.

The 3-tuple set was an ordered set of three score values, by arbitrarily assigning a fingerprint score and a facial recognition score to each signature score for a total of 990 authentic score 3-tuples and 325,710 impostor score 3-tuples.","By assuming independence, it is well known that the joint pdf is the product of the marginal density functions, hence the joint class conditional pdf for the three biometric systems, \u0192(x|\u03b8)=\u0192(\u03c7,\u03c7,\u03c7|\u03b8) can be written as\n\n\u0192(X|\u03b8)=\u0192(\u03c7|\u03b8)\u0192(\u03c7|\u03b8)\u0192(\u03c7|\u03b8)\u2003\u2003(33)\n","So it is not necessary to dilute the available data.

The authentic score densities were approximated using two methods: (1) the histogram-interpolation technique and (2) the Parzen-window method. The impostor densities were approximated using the histogram-interpolation method. Although each of these estimation methods are guaranteed to converge in probability to the true underlying density as the number of samples goes to infinity, they are still approximations and can introduce error into the decision making process, as will be seen in the next section. The densities for fingerprint, signature, and facial recognition are shown in , , and  respectively. Note that the authentic pdf for facial recognition is bimodal. The Neyman-Pearson test was used to determine the optimal ROC for each of the modalities. The ROC curves for fingerprint, signature, and facial recognition are plotted in .","There are 3 possible unique pairings of the three biometric systems: (1) fingerprints with signature, (2) fingerprints with facial recognition, and (3) signatures with facial recognition. Using the marginal densities (above) to create the required 2-D joint class conditional density functions, two sets of 2-D joint density functions were computed - one in which the authentic marginal densities were approximated using the histogram method, and one in which the densities were approximated using the Parzen window method. Using the Neyman-Pearson test, an optimal ROC was computed for each fused pairing and each approximation method. The ROC curves for the histogram method are shown in  and the ROC curves for the Parzen window method are shown in .","As predicted by the corollary, the fused performance is better than the individual performance for each pair under each approximation method. But, as we cautioned in the example, error due to small sample sizes can cause pdf distortion. This is apparent when fusing fingerprints with signature data (see  and ). Notice that the Parzen-window ROC curve () crosses over the curve for fingerprint-facial-recognition fusion, but does not cross over when using the histogram interpolation method (). Small differences between the two sets of marginal densities are magnified when using their product to compute the 2-dimensional joint densities, which is reflected in the ROC.","As a final step, all three modalities were fused. The resulting ROC using histogram interpolating is shown in , and the ROC using the Parzen window is shown .

However, if FAR=P(A\u222aB) and FAR=P(A), in the construction of the decision space, it is intended that FAR=P(B)\u2212P(A)P(B).","Given a test with the computed FAR, there is an associated false-rejection-rate, FRRby the second station, which is the fraction of subjects that are required to move on to a manual checkout station.

Step 1: set the initial cost estimate to infinity and, for a specified FAR, loop over all possible values of FAR\u2266FAR.

The optimal fusion algorithm uses the probability of an authentic match and the probability of a false match for each p\u2208P.

A sufficient number of samples may be generated to get a \u201csmooth\u201d surface by simulation. Given a sequence of matching score pairs and non-matching score pairs, it is possible to construct a numerical model of the marginal cumulative distribution functions (cdf). The distribution functions may be used to generate pseudo random score pairs. If the marginal densities are independent, then it is straightforward to generate sample score pairs independently from each cdf. If the densities are correlated, we generate the covariance matrix and then use Cholesky factorization to obtain a matrix that transforms independent random deviates into samples that are appropriately correlated.","Assume a given partition P. The joint pdf for both the authentic and impostor cases may be built by mapping simulated score pairs to the appropriate P\u2208P and incrementing a counter for that sub-square. That is, it is possible to build a 2-dimensional histogram, which is stored in a 2-dimensional array of appropriate dimensions for the partition. If we divide each array element by the total number of samples, we have an approximation to the probability of a score pair falling within the associated sub-square. We call this type of an array the probability partition array (PPA). Let Pbe the PPA for the joint false match distribution and let Pbe the PPA for the authentic match distribution. Then, the probability of an impostor's score pair, (s, s)\u2208p, resulting in a match is P(i,j). Likewise, the probability of a score pair resulting in a match when it should be a match is P(i,j).

Therefore, the notation \u201c(i,j)\u201d includes more than two modalities, for example (i,j,k), (i,j,k,l), (i,j,k,l,m), etc.","For example,  illustrates one method according to the invention in which Pm(i,j) is provided 10 and Pfm(i,j) 13 is provided. As part of identifying 16 indices (i,j) corresponding to a no-match zone, a first index set (\u201cA\u201d) may be identified. The indices in set A may be the (i,j) indices that have values in both Pfm(i,j) and Pm(i,j). A second index set (\u201cZ\u221e\u201d) may be identified, the indices of Z\u221e being the (i,j) indices in set A where both Pfm(i,j) is larger than zero and Pm(i,j) is equal to zero. Then determine FAR19, where FAR=1\u2212\u03a3P(i,j). It should be noted that the indices of Z\u221e may be the indices in set A where Pm(i,j) is equal to zero, since the indices where both Pfm(i,j)=Pm(i,j)=0 will not affect FAR, and since there will be no negative values in the probability partition arrays. However, since defining the indices of Z\u221e to be the (i,j) indices in set A where both Pfm(i,j) is larger than zero and Pm(i,j) is equal to zero yields the smallest number of indices for Z\u221e, we will use that definition for illustration purposes since it is the least that must be done for the mathematics of FAR to work correctly. It will be understood that larger no-match zones may be defined, but they will include Z\u221e, so we illustrate the method using the smaller Z\u221e definition believing that definitions of no-match zones that include Z\u221e will fall within the scope of the method described.","FAR may be compared 22 to a desired false-acceptance-rate (\u201cFAR\u201d), and if FAR is less than or equal to the desired false-acceptance-rate, then the data set may be accepted, if false-rejection-rate is not important.

Here we modify Z\u221e so that ZM\u221e includes indices that would not affect the calculation for FAR, but which might affect calculations related to the false-rejection-rate.
