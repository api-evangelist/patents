title: Integrity monitor antenna systems for GPS-based precision landing system verification
abstract: The integrity of operation of a GPS precision aircraft approach and landing system may be compromised by error producing effects of reflected multipath signals. An integrity monitor antenna system as disclosed may utilize both attenuation and shadowing of reflected multipath GPS signals to achieve extreme multipath mitigation of the order of 50 dB suppression. An antenna with a right-hand circular polarization pattern having a sharp cut off at the horizon may provide 30 dB suppression of reflected multipath signals. A signal absorbent ground plane bed of defined dimensions may provide 20 dB attenuation of incident multipath signals. A signal/processor may be employed to derive position error data for integrity monitoring, based upon differentials between a known fixed location and a current GPS-indicated location. Communication of identification of a subset of particular GPS satellites for common usage may also reduce potential error levels.

The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.","(Not Applicable)","(Not Applicable)","This invention relates to antenna systems to receive signals from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites and, more particularly, to antenna systems capable of highly accurately determining errors in a current GPS-indicated position of a fixed location of known latitude, longitude and elevation.","Implementation of GPS-based precision aircraft approach and landing systems necessitates provision for currently verifying the integrity of the system. Particularly for systems capable of enabling aircraft landings at airports under zero visibility atmospheric conditions, small errors in the GPS-indicated position of an aircraft relative to the runway surface may be critical to the accomplishment of a safe landing. Variations in the integrity of a GPS-indicated position are inherent due to variations and errors which may occur in the transmission of the signals from GPS satellites due to atmospheric and other conditions.","Pursuant to the invention, an integrity monitor antenna system may be employed to enable derivation of error data on a current basis representing differentials between a GPS-indicated position and the actual fixed position of known latitude, longitude and altitude of the antenna system. However, it is critical that an antenna employed for this purpose be capable of receiving GPS signals without itself inherently introducing errors which may adversely affect the derivation of a GPS-indicated position by use of the received GPS signals. Thus, if the antenna itself is subject to signal reception errors, it will not be possible to accurately evaluate actual errors inherent in the GPS-indicated position developed from the received GPS signals.","In this context, antenna susceptibility to effects of reflected multipath GPS signals is of major significance. Extreme ground multipath mitigation, defined for this purpose as 40 to 50 dB suppression of reflected GPS ground signals, is desirable. Consistent with this, it is desirable that with such enhanced multipath performance the antenna employed be capable of achieving a peak multipath based error of the order of 1 cm. in altitude or lateral distance. Also of major significance is the desirability of an antenna having a unitary phase center of accurately determined position, to permit precision determinations of phase of received signals and avoid introduction of phase discrepancies. Antenna systems having the desired characteristics in this regard are described in applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 5,534,882 (the '882 patent) which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","Antennas providing a circular polarization characteristic in all directions horizontally and upward from the horizon (i.e., omnidirectional coverage from the zenith to the horizon) with a sharp pattern cut off at the horizon are described in applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 6,201,510 (the '510 patent) which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Antennas described in the '510 patent may be employed to provide up to 30 dB suppression of reflected GPS multipath signals.","Objects of the present invention are to provide new and improved antenna systems, including antenna systems capable of receiving GPS signals with very low susceptibility to effects of reflected ground multipath GPS signals.","In accordance with the invention, an embodiment of an integrity monitor antenna system with enhanced multipath mitigation, usable for GPS-based aircraft precision landing system verification, may include the following. An antenna which is configured to provide a right-hand circular polarization antenna pattern above a horizontal plane and having a phase center above the plane. A multipath limiting configuration which includes a bed portion positioned on the plane below the antenna and having a signal absorbent characteristic effective to provide attenuation of incident signals (e.g., 20 dB attenuation), the bed portion having a minimum dimension along the plane adequate to intersect ray paths from the phase center representative of multipath signals incident at negative elevation angles (e.g., elevation angles of minus 20 degrees or greater), and the configuration positioned at a fixed location of known latitude, longitude and altitude. A receiver\/processor coupled to the antenna is configured to process received GPS signals to derive position error data representing differentials between the fixed location and a GPS-indicated location of the antenna based on signals currently received from a subset of GPS satellites. The position error data is configured to be usable to derive error levels relative to aircraft location in space determinations based on GPS signals received during landing operations.","The receiver\/processor may additionally be configured to include, with the error data, identification of individual GPS satellites included in the subset of GPS satellites thus enabling consistency as to which satellites the error data is associated with.","Also in accordance with the invention, an embodiment of an integrity monitor antenna system with enhanced multipath mitigation, usable for GPS-based aircraft precision landing system verification, may include the following. An antenna, which includes a vertical array of sub-arrays each having a 360 degree progressive phase radiation characteristic, is configured to provide a right-hand circular polarization antenna pattern above a horizontal plane and having a phase center above the plane. A multipath limiting configuration includes a bed portion positioned on the plane below the antenna and has a signal absorbent characteristic effective to provide a predetermined attenuation of incident signals. The bed portion has a dimension along the plane (e.g., of nominally 20 feet) adequate to intersect a ray path from the phase center representative of multipath signals incident at negative elevation angles (e.g., elevation angles of minus 20 degrees or greater). The configuration also includes a support structure supporting the antenna and the bed portion at a height above ground surface (e.g., nominally 10 feet) adequate to provide shadowing by the bed portion of multipath reflections from surface vehicles closer than 30 feet from the antenna. The configuration is positioned at a location of known latitude, longitude and altitude. As described, the antenna system is configured to provide at least 40 dB suppression (e.g., nominally 50 dB suppression) of reflected GPS multipath signals incident upon the bed portion. For present purposes, nominally is defined as within plus or minus ten percent of a stated value.","For a better understanding of the invention, together with other and further objects, reference is made to the accompanying drawings and the scope of the invention will be addressed by the accompanying claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIGS. 1","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","11","12","13","14","11","13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["16","18","16","12","12","12","18","18","16","16","18","10"],"i":["l ","r "]},"As shown in the  side view of the  four-dipole sub-array, opposed arms and of dipole  extend respectively upward and downward at approximately 45 degrees diagonally to horizontal. Arms and of dipole , at the back of configuration  in the view of , are also visible. The four dipoles , , ,  are successively spaced around a vertical axis , shown dashed in  and in end view in . Dipole arms are labeled l and r, representing the left arm and right arm of a particular dipole when viewed from vertical axis  (i.e., viewed from a position above the top surface of element , looking outward from axis ).","Four-dipole sub-array  includes a port illustrated as coaxial connector . Connector  is shown in  with its outer conductor portion mounted to conductive layer  and its center conductor passing through layer  to the upper surface of substrate .","Sub-array  also includes a progressive-phase-omnidirectional (PPO) excitation network coupled between port  and dipoles , , , . As illustrated, the PPO network includes first and second quadrature couplers  and , respectively, as shown in  and first and second transmission line sections  and , respectively, as shown in . Couplers  and  in this embodiment are wireline quadrature couplers having an external encasement which is soldered or otherwise grounded to conductive layer . Each wireline device is a 3 dB coupler having four signal port conductors: input port \u201ca\u201d; output port \u201cb\u201d providing signals of the same phase as input signals; output port \u201cc\u201d providing signals of quadrature phase (i.e., 90 degree phase lag relative to input signals); and port \u201cd\u201d which is resistively terminated (e.g., 50 ohms to ground). While signal input terminology is used for convenience, it will be understood that the couplers operate reciprocally for the present signal reception application.","Considering both the bottom view of  and the top view of , it will be seen that port a conductor of wireline coupler  is coupled through layers \/ and coupled to signal port  via line section . Port b conductor is coupled through layers \/ and coupled to the left arm of first dipole , via conductor , to provide first dipole excitation of a first phase. Conductor and associated shorted stub (connected to layer  through layer ) are appropriately dimensioned to provide suitable impedance matching to the dipole using known design techniques. Similarly, port c conductor is coupled to the left arm of second dipole  via conductor to provide second dipole excitation of a quadrature phase (i.e., differing by 90 degrees). Port d conductor passes through layers \/ and is terminated by a 50 ohm chip resistor mounted on the surface of layer  and grounded to layer .","Second wireline quadrature coupler  is correspondingly coupled to third and fourth dipoles  and , however, in this case couplings are to the right arms of dipoles  and  (rather than to the left arms, as above). Thus, port a conductor of coupler  is coupled to signal port  via second transmission line section . Port b conductor (zero phase) is coupled to the right arm of third dipole , via conductor , with the phase reversal from opposite-arm excitation (i.e., via right arm v. left arm above) resulting in third dipole excitation of a phase opposite (i.e., differing by 180 degrees) to the first phase excitation of first dipole  (e.g., 180 degrees lag). Port c conductor (quadrature phase) is coupled to the right arm of fourth dipole , via conductor , with the quadrature phase and phase reversal from opposite arm excitation resulting in fourth dipole excitation of a phase opposite to the second phase excitation of second dipole  (e.g., 180 degrees lag). Port d conductor is resistively terminated via chip resistor . Shorted stubs , , and as shown are provided for dipoles ,  and  as discussed above with reference to stub ","During signal reception, this sub-array configuration is effective to provide at signal port  a signal representative of reception via a 360 degree PPO azimuth antenna pattern. Thus, the PPO network is effective to provide relative signal phasing of zero, \u221290, \u2212180 and \u2212270 degrees at first, second, third and fourth dipoles , , , , respectively, with received signals combined to provide the PPO signal at port . The four-dipole configuration  thus operates as a self-contained unit to provide this PPO capability.","For effective GPS operation, the four-dipole sub-array as configured in  is double tuned for operation at two GPS frequencies of 1,572.42 MHZ and 1,227.6 MHZ. With reference to second dipole , double tuning is provided by a tuned circuit utilizing the inductance of a stub comprising gap backed up by a rectangular opening in conductive layer , in combination with capacitive stub connected to layer  and overlying a portion of dipole . Provision of this tuned circuit enables the dipole to be double tuned using known design techniques, to enable reception at both GPS signal frequencies.","By way of example, the four-dipole sub-array  may be fabricated as a self-contained unit using printed circuit techniques, with the dipole arms, wireline quadrature couplers and coaxial connector soldered in place. For GPS application, the sub-array  may have typical dimensions of approximately three and a quarter inches across and an inch and a quarter in height. The sub-array is shown slightly enlarged and some dimensions may be distorted for clarity of presentation. The square central opening is dimensioned for placement on a square conductive member  of hollow construction (e.g., a square aluminum vertical support or mast shown sectioned in ) with electrical connection of ground layer  to the member .","Reference is made to which illustrates a form of antenna system described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,534,882 (the '882 patent). The antenna system is arranged to provide a first circular polarization characteristic (e.g., right circular polarization) horizontally and upward from the horizon.","Referring to the antenna system, a mast  supporting the antenna system is shown centered on the vertical axis  and normal to the horizontal plane. As illustrated, the antenna system includes a plurality of sub-arrays, shown as sub-arrays -, spaced along mast . Considering sub-array , it consists of four dipoles each supported by coupling means illustrated as a base portion (such as shown at  with respect to dipole A) extending from mast . As shown for dipole D, each dipole is tilted so that its arm portions are at an angle of approximately 45 degrees. In dipole D is in the front (permitting its tilted orientation to be seen), side dipoles A and C are seen in side profile and rear dipole B is shown in simplified form as a tilted line (to distinguish it from front dipole D). The A, B, C, D dipole labeling is typical for each of the other dipole arrays -. The antenna system looks the same when viewed from the front, the back or either side. Thus, except for the specific dipole labels as shown, may be considered a front, back or side view. shows simplified top views of sub-arrays , , and  of the antenna, illustrating the symmetrical character of the four dipoles of each sub-array. As shown, the four dipoles of each sub-array are equally spaced around the mast  at 90 degree angular increments. The boresight of each dipole is thus aligned at an azimuth angle differing from the boresight angle of each other dipole in its sub-array by an integral multiple of 90 degrees.","In overview, it will thus be seen that each sub-array provides a PPO antenna pattern, however, the signal phasing at sub-arrays  and  have respectively been rotated forward (lead) and backward (lag) by 90 degrees relative to the signal phasing of sub-array .","As a result of excitation as described, with four 45 degree angled dipoles positioned symmetrically around mast  and supplied with signals as described, sub-array  will be effective to produce a right circular polarized radiation pattern around axis  which has a 360 degree PPO characteristics, as indicated by the relative phasing shown for dipoles A, B, C and D in . Similarly, signals are coupled to the dipoles of the second sub-array of relative phase effective to produce a second PPO radiation pattern around axis  similar to the first such pattern, but which is shifted in azimuth by an angle of 90 degrees (i.e., 90 degrees phase lag) and to dipoles A, B, C and D to produce a similar 360 degree third PPO radiation pattern also shifted in azimuth relative to the first such pattern (i.e., 90 degrees phase lead). Additional sub-arrays (e.g., some or all of sub-arrays , ,  and , plus additional similar arrays as suitable in particular applications) may be included and excited to provide appropriately aligned 360 degree circularly polarized PPO radiation patterns. Additional details as to the feed configuration, construction and operation of the antenna system are provided in the '882 patent.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 1-3","FIGS. 1-3"],"b":["10","1","10","1","10","1","44","10","10","10","50","10","4","50","10","6","10","2","10","4","10","6","10","8","10","10","10","12","10","14","10","16","10","18","10","20","10","1","10","3","10","5","10","7","10","9","10","11","10","13","10","15","10","17","10","19","10","21","10","1"]},"Although sub-arrays are described in terms of being directly or indirectly \u201cexcited\u201d, it will be understood the  antenna is intended for reception of GPS satellite signals. As represented in , received signals are provided to signal combiner  by eleven signal paths A-K (e.g., coaxial cables). Each of cables A-K, which are typically of equal length, connects to the signal port (e.g., connector  of the  sub-array) of one of the eleven directly excited sub-arrays. In this embodiment there are no cable connections to the ten indirectly excited sub-arrays, the signal ports of which may be suitable terminated. To provide the desired antenna pattern as discussed above with reference to the antenna system, signal combiner  is arranged to: provide reference phase signals to the first sub-array (sub-array  (-D) the center sub-array); provide to each of the directly excited upper sub-arrays signals which lag that reference phase by 90 degrees; and provide to each of the directly excited lower sub-arrays signals which lead by 90 degrees. As an alternative, it will be apparent that the desired PPO excitations which lead and lag by 90 degree phase differentials can be provided by permanently rotating selected sub-arrays by 90 degrees in azimuth and coupling of reference or some phase signals to each of the eleven directly excited sub-arrays. Thus, for this alternative configuration all of the upper sub-arrays above first sub-array  (-D) can be placed on the square mast  in a physical alignment rotated forward (clockwise, looking down from above) one quarter turn or 90 degrees, relative to the first sub-array. Similarly, all of the lower sub-arrays can be placed on the square mast  in a physical alignment rotated backward one quarter turn or 90 degrees, relative to the first sub-array  (-D). The  antenna and its operation are more fully described in the '510 patent.","In particular applications, the antenna of  may include different numbers of sub-arrays of the directly and indirectly excited types, as determined by skilled persons in view of the desired operational performance. The  antenna has been determined to provide 30 dB of suppression of reflected GPS signals, as a result of its sharp radiation pattern cut off for signals incident at below horizon angles.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIGS. 6 and 7","b":["60","60"]},"As illustrated, antenna system  includes an antenna  configured to provide a right-hand circular polarization antenna pattern above a horizontal plane (such plane is represented at  in ). In a presently preferred embodiment, antenna  may comprise the antenna of the form of  (including the cylindrical radome ) as described above or modifications thereof as may be provided by skilled persons as suitable for particular applications. As described above with reference to , antenna  employs a vertical array of sub-arrays each having a 360 degree progressive phase radiation characteristic, with directly excited sub-arrays interspersed with indirectly excited sub-arrays. With the  configuration, antenna  operationally provides a 30 dB up\/down gain ratio, thereby providing 30 dB of suppression of GPS multipath signals. A characteristic of the  antenna is a well-defined unitary signal phase center positioned about one meter above the base of the antenna, as represented at  in .","The integrity monitor antenna system of  further includes a multipath limiting configuration  comprising a bed portion  and a support structure . Bed portion , positioned on a horizontal plane represented at  below the antenna , has a signal absorbent characteristic effective to provide attenuation of incident GPS signals (e.g., 20 dB attenuation of signals incident on its surface). In this embodiment, bed portion  has a minimum dimension  along plane  of 20 feet, which is adequate to intersect a ray path from phase center  representative of a multipath signal incident at an elevation angle of minus 20 degrees. As will be discussed further, it follows from this that any multipath signal incident at a negative angle greater than minus 20 degrees (e.g., minus 30 degrees, minus 45 degrees, etc.) would similarly be attenuated before reflection to the phase center . For present purposes, the words suppression and attenuation are used in the sense of reduction of the level or effect of a signal.","Multipath limiting configuration  also includes support structure  supporting the antenna  and bed portion  at a height above ground surface adequate to result in shadowing by bed portion  of multipath reflections from surface vehicles, such as local maintenance vehicles, and other possible items which may be present in the relatively near vicinity of the antenna system on a transient or other basis. In this embodiment, support structure  has a height of approximately 11 feet, so as to support the top surface of bed portion  at a height of 12 feet above the surface of the ground. In this regard, it should be noted that the most relevant multipath reflections to be blocked are those reflected from surface vehicles (e.g., a maintenance vehicle) which could be parked or driven to a position closer than about 30 feet from the antenna system . It has been determined that multipath reflections from vehicles which are farther than about 30 feet from the antenna can be assumed to have a maximum potential signal strength upon reaching phase center  of the antenna such that those reflections will not result in any significant multipath error in derivation of a GPS-indicated position via the antenna system.","The integrity monitor antenna system of  additionally includes receiver\/processor  illustrated in  as an equipment enclosure  positioned at ground level within support structure  and including a top-mounted VHF receiving antenna . Receiver\/processor  is coupled (e.g., via a cable not shown) to antenna  and is configured to process received GPS signals to derive position error data representing differentials between the fixed location of the antenna system  (the latitude, longitude and altitude of such position having previously been accurately determined) and a GPS-indicated location of antenna  determined based on signals currently received from a subset of GPS satellites. Such position error data, representing errors or error levels inherent in the currently derived GPS-indicated location, may be configured to be usable onboard an aircraft to represent error levels in the aircraft location in space as determined from GPS signals received by the aircraft during approach and landing operations at an airport adjacent to the location of antenna system . Such usage of the error data may include indications of the possible magnitude of current positional errors or the activation of warning signals, sounds or flags, when the current error levels make reliance upon guidance from a GPS-based landing system for landing the aircraft potentially unsafe or dangerous (e.g., under zero visibility conditions).","A GPS-based aircraft precision landing system may utilize a plurality of standardized antennas at accurately known positions adjacent to a runway in order to receive current GPS signals and derive GPS correction data which is transmitted to approaching aircraft to enable corrections to the aircraft position in space as actively derived from GPS signals. Thus, current atmospheric and other conditions could result in onboard equipment deriving an aircraft position in space which is subject to relatively large errors in altitude, as one example. Use of the GPS correction data received from the landing system with reliance on those standardized antennas would ideally permit the equipment onboard the aircraft to correct that altitude error and enable a safe landing.","However, the performance of one or more of those standardized antennas used by the landing system may at any time be adversely affected (i.e., degraded) by the presence of reflected multipath signals, with the potential result that the correction signals provided to the aircraft by the landing system could themselves be inaccurate (e.g., representative of an error of 6-10 cm. in altitude or laterally). Thus, the operating integrity of the landing system intended to insure the accuracy of GPS assisted landings may itself be compromised by multipath signals affecting reception via the standardized antennas. To address this problem, integrity monitor antenna system  may be arranged to receive from the landing system the same GPS correction signals the landing system transmits or would transmit to aircraft. Thus, antenna  in  may be a small VHF antenna to receive from the landing system and couple to receiver\/processor  signals carrying GPS correction data, representing errors in GPS-indicated position data, as derived by the landing system (via the standardized antennas) for use by aircraft. Receiver\/processor  may be configured to first receive via antenna  GPS signals from a sub-set of GPS satellites, then to derive position error data as discussed above, then to compare that error data with GPS correction data received from the landing system, and finally to send position error data including the results of that comparison by land cable back to the landing system. In this way, the landing system receives results indicating the level of error (as determined via antenna system , which is much less subject to multipath induced error than the standardized landing system antennas) in the GPS correction data the landing system is transmitting or would transmit to aircraft. With information on that level of error, the landing system may use such information to determine that its GPS correction data has the required integrity, to broadcast warning flags or messages to aircraft, or to take other suitable action. Thus, error data from the antenna system  is usable by the GPS-based precision approach and landing system for system verification.","In other implementations, position error data derived by receiver\/processor  may be transmitted directly to an approaching aircraft, instead of to the landing system as described. In this case, a signal processor onboard the aircraft may be arranged to utilize the received error data to generate warnings, when appropriate, regarding the accuracy of a GPS-indicated location in space of the aircraft (as derived onboard the aircraft).","Consistent with the preceding, in a currently preferred implementation receiver\/processor  employs the same signal processing as employed in the signal processor utilized in aircraft using the landing system (e.g., the same circuitry or comparable circuitry employing the same processing and the same or equivalent VHF antenna). In this way the GPS-indicated location derived by antenna system  will be directly comparable to GPS-indicated locations derived onboard approaching aircraft. It is possible that different levels of error may concurrently be associated with GPS indicated locations derived by use of different subsets (e.g., groups of three) of GPS satellites. In a currently preferred implementation receiver\/processor  is configured to identify the individual satellites of the subset of GPS satellites currently being utilized for location determinations and provide such information to the landing system to permit the landing system to communicate with equipment onboard the aircraft to ensure that the aircraft, the landing system and antenna system  are all operating on the basis of the same signals in space received from the same identified subset of GPS satellites. This would obviate aircraft reliance on signals from a different GPS satellite whose signals in space have not been subject to error determinations by antenna system .","As already noted, antenna  may have the form of the  antenna. Bed portion  in a currently preferred embodiment comprises an approximately 12 inch thick layer of foam material (e.g., of adjacent two foot square units) having a signal absorption characteristic, comparable to such material commonly used in anechoic chambers designed for antenna test purposes. A suitable protective layer, of plastic sheeting or other suitable construction, may be employed to cover and protect such foam material from atmospheric and other conditions. With such construction, bed portion  may be configured to provide 20 dB attenuation of incident signals or, more generally, nominally 20 dB attenuation, where nominally is defined as within plus or minus ten percent of a stated value. Support structure  may comprise a steel tower type of construction mounted on a concrete ground pad, or other suitable arrangement configured to provide stable support for the other antenna system elements. Receiver\/processor unit  may comprise a suitable weather-protective electronic equipment enclosure enclosing electronic circuitry and other components suitable for implementing the described functions using known signal processing and other techniques. Fiber optic or other cabling, buried or otherwise, may be used between the antenna system and the landing system. Such cabling is well known and is not illustrated.","As discussed, antenna system  implemented as described is capable of providing up to 50 dB of suppression of incident reflected multipath signals. Under all typical operating conditions, antenna system  provides the capability of limiting the peak multipath based error level to the order of 1 cm. in altitude or lateral distance, enabling highly accurate GPS positioning for determining the landing system integrity level and generating warnings if required. In this context, antenna system  provides a stable unitary phase center of accurately determined position, to enable precision determinations of phase of received signals and avoid introduction of phase discrepancies.","Referring now to , it is illustrated that with bed portion  having a horizontal dimension of 20 feet and antenna  having a signal phase center one meter above bed portion , bed portion  will be effective to absorb a predetermined portion (e.g., 20 dB attenuation) of multipath signals incident at any negative angle greater than minus 20 degrees, prior to such signals being received (i.e., approaching the phase center ). Thus, as represented in , bed portion  has a dimension horizontally (along plane ) which is adequate to intersect a ray path  from the phase center  which is representative of a multipath signal  incident at a negative elevation angle of minus 20 degrees. As illustrated in , a GPS satellite signal  is reflected from bed portion  as an attenuated multipath signal, shown dashed to represent the attenuation. Thus, it will be seen that ray path  from phase center  is representative of a signal  incident on bed portion  at a negative angle of minus 20 degrees. As will be seen from , if bed portion  has a horizontal dimension adequate to intersect a ray path representative of a multipath signal incident at minus 20 degrees, that horizontal dimension will also be adequate to intersect multipath signals incident at negative elevation angles that are greater than minus 20 degrees, e.g., at negative angles of minus 30, 45, 60 degrees, etc. For clarity, in  a negative angle of minus 30 degrees is illustrated as extending at an angle of 30 degrees below a horizontal plane . Signals at lower negative angles (less than minus 20 degrees) cannot be expected to be incident directly from the GPS satellites at signal levels adequate to cause significant multipath errors for present purposes.","Multipath GPS signals may also result from reflections of satellite signals from surface vehicles (e.g., maintenance vehicles parked near the antenna system). In selecting a site near a runway for installation of antenna system  the presence of fixed objects presenting reflecting surfaces (e.g., buildings, sheds, etc.) must be carefully analyzed, so that there are no such large surfaces close enough to the antenna site to potentially reflect signals of significant strength at the phase center of the antenna. Having addressed and taken action to avoid such reflections from fixed objects, there remains the potential problem of significant reflections from maintenance vehicles, as may be employed by technicians servicing the antenna system. While there may be a low probability that a car or truck will present a significant reflecting surface at just the right orientation and angle to aim a reflected GPS satellite signal directly at the phase center  of antenna , nevertheless, the bed portion  of the antenna system is raised above ground surface to provide suppression by shadowing such reflected multipath signals. By analysis, it has been determined that a potential for a multipath reflection from a vehicle of a signal strength which will be significant for present purposes may exist if such a vehicle is closer to the antenna than about 30 feet. For example, as illustrated in , for such a reflection  from a vehicle  the reflected multipath signal will be shadowed (i.e., blocked) by the bed portion  and prevented from reaching the phase center  of the antenna . In this embodiment, support structure  supports bed portion  at a height of about 11 feet, so that the top surface of bed portion  is about 12 feet above ground surface to provide such shadowing of multipath reflections from ground elements. Thus, while such reflections from vehicles at 30 feet or less from the antenna will be blocked from reaching the phase center , reflections from a vehicle located further away would not be blocked and could reach the phase center. However, even if such vehicle presented the equivalent of a 4 foot by 4 foot flat surface at just the right orientation and angle, the potential for a resulting significant multipath error would not be presented.","While there have been described currently preferred embodiments of the invention, those skilled in the art will recognize that other and further modifications may be made without departing from the invention and it is intended to claim all modifications and variations as fall within the scope of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIGS. 1"],"i":["a ","b "],"b":["2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 1"],"b":["2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIGS. 6 and 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIGS. 8 and 9"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
