title: Virtual wallet card selection apparatuses, methods and systems
abstract: The VIRTUAL WALLET CARD SELECTION APPARATUSES, METHODS AND SYSTEMS (“VWCS”) transform virtual wallet card selections by users utilizing mobile devices via VWCS components into virtual wallet card-based transaction purchase notifications. In one implementation, the VWCS obtains a user authentication request for a purchase transaction, and extracts a universal card account number from it. Upon querying a database, the VWCS determines that the user has access to a virtual wallet and obtains virtual wallet card selection options for the user from the database. The VWCS provides the virtual wallet card selection options to a user mobile device, and obtains a user selection of an account included among the options. The VWCS initiates a purchase transaction using the user selection. Also, upon completion of authorization of the purchase transaction, the VWCS provides a purchase receipt to the user mobile device.

The VWCS has many features and capabilities, of which the ones in  are examples. More detail with regard to  may be found with regard to . With reference to , in some implementations, a user, e.g., , may desire to purchase a product, service, offering, and\/or the like (\u201cproduct\u201d), from a merchant. The user may communicate with a merchant server, e.g., , via a client such as, but not limited to: a personal computer, mobile device, television, point-of-sale terminal, kiosk, ATM, and\/or the like (e.g., ). For example, the user may provide user input, e.g., purchase input , into the client indicating the user's desire to purchase the product. In various implementations, the user input may include, but not be limited to: keyboard entry, card swipe, activating a RFID\/NFC enabled hardware device (e.g., electronic card having multiple accounts, smartphone, tablet, etc.), mouse clicks, depressing buttons on a joystick\/game console, voice commands, single\/multi-touch gestures on a touch-sensitive interface, touching user interface elements on a touch-sensitive display, and\/or the like. For example, the user may direct a browser application executing on the client device to a website of the merchant, and may select a product from the website via clicking on a hyperlink presented to the user via the website. As another example, the client may obtain track  data from the user's card (e.g., credit card, debit card, prepaid card, charge card, etc.), such as the example track  data provided below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"%B123456789012345{circumflex over (\u2009)}PUBLIC\/"},{"entry":"J.Q.{circumflex over (\u2009)}99011200000000000000**901******?*"},{"entry":"(wherein \u2018123456789012345\u2019 is the card number of \u2018J.Q.

User interfaces describing providing split tender options are further described below in the discussion with reference to .","With reference to , in some implementations, a user, e.g., , may desire to purchase products, services and\/or other offerings (\u201cproducts\u201d) in-person. The user may, e.g., enter, see e.g., , into a store, warehouse, etc. to purchase a product. The user may desire to procure purchase items available at the store in person, see, e.g., . The user may, in some implementations, attempt to check out the purchase items, see e.g., , at a point-of-sale (\u201cPOS\u201d) terminal, e.g., . For example, the user may swipe a charge card  (e.g., credit card, debit card, prepaid card, etc., hereinafter \u201cuniversal card\u201d). The POS terminal may provide the details of the user's universal card for processing the purchase transaction. For example, the POS terminal may provide the purchase transaction details to a pay network  (e.g., credit card company, issuer bank, acquirer bank, etc.) for payment processing. The pay network may identify, e.g., , based on the universal card details, that the user associated with the universal card has access to a virtual wallet of cards. The pay network may, e.g., in real-time, query, e.g., , the user for a selection of one of the cards from user's virtual wallet. For example, the pay network may send to the user's device, e.g.,  (e.g., smartphone, tablet computer, netbook, laptop, personal digital assistant, gaming console, etc.) a message (e.g., (Secure) HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP(S)) POST\/GET message, electronic mail message, Short Messaging Service (SMS) message, HTTP\/Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) video stream, text message, Twitter\u2122 tweet, Facebook\u00ae message\/wall posting, etc.) requesting the user to select a payment option from the user's virtual wallet. Based on the message, a user interface rendered by the user's device may be populated with user card selection options, see . In some examples, even though the universal card is not a credit card, a most appropriate card may be selected by the user using the user device. Alternatively, the payment network server may select a pre-set card with which to process the purchase transaction.","In some implementations, upon obtaining the message, the device may provide the user with an interface to make a selection of a card from the user's virtual wallet to utilize to complete the purchase transaction. For example, the user's device may be executing an application module (\u201capp\u201d), via which the user's device may communicate with the pay network. The user's device may display the virtual wallet card selection options obtained from the pay network via the app to the user. In some implementations, the app may provide the user an option to buy the purchase items  on the spot by performing a single action (e.g., tap, swipe touchscreen of a mobile device, press a key on a keyboard, perform a single mouse click, etc.).","In some implementations, the app may provide various alternate options for the user. For example, the app may provide the user with alternate merchants where the user may obtain the products and\/or similar products, alternate products that may be comparable to the purchase products, competitive pricing information between merchants, discounts, coupons, and\/or other offers for the user, etc. In some implementations, the app may indicate that the user may earn rewards points if the user purchases the product at another merchant. In some implementations, the app may indicate that the may be required to use fewer rewards points to pay for the purchase transaction if the user purchases the product at another merchant, because the other merchant may have a better relationship with the rewards points provider. In some implementations, the app may indicate that the user may earn more rewards points if the uses a specific (or alternative) card to pay for the purchase transaction. In some implementations, the app may indicate that the user may obtain a greater amount of cash back if the user purchases the card at an alternate merchant and\/or using an alternate card. In various implementations, offers to the user including and similar to those described herein may originate from various entities and\/or components, including but not limited to: merchants, pay networks, card issuers, acquirers, and\/or the like.","With reference to , in some implementations, the user may buy, see, e.g., , the product on the spot from the current merchant and\/or other merchant(s) by performing the single action on the user device (e.g., one tap of a touchscreen of the user device). In such implementations, the VWCS server may initiate a card-based purchase transaction using a \u201ccard\u201d (e.g., checking account, savings account, Paypal\u2122 account, Google Checkout\u2122 account, credit card, debit card, prepaid card, etc.) selected from the user's virtual wallet, see, e.g., -. In some implementations, the VWCS may be able to arbitrage credit card payment networks in that a merchant, card issuer, acquirer, pay network, and\/or the like entities and\/or VWCS components may switch how payments for the user are processed because of transaction cost considerations.","In some implementations, the pay network (e.g., ) may initiate the card-based purchase transaction, e.g., , and may generate a purchase confirmation receipt for the user. The VWCS server may provide the purchase confirmation receipt to the client device, e.g., -. In some implementations, the user may desire to exit the store after purchasing items via the app. In such implementations, the user may be required to provide proof of purchase of the product at the exit of the store, e.g., . The user may utilize the purchase confirmation receipt obtained from the VWCS via the app on the client device to provide such proof of product purchase, e.g., . For example, the receipt may include a purchase identifier, e.g., . For example, the purchase identifier may include a barcode, a QR code, an image of a receipt, a video of a purchase action, etc. The user may utilize such confirmations of the purchase as proof at the exit of the store. Accordingly, in some implementations, the user may obtain greater security in transactions because a purchase can only be completed if the person has both the user's universal card, and access to the user's device, as well as access to the app executing on the user's device. Further, even at outdated POS terminals, a user may obtain access to the user's virtual wallet via the user's device, thus improving the user's efficiency and ease in the shopping experience.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["201","202","203","204","205","206","207","208","209","210","211","212","214","213"]},"In some implementations, the user may select to conduct the transaction using a one-time anonymized credit card number, see e.g., . For example, the VWCS may utilize a pre-designated anonymized set of card details (see, e.g., \u201cAnonCard1,\u201d \u201cAnonCard2\u201d). As another example, the VWCS may generate, e.g., in real-time, a one-time anonymous set of card details to securely complete the purchase transaction (e.g., \u201cAnon It 1X\u201d). In such implementations, the app may automatically set the user profile settings such that the any personal identifying information of the user will not be provided to the merchant and\/or other entities.

For example, the VWCS may communicate with the user via text chat, SMS messages, electronic mail, Facebook\u00ae messages, Twitter\u2122 tweets, and\/or the like. The VWCS may pose a challenge question, e.g., , for the user. The app may provide a user input interface element(s) (e.g., virtual keyboard ) to answer the challenge question posed by the VWCS. In some implementations, the challenge question may randomly selected by the VWCS automatically; in some implementations, a customer service representative may manually communicate with the user. In some implementations, the user may not have initiated the transaction, e.g., the transaction is fraudulent. In such implementations, the user may cancel, e.g., , , the text challenge. The VWCS may then cancel the transaction, and\/or initiate fraud investigation procedures on behalf of the user.","In some implementations, the app may be configured to recognize product identifiers (e.g., barcodes, QR codes, etc.). For example, for fraud prevention, the app may require the user to utilize the user's device to obtain snapshot of the items being purchased, thus ensuring that the person who swiped the card is also in possession of the user's device as well as the purchase items. In some implementations, the user may be required to sign in to the app to enable its features. Once enabled, the camera may provide in-person one tap purchasing features for the user. For example, the client device may have a camera via which the app may acquire images, video data, streaming live video, and\/or the like, e.g., . The app may be configured to analyze the incoming data, and search, e.g., , for a product identifier, e.g., . In some implementations, the app may overlay cross-hairs, target box, and\/or like alignment reference markers, e.g., , so that a user may align the product identifier using the reference markers so facilitate product identifier recognition and interpretation. In some implementations, the app may include interface elements to allow the user to switch back and forth between the product identification mode and the product offer interface display screens (see, e.g., ), so that a user may accurately study the deals available to the user before capturing a product identifier. In some implementations, the app may provide the user with the ability to view prior product identifier captures (see, e.g., ) so that the user may be able to better decide which product identifier the user desires to capture. In some implementations, the user may desire to cancel product purchasing; the app may provide the user with a user interface element (e.g., ) to cancel the product identifier recognition procedure and return to the prior interface screen the user was utilizing. In some implementations, the user may be provided with information about products, user settings, merchants, offers, etc. in list form (see, e.g., ) so that the user may better understand the user's purchasing options. Various other features may be provided for in the app (see, e.g., ).","In some implementations, the user may be able to view and\/or modify the user profile and\/or settings of the user, e.g., by activating user interface element  (see ). For example, the user may be able to view\/modify a user name (e.g., -), account number (e.g., -), user security access code (e.g., -), user pin (e.g., -), user address (e.g., -), social security number associated with the user (e.g., -), current device GPS location (e.g., -), user account of the merchant in whose store the user currently is (e.g., -), the user's rewards accounts (e.g., -), and\/or the like. In some implementations, the user may be able to select which of the data fields and their associated values should be transmitted to facilitate the purchase transaction, thus providing enhanced data security for the user. For example, in the example illustration in , the user has selected the name , account number , security code , merchant account ID and rewards account ID as the fields to be sent as part of the notification to process the purchase transaction. In some implementations, the user may toggle the fields and\/or data values that are sent as part of the notification to process the purchase transactions. In some implementations, the app may provide multiple screens of data fields and\/or associated values stored for the user to select as part of the purchase order transmission. In some implementations, the app may provide the VWCS with the GPS location of the user. Based on the GPS location of the user, the VWCS may determine the context of the user (e.g., whether the user is in a store, doctor's office, hospital, postal service office, etc.).

For example, the pay network server may obtain the user ID of the user, card account number of the card the user swiped at the client, etc. The pay network server may attempt to determine whether the user has access to a virtual wallet from which the user may select a card to use to complete the purchase transaction. In some implementations, the pay network server may generate a query, e.g., , to a pay network database to obtain virtual card selection options available to the user, as discussed above in the description with reference to . In response to the virtual wallet card selection query, e.g., , the pay network database may provide, e.g., , the requested virtual wallet card selection options to the pay network server. The pay network server may generate a request for a selection of one of the payment options from the user's virtual wallet, e.g., , and provide the virtual wallet card selection request to a user device. For example, the query results mayt return a listing of several user e-wallet accounts (e.g., credit, debit, prepaid, etc., from numerous issuers, and merchants); this list of query results may be wrapped into a dynamic user-interface object (e.g., an HTML, XML, CSS, etc. wrapper; see , ), which may then be rendered by the user device. In some implementations, the user device may render, e.g., , the virtual wallet card selection options provided by the pay network server, and display the virtual wallet card selection options for the user, e.g., . For example, the selection object may be rendered in a display portion of the screen, e.g., in a web-rendering object view.","In some implementations, the user may provide a card selection input, e.g., , in response to the virtual wallet card selection options presented by the user device to the user. The user device may generate a virtual wallet card selection response based on the user's card selection input, e.g., , and provide the virtual wallet card selection response to the pay network server. In some implementations, the pay network server may wait for at least a predetermined amount of time for a response from the user to the virtual wallet card selection request. If the wait time exceeds the predetermined amount of time, the pay network server may determine that the user's time has run out, resulting in a timeout. This may provide an element of security to the user's virtual wallet. If the user has timed out, e.g., , option \u201cYes,\u201d the server may determine whether the user timed out more than a pre-specified number of times in the processing of the current transaction. If the user has not responded (or if the user's selections all have failed to result in successful authorization) more than a pre-specified threshold number of times, e.g., , option \u201cYes,\u201d the pay network server may determine that the transaction must be cancelled, and generate an \u201cauthorization fail\u201d message for the merchant server, e.g., . In some implementations, if the pay network server determines that the user has timed out (and\/or that the number of timeouts for the current transaction has exceed a predetermined threshold), the server may utilize a default virtual wallet card selection previously set by the user, and continue transaction processing using the default selection. In some implementations, the pay network server may always use the default virtual wallet card selection of the user, and may not attempt to contact the user via the user device to obtain a user selection. It is to be understood that varying permutations and\/or combinations of the features presented herein may be utilize to balance the security interest in contacting the user to obtain authorization and a custom selection of the card to utilize from the virtual wallet, against minimizing the number of times a user is contacted in order to effect a purchase transaction.","In some implementations, if the pay network server successfully captures a valid user selection of a card account from the virtual wallet card selection options, the pay network server may obtain the virtual wallet card selection response from the user device, and may parse the virtual wallet card selection response to extract details of the virtual wallet card selection. Using the extracted fields and field values, the pay network server may generate a query, e.g., , for an issuer server corresponding to the user's card account. In response to obtaining the issuer server query the pay network database may provide, e.g., , the requested issuer server data to the pay network server. In some implementations, the pay network server may utilize the issuer server data to generate a forwarding card authorization request, e.g., , to redirect the card authorization request from the acquirer server to the issuer server. The pay network server may provide the card authorization request to the issuer server. In some implementations, the issuer server may parse, e.g., , the card authorization request, and based on the request details may query a database, e.g., , for data of the user's card account. In response, the database may provide the requested user data, e.g., . On obtaining the user data, the issuer server may determine whether the user can pay for the transaction using funds available in the account, e.g., . For example, the issuer server may determine whether the user has a sufficient balance remaining in the account, sufficient credit associated with the account, and\/or the like, but comparing the data from the database with the transaction cost obtained from the card authorization request. If the issuer server determines that the user can pay for the transaction using the funds available in the account, the server may provide an authorization message, e.g., , to the pay network server.","In some implementations, the pay network server may obtain the authorization message, and parse the message to extract authorization details, e.g., . Upon determining that the user possesses sufficient funds for the transaction (e.g., , option \u201cYes\u201d), the pay network server may extract the transaction card from the authorization message and\/or card authorization request, e.g., , and generate a transaction data record, e.g., , using the card transaction details. The pay network server may provide the transaction data record for storage, e.g., , to a database. In some implementations, the pay network server may forward the authorization message, e.g., , to the acquirer server, which may in turn forward the authorization message, e.g., , to the merchant server. The merchant may obtain the authorization message, and parse the authorization message to extract its contents, e.g., . The merchant server may determine whether the user possesses sufficient funds in the card account to conduct the transaction. If the merchant server determines that the user possess sufficient funds, e.g., , option \u201cYes,\u201d the merchant server may add the record of the transaction for the user to a batch of transaction data relating to authorized transactions, e.g., -. The merchant server may also generate a purchase receipt, e.g., , for the user. If the merchant server determines that the user does not possess sufficient funds, e.g., , option \u201cNo,\u201d the merchant server may generate an \u201cauthorization fail\u201d message, e.g., . The merchant server may provide the purchase receipt or the \u201cauthorization fail\u201d message to the client. The client may render and display, e.g., , the purchase receipt for the user.","In some implementations, the merchant server may initiate clearance of a batch of authorized transactions by generating a batch data request, e.g., , and providing the request to a database. In response to the batch data request, the database may provide the requested batch data, e.g., , to the merchant server. The server may generate a batch clearance request, e.g., , using the batch data obtained from the database, and provide the batch clearance request to an acquirer server. The acquirer server may generate, e.g., , a batch payment request using the obtained batch clearance request, and provide the batch payment request to a pay network server. The pay network server may parse, e.g., , the batch payment request, select a transaction stored within the batch data, e.g., , and extract the transaction data for the transaction stored in the batch payment request, e.g., . The pay network server may generate a transaction data record, e.g., , and store the transaction data, e.g., , the transaction in a database. For the extracted transaction, the pay network server may generate an issuer server query, e.g., , for an address of an issuer server maintaining the account of the user requesting the transaction. The pay network server may provide the query to a database. In response, the database may provide the issuer server data requested by the pay network server, e.g., . The pay network server may generate an individual payment request, e.g., , for the transaction for which it has extracted transaction data, and provide the individual payment request to the issuer server using the issuer server data from the database.","In some implementations, the issuer server may obtain the individual payment request, and parse, e.g., , the individual payment request to extract details of the request. Based on the extracted data, the issuer server may generate a payment command, e.g., . For example, the issuer server may issue a command to deduct funds from the user's account (or add a charge to the user's credit card account). The issuer server may issue a payment command, e.g., , to a database storing the user's account information. In response, the database may update a data record corresponding to the user's account to reflect the debit\/charge made to the user's account. The issuer server may provide a funds transfer message, e.g., , to the pay network server after the payment command has been executed by the database.","In some implementations, the pay network server may check whether there are additional transactions in the batch that need to be cleared and funded. If there are additional transactions, e.g., , option \u201cYes,\u201d the pay network server may process each transaction according to the procedure described above. The pay network server may generate, e.g., , an aggregated funds transfer message reflecting transfer of all transactions in the batch, and provide, e.g., , the funds transfer message to the acquirer server.

For example, the user may view the details of the items associated with the transaction and the amounts  of each item. In a further implementation, the user may select the show option  to view actions  that the user may take in regards to the transaction or the items in the transaction. For example, the user may add a photo to the transaction (e.g., a picture of the user and the iPad the user bought). In a further implementation, if the user previously shared the purchase via social channels, a post including the photo may be generated and sent to the social channels for publishing. In one implementation, any sharing may be optional, and the user, who did not share the purchase via social channels, may still share the photo through one or more social channels of his or her choice directly from the history mode of the wallet application. In another implementation, the user may add the transaction to a group such as company expense, home expense, travel expense or other categories set up by the user. Such grouping may facilitate year-end accounting of expenses, submission of work expense reports, submission for value added tax (VAT) refunds, personal expenses, and\/or the like. In yet another implementation, the user may buy one or more items purchased in the transaction. The user may then execute a transaction without going to the merchant catalog or site to find the items. In a further implementation, the user may also cart one or more items in the transaction for later purchase.","The history mode, in another embodiment, may offer facilities for obtaining and displaying ratings  of the items in the transaction. The source of the ratings may be the user, the user's friends (e.g., from social channels, contacts, etc.), reviews aggregated from the web, and\/or the like. The user interface in some implementations may also allow the user to post messages to other users of social channels (e.g., TWITTER or FACEBOOK). For example, the display area  shows FACEBOOK message exchanges between two users. In one implementation, a user may share a link via a message . Selection of such a message having embedded link to a product may allow the user to view a description of the product and\/or purchase the product directly from the history mode.","In one embodiment, the history mode may also include facilities for exporting receipts. The export receipts pop up  may provide a number of options for exporting the receipts of transactions in the history. For example, a user may use one or more of the options , which include save (to local mobile memory, to server, to a cloud account, and\/or the like), print to a printer, fax, email, and\/or the like. The user may utilize his or her address book  to look up email or fax number for exporting. The user may also specify format options  for exporting receipts. Example format options may include, without limitation, text files (.doc, .txt, .rtf, iif, etc.), spreadsheet (.csv, .xls, etc.), image files (.jpg, .tff, .png, etc.), portable document format (.pdf), postscript (.ps), and\/or the like.

For example, a user may buy grocery and prescription items from a retailer Acme Supermarket. The user may, inadvertently or for ease of checkout for example, use his or her Visa card to pay for both grocery and prescription items. However, the user may have an FSA account that could be used to pay for prescription items, and which would provide the user tax benefits. In such a situation, the user may use the snap mode to initiate transaction reallocation.","As shown, the user may enter a search term (e.g., bills) in the search bar . The user may then identify in the tab  the receipt  the user wants to reallocate. Alternatively, the user may directly snap a picture of a barcode on a receipt, and the snap mode may generate and display a receipt  using information from the barcode. The user may now reallocate . In some implementations, the user may also dispute the transaction  or archive the receipt .","In one implementation, when the reallocate button  is selected, the wallet application may perform optical character recognition (OCR) of the receipt. Each of the items in the receipt may then be examined to identify one or more items which could be charged to which payment device or account for tax or other benefits such as cash back, reward points, etc. In this example, there is a tax benefit if the prescription medication charged to the user's Visa card is charged to the user's FSA. The wallet application may then perform the reallocation as the back end. The reallocation process may include the wallet contacting the payment processor to credit the amount of the prescription medication to the Visa card and debit the same amount to the user's FSA account. In an alternate implementation, the payment processor (e.g., Visa or MasterCard) may obtain and OCR the receipt, identify items and payment accounts for reallocation and perform the reallocation. In one implementation, the wallet application may request the user to confirm reallocation of charges for the selected items to another payment account. The receipt  may be generated after the completion of the reallocation process. As discussed, the receipt shows that some charges have been moved from the Visa account to the FSA.","With reference to , in one embodiment, the snap mode may facilitate payment via pay code such as barcodes or QR codes. For example, a user may snap a QR code of a transaction that is not yet complete. The QR code may be displayed at a merchant POS terminal, a web site, or a web application and may be encoded with information identifying items for purchase, merchant details and other relevant information. When the user snaps such as a QR code, the snap mode may decode the information in the QR code and may use the decoded information to generate a receipt . Once the QR code is identified, the navigation bar  may indicate that the pay code is identified. The user may now have an option to add to cart , pay with a default payment account  or pay with wallet .","In one implementation, the user may decide to pay with default . The wallet application may then use the user's default method of payment, in this example the wallet, to complete the purchase transaction. Upon completion of the transaction, a receipt may be automatically generated for proof of purchase. The user interface may also be updated to provide other options for handling a completed transaction. Example options include social  to share purchase information with others, reallocate  as discussed with regard to , and archive  to store the receipt.","With reference to , in one embodiment, the snap mode may also facilitate offer identification, application and storage for future use. For example, in one implementation, a user may snap an offer code  (e.g., a bar code, a QR code, and\/or the like). The wallet application may then generate an offer text  from the information encoded in the offer code. The user may perform a number of actions on the offer code. For example, the user use the find button  to find all merchants who accept the offer code, merchants in the proximity who accept the offer code, products from merchants that qualify for the offer code, and\/or the like. The user may also apply the offer code to items that are currently in the cart using the add to cart button . Furthermore, the user may also save the offer for future use by selecting the save button .","In one implementation, after the offer or coupon  is applied, the user may have the option to find qualifying merchants and\/or products using find, the user may go to the wallet using , and the user may also save the offer or coupon  for later use.","With reference to , in one embodiment, the snap mode may also offer facilities for adding a funding source to the wallet application. In one implementation, a pay card such as a credit card, debit card, pre-paid card, smart card and other pay accounts may have an associated code such as a bar code or QR code. Such a code may have encoded therein pay card information including, but not limited to, name, address, pay card type, pay card account details, balance amount, spending limit, rewards balance, and\/or the like. In one implementation, the code may be found on a face of the physical pay card. In another implementation, the code may be obtained by accessing an associated online account or another secure location. In yet another implementation, the code may be printed on a letter accompanying the pay card. A user, in one implementation, may snap a picture of the code. The wallet application may identify the pay card  and may display the textual information  encoded in the pay card. The user may then perform verification of the information  by selecting the verify button . In one implementation, the verification may include contacting the issuer of the pay card for confirmation of the decoded information  and any other relevant information. In one implementation, the user may add the pay card to the wallet by selecting the \u2018add to wallet\u2019 button . The instruction to add the pay card to the wallet may cause the pay card to appear as one of the forms of payment under the funds tab  discussed in . The user may also cancel importing of the pay card as a funding source by selecting the cancel button . When the pay card has been added to the wallet, the user interface may be updated to indicate that the importing is complete via the notification display . The user may then access the wallet  to begin using the added pay card as a funding source.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0125"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1111","1112","1113","1114","1115","1116","1117","1119","1120","1117","1120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0126"},"figref":["FIGS. 12A-B","FIG. 12A","FIG. 12A"],"b":["1211","1212","1213","1214","1215","1216","1217","1218","1219","1211","1212","1213","1218","1219"],"i":["a","b","a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","a","a","a","a ","a "]},"For example, a user may go to doctor's office and desire to pay the co-pay for doctor's appointment.

Logic blocks and interconnects can be programmed by the customer or designer, after the FPGA is manufactured, to implement any of the VWCS features. A hierarchy of programmable interconnects allow logic blocks to be interconnected as needed by the VWCS system designer\/administrator, somewhat like a one-chip programmable breadboard. An FPGA's logic blocks can be programmed to perform the operation of basic logic gates such as AND, and XOR, or more complex combinational operators such as decoders or simple mathematical operations. In most FPGAs, the logic blocks also include memory elements, which may be circuit flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory. In some circumstances, the VWCS may be developed on regular FPGAs and then migrated into a fixed version that more resembles ASIC implementations. Alternate or coordinating implementations may migrate VWCS controller features to a final ASIC instead of or in addition to FPGAs. Depending on the implementation all of the aforementioned embedded components and microprocessors may be considered the \u201cCPU\u201d and\/or \u201cprocessor\u201d for the VWCS.","The power source  may be of any standard form for powering small electronic circuit board devices such as the following power cells: alkaline, lithium hydride, lithium ion, lithium polymer, nickel cadmium, solar cells, and\/or the like.

Instant Messenger Service, and\/or the like. The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers, and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server, the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the VWCS controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example, a request such as http:\/\/123.124.125.126\/myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request \u201c123.124.125.126\u201d resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address; that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the \u201c\/myInformation.html\u201d portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information \u201cmyInformation.html.\u201d Additionally, other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports, e.g., FTP communications across port , and\/or the like. An information server may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the information server communicates with the VWCS database , operating systems, other program components, user interfaces, Web browsers, and\/or the like.","Access to the VWCS database may be achieved through a number of database bridge mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below (e.g., CGI) and through inter-application communication channels as enumerated below (e.g., CORBA, WebObjects, etc.). Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the VWCS. In one embodiment, the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields, and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags, which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and\/or fields. In one embodiment, the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join\/select commands based on the tagged text entries, wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the VWCS as a query. Upon generating query results from the query, the results are passed over the bridge mechanism, and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server, which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.","Also, an information server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","Computer interfaces in some respects are similar to automobile operation interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels, gearshifts, and speedometers facilitate the access, operation, and display of automobile resources, and status. Computer interaction interface elements such as check boxes, cursors, menus, scrollers, and windows (collectively and commonly referred to as widgets) similarly facilitate the access, capabilities, operation, and display of data and computer hardware and operating system resources, and status. Operation interfaces are commonly called user interfaces. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as the Apple Macintosh Operating System's Aqua and iOS's Cocoa Touch, IBM's OS\/2, Google's Android Mobile UI, Microsoft's Windows 2000\/2003\/3.1\/95\/98\/CE\/Millenium\/Mobile\/NT\/XP\/Vista\/7\/8 (i.e., Aero, Metro), Unix's X-Windows (e.g., which may include additional Unix graphic interface libraries and layers such as K Desktop Environment (KDE), mythTV and GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME)), web interface libraries (e.g., ActiveX, AJAX, (D)HTML, FLASH, Java, JavaScript, etc. interface libraries such as, but not limited to, Dojo, jQuery(UI), MooTools, Prototype, script.aculo.us, SWFObject, Yahoo! User Interface, any of which may be used and) provide a baseline and means of accessing and displaying information graphically to users.","A user interface component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The user interface may be a graphic user interface as provided by, with, and\/or atop operating systems and\/or operating environments such as already discussed. The user interface may allow for the display, execution, interaction, manipulation, and\/or operation of program components and\/or system facilities through textual and\/or graphical facilities. The user interface provides a facility through which users may affect, interact, and\/or operate a computer system. A user interface may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the user interface communicates with operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The user interface may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","A Web browser component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The Web browser may be a hypertext viewing application such as Goofle's (Mobile) Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, Apple's (Mobile) Safari, embedded web browser objects such as through Apple's Cocoa (Touch) object class, and\/or the like. Secure Web browsing may be supplied with 128 bit (or greater) encryption by way of HTTPS, SSL, and\/or the like. Web browsers allowing for the execution of program components through facilities such as ActiveX, AJAX, (D)HTML, FLASH, Java, JavaScript, web browser plug-in APIs (e.g., Chrome, FireFox, Internet Explorer, Safari Plug-in, and\/or the like APIs), and\/or the like. Web browsers and like information access tools may be integrated into PDAs, cellular telephones, smartphones, and\/or other mobile devices. A Web browser may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the Web browser communicates with information servers, operating systems, integrated program components (e.g., plug-ins), and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses. Also, in place of a Web browser and information server, a combined application may be developed to perform similar operations of both. The combined application would similarly effect the obtaining and the provision of information to users, user agents, and\/or the like from the VWCS equipped nodes. The combined application may be nugatory on systems employing standard Web browsers.","A mail server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail server may be an Internet mail server such as, but not limited to Apple's Mail Server (3), dovect, sendmail, Microsoft Exchange, and\/or the like. The mail server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as ASP, ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, PERL, PHP, pipes, Python, WebObjects, and\/or the like. The mail server may support communications protocols such as, but not limited to: Internet message access protocol (IMAP), Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)\/Microsoft Exchange, post office protocol (POPS), simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), and\/or the like. The mail server can route, forward, and process incoming and outgoing mail messages that have been sent, relayed and\/or otherwise traversing through and\/or to the VWCS.","Access to the VWCS mail may be achieved through a number of APIs offered by the individual Web server components and\/or the operating system.","Also, a mail server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses.","A mail client component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail client may be a mail viewing application such as Apple (Mobile) Mail, Microsoft Entourage, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, Mozilla, Thunderbird, and\/or the like. Mail clients may support a number of transfer protocols, such as: IMAP, Microsoft Exchange, POP3, SMTP, and\/or the like. A mail client may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the mail client communicates with mail servers, operating systems, other mail clients, and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses. Generally, the mail client provides a facility to compose and transmit electronic mail messages.","A cryptographic server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU , cryptographic processor , cryptographic processor interface , cryptographic processor device , and\/or the like. Cryptographic processor interfaces will allow for expedition of encryption and\/or decryption requests by the cryptographic component; however, the cryptographic component, alternatively, may run on a CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and\/or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric (e.g., Pretty Good Protection (PGP)) encryption and\/or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as, but not limited to: digital certificates (e.g., X.509 authentication framework), digital signatures, dual signatures, enveloping, password access protection, public key management, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component will facilitate numerous (encryption and\/or decryption) security protocols such as, but not limited to: checksum, Data Encryption Standard (DES), Elliptical Curve Encryption (ECC), International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), Message Digest 5 (MD5, which is a one way hash operation), passwords, Rivest Cipher (RC5), Rijndael, RSA (which is an Internet encryption and authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), and\/or the like. Employing such encryption security protocols, the VWCS may encrypt all incoming and\/or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network (VPN) with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of \u201csecurity authorization\u201d whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource. In addition, the cryptographic component may provide unique identifiers of content, e.g., employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique signature for an digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. The cryptographic component supports encryption schemes allowing for the secure transmission of information across a communications network to enable the VWCS component to engage in secure transactions if so desired. The cryptographic component facilitates the secure accessing of resources on the VWCS and facilitates the access of secured resources on remote systems; i.e., it may act as a client and\/or server of secured resources. Most frequently, the cryptographic component communicates with information servers, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The VWCS database component  may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component, which is executed by the CPU; the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be any of a number of fault tolerant, relational, scalable, secure databases, such as DB2, MySQL, Oracle, Sybase, and\/or the like. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field; i.e., the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely, they uniquely identify rows of a table on the \u201cone\u201d side of a one-to-many relationship.","Alternatively, the VWCS database may be implemented using various standard data-structures, such as an array, hash, (linked) list, struct, structured text file (e.g., XML), table, and\/or the like. Such data-structures may be stored in memory and\/or in (structured) files. In another alternative, an object-oriented database may be used, such as Frontier, ObjectStore, Poet, Zope, and\/or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and\/or linked together by common attributes; they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object-oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data but may have other types of capabilities encapsulated within a given object. If the VWCS database is implemented as a data-structure, the use of the VWCS database  may be integrated into another component such as the VWCS component . Also, the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures, objects, and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases, e.g., tables, may be exported and\/or imported and thus decentralized and\/or integrated.","In one embodiment, the database component  includes several tables -. A Users table may include fields such as, but not limited to: user_id, ssn, dob, first_name, last_name, age, state, address_firstline, address_secondline, zipcode, devices_list, contact_info, contact_type, alt_contact_info, alt_contact_type, and\/or the like.

For example, employing a distributed database system, queries and data access by search VWCS component may treat the combination of the VWCS database, an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.","In one embodiment, user programs may contain various user interface primitives, which may serve to update the VWCS. Also, various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the VWCS may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment, these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers (i.e., individual database controllers for each of the above tables). Employing standard data processing techniques, one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and\/or storage devices. Similarly, configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and\/or distributing the various database components -. The VWCS may be configured to keep track of various settings, inputs, and parameters via database controllers.","The VWCS database may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the VWCS database communicates with the VWCS component, other program components, and\/or the like. The database may contain, retain, and provide information regarding other nodes and data.","The VWCS component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment, the VWCS component incorporates any and\/or all combinations of the aspects of the VWCS discussed in the previous figures. As such, the VWCS affects accessing, obtaining and the provision of information, services, transactions, and\/or the like across various communications networks. The features and embodiments of the VWCS discussed herein increase network efficiency by reducing data transfer requirements, the use of more efficient data structures and mechanisms for their transfer and storage. As a consequence, more data may be transferred in less time, and latencies with regard to transactions, are also reduced. In many cases, such reduction in storage, transfer time, bandwidth requirements, latencies, etc., will reduce the capacity and structural infrastructure requirements to support the VWCS's features and facilities, and in many cases reduce the costs, energy consumption\/requirements, and extend the life of VWCS's underlying infrastructure; this has the added benefit of making the VWCS more reliable. Similarly, many of the features and mechanisms are designed to be easier for users to use and access, thereby broadening the audience that may enjoy\/employ and exploit the feature sets of the VWCS; such ease of use also helps to increase the reliability of the VWCS. In addition, the feature sets include heightened security as noted via the Cryptographic components , ,  and throughout, making access to the features and data more reliable and secure.","The VWCS component may transform virtual wallet card selections by users utilizing mobile devices via VWCS components into virtual wallet card-based transaction purchase notifications, and\/or the like and use of the VWCS. In one embodiment, the VWCS component  takes inputs (e.g., purchase input , card selection input ; virtual wallet card selection options ; issuer server data ; user data ; checkout request , product data ; wallet access input ; transaction authorization input ; payment gateway address ; payment network address ; issuer server address(es) ; funds authorization request(s) ; user(s) account(s) data ; batch data ; payment network address ; issuer server address(es) ; individual payment request ; payment ledger, merchant account data ; and\/or the like) etc., and transforms the inputs via various components (e.g., VW-CTE ; UPC ; PTA ; PTC ; and\/or the like), into outputs (e.g., virtual wallet card selection request ; authorization message -; batch append data ; purchase receipt ; checkout request message ; checkout data ; card authorization request , ; funds authorization response(s) ; transaction authorization response ; batch append data ; purchase receipt ; batch clearance request ; batch payment request ; transaction data ; individual payment confirmation , ; updated payment ledger, merchant account data ; and\/or the like).","The VWCS component enabling access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as, but not limited to: Apache components, Assembly, ActiveX, binary executables, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, database adapters, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, mapping tools, procedural and object oriented development tools, PERL, PHP, Python, shell scripts, SQL commands, web application server extensions, web development environments and libraries (e.g., Microsoft's ActiveX; Adobe AIR, FLEX & FLASH; AJAX; (D)HTML; Dojo, Java; JavaScript; jQuery(UI); MooTools; Prototype; script.aculo.us; Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP); SWFObject; Yahoo! User Interface; and\/or the like), WebObjects, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the VWCS server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The VWCS component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the VWCS component communicates with the VWCS database, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The VWCS may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The structure and\/or operation of any of the VWCS node controller components may be combined, consolidated, and\/or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and\/or deployment. Similarly, the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and\/or development. To accomplish this, one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.","The component collection may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and\/or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node, and\/or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load-balancing and\/or data-processing techniques. Furthermore, single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and\/or storage devices; e.g., databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.","The configuration of the VWCS controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as, but not limited to, the budget, capacity, location, and\/or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and\/or integrated program components, results in a more distributed series of program components, and\/or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration, data may be communicated, obtained, and\/or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate, obtain, and\/or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: data referencing (e.g., pointers), internal messaging, object instance variable communication, shared memory space, variable passing, and\/or the like.","If component collection components are discrete, separate, and\/or external to one another, then communicating, obtaining, and\/or providing data with and\/or to other components may be accomplished through inter-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: Application Program Interfaces (API) information passage; (distributed) Component Object Model ((D)COM), (Distributed) Object Linking and Embedding ((D)OLE), and\/or the like), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), Jini local and remote application program interfaces, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Remote Method Invocation (RMI), SOAP, process pipes, shared files, and\/or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter-application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra-application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using development tools such as lex, yacc, XML, and\/or the like, which allow for grammar generation and parsing capabilities, which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components.","For example, a grammar may be arranged to recognize the tokens of an HTTP post command, e.g.:\n\n","where Value1 is discerned as being a parameter because \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d is part of the grammar syntax, and what follows is considered part of the post value. Similarly, with such a grammar, a variable \u201cValue1\u201d may be inserted into an \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d post command and then sent. The grammar syntax itself may be presented as structured data that is interpreted and\/or otherwise used to generate the parsing mechanism (e.g., a syntax description text file as processed by lex, yacc, etc.). Also, once the parsing mechanism is generated and\/or instantiated, it itself may process and\/or parse structured data such as, but not limited to: character (e.g., tab) delineated text, HTML, structured text streams, XML, and\/or the like structured data. In another embodiment, inter-application data processing protocols themselves may have integrated and\/or readily available parsers (e.g., JSON, SOAP, and\/or like parsers) that may be employed to parse (e.g., communications) data. Further, the parsing grammar may be used beyond message parsing, but may also be used to parse: databases, data collections, data stores, structured data, and\/or the like. Again, the desired configuration will depend upon the context, environment, and requirements of system deployment.","For example, in some implementations, the VWCS controller may be executing a PHP script implementing a Secure Sockets Layer (\u201cSSL\u201d) socket server via the information server, which listens to incoming communications on a server port to which a client may send data, e.g., data encoded in JSON format. Upon identifying an incoming communication, the PHP script may read the incoming message from the client device, parse the received JSON-encoded text data to extract information from the JSON-encoded text data into PHP script variables, and store the data (e.g., client identifying information, etc.) and\/or extracted information in a relational database accessible using the Structured Query Language (\u201cSQL\u201d).

That alternate embodiments may not have been presented for a specific portion of the innovations or that further undescribed alternate embodiments may be available for a portion is not to be considered a disclaimer of those alternate embodiments. It will be appreciated that many of those undescribed embodiments incorporate the same principles of the innovations and others are equivalent. Thus, it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and functional, logical, operational, organizational, structural and\/or topological modifications may be made without departing from the scope and\/or spirit of the disclosure. As such, all examples and\/or embodiments are deemed to be non-limiting throughout this disclosure. Also, no inference should be drawn regarding those embodiments discussed herein relative to those not discussed herein other than it is as such for purposes of reducing space and repetition. For instance, it is to be understood that the logical and\/or topological structure of any combination of any data flow sequence(s), program components (a component collection), other components and\/or any present feature sets as described in the figures and\/or throughout are not limited to a fixed operating order and\/or arrangement, but rather, any disclosed order is exemplary and all equivalents, regardless of order, are contemplated by the disclosure. Furthermore, it is to be understood that such features are not limited to serial execution, but rather, any number of threads, processes, processors, services, servers, and\/or the like that may execute asynchronously, concurrently, in parallel, simultaneously, synchronously, and\/or the like are also contemplated by the disclosure. As such, some of these features may be mutually contradictory, in that they cannot be simultaneously present in a single embodiment. Similarly, some features are applicable to one aspect of the innovations, and inapplicable to others. In addition, the disclosure includes other innovations not presently claimed. Applicant reserves all rights in those presently unclaimed innovations, including the right to claim such innovations, file additional applications, continuations, continuations-in-part, divisions, and\/or the like thereof. As such, it should be understood that advantages, embodiments, examples, functional, features, logical, operational, organizational, structural, topological, and\/or other aspects of the disclosure are not to be considered limitations on the disclosure as defined by the claims or limitations on equivalents to the claims. It is to be understood that, depending on the particular needs and\/or characteristics of a VWCS individual and\/or enterprise user, database configuration and\/or relational model, data type, data transmission and\/or network framework, syntax structure, and\/or the like, various embodiments of the VWCS may be implemented that allow a great deal of flexibility and customization. For example, aspects of the VWCS may be adapted for fraud prevention, online\/virtual shopping, online financial management; and\/or the like. While various embodiments and discussions of the VWCS have been directed to electronic purchase transactions, however, it is to be understood that the embodiments described herein may be readily configured and\/or customized for a wide variety of other applications and\/or implementations."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying appendices, drawings, figures, images, etc. illustrate various example, non-limiting, inventive aspects, embodiments, and features (\u201ce.g.,\u201d or \u201cexample(s)\u201d) in accordance with the present disclosure:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A-C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A-C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A-C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A-E","b":"500"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A-G"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIGS. 8A-F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIGS. 10A-E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIGS. 12A-B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIGS. 15A-B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIGS. 16A-B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIGS. 17A-B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIGS. 18A-B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 19"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
