The Government has certain rights in the invention.","Optical arbitrary waveform generation (OAWG) is a technique where a photonic device is programmed to create the desired output as an optical waveform which has an arbitrary modulation format that is user specified on demand. Typically this is done from a purely electronic approach, which is limited in bandwidth. OAWG has a wide range of potential and emerging military and commercial applications.","The past approaches described in this section could be pursued, but are not necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated herein, the approaches described in this section are not to be considered prior art to the claims in this application merely due to the presence of these approaches in this background section.","Electronic AWG systems meet the requirements of certain applications, but are typically limited in their bandwidth. Some optical AWG systems alleviate the limited bandwidth constraint. However, despite significant investment, the known state-of-the-art OAWG systems suffer from several limitations, including their relatively short duration for non-repetitive waveforms, a slow refresh rate, limited spectral resolution, and a relatively small number of independently controlled frequency channels","New OAWG methods are desired that are capable of effective use of wider bandwidth, extended time apertures, high-resolution spectral control of the optical waveforms, long optical coherence lengths, long-term absolute frequency stability, or precise optical phase manipulation, alone or in some combination. Additional desirable properties include systems that incorporate cost-effective low-bandwidth commercial technology with a robust, compact modular system design for efficient mass-production and deployment into a wide range of operation platform.","In a first set of embodiments, a method for producing an arbitrary broadband waveform includes generating a first narrowband waveform and generating a frequency-shifted replica by frequency shifting the first narrowband waveform by a frequency shift. A second narrowband waveform is also generated. A broadband waveform is generated by combining the frequency-shifted replica and the second narrowband waveform.","In a second set of embodiments, a method for producing an arbitrary broadband optical waveform includes generating a first narrowband optical waveform and generating a frequency-shifted replica by frequency shifting the first narrowband waveform by a frequency shift. A second narrowband optical waveform is also generated. A broadband optical waveform is generated by coherently combining the frequency-shifted replica and the second narrowband waveform.","In a third set of embodiments, a method comprises determining a target broadband waveform. The method also comprises determining a spectrum and phase for a first narrowband optical waveform and determining a spectrum and phase for a second narrowband optical waveform. The first and second waveforms are determined so that a frequency-shifted replica of the first narrowband optical waveform coherently combined with the second narrowband optical waveform generates a broadband optical waveform that substantively matches the target broadband waveform.","In a various other sets of embodiments, an apparatus or computer readable medium is configured to perform one or more steps of one or more of the above methods.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","A method and apparatus are described for broadband optical arbitrary waveform generation (OAWG). In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","Some embodiments of the invention are described below in the context of arbitrary broadband optical waveforms. However, the invention is not limited to this context. In other embodiments arbitrary waveforms of other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as microwave waveforms, are generated using steps and components known to correspond to those described below for optical waveforms.","Some basic attributes of the desired waveform are wide bandwidth (BW) and its time aperture (TA). The metric of the time bandwidth product, or TBP=TA\u00d7BW covers both of these attributes. OAWG techniques can also be used to create radio frequency (RF) or millimeter wave (MMW) waveforms, a concept called herein RF-AWG. The approach is similar to OAWG but in which the output signal is a voltage, typically created by interacting the produced optical waveform with a photodetector, which converts photons to voltages.","According to example embodiments described herein, wideband spectral shaping of optical signals with complete phase and amplitude control provide capabilities for generating complex waveforms that are difficult, expensive, or impossible to generate or transmit by purely electronic means [refs 1,2]. In various embodiments, the output is either an optical signal, or RF\/MMW signals. Generation of agile, complex, wideband waveforms is useful for sophisticated military applications including electronic countermeasures, optical code-division-multiple-access (CDMA) systems, synthetic aperture RADAR (SAR), low probability of intercept (LPI) RADAR, unambiguous Range-Doppler radar or laser radar, optical free space communications, and pulse shaping for spectroscopy, among others [refs 3, 4, 5, 6].","To meet these demanding performance targets, embodiments of enhanced OAWG systems are described herein, including an experimental prototype device embodiment. The approach is based on the coherent accumulation and interference of spectrally shaped waveforms. This represents a fundamental new direction in OAWG methodology\u2014as this photonic approach is fundamentally different from other techniques that are known for the synthesis of wideband RF waveforms with photonic means [refs. 7, 8]. A difference of the approach presented herein from other approaches is in doing coherent waveform synthesis, in which the technique builds on a frequency and phase stable continuous wave (cw) laser and uses control signals derived from conventional, narrowband and stable components (both modulators and electronics). The photonic components include a coherent photonic ring apparatus with several control points. This is opposed to the prior art approach of modulating a train of brief optical pulses. The benefits in the new OAWG approach presented here include one or more of: full wideband operation of 10 gigahertz (GHz, 1 GHz=10Hertz, 1 Hertz=1 cycle per second) or higher; and a significantly increased time aperture of 100 to 1000 times that of the prior art. For example, the time aperture scales to several microseconds (\u03bcs, 1 \u03bcs=10seconds) or longer for one or more of the illustrated embodiments, as compared to a limit of several nanoseconds (ns, 1 ns=10-12 seconds) when using brief pulses.","The illustrated embodiments build on the concept of a spectrally accumulated signal in a optical storage ring. Some embodiments have focused on methods for generating accurate, broadband, rapid frequency chirps that span ranges approaching 1 terahertz (THz, 1 THz=10Hertz). With further development, this same innovative technology is extended in other embodiments to generate arbitrary optical waveforms with complete amplitude and phase control over bandwidths of 1 GHz-1 THz, and with time apertures of 1-100 \u03bcs, and spectral resolution down to \u02dc10 kilohertz (kHz, 1 kHz=10Hertz). These are example ranges, and not intended to be limiting on either end of the scale.","An advantage of some embodiments includes operating with modern but rather ordinary photonic components. These components consist of lasers, fiber optics, low bandwidth modulators, low bandwidth control electronics, fiber optical amplifiers, and related fiber optical items (splitters, couplers, etc). This is an advantage in that the laser light can be formed arbitrarily wherever there are available components. Typically this means there is a good fit to the technologically significant 1.5 micrometer (\u03bcm, 1 \u03bcm=10meters) wavelength telecom band, allowing the OAWG device to be constructed from high-quality commercial off-the-shelf components (COTS)\u2014an important advantage for practical commercialization and mass-production of OAWG units.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","120","130","140"]},"The OAWG  is configured for one or more of the following operations. 1. Input source may be electromagnetic radiation source. 2. Input source packets perform only lower bandwidth shaping as compared to desired output bandwidth of a target broadband waveform. 3. Input source provides N limited bandwidth packets, each individually spectrally configurable with lower bandwidth controls. 4. Each one of N input packets is input sequentially into storage device. 5. Storage device has intrinsic delay time that can store previous packets with a time aperture up to that delay duration. 6. Storage is paired with frequency shifter that shifts previously input spectral packets to other frequencies to open up spectral window for new inputs. 7. New input spectrum packets are inserted into the next sequential spectral window. 8. After N sequential cycles of input, the storage device has accumulated and now contains up to N times the bandwidth of the original low bandwidth inputs. 9.

Because of the continuous optical frequency stepping incorporated into the ring design, subsequent injected waveforms each span an independent section of the optical spectrum, and the coherent interference of these stored waveforms generates the high-bandwidth optical arbitrary waveform output. After the desired spectral range is accumulated in the ring, the optical waveform is coupled out of the ring and generation of the next waveform may begin, or the current waveform may be continuously repeated if desired. A modular fiber delay line  inside the optical ring controls the ultimate waveform time aperture, and an intra-ring optical amplifier  compensates all losses incurred during circulation. In the illustrated embodiment, phase control can be enforced through control of the RF phase driving the intra-ring frequency shifter ; however, it is anticipated that in other embodiments an intra-ring EOM could be included for precise dynamic control of the phase.","The fact that this simple and well-controlled method for constructing wide-bandwidth optical waveforms only requires low-bandwidth spectral shaping techniques acts as a tremendous advantage in design, construction, flexibility, and cost.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["420","402","410"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"]},"In the illustrated embodiment, Steps 1 and 2 are done a priori on an electronic computer or ship (as described below with reference to  and , respectively); while steps 3 and 4 are done in photonic hardware (e.g., as depicted in ). The basic operational approach for constructing an arbitrary optical waveform with this accumulation method is diagrammed in . With Step 1, the desired target broadband optical waveform phase and amplitude profile are entered into a software interface. In Step 2, the software calculates the Fourier spectrum of the desired waveform and sections the spectrum into individual frequency bins with width on the same order as the ring stepping frequency. During Step 3, these individual sections of the spectrum are inverse Fourier transformed to generate low-bandwidth temporal waveforms that are then sequentially shaped and injected into the optical ring where they are frequency shifted on each circulation to cover the entire desired frequency bandwidth after a specified number of circulations. This leads to Step 4, where the coherent interference of all the frequency-shifted low-bandwidth injected waveforms reconstructs the desired high-bandwidth optical waveform that is then coupled out of the ring on demand.","As evident in the above figures, these embodiments introduce a fundamental new direction in OAWG methodology: replacing the typical space-to-frequency conversion employed in optical comb techniques for OAWG with a new approach of coherent accumulation. This new concept provides unique advantages through the existing technological capability for controlling time more precisely than spatial channel separation.","There are several reasons why broadband optical arbitrary waveform generation in a re-circulating optical ring can achieve more precise waveform synthesis than what is possible with spectral line-by-line filtering of the comb emission spectrum of a mode-locked laser. A self-referenced optical frequency comb [ref. 9] can emit a set of very broadband frequency components that can be individually manipulated for waveform synthesis. These systems generally employ dispersive elements to spatially separate the spectral components onto a spatial light modulator (SLM) that allows the phase and amplitude of each spectral component to be manipulated. In the current state-of-the-art OAWG systems, individual phase-locked spectral lines of the optical frequency comb are imaged onto independent pixels of the SLM to allow for spectral resolutions limited only by the mode-locking frequency [refs 10, 11, 12]. While these system provide excellent capabilities for generating waveforms with bandwidths of THz or more, there are significant limitations in present day filtering technologies for how precisely the desired spectrum can be shaped after spatial separation by a diffraction grating.","Recent SLM demonstrations [ref. 13] for arbitrary waveform shaping have used on the order of 10elements (perhaps extensible to about 10) to control the entire bandwidth of the comb using available sizes of transmissive LCD pixel arrays. This restrictive limitation on the number of independent spectral data bits directly translates to limited dynamic range and waveform shaping capabilities. Furthermore, current SLM technology based on thermo-optic effects or LCD arrays is limited to slow refresh rates of typically a few kHz. In addition, practical frequency mode spacings are limited to MHz to GHz ranges, limiting the non-repetitive waveform time apertures to less than microseconds, and more typically to nanoseconds. While a variety of techniques may be employed to spread the discreet spectral elements continuously over the spectrum, the spacing of SLM pixels still sets the ultimate frequency resolution.","Various illustrated embodiments for OAWG through coherent accumulation provide many unique advantages over traditional methods of spectral shaping of frequency combs. These advantages arise through the approach of using a highly stable cw laser source with a frequency stepping optical storage ring as an effective time-to-frequency converter, allowing all of the spectral shaping to be performed in the time domain. With this technique, time can be mapped to frequency with any chosen proportionality so that individual sections of the final frequency spectrum may be shaped with a spectral resolution and bandwidth chosen to match available low-cost COTS RF frequency opto-electronic components. Furthermore, the ultimate non-repetitive length of the time aperture is only limited by the optical fiber delay line in the ring, which can easily be greater than 100 \u03bcs. As a result, complete and continuous spectral shaping across a bandwidth of up to 1 THz is possible with resolutions of 10 kHz, corresponding to phase and amplitude control of 10independent spectral channels\u2014a capability clearly far advanced of the 100-1000 channels available with SLM technology. This high spectral resolution is preferred for optical synthesis of wideband RF waveforms or generation of complex and agile optical waveforms for LADAR.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"While there are many different embodiments anticipated, a preferred embodiment for generating high bandwidth phase and amplitude controlled output waveforms is depicted in .  is a high level block diagram that illustrates another implementation with additional advantages, according to an embodiment. The embodiment of  involves one or more of the following: frequency stable, narrow linewidth, laser source , for example an optical fiber laser source; high dynamic range amplitude and phase\/frequency modulation  for input shaping, for example a waveguide AM and PM modulators or acousto-optic modulators; optical coupler to inject input waveforms into storage ring, for example a fiber optic beam splitter ; optical frequency shifter in storage ring , for example an acousto-optic frequency shifter; linear optical amplifier, for example erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) ; optical delay line , for example a length of single-mode optical fiber combined; precise system timing such as injection pulses, stable master clock  for all electronic signals; and constant relative phase lock of input laser optical frequency, optical frequency shifter, and optical storage ring circulation frequency (inverse of round trip circulation time period).","The high-level design of the preferred implementation as depicted in  was implemented and used to produce experimental results. Commercial off the shelf (COTS) optical components at 1.5 micron optical wavelengths were used. Results of this proof of principle demonstrations are shown below in ,  and . These results are very promising and demonstrate that this approach is practical with existing COTS components.","Some embodiments involve a RF output waveform rather than an optical output waveform, called herein \u201cphotonics-enabled Radio-Frequency Arbitrary Waveform Generation\u201d (RF-AWG) and development efforts for such embodiments are summarized below","This demonstration's goal was to show embodiments capable of high-speed synthesis at the expected 3.24 GHz of bandwidth that were able to be measured using present equipment. The highest bandwidth waveforms to date were synthesized by embodiments using forty circulations, with injection waveforms at spectral intervals of 80.993 MHz, for a total bandwidth of 3.24 GHz.

This effect can be improved in other embodiments by actively stabilizing the optical storage ring. Improved waveform reliability is achieved in some embodiments after active stabilization hardware is added.","Some embodiments are designed for achieving bipolar radio frequency (RF) signal generation. Therein, the photodetector is a current source input to a high bandwidth Bias-T with DC throughput of a configurable fixed offset current added to the detected photocurrent, with the combined signal then sent through a resistive load. This allows the photocurrent to be operated at a nominal half-maximum level for zero signal that is offset above and below that level for positive and negative signals, respectively.","An initial demonstration was performed for synthesizing bipolar waveforms by using the previously suggested technique. ,  and  are graphs that illustrate an initial demonstration of bipolar waveform synthesis for waveform specification () using a boosted optical level bias (unipolar optical power), and then a post-detection subtracted electronic offset via a biased-T junction. With the limited bandwidth of only seven circulations, there are comparable transients observed in both simulation () and data ().","An input waveform is specified as shown in . This bipolar RF signal is temporarily converted to an equivalent unipolar signal by adding a half-maximum offset as a DC bias level, so that it is implemented as a simple unipolar power envelope for handling by the optical interference process steps in some embodiments. After the AC-coupled photodetector transfers the optical envelope to an RF signal, a Bias-T junction subtracts a fixed DC current to remove the preset optical bias level in these embodiments. The resulting current is passed through a resistive load (or alternatively through a transimpedance amplifier). The end output is a bipolar voltage waveform for the user.","The idea for creating \u201cbipolar\u201d optical waveforms biased at half optical intensity (for making bipolar RF signals via a post-photodetection subtracted offset) may be difficult to implement in some embodiments because much of the optical dynamic range is wasted with a large average \u201cDC\u201d component. More sophisticated strategies for dynamic range preservation are used in yet other embodiments, such as by employing compression with non-linear absorbers and non-linear re-amplification.","Preliminary data from initial embodiments is shown in . In this embodiment, the optical waveform representation is broken down into seven injections comprising a total of 567 MHz of bandwidth for this data. The time aperture is 419.79 ns, and the resulting TBP was about 238. What is remarkable is that many of the transient oscillations that are most easily seen in the simulated trace of  are also quite visible as very similar mid-level oscillations in experimental data of , indicating that these undulations are not just random noise.","The example optical arbitrary waveform generation devices (OAWG) serve applications grouped in two primary divisions: a) usage as a primary optical arbitrary waveform source, and b) usage for conversion of the optical waveform modulation to RF for the generation of 10 GHz-1 THz bandwidth signaling. One goal is for a portable, rugged photonic hardware system. Such OAWG embodiments are deployable for a variety of applications, in typical test and measurement packaging. Thus, applications can be divided into photonic outputs and RF outputs.","As one example of optical source market demand, the OAWG product provides an enabling component for the ultra-wideband signal processing capabilities of an optical LADAR\/communications system. Our other capabilities can process UWB optical waveforms, and thus the OAWG embodiments are enabling for generating optical arbitrary waveforms, which are then optically processed.","Examples of applications using OAWG photonic outputs are: 1) a fundamental signal generator for photonic circuitry test and measurement to fill the unpopulated gap for 10 GHz-1 THz optical modulation sources; 2) optical analog to digital converter (ADC) systems, as described above; 3) LADAR with spectrally tuned and customized waveforms for maximum return for each situation; 4) LADAR vibrometry with extended range returns of the time aperture in the OAWG, where individualized analysis waveforms can be sequentially applied to each specific spectral return blip from a multiple vehicle return signal; 5) compressed optical communication streams using brevity and high bandwidth to compact the data for assisting in low probability of intercept communications; and 6) heterodyne detection using AWG for coherent detection, particularly with spectral compression for acquisition of sparse waveforms with spectral energy allocation directed to bandwidths of particular interest.","The application of OAWG as an input to the conversion interface for ultra-high speed RF applications is very similar but the end result is a voltage. The RF applications often involve development of a specialized RF backend, with a wideband photo-detector and amplifiers. This may be of particular interest for users or companies already possessing those capabilities. Applications include: 1) electronic countermeasures where incoming signals are jammed until a falsified signal is generated and returned to confuse the observer; 2) tailored spectrum waveforms to fill open space but avoid co-site interference; 3) collision avoidance range-Doppler waveforms; and 4) optically mixed pre- or post-compensation of high BW phase distortions from high-gain RF antennas with poor intrinsic phase response.","THz applications are also anticipated. Examples of these extensions are THz signal generation and THz signal processing. Also, broadband RF, MMW, THz and optical signals could be applied for medical potential in finding reactions and the impact on human cells to different electrical impulses using various frequencies, waveforms, and designs.","The need for an optical version of an AWG is as directly applicable to light wave circuitry as the analogs found in the ubiquitous counterparts for RF electronic circuits test bench equipment. Markets for existing electronic arbitrary waveform generators are large and expanding. According to Frost & Sullivan's market report, \u201cWorld Signal Generators and Arbitrary Waveform Generators Markets\u201d (released June 2008), there is a $667M global market in which RF signal generators account for 52.6 percent of the 2007 revenues. Estimates reach $888.5M in 2012, reflecting high growth rates in demand for AWGs with the increased development of higher performance instruments.","Commercial OAWGs do not exist, while electronic arbitrary waveform generators do, and have excellent performance with lower bandwidths, while still making excellent improvements over the past decade. As a point of comparison to what is currently available in the state-of-the-art high end AWG market place, Tektronix offers its AWG7102 product which offers approximately 4 GHz of bandwidth with \u02dc6 ENOB for $120 k. OAWGs for RF applications are anticipated to meet the needs of users with very wide bandwidths >10 GHz, and for optical applications with 10-1,000 GHz of bandwidth. The end users may be expecting RF generator performance, but will likely relax expectations in exchange for higher bandwidth. Product pricing in this market is a highly competitive factor as the average price of the test instruments continue to steadily decline.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1100","1100","1110","1100","1100"]},"A sequence of binary digits constitutes digital data that is used to represent a number or code for a character.

Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in memory  causes processor  to perform the method steps described herein. In alternative embodiments, hardware, such as application specific integrated circuit , may be used in place of or in combination with software to implement the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software.","The signals transmitted over network link  and other networks through communications interface , carry information to and from computer system . Computer system  can send and receive information, including program code, through the networks ,  among others, through network link  and communications interface . In an example using the Internet , a server  transmits program code for a particular application, requested by a message sent from computer , through Internet , ISP equipment , local network  and communications interface . The received code may be executed by processor  as it is received, or may be stored in storage device  or other non-volatile storage for later execution, or both. In this manner, computer system  may obtain application program code in the form of a signal on a carrier wave.","Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequence of instructions or data or both to processor  for execution. For example, instructions and data may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer such as host . The remote computer loads the instructions and data into its dynamic memory and sends the instructions and data over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to the computer system  receives the instructions and data on a telephone line and uses an infra-red transmitter to convert the instructions and data to a signal on an infra-red a carrier wave serving as the network link . An infrared detector serving as communications interface  receives the instructions and data carried in the infrared signal and places information representing the instructions and data onto bus . Bus  carries the information to memory  from which processor  retrieves and executes the instructions using some of the data sent with the instructions. The instructions and data received in memory  may optionally be stored on storage device , either before or after execution by the processor .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1200","1200","1200"]},"In one embodiment, the chip set  includes a communication mechanism such as a bus  for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor  has connectivity to the bus  to execute instructions and process information stored in, for example, a memory . The processor  may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi-core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi-core processor include two, four, eight, or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition, the processor  may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus  to enable independent execution of instructions, pipelining, and multithreading. The processor  may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors (DSP) , or one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) . A DSP  typically is configured to process real-world signals (e.g., sound) in real time independently of the processor . Similarly, an ASIC  can be configured to performed specialized functions not easily performed by a general purposed processor. Other specialized components to aid in performing the inventive functions described herein include one or more field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) (not shown), one or more controllers (not shown), or one or more other special-purpose computer chips.","The processor  and accompanying components have connectivity to the memory  via the bus . The memory  includes both dynamic memory (e.g., RAM, magnetic disk, writable optical disk, etc.) and static memory (e.g., ROM, CD-ROM, etc.) for storing executable instructions that when executed perform one or more steps of a method described herein. The memory  also stores the data associated with or generated by the execution of one or more steps of the methods described herein.","In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof.
