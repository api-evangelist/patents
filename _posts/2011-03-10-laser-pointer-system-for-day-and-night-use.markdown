title: Laser pointer system for day and night use
abstract: A novel eye-safe, long range laser pointer system for use in day or night conditions is described. The system uses a short pulse laser and a gated camera to detect the laser spot at long ranges in the presence of a strong solar background. The camera gate is synchronized with incident laser pulses using a separate large area, fast photodiode to detect the high peak power pulses. Alternately, gate synchronization using a GPS-disciplined clock can be used. Eye-safe systems operating in the near-UV or SWIR band are described.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, sold, imported, and\/or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America.","This invention relates in general to laser pointers, and more particularly to long range, day or night laser pointers.","Infrared laser pointers have been used successfully under nighttime conditions for the important applications of target marking and target hand-off, while providing shoot-from-the-hip capability. A laser spot generated by a continuous wave (CW) eye-safe near-infrared (NIR) laser can be observed by standard issue night vision goggles (NVGs) or near-infrared sensitive cameras at long distances. This system, however, only operates under conditions where the background illumination is very low. Under daytime conditions, the IR laser spot becomes indistinguishable from the solar background illumination, rendering the CW laser spot undetectable.","A novel eye-safe, long range laser pointer system for use in day or night conditions is described. The system uses a short pulse laser and a gated camera to detect the laser spot at long ranges in the presence of a strong solar background. The camera gate is synchronized with incident laser pulses using a separate large area, fast photodiode to detect the high peak power pulses. Alternately, gate synchronization using a GPS-disciplined clock can be used. Eye-safe systems operating in the near-UV or SWIR band are described.","In one aspect, a laser pointer system is disclosed. Such a system comprises a laser capable of emitting short laser pulses; a synchronization photodiode to detect arriving reflections of said short laser pulses; a camera to detect a remote laser spot; and a display to display the position of said laser spot. Said camera is gated synchronously with the laser pulses.","In another aspect, a GPS-based laser pointer system is disclosed. Such a system comprises a laser capable of emitting short laser pulses; a GPS-disciplined clock; a camera that is gated synchronously with said laser pulses based on a GPS signal from said GPS-disciplined clock to detect a remote laser spot; and a display to display the position of said laser spot.","Yet, in another aspect, a laser pointing method is disclosed based on a laser pointer system. Such a method comprises: directing a laser beam of short pulses from a laser towards a distant surface; detecting by a photodiode laser pulses scattered from said laser beam incident on said distant surface; producing a detection signal from a photodiode detection circuit based on said detection of scattered laser pulses; triggering a gated camera based on said detection signal from the photodiode detection circuit so that the gate coincides with the scattered laser pulses incident on the camera to generate a camera image signal; and generating a context image on a display based on said camera image signal. Said context image includes the position of an imaged laser spot shown on said display.","The disclosure can find applications in long range, day or night laser pointer for, e.g., target hand-off, target marking, or shoot-from-hip capability.","An exemplary embodiment of a laser pointer system  comprises a camera  that is gated synchronously with laser pulses , a short pulse eye-safe laser , a narrow-band spectral filter ( and\/or ), a photodiode  to detect the arriving reflections  of the laser pulses and to provide synchronization signal to the camera , or a GPS-disciplined clock for synchronizing the camera.","An exemplary laser wavelength for an exemplary embodiment of the daytime pointer system (e.g., ) is in the near-UV band of 350-399 nm. This wavelength range has several important advantages; a) optical radiation in this wavelength range is relatively eye-safe because it does not penetrate to the retina of the eye, b) the solar background radiation in this wavelength range is low, c) atmospheric transmission is adequate for type of operational range needed for a laser pointer, d) near-UV optical radiation is readily detectable with standard low cost silicon CCD and CMOS cameras, e) large area silicon PIN or APD detectors exhibit high quantum efficiency in this wavelength range and also have a fast response time due to low junction capacitance. Such large area, fast detectors are required for detection of high peak power pulses while achieving a wide field of view for the detection system.","Such an exemplary system configuration, and the essential system components, the pulsed laser , synchronization photodiode , camera , and display  are shown in .","Such an exemplary system functions as follows, e.g., a laser pointing method based on a laser pointer system comprises: the laser beam , consisting of a train of short pulses, is incident on a distant surface  and scattered light (e.g., ) is detected by the photodiode. The signal from the photodiode detection circuit  triggers a gated camera  so that the gate coincides with the arrival of the scattered laser pulses  at the camera . The context image generated by the camera, including the imaged laser spot , is shown on a display . Image processing can be used to locate the laser spot  in the image, and a display overlay indicator can be used to highlight the location of the laser spot on the image. Alternately, a second co-aligned camera can be used to provide an RGB context image while the first camera is used to find the location of the laser spot. The laser spot location is shown on the RGB image display using an overlay indicator. To reduce the contribution of the solar background, narrow-band spectral filters (e.g.,  or ) are placed in front of the photodiode  and the camera , as shown in . The photodetector  should have a large area to enable a wide field of view (FOV) detection of the short laser pulses using large diameter, short focal length lenses (e.g., ). Such large area, fast detectors are only available in silicon and have high sensitivity in the 300-1100 nm band.","An alternate exemplary system can be embodied without the synchronization photo detector as shown in . Such an exemplary alternative system uses GPS signals (e.g., , ) to independently synchronize the laser  and the camera , so that both are mutually synchronized to each other. More specifically, such an alternate exemplary system comprises a camera  that is gated synchronously with laser pulses  based on a GPS signal , a short pulse laser  based on a GPS signal , a narrow-band spectral filter . A GPS-disciplined clock  synchronizes the laser  and the camera  based on GPS signals  and . The context image generated by the camera, including the imaged laser spot , is shown on a display . This approach has the advantage of providing camera-to-laser synchronization under conditions when the optical signal reaching the observer is too low to detect using a photodiode. Since this approach does not require large area, fast photodiodes that are only available in silicon, an alternate eye-safe laser wavelength can be used, such as one in the SWIR band of 1400-2000 nm. A convenient wavelength in this band is 1570 nm because of the availability of compact pulsed laser sources based on Q-switched Nd:YAG and optical parametric oscillators (OPOs).","In the near-UV band, a preferred choice of wavelength is 355 nm, corresponding to frequency tripled Nd:YAG lasers operating at 1064 nm. Efficient frequency tripling of Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers can be readily achieved using a two step process of generating the 532 nm second harmonic in the first nonlinear crystal then using a second nonlinear crystal to generate the 355 nm sum frequency by mixing the second harmonic radiation with the remaining 1064 nm fundamental radiation. Typically KTP is used as the frequency doubling crystal and LBO is used as the sum frequency mixing crystal.","Compact optical sources based on frequency conversion (using OPO or frequency tripling) of Q-switched lasers typically generate pulses in the 5-20 nanosecond range, making it possible to use very short camera gate widths of 10-50 microseconds, resulting in strong suppression of the solar background signal. In addition, such short pulse lengths result in very high laser pulse peak powers, making it possible to detect such pulses with the synchronization photodiodes from a long distance.","Such various exemplary day pointer systems as described can circumvent deficiencies associated with the NIR pointer system and make it possible to achieve laser pointing under full sunlight conditions. Short camera gate times and narrow-band spectral filters are used to suppress the solar contribution to sufficiently small levels to allow detection of the laser spot in the camera image. The use of near-UV or SWIR laser wavelengths makes it possible to achieve long range laser spot detection and laser pointing with laser pulse energies and average powers that are eye-safe.","The disclosure can find applications in long range, day or night laser pointer for, e.g., target hand-off, target marking, or shoot-from-hip capability.","It is obvious that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Additional advantages and features will become apparent as the subject invention becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
