ID NO. 1) was made on a 433A automated synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) using standard Fastmoc\u2122 deprotection\/coupling cycles with 0.25 mmol MBHA Rink amide resin (SynPep, Dublin, Calif.). Cartridges containing NFmoc-amino acids (1 mmol) with side-chain protection (Arg: 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonyl; Asp and Glu: tert-butyl ester; Asn, Cys, Gln, and His: trityl; Lys and Trp: tert-butyloxycarbonyl; Ser, Thr, and Tyr: tert-butyl ether were activated with O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (1 mmol), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (1 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (2 mmol) in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). The activated amino acid was coupled for 30 minutes following removal of the N-terminal Fmoc group with 20% piperidine in NMP. Labeling was accomplished by suspending the resin-bound, N-terminally deprotected side-chain protected peptide resin (0.04 mmol) and 6-carboxyfluorescein-NHS ester (57 mg) in anhydrous dimethylformamide (2 mL) containing 0.02 mL diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) and shaking at ambient temperature overnight. The resin was drained, washed 3 times with 1:1 dichloromethane\/methanol and dried. The labeled resin was cleaved and deprotected by mixing with TFA:water:thioanisole:phenol:3,6-dioxa-1,8-octanedithiol:triisopropylsilane, 80:5:5:5:2.5:2.5 for 3 hours at ambient temperature. Following evaporation under reduced pressure, the crude peptide was recovered by precipitation with ether. The product was purified on a preparative HPLC running Unipoint\u00ae analysis software (Gilson, Inc., Middleton, Wis.) on a 25 mm\u00d7200 mm radial compression column containing Delta-Pak\u00ae Cpacking (Waters, Inc., Taunton, Mass.) with a flow rate of 20 mL\/min. The peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1% TFA\/water and acetonitrile. Fractions containing the product were combined and lyophilized. The purity of the final products were confirmed by reverse-phase analytical HPLC on a Hewlett-Packard 1050 series system with diode-array and fluorescence detection (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.) eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid\/water and acetonitrile on a 4.6\u00d7250 mm YMC ODS-AQ, 5 \u03bcm, 120 \u212b column (Waters Inc.) to give the product (45.6 mg) as a yellow powder following lyophilization. The identity of the product was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrography (MALDI-MS) on a Voyager DE-PRO (Applied Biosystems), m\/z 1470.00 and 1448.01 (M+H).","A fluorescence polarization assay was used for ICdetermination of representative compounds having Formula I against recombinant Mcl-1 protein. Compounds were series diluted in DMSO starting at 10 \u03bcM and transferred (5 \u03bcL) into a 96 well plate. Then, 120 \u03bcL of a mixture containing 10 nM fluorescent Noxa BH3 peptide and 80 nM Mcl-1 protein was added to each well. For each assay, free peptide controls (fluorescent peptide only) and bound peptide controls (fluorescent peptide in the presence of Mcl-1) were included on each assay plate. The plate was mixed on a shaker for 1 minute and incubated at room temperature for an additional 15 minutes. The polarization (in mP) was measured at room temperature with excitation wavelength at 485 nm and emission wavelength at 530 nm using an Analyst (LJL, Molecular Dynamic, Sunnyvale, Calif.). The percentage inhibition was calculated by % inhibition=100\u00d7(1\u2212(mP\u2212mP)\/(mP\u2212mP)) in which mPis the free peptide control and mPis the bound peptide control. Based on percentage of inhibition, the IC(inhibitor concentration at which 50% of bound peptide is displaced), obtained by fitting the inhibition data using Prism 3.0 software (Graphpad Software Inc, San Diego, Calif.).
