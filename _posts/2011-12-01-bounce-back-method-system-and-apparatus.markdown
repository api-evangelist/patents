title: Bounce back method, system and apparatus
abstract: A customer whose conditional purchase offer (CPO) has been accepted may receive a bounce back offer from a vendor (supplier-partner) of other services or products. The bounce back process determines whether a supplier-partner can participate in a bounce back transaction. If a bounce back transaction is effectuated between the customer and supplier-partner, the partner notifies the principal of the transaction. In the case of automobile rentals, the bounce back process permits a traveler to recognize reduced automobile rental rates while enabling a rental agency to more effectively manage its excess capacity. The CPO management system employing bounce back capability can be utilized to acquire any underlying product and/or service and bounce back product and/or service.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a Continuation of and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7120 to prior U.S. Non-Provisional patent application Ser. No. 12\/912,627 filed Oct. 26, 2010 entitled, \u201cBOUNCE BACK METHOD, SYSTEM AND APPARATUS,\u201d which in turn is a Divisional of and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7120 to prior U.S. Non-Provisional patent application Ser. No. 09\/716,114, filed Nov. 14, 2000 entitled, \u201cMETHOD, SYSTEM AND APPARATUS TO FACILITATE CONDITIONAL PURCHASE ORDERS WITH BOUNCE BACK FUNCTIONALITY,\u201d which in turn claims priority from provisional U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/165,446 entitled, \u201cCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OFFER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\u201d filed Nov. 15, 1999 The entirety of the aforementioned applications are herein expressly incorporated by reference.","This invention relates generally to a method, system and apparatus for arranging for the acquisition of goods and services, such as automobile rentals and, more particularly, to a bounce back method, system and apparatus for managing the acquisition of such goods and services in an arrangement where customers have already contracted for the purchase of other items, such as airline tickets or hotel reservations.","There is a large source of latent demand for goods and services associated with leisure and business travelers who purchase plane tickets and\/or make hotel reservations. For example, when a reservation at a hotel is made, often the customer is from out of town and requires a mode of transportation that is not dependent on the traveler's own vehicle. Even more frequently, a person who books an airline reservation is travelling out of town and similarly requires a means of transportation independent of the traveler's personal vehicle. Automobile rental agencies recognize that many of these travelers have various options in selecting a mode of transportation, such as public transportation, hotel or airport shuttles, automobile rentals, and the like. Automobile rental agencies further recognize that although renting a vehicle often provides greater transportation flexibility to a traveler, cost considerations may result in the selection of another mode of transportation. If a traveler is aware of a competitive (or discounted) automobile rental offering, however, the traveler may be more apt to select such mode of transportation upon arriving at the destination in which the hotel and\/or airport is located.","There is currently no effective way, however, for any retail agency or service, such as an automobile rental agency with excess capacity to be connected to a person who has made a hotel and\/or airline reservation. In particular, there is no effective way for a retail agency or service with excess capacity in a specific location to communicate a competitive or discounted rate to a traveler that has entered into a binding contract to fly to or spend at least an evening in a hotel in a destination that is in the agency's excess capacity location.","It is apparent from the above deficiencies with conventional systems for selling goods and services, such as those related to travelers (e.g., airline passengers and hotel guests), that a need exists for a method, system and apparatus to connect travelers to retail agencies or services, such as automobile rental agencies, having excess capacity in an arrival destination, to facilitate the acquisition of such goods or services.","A bounce back method, system and apparatus is used in a conditional purchase offer (CPO) management system for receiving conditional purchase offers from one or more customers, such as airline passengers, and evaluating the received CPOs against a number of CPO rules defined by a plurality of sellers, such as airlines, to determine whether any seller is willing to accept a given CPO. While the specific embodiments of the invention discussed herein relate to travel services, the bounce back method, system and apparatus has potential applications in other related areas of commerce.","A customer whose CPO has been accepted may receive a bounce back offer from a vendor (supplier-partner) of a second product or service\u2014e.g., an automobile rental company. The bounce back process determines whether a supplier-partner is located in the customer's destination area. If a supplier-partner is located in the customer's destination area and has excess capacity, a bounce back offer may be made to the customer in accordance with a supplier allocation process. If the bounce back offer is accepted, a partner fulfillment process is effectuated. The bounce back process can be utilized to acquire any product or service offered in connection with an accepted CPO for an underlying product or service. In the case of vehicle rentals, the bounce back process permits a traveler to recognize reduced automobile rental rates while enabling a rental agency to more effectively manage excess capacity.","In one embodiment, a customer accesses a CPO management system web site and submits a CPO for a first product or service, such as an airline ticket or hotel reservation. The customer receives a communication, such as in the form of an e-mail, that the CPO has been accepted and a bounce back offer for a second product or service, such as an automobile rental, has been extended. The customer is then directed to a bounce back transaction for the acquisition of an automobile rental.","The customer can access the bounce back offer in a variety of ways. In one embodiment, a CPO server generates an e-mail to the customer advising the customer of the CPO acceptance and bounce back offer. The e-mail contains a hyperlink to a bounce back web page containing further information regarding the bounce back offer. The bounce back web page is generated by the CPO server specific to the supplier-partner allocated to participate in the bounce back offer. The bounce back web page may, in turn, contain a hyperlink to a cobranded web site. The customer's identification generated in the prior CPO transaction and information about the customer's itinerary can be transmitted securely via a hyperlink to the cobranded site. For convenience, the bounce back method, system and apparatus will be discussed in detail in connection with a cobranded site but can be conducted on a single site.","In another embodiment, the bounce back offer is received via a jump page containing a hyperlink to the cobranded web site. The customer can also defer the bounce back offer until a subsequent time or choose not to access the bounce back offer in which case the offer is terminated. Any form of communication can be used to implement the bounce back offer and transaction including on-line access, telephone, facsimile, e-mail, voice-mail, in person or through a travel agent. For example, a customer can telephone a CPO management system operator to check the status of a CPO and receive an interactive voice mail advising of the bounce back offer and directions to a bounce back web page.","In the cobranded web site, a customer can choose to accept or reject a bounce back product or service or optionally submit a counteroffer for the product or service to a supplier-partner allocated to participate in the bounce back offer. To the extent a bounce back offer is accepted a supplier-partner through the fulfillment process notifies a principal, such as a CPO operator, of the completed transaction. In one embodiment, the supplier-partner receives an identifier for the accepted CPO and notifies a principal of the accepted bounce back transaction using the identifier so that the principal can monitor bounce back transaction commitments.","In the supplier allocation process, the CPO management system identifies at least one supplier-partner that can participate in a bounce back transaction for a product or service. For example, in the case of automobile rentals, the CPO management system identifies at least one automobile rental company that has excess capacity in a flight or hotel destination which is the subject of a CPO. If more than one supplier-partner can participate in a bounce back transaction, the CPO management system determines an order that each supplier-partner can participate in the transaction, e.g., receive a bounce back look.","The partner-supplier order can be determined based on market share data or data tracking tables. In one embodiment, the order is determined using the following formula for the first 3-6 months that the bounce back process is in use: Base City Share+(Premium*Unused Share). In another embodiment, the order is determined using the following formula after the first 3-6 months: Base City Share+(Premium*Unused Share)+Performance Factor. Where two or more supplier-partners receive the same score, a random number generator can be used to allocate a bounce back look. The random number generator could be weighted to reflect the relative market share of each supplier-partner. In the event no supplier-partner can participate in a bounce back transaction, the CPO management system sends a customer a standard success acceptance of a CPO.","It will be understood that the foregoing brief description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory of this invention, but are not intended to be restrictive thereof or limiting of the advantages which can be achieved by this invention. Thus, the accompanying drawings, referred to herein and constituting a part hereof, illustrate embodiments of this invention and, together with the detailed description, serve to explain the principles of this invention.","A. CPO Management System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","130","100","110"]},"As used herein, a CPO is a binding offer containing one or more conditions submitted by a customer  for the purchase of an item, such as air travel, at a customer-defined price. In the illustrative airline embodiment, the customer-defined conditions would include itinerary parameters, such as the origin and destination cities; acceptable dates and times of departure and return; and whether connecting flights or stopovers are acceptable to the customer. In addition, the parameters of a CPO may allow a customer to specify one or more preferred airline(s), flights, seat assignments, seat class, aircraft type, refund\/change rules, or maximum layover time.","A CPO rule is a set of restrictions defined by a given seller, such as an airline, to define a combination of such restrictions for which the seller is willing to accept a predefined minimum price. The CPO rules are utilized by the CPO management system to render a decision to either accept, reject or counter a CPO on behalf of a particular seller. In one embodiment, the CPO rules are generated by the revenue management system (RMS) ,  of the respective airline. In alternate embodiments, the CPO rules may be generated by a yield management system, a profit management system, or any system which controls and manages inventory.","The RMS ,  employs a CPO rules generation process to generate CPO rules by evaluating current inventory, pricing and revenue information, as well as historical patterns and external events, to forecast future travel. Thereafter, the CPO rules are utilized by the CPO management system  to render a decision to either accept, reject or counter a CPO on behalf of a particular airline. The CPO rules are dynamic in nature and may be updated by a given airline, as necessary.","As shown in , the CPO management system  comprises a CPO management central server  and one or more secured airline servers , . Each secured airline server may be associated with one or more airlines and each server stores, among other things, the CPO rules defined by any associated airlines, such as airline . Each secured airline server ,  may be remotely located from the CPO management central server , as shown in , or may be integrated with the CPO management central server .","Each customer  contacts the CPO management system , for example, by means of telephone, facsimile, online access, e-mail, voice mail, in-person contact or through a travel agent, and provides the CPO management system  with the terms of their CPO. It is noted that each customer  may employ a general-purpose computer for communicating with the CPO management system . The general-purpose computer of each customer  is comprised of a processing unit, a modem, memory means and any software required to communicate with the CPO management system .","In one embodiment, CPO management central server  is configured as a web server, and conventional communications software such as the Netscape Navigator web browser may be used to transmit a CPO. In one embodiment, the CPO management central server  has a web page on the world wide web, allowing the buyer to provide information through the interface of the conventional web browser software. In one embodiment, the buyer selects the subject of the goods he wishes to purchase by selecting from a list of possible subjects. Subjects might include airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars, insurance, mortgages, clothing, etc. After the subject is selected, a form is displayed on a video monitor of a buyer interface. This form is an electronic contract with a number of blanks to be filled out by the buyer, with each blank representing a condition of a CPO.","Once the terms of the CPO have been received by the CPO management system , the CPO management central server  will execute a CPO management process to compare the received CPO against the CPO rules of each airline. A result of this comparison, the CPO is either accepted, rejected or countered. Thereafter, the customer  is notified of the response of the airlines to the CPO. If an airline accepts the CPO, or if the customer  accepts a counteroffer from an airline, a ticket is then booked by the CPO management system  with the appropriate restrictions which meet the conditions defined by the customer .","In one embodiment, the CPO management system  may optionally access a central reservation system (CRS) , such as a SABRE or WORLDSPAN, to perform itinerary queries that will identify particular flights which satisfy a given itinerary, and to make reservations. In addition, the CPO management system  could alternatively access the proprietary airline reservation systems (ARSs) ,  of each airline to perform such itinerary queries and to make reservations with the respective airline. The ARSs ,  maintained by each airline ,  are each essentially a subset of the central CRS . Thus, in view of the overlapping functions and capabilities of the CRS  and the proprietary reservation systems ,  of each airline, the CPO management system  could access any of such systems to obtain required information, and the terms \u201cCRS\u201d and \u201cARS\u201d are used interchangeably herein.","As shown in , each airline , , also has an RMS , . The RMSs ,  generate CPO rules and otherwise allocate and price airline tickets for sale to CPO customers. Generally, the RMSs ,  are utilized to optimize revenue per flight. An RMS performs seat inventory control by periodically adjusting nested booking limits (\u201cbuckets\u201d) for the various fare classes, in order to optimize the passenger mix and thereby maximize the generated revenue.","The CPO management system , customer , airlines ,  and CRS  (collectively, the \u201cnodes\u201d) transmit digitally encoded data and other information between one another. The communication links between the nodes comprise a cable, fiber or wireless link on which electronic signals can propagate. For example, each node may be connected via an Internet connection using a public switched telephone network (PSTN), such as those provided by a local or regional telephone operating company. Alternatively, each node may be connected by dedicated data lines, cellular, Personal Communication Systems (\u201cPCS\u201d), microwave, or satellite networks.","Although the CPO management system  is illustrated herein as a system for selling airline tickets, the CPO management system  could be utilized to sell any underlying good or service, such as automobiles, insurance, computer equipment or hotel accommodations. For a more detailed discussion of a general CPO management system for selling such items, as well as an associated revenue management system (RMS) and central reservation system (CRS), see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/889,319, entitled \u201cConditional Purchase Offer Management System,\u201d which was filed as a continuation in part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/707,660, filed on Sep. 4, 1996, incorporated by reference herein.","CPO Management System Including Bounce Back Capability","As shown in , the CPO management system  includes bounce back capability. In addition to communicating with a customer , CRS  and ARSs ,  of airlines , , the CPO management system is in communication with one or more supplier-partners ,  and principal-partner cobranded site . This system enables a bounce back opportunity (such as automobile rental bounce back) to be presented to a customer  as described more fully below with reference to , and -.","The available supplier-partners ,  are, in one embodiment, automobile rental agencies that are located in a customer's travel destination area and have agreed to participate in the bounce back program. The principal-partner cobranded site  provides an interface to which a bounce back customer is directed, such as a bounce back page. The bounce back page is the graphical user interface that indicates the availability of a bounce back automobile rental opportunity. The page also prompts a bounce back candidate for information to effectuate the bounce back rental. The cobranded site  combines information of the supplier-partner ,  that is allocated for a specific bounce back opportunity and the principal (the operator of the CPO management system, or the party selling the underlying product or service, such as an airline or hotel, or an agent that effectuated the CPO acceptance on behalf of the airline or hotel). It should be understood that the cobranded site  may be designed so that the automobile rental offer is a customer benefit provided as a result of the customer using the services of the underlying airline or hotel. Accordingly, in such an embodiment, the airline or hotel is listed as the principal of the bounce back benefit provided by the allocated rental agency. Alternatively, the page may be designed to inform the customer  that the principal of the bounce back opportunity that is supplied by the supplier-partner ,  is the CPO management system operator or an agent that effectuated the CPO acceptance of the underlying product or service, such as an airline ticket or hotel reservation.","The supplier-partners ,  and CPO central server  are in communication with one another to effectuate the partner allocation process and the partner fulfillment process. The partner allocation process identifies which supplier-partners ,  offer service from the airport or hotel location identified in the customer CPO, and determines the order of the supplier-partners (if more than one) that may view or make the offer. The partner fulfillment process is where the supplier-partner ,  informs the principal-partner of a successful bounce back rental and the associated data (including referral and commission information) is transferred to the principal and executed. Both of these processes are described more fully below with reference to , respectively.","Although the bounce back system is illustrated herein as handling automobile rentals as the bounce back service or product, the bounce back system could be utilized to sell any good or service, such as airplane tickets, hotel accommodations, insurance or computer equipment.","C. CPO Management Central Server Including Data Storage Device and Communication Port to Support Bounce Back Capability",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["160","250","260","160","270","280","290","300","310","260","270"]},"The ROM  and\/or airline data storage device  are operable to store one or more instructions which the CPU  is operable to retrieve, interpret and execute. For example, the ROM  and\/or airline data storage device  may store processes to accomplish the transfer of required payments, charges and debits, between the airlines ,  and customers . In particular, the CPO management process  may transmit the credit card information associated with a given customer  to the credit card issuer for payment, if a ticket is actually issued to the customer .","The CPU  comprises a control unit, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and a CPU local memory storage device, such as, for example, a stackable cache or a plurality of registers. The control unit is operable to retrieve instructions from the airline data storage device  or ROM . The ALU is operable to perform a plurality of operations needed to carry out instructions. The CPU local memory storage device is operable to provide high-speed storage used for storing temporary results and control information.","The airline data storage device  further includes a customer database , an airline database , a flight schedule database , and a CPO database . The customer database  may store information on each customer of the CPO management system , including biographical information and billing information, such as a credit card number. The airline database  may store information on each airline which is registered with the CPO management system  to sell airline tickets to CPO customers, including address and contact information. The flight schedule database  may store specific flight information for each O & D Pair. Finally, the CPO database  may contain a record of each CPO being processed by the CPO management system , including the terms of the CPO and the associated status.","In addition, the airline data storage device  includes a CPO management process which receives each CPO from a customer , compares the CPO against the CPO rules of each airline , , and determines whether to accept, reject or counter the CPO on behalf of an airline.","The communications port  connects the CPO management central server  to the central reservation system (CRS)  and the proprietary reservation systems (ARSs) ,  maintained by each airline , . The communications port  connects the CPO management central server  to individual customers and travel agents, such as the customer , for example, by means of an Internet connection using the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The communications port  connects the CPO management central server  to any remote secured airline servers. The communications port  may include multiple communication channels for simultaneously establishing a plurality of connections. The CPO management central server  could alternatively be implemented with multiple communication ports or with a single connection to an ethernet network, which in turn provides the central server  with a connection to the various nodes.","As shown in , CPO management central server  includes additional storage and communication capability which support bounce back capability. As discussed further below in conjunction with , and -, bounce back data storage device  includes a customer information database , partner statistics database , coverage table database , market share database , tracking database , bounce back table database , vendor capability table database  and partner information database . Moreover, bounce back data storage device  includes a bounce back management process  for ensuring that the appropriate databases are accessed as required.","Communications port  connects the CPO management central server  to the CRS , ARSs ,  maintained by each airline , , as well as to supplier-partners ,  and principal partner . It should be noted that although  shows communications with each supplier partner ,  in another embodiment one entity may handle the bounce back process communications for all of the potential bounce back supplier-partners. The communications port may contain multiple communications channels for simultaneously establishing a plurality of connections. Moreover, communications may be effectuated in various ways, including by means of an internet connection using the public switched telephone network (PSTN).","D. Operation of the Bounce Back Method, System and Apparatus","Once a CPO is accepted by or on behalf of an airline (or for any type of service or product), the availability to sell a second service or product exists. The supplier or seller of the second service or product may be connected in some manner to purchasers of the underlying service or product. For example, customers who make reservations for a flight or for a hotel room often have transportation needs when reaching their destination. Automobile rental agencies, particularly those agencies whose fleet capacity exceeds demand, may benefit by stimulating such travelers to rent their vehicles through a \u201cbounce back\u201d process. A bounce back process is the method of connecting customers , whose CPO for airline or hotel services has been accepted, to vendors of other services or products, such as supplier-partners , . Although the present embodiment describes giving travelers whose CPO has been accepted the opportunity to rent a car from a group of automobile rental companies , , it should be understood that the products or services need not be associated to the travel industry. Accordingly, the bounce back program may be applied to any products and\/or services.","The operation of a bounce back program will now be described with reference to , and - and further references to . Turning to and , as an initial step, a customer  (e.g., traveler) accesses the CPO management system  and places an offer (step ). As described above, the CPO may be accepted or rejected. Such a determination is made in step . If the CPO is not accepted and the customer does not resubmit an offer or CPO (step ), the CPO management process transmits the rejection of the CPO to the customer  and the process is terminated (step ). If, however, the customer resubmits a CPO or a counteroffer is made, step , which determines whether such CPO is accepted, is repeated. If a CPO is accepted, a bounce back offer is generated (step ) (as described more fully below with reference to ).","A bounce back offer is an offer presented to all successful air or hotel customers  whereby the customer  is given the opportunity to, in this case, rent a vehicle from a supplier partner(s) such as an automobile rental company , . In the present embodiment, it is required that a CPO is accepted by or on behalf of an airline and\/or hotel (e.g., that the customer  is bound) and, as described below, that the destination airport or hotel city is covered by one of the supplier-partners ,  (the supplier-partner is an automobile rental company, located in a customer's travel destination area, that has agreed to participate in the bounce back program). Once these two requirements (a CPO is accepted and a destination has coverage by supplier-partner , ) are met, the customer  is designated a bounce back candidate.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["2000","220","230","390","2010","110"]},"If the hotel or airport destination area is serviced by a supplier-partner, the offer is allocated to a participating supplier (step ) (supplier allocation is described more fully below with reference to ). In step , the customer is flagged as a bounce back recipient, and, in step  the supplier record is populated. By flagging the customer  as a bounce back, the customer  receives a preferred automobile rental opportunity usually in the form of a reduced rate. In alternative embodiments, the bounce back candidate may be offered other benefits such as a free vehicle upgrade, additional rental days at no extra charge, etc. Such benefits may vary among suppliers and may depend on the supplier's current excess fleet capacity. An e-mail with a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) linked to the automobile rental supplier-partner ,  or supplier-partner cobranded web-site  is generated and sent to the customer  (step ). Cobranded site  is the interface between the principal\/supplier and the customer  which executes a dialog to effectuate a bounce back rental.","The confirmation e-mail sent to the customer  is modified to include notification that an automobile rental opportunity is pending. In addition to the automobile rental opportunity notification, the e-mail may include the traditional confirmation data including the flight itinerary and\/or hotel information. The e-mail may also include a message that the automobile rental offer is a promotional deal sponsored by the airline and\/or hotel that has accepted the offer. An exemplary e-mail template including an automobile rental opportunity notification, click-through link to a cobranded site and flight itinerary is shown in .","In one embodiment, customers may also receive the bounce back offer via the check status page off of the principal's homepage. For customers who choose this path, the initial details of the offer that were contained in the e-mail will be presented in a jump page hosted by the principal. The jump page contains the hyperlink to the cobranded site . An exemplary jump page including an automobile rental opportunity notification, click-through link to a cobranded site and flight itinerary is shown in .","In another embodiment, the URL available for the automobile rental opportunity may be re-accessed at various points subsequent to the acceptance of a CPO but prior to a customer's travel. The URL may be bookmarked and, in one embodiment, may only be accessible for a limited time (e.g., predetermined number of hours or days). The bounce back page may have an option or a get back in touch with me checkbox that allows a customer who chooses to defer an offer of an automobile rental opportunity until a subsequent time (e.g., three to seven days prior to the customer's travel date).","With reference to , a determination is made as to whether the customer  clicked on the e-mail linked to the automobile rental opportunity or principal partner cobranded site  (step ). If the customer does not click on the e-mail link, the bounce back process is terminated in step . If, however, the link is accessed, a bounce back page is constructed (step ) indicating that the customer is potentially interested in an automobile rental opportunity (construction of the bounce back page is described more fully below with reference to ). It should be noted that although communication between the customer , the cobranded site  and the CPO management central server  in the present embodiment is effectuated using e-mail, other forms of communication, including telephone, facsimile, online access, chat, in person contact and the like, may be used.","Once the bounce back page is constructed, a determination as to whether the customer  has accessed the page is made in step . If the customer  chooses not to access such page, the customer  is asked in step  whether an e-mail alert is desired before the customer's trip. The customer's response is stored in Customer Information Database  (step ) and an alert is provided to the customer at a later date, if requested. The alert serves to remind the customer  of the availability of an automobile rental opportunity and instructs the user to access the corresponding cobranded page by clicking on the URL enclosed in the alert. If no alert is requested, the bounce back process is terminated in step .","If, in step , the customer clicks on the link or a subsequent e-mail alert is selected, the customer enters principal\/partner cobranded site  (step ). In the present embodiment, the principal is the company that effectuated the CPO acceptance of underlying product or service (e.g., airline or hotel) and\/or operator of the CPO management central server  of the CPO management system . The partner is the automobile rental agent . It should be understood that the cobranded site  may be designed so that the automobile rental offer appears as a benefit provided as a result of the customer using the services of the underlying airline or hotel. Alternatively, the page may be designed to inform the customer  that the automobile rental opportunity that is supplied by the automobile rental agency  is sponsored by the principal (e.g., CPO management system operator). The supplier-partner's  product\/service availability is updated from the information that was stored in Partner Statistics Database .","In step , the customer  may make an offer for a vehicle rental. In an alternative embodiment, the customer may view an automobile rental offer and either accept, reject or make a counter-offer to the automobile rental agency. If the customer  does not make and\/or accept a rental offer, the customer  is redirected back to the principal's site in step . If, however, the customer makes and\/or accepts an offer for a vehicle rental, the partner fulfillment process (described more fully below with reference to ), which is the process whereby the supplier-partner informs the principal of a successful bounce back rental and the associated data (including referral and commission information) is transferred to the principal, is executed in step . Upon completion of the partner fulfillment process, the customer  is redirected to the principal's site in step .","Referring to the flowchart in , the supplier allocation process is described. The allocation process comprises\u2014(1) identifying which supplier-partners ,  offer service from the airport or hotel location in the customer offer; and (2) determining the order of the suppliers (if more than one) that may view or make the offer. It should be understood that any of the allocation techniques of provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60\/179,008 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ALLOCATING A CONDITIONAL PURCHASE OFFER FOR A HOTEL RESERVATION TO ONE OF A PLURALITY OF HOTEL ENTITIES IN A BUYER DRIVEN ELECTRONIC COMMERCE SYSTEM filed Jan. 28, 2000 and of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/252,574 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ALLOCATING BUSINESS TO ONE OF A PLURALITY OF SELLERS IN A BUYER DRIVEN ELECTRONIC COMMERCE SYSTEM filed Feb. 18, 1999 are incorporated herein by reference.","In step , the airport or hotel destination is determined. A Coverage Table Database  which stores all available partner suppliers ,  based on a customer's destination is accessed (step ). A determination as to whether the destination location is covered is made in step . If no such coverage exists for the customer's destination area, the process returns the customer to standard processing and the bounce back process-is-terminated (step ). If, however, coverage does exist, a determination as to the number of supplier-partners is made in step . If only one partner exists in the customer's destination area, then the bounce back look is allocated to that partner in step .","When multiple supplier-partners are available to handle a customer bounce back, an analysis is undertaken to determine which partner will receive the bounce back look or opportunity. Any criteria or formula can be selected for this analysis, including but not limited to performance related criteria and\/or market share criteria. In one embodiment, market share tables and data tracking tables (step ) are accessed from the Market Share Database  (step ) and Tracking Database  (step ), respectively. This data allows the principal to determine which supplier-partner will receive the bounce back look or opportunity. In another embodiment, one of two formulas may be used in selecting among multiple supplier-partners. One formula that can be used for the first 3-6 months that the bounce back process is in use is: Base City Share+(Partner Premium*(Unused Share), where the unused share may comprise the non-supplier-partner share of the relevant market. For example, in the case of two supplier-partners, if one supplier-partner has a 5% share of the market and the second supplier-partner has a 25%, the unused share comprises 70% of the market. Another formula that may be used after the process has some history (e.g., after the first 3-6 months) is: Base City Share+(Partner Premium*Unused Share)+Partner Performance Factor. The Base City Share variable is the supplier-partner's relative market share for the customer's destination city. The data may be updated monthly, annually or at some other frequency. The Partner Premium is a factor which provides a bias to partner(s) based on a negotiated\/contracted commitment with the principal (e.g., in return for a monetary investment). Partner Performance compares the relative bind rate (success in offering rental opportunity and\/or gaining customer commitment of such rental opportunity) across supplier-partners and provides preference to the partners who are aggressively participating in the bounce back program. Such preference is provided by multiplying the Unused Share variable with a more competitive (higher) Partner Premium variable. The Partner Performance factor, which may be incorporated into the evaluation once the program has been effect for some amount of time, is a variable that may be included in the formula taking into consideration a favorable experience of the automobile rental bounce back program with respect to each supplier-partner.","With the above formulas and stored data, the partner who will receive the bounce back look is determined in step . The automobile rental agency with the highest score is the allocated supplier-partner. If more than one supplier-partner receives the same score, one may be selected at random. The random number generator can be configured to reflect each supplier-partner's relative market share. It should be noted that in another embodiment, the supplier-partner may be selected by a random number generator in all cases obviating the logic associated with formulas described above. The supplier-partner is selected in step  as well as storing the selection in a database and updating the tracking data in Tracking Database . Upon selecting the partner and updating the associated databases, the process returns to the bounce back offer generation process (step ) described with reference to .","Once the offer is allocated to a supplier-partner and the bounce back offer is generated, a bounce back page is created as shown in step  of . Bounce back page construction is described in more detail with reference to . The bounce back page is a cobranded (principal and partner) site . The bounce back page may contain certain dynamic data elements that are populated on an offer specific basis. Such data elements include, but are not limited to, itinerary information including flight and\/or hotel information, click through link to supplier-partner cobranded web-site and vendor\/supplier logo and\/or special text to be accessed to make a cobranded page. A checkbox item may also be provided that allows a customer to be reminded of an outstanding automobile rental opportunity before the travel date. In one embodiment, the reminder must be the same offer that is sent by e-mail to the customer .","In step , the CPO management central server  determines whether a bounce back record exists, e.g., an airplane ticket request number or hotel request number. Any successful or bound offer is assigned a bounce back record number. A bounce back record number is located by accessing (step ) the data stored in the Bounce Back Table Database . If a bounce back number does not exist, the process is terminated in step . If, however, a bounce back number exists, the offer is valid and bounce back processing continues (step ).","Selecting a vendor (supplier-partner) (step ), involves determining the vendor's technical capabilities by accessing (step ) data in the Vendor Capability Table Database . In one embodiment, the minimal requirements for a vendor to participate is the ability to serve the principal's customer in the destination location or to provide negotiated rates to the principal's customers.","In step , a determination is made as to whether the principal is capable of populating the requisite vendor data fields of a bounce back page. If the principal is capable of populating the page, the bounce back record is mapped to the vendor's fields (step ) and the bounce back page is built in step . When building the bounce back page, the Partner Information Database  may be accessed (step ) to retrieve data such as the vendor's logo.","If the principal is unable to populate the data fields, a determination is made in step  as to whether the principal can construct a specific URL for access to the vendor. If a vendor specific URL can be devised, such URL is constructed in step  and the bounce back page is built in step . In this embodiment, the vendor supplies information for the data fields. In another embodiment where the principal cannot construct a vendor specific URL, some other means to identify the principal may be selected to construct the bounce back page, such as where the customer inputs information to identify the principal, including the bounce back record (step ). Once the bounce back page is constructed, a vehicle has been created for a customer  to access the cobranded site  and make an offer for automobile rental services.","Termination pages are accessed at different points (usually points of failure) of the bounce back process. In order for the principal and supplier-partners  to learn what a customer  did not like about the offer and to generate a demand collection system (a statistical analysis to improve successful rental opportunities), termination points may be monitored and the associated data collected. The termination pages will give a customer the opportunity to do the following: (1) identify the price that the customer would be willing to pay for the rental car offered; (2) provides feedback about what features of an automobile rental product that the customer would like to see; (3) provide feedback about what the customer did and did not like about the offer; (4) have an \u201ce-mail me later\u201d checkbox functionality; and link to the principal's homepage. It should be further noted that where a bounce back offer is successfully accepted, an opportunity to gather customer feedback may still be available. Moreover, the aforementioned feedback features are only a few examples of types of data that may be collected. Accordingly, additional information may be sought and analyzed.","Turning to , the partner fulfillment process is described. Once a vehicle rental commitment between the customer  and the supplier-partner  has been established, the supplier-partner  informs the principal of the transaction. In step , the customer  is identified by the supplier-partner . This may be accomplished by transmitting a unique identification code for each customer in the URL. In step , the principal's referral identification code is appended to the customer offer in the vehicle rental system. The commitments are pooled and the referral identification codes are counted in step . Then, in step , the fees are calculated and reconciled with the principal. The fees may be calculated as a flat fee or as a percentage of the total sale. The fees may vary among supplier-partners. The frequency of such reconciliation may also vary among the supplier-partners ,  (e.g., daily, weekly, etc.). Upon completion of the supplier-partner fulfillment process, the bounce back process is complete.","Turning to , the interactive voice response (IVR) bounce back feature is described. As described above, the bounce back process may be effectuated by any suitable communications means, including e-mail, voice mail, online, facsimile, telephone, in-person contact or through a travel agent. There will be times that a customer  may interact with the principal on the telephone, for example to check the status of the customer's CPO. The IVR bounce back feature allows the principal to inform a customer  of a bounce back opportunity and to direct the customer  to a bounce back offer page in order to effectuate access to the system. In step , the customer  submits an air or hotel CPO. Subsequently, in step , a customer calls the IVR system (instead of, for example, using internet or world wide web access) to check the status of the CPO. In step , a determination is made as to whether the CPO is accepted. If the CPO is not accepted and no additional CPO is generated (step ), the IVR bounce back process is terminated (step ). If, however, the original CPO, or a subsequent CPO, is accepted, a bounce back offer is generated in step  (bounce back offer generation is described above in detail with reference to ). The customer is also directed, in step , to the bounce back offer page which may be accessed, in one embodiment, by a customer interface device in communication with the CPO management system  described above. In one embodiment, the IVR system directs the customer  to the bounce back page by accessing an IVR script that is automatically generated when a CPO is confirmed by telephone and a bounce back opportunity associated with that customer  exists. Once the customer  is directed to the bounce back page that has been generated, the customer  may continue with the bounce back progress if so desired as directed beginning at step  of (and described above in detail with reference to ).","The IVR bounce back system may also provide assistance to a bounce back rental customer. If a customer requires assistance with his or her vehicle rental and information is entered identifying the customer as a bounce back customer, the IVR system has the capability of transferring the customer to the rental agency. In another embodiment, the IVR system provides a customer who needs additional vehicle rental assistance with the correct name and number(s) to access the automobile rental agency. Alternatively, if the customer reaches a principal customer service representative, the customer service agent will know which supplier-partner is associated with the bounce back customer and will have the necessary information to direct the customer to the appropriate vendor. Accordingly, a Vendor Information Table Database may be devised which may include, but is not limited to, the following information: (1) name and business address of the vendor; (2) telephone number of the vendor (ideally toll-free number); and (3) website address of the vendor.","Although illustrative embodiments have been described herein in detail, it should be noted and understood that numerous variations may be made within the scope of this invention without departing from the principle of this invention and without sacrificing its chief advantages. The terms and expressions have been used as terms of description and not terms of limitation. There is no limitation to use the terms or expressions to exclude any equivalents of features shown and described or portions thereof and this invention should be defined with the claims which follow.","For example, the CPO management system can render a decision to accept an offer for a hotel reservation and generate a bounce back offer for airline tickets. Moreover, as previously indicated, although the CPO management system  employing bounce back capability has been illustrated in an airline\/automobile rental environment, the CPO management system  employing bounce back capability could be utilized to acquire any underlying product and\/or service and bounce back product and\/or service."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIGS. 3","i":["a ","b"],"b":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 3"],"i":["a ","b; "],"b":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A-C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A-B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 3"],"i":["a ","b; "],"b":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIGS. 3"],"i":["a ","b; "],"b":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIGS. 3"],"i":["a ","b"],"b":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIGS. 3"],"i":["a ","b.
