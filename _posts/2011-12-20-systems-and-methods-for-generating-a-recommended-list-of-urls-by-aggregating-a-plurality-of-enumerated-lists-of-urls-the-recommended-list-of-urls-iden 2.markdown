In particular, the present application is directed to a method for providing a recommended list of uniform resource locators (URLs) responsive to a uniform resource locator (URL).","With the proliferation of mobile devices and mobile applications connected to the Internet and with the growth of social networking and content on the Internet in general, more and more people are sharing content with other people on a regular basis. To share content that people may like or that they think others may like, people may forward links to the content to other people via email, tweeting, texting or posting to a web-site or social networking site. Likewise, those people may in turn forward the forwarded content to other people, and so on. As a result of one person sharing content, a multitude of users may interact with the same content. This sharing and forwarding may occur with a plurality of different content from different sources. It is challenging to identify, track and analyze the forwarding and sharing of such content via the multitude of users, devices and sources of content.","The present solution provides multiple techniques for identifying, tracking and analyzing user's interactions with content that may be shared across the Internet. Embodiments of the present solution identifies and tracks user's interactions with content, such as via clicking on shortened URLs or links that may be shared among users. One technique of the present solution provides a relevance score of a digital resource based on user's interactions with digital resources. Another technique of the present solution provides relevance search results based on user interaction with content. Another technique of the present solution identifies phrases that are trending or are temporally popular based on aggregating multiple users' interactions with an aggregate of content. Yet another technique of the present solution identifies trending phrases that are relevant to a unique user. One technique of the present solution provides for tracking influence of a user, based on engagement or clicks driven by that user on content shared by that user, such as via shortened links. Another technique of the present solution provides a recommended set of URLs given an input URL based on user interactions with a list of related URLs.","In one aspect, the present application is directed to a method for relevance scoring of a digital resource keyword based on user actions associated with a plurality of digital resources. The method scores content, URLs, domains, phrases or any entity (all of which are examples of digital resources) based on an expected relevance to an individual user which may be based on that user's previous engagement with digital resources. The method may include receiving, by a server, identification of a first plurality of actions of a user.

The search results may rank available content based on popularity of the content, which may be determined by user visits and\/or referring websites. These results may be determined based on actual interactions between people and content. Such methods, when incorporated into searches, may yield significant improvements over those using typical link crawling and ranking based on links that reside on a page.","Referring to , one embodiment of a system for providing search results based on user interaction with content is depicted. In brief overview, the system includes a linking system  that incorporates a relevance system  for facilitating a search request. The relevance system  may receive a click stream \u2032, as well as keywords or search terms  from a search request. In some embodiments, the relevance system  includes one or more of the following modules: distribution scorer , engagement scorer , frequency normalizer , source weighting module , user weighting module , time decay function  and search relevance scorer . The relevance system  may determine a relevancy score for each document identified in a clickstream, for ranking documents during a search.","In certain embodiments, the linking system , via a click tracker, may collect, track or otherwise monitor information about links or content accessed by one or more users. The linking system  or the click tracker may determine the content that users selected via encoded links, and may analyze the selected content to facilitate interactive search. By way of illustration, and in one embodiment, the linking system  may prioritize content and\/or links based on one or more of: (i) the identity or other information of the user clicking on the link, (ii) the identity or other information of the website providing the content or link to the content, and (iii) the timing and\/or number of users accessing the content via a certain link.

The relevancy of a content may be determined in relation to keywords or search terms, user activity and\/or activity from various websites. The search system may communicate with or rely on the linking system  to process the clickstreams in real time or substantially real time. In some embodiments, the linking system includes a clickstream processing module, which may be referred to as a relevance system  or omniflector. The linking system  may process or decode a clickstream in real time, and may dissect, organize, buffer and\/or store the processed information to the database .","In some embodiments, the database  may be referred to as a redistribution database or a sharded redis cluster database. The database  may comprise one or more sharded redis cluster databases, e.g., in a storage area network (SAN). In certain embodiments, the relevance system  may receive and\/or process a portion of the clickstream to obtain a social score for each content or document (hereafter sometimes generally referred to as \u201cdocument\u201d or \u201ccontent\u201d). The relevance system  may perform calculations on a portion of the decoded stream, to generate the social score and\/or other data. The linking system  may store the social score and\/or other data to the database . In some embodiments, the linking system, e.g., via the relevance system , may receive or access a portion of the stored or buffered information. The linking system  may use this information to generate, create, calculate or otherwise determine a social score for each document.","In some embodiments, a social score indicates, describes or represents how popular or in demand a certain document is. In some embodiments, a social score is a weight to be applied to the relevancy scoring. A social score may be determined based on the number of times a document is \u201cclicked\u201d or accessed, and\/or how widely the document is being shared or referred (e.g., a corresponding encoded link is forwarded or copied). The social score may be tempered by, or incorporate, a decay function to allow old content to decay, and new content to gain traction, prominence or relevance in searches. The linking system  or relevance system  may include a decode processor, which may comprise or execute any application, algorithm, program, library, process, service, script, task or any type and form of instructions for determining social scores. In some embodiments, the decode processor includes a chip or a chipset, e.g., a CPU, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a Field-programmable gate array_(FPGA), or any other hardware for determining the social score.","By way of illustration, and not intended to be limiting in any way, the social score may be any real number or integer ranging between 1 and 100 (or any other range). A maximum of 80 points for example, may be mapped, derived, or contributed from a raw social score. A maximum of 10 points, for example, may be mapped, derived, or contributed from a count of the total number of social referrers. A maximum of 10 points, for example, may be mapped, derived, or contributed from a count of the total number of other referrers. The raw score may indicate the reach of a website or a document online, and may include a number of components, including a distribution score, an engagement score, etc. The raw score may have any value larger than one (or zero, in some embodiments). A raw score falling within certain predefined range may be mapped to a value that makes up a portion (e.g., 80%) of the social score. The total number of social and\/or other referrers may similarly yield component value(s) that contribute to the final value of the social score. By way of example, one embodiment of a pseudo code or algorithmic description of the determination of a social score is depicted below:","a=raw social score [e.g., weighted number of clicks, weight may indicate the reach of a site on the internet]","b=total count of social referrers","c=total count of other (e.g., non-social) referrers","d=mapped social score [a: 1-400->buckets 1-70; a: 401-2000->buckets 71-80, >2000=80]","e=mapped social referrers [b*3, may be bounded between 0 and 10]","f=mapped other referrers [c\/2, may be bounded between 0 and 10].","In some embodiments, the raw social score may contribute the largest component of the social score. However, various different attribution weights may be implemented in various embodiments, and applied to each of the social score components. In one embodiment, the linking system  (e.g., via a source weighting module ) may assign a weight (e.g., ranging between 1 and 10) to certain websites (e.g., top sites) or documents in accordance with the reach they have on the web. Sites with high or broad reach, such as Facebook and Twitter, may be assigned a weight of 10 or some large value. Lower reaching sites, such as Xing.com, may be assigned a 1 or some small value. In some embodiments, when a social click is identified or detected, the raw social score for a corresponding document is adjusted according to the appropriate, assigned weight. By way of example, a click from Facebook may be worth 10 times as much as a click from Xing, and correspondingly represented by their assigned weights.","The raw social score of a document may continue to increase in value as the document's link receives more clicks. In one illustrative embodiment, the raw score may be mapped to a number between 1 and 80, e.g., with the bottom 70 points mapped to lower raw score ranges, and the last 10 points mapped to higher raw score ranges. In some embodiments, the source weighting module  may receive source weight training data  to generate an initial social score, or to test the social scoring system. The source weight training data  may include weights to assign to certain sites, and these weights may be adjusted or updated as sites are ranked and re-ranked. In some embodiments, the source weight training data  may include clickstreams (e.g., simulated, historical, or received in real time) for evaluating source weighting and social scores.","In some embodiments, the relevance system  identifies users that triggered the clickstreams and includes a user weighting module  configured to weight the social score based on the identified users. The user weighting module  may assign specific weights to particular users, such as those identified as influencers (e.g., showing significant social networking reach in sharing content, etc) and\/or power users (e.g., performing significant number of searches, which may influence search relevancy in a positive or negative way for other users). By way of example, the user weighting module  may measure the value of particular users (e.g., a leading social networker on shoe fashion trends) on specific keywords, search terms or search strings (e.g., \u201clace up boots\u201d, \u201ctasseled leather pumps\u201d), and may categorize such users as influencers. The user weighting module  may weight search results based on identifier influencers, for example boosting search results for content that is either encoded or decoded by influencers. In certain embodiments, the user weighting module  assigns weights to clicks associated with certain user data or characteristics (e.g., gender, age group, or users whose online history include visits to websites catering to specific subject matter).","In certain embodiments, the total number or count of social referrers represents the total number of unique referring domains for a certain document or content. These referring domains may be social websites or online social networks. The total number of other referrers may represent the total number of unique referring domains that are not social sites, for a certain document or content. In the above example, the total number of social referrers may be multiplied by three, and the result bounded between 0 and 10. The linking system  may divide the total number of other referrers by 2 (or some other number), and bound the result between 0 and 10. Either of these referrer counts may be adjusted by some other predetermined multiplication (or division) factor before contributing to the social score. In addition, either of these referrer counts may be capped or bounded by other ranges (e.g., 0-100) after adjustment.","Any of the above information may be used to determine the social score and\/or to determine which documents get indexed within search lists. Once a document is indexed, the relevancy score for a document is determined by a relevance system of the linking system  using a combination of word relevancy and the document's social score. The social score may indicate that a document is relatively more important, or is more relevant to a search if the document has been accessed by users and\/or from domains (e.g., via encoded links) that have a lot of influence or reach on the web. It may be expected that documents accessed from popular sites may be more popular and relevant to a user in a search. The linking system  may index each document identified in a clickstream. The linking system  may index or store the document in the database  with or against a corresponding social score. This social score of a document may be updated in real time, according to a schedule, or in response to a triggering event (e.g., a search). In certain embodiments, the relevance system  and\/or search system may access, compare and\/or use the social score of a document during a search.","In some embodiments, the social score of a document is determined based on social clicks that access the document via encoded links. In other embodiments, the social score may incorporate one or more types of clicks, which may include non-social clicks. In some embodiments, social clicks include clicks on document links from identified top websites. In some of these embodiments, social clicks include clicks on links from top social sites. The linking system may identify, maintain or track a number of top sites, e.g., 1000 top sites, which may be provided by partners, market research providers (e.g., Doubleclick), analytics (e.g. BlueKai and Exelate) or search providers (e.g., Yahoo, Google and Bing). In some embodiments, the top sites may comprise, exclusively or non-exclusively, major social sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, etc). The linking system  may determine that a click referred, redirected or consummated from one of these top sites or domains may be considered a social click. As an illustration of the relative importance or relevance of social clicks, consider the following: a linking system that focuses on social clicks from the top 1000 sites may be able to index less than 1% of the domains being clicked, but such clicks may account for over 38% of all online clicks. Thus, social clicks may be useful for determining social scores for online content. In certain embodiments, the linking system  may dynamically monitor click counts from domains and determine top sites based on the distribution of click counts. The linking system may dynamically identify top sites, e.g., in lieu of a static list of top sites provided by a third party.","In certain embodiments, the linking system may classify or group two or more clicks on a social site for the same document, occurring within a certain time period (e.g., 2 or 5 minutes), as a social click. In some embodiments, the linking system may group multiple clicks from other types of websites as a single social click. Documents identified by a social click may be included in a directory, database, search list, index or application programming interface to index the document for search. In some embodiments, such documents are placed in a publisher\/subscriber (pubsub) index or stream that can be pulled during searches. A search engine may pull the social clicks pubsub stream and may continuously index global hashes within the pubsub. Documents that are popular may tend to be clicked over and over again. Such documents may get indexed again and again corresponding to the clicks. As documents' links are clicked, the linking system  may update the documents' social scores. As the documents get re-indexed, their corresponding social scores may be higher, resulting in higher rankings within search results.","In certain embodiments, the number of social clicks may contribute to a social score in a linear or non-linear fashion. For example, a social score of a document may be configured such that it is directly proportional to the number of social clicks detected. In some other embodiments, the first clicks (click number 1-80) from a social website may be weighted more than later clicks (click number 81 to 100) in determining a social score. In one embodiment, and by way of illustration, the number of social clicks may be represented as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0145","num":"0152"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"sc","mrow":{"mi":["i","j"],"mo":","}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mn":["1","80"],"mo":","}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"s","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"i"}},"mn":"10"}},{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mn":["81","100"],"mo":","}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"s","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"i"}},"mn":"100"}}],"mo":"+"}}}}},"In some embodiments, s(i) may represent the click count for term i within the respective click count ranges for document j. Additional clicks (e.g., beyond 100) may be weighted less or differently, or disregarded after a certain threshold (e.g., 100 clicks). In certain embodiments, the number of social clicks, sc, may be referred to as an engagement score. An engagement scorer  of the linking system may rank, score or rate content based on how many clicks are received. An engagement scorer  may include or execute any application, program, library, process, service, script, task or any type and form of executable instructions for generating and\/or updating an engagement score. The engagement scorer  may apply the above function, or some other nonlinear function, such that initial clicks are weighted more than later clicks. The engagement scorer  may emphasize initial clicks so that new content may promoted over older content with the same frequency of clicks. The linking system  may, for example, promote new content by leveraging on a time decay function in conjunction with the engagement score. The linking system  may include or incorporate the engagement score in a social score.","As described, the linking system  may calculate the social score for each document, and may stored the social score in an index. The social score may be decayed, reduced or de-emphasized in time for use in searches, e.g., from the time the document is first indexed. A social score may decay down to half of its original score over a configured period of time, such as 72 or 168 hours. In some embodiments, a social score may be decayed as a function of e(e.g., f(e)), where x represents time. The linking system  and\/or search system may use the social score to determine a relevancy score. The linking system  may include a search relevance scorer  for determining and\/or updating the relevancy score of a document. The search relevance scorer  may include and\/or execute any application, program, library, process, service, script, task or any type and form of executable instructions for generating and updating the relevancy score of a document. The search relevance scorer  may communicate or interoperate with one or more modules (e.g., distribution scorer , engagement scorer , frequency normalizer , time decay function ) in determining and\/or updating a relevancy score. A relevancy score may sometimes be referred to as a search score or a relevance score. The social score may be one of several factors that determines the relevancy score of a document as pertains to search (e.g., interactive search).","In some embodiments, a relevancy score is based on one or more of weights, factors or components, for example: (i) Social score (e.g., how popular a document is), (ii) time decay (e.g., how long a document has been in the index), and (iii) normalized frequency (e.g., how relevant certain terms are to the text of a document). Other weights, factors or components may include (iv) a distribution score and (v) an engagement score. In certain embodiments, the social score for a document may incorporate one or more of the above components, e.g., time decay, distribution score and\/or engagement score. For example, the social score may be subject to time decay prior to being used by the linking system  to determine a relevancy score. In other embodiments, the social score may be combined with other factors before being subject to time decay to establish the relevancy score. As discussed, time decay may incorporate an efunction with respect to time (x), or any log-linear time decay function. With the time decay function, new documents with links that are more recently clicked may have a higher social and\/or relevancy score.","A distribution scorer of the relevance system may calculate or determine the distribution score or weight for a document. The distribution scorer  may include any application, program, library, process, service, script, task or any type and form of executable instructions for monitoring or tracking clicks arising from various websites. The distribution scorer  may determine that a document is ranked higher or more relevant in a search if clicks to access such a document arise from a broader set of source web sites. The distribution scorer  may determine the distribution of clicks (e.g., counts of social clicks or normal clicks) for the same document across a plurality of sites. In some embodiments, the distribution scorer  may determine the number of source sites (e.g., specific social sites) that referred clicks for a certain document. In certain embodiments, the distribution score may be referred as \u201csocial distribution\u201d. The distribution score may be calculated, expressed or represented in one embodiment by the following formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0150","num":"0157"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["sd","ij"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"max","mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"k"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"n"},"mo":",","mi":"Max_SD"}}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0151","num":"0158"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"k"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"n"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0152","num":"0159"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"k"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"n"}}},"br":{}},"In some embodiments, the linking system  includes a frequency normalizer . A frequency normalizer  may include any application, program, library, process, service, script, task or any type and form of executable instructions for processing a term or word's frequency of occurrence in a document. Once enough traffic has been monitored for clickstream activity, the linking system  may retrieve a document identified in the clickstream, using the corresponding long URL. The linking system may extract content that is appropriate for text-based, keyword search. The frequency normalizer  may extract key words from the extracted content, and may normalize some of these keywords. In some embodiments, the frequency normalizer  may insert or store the keywords and their normalization values into the database .","In some embodiments, the frequency normalizer  uses a term frequency\u2014inverse document frequency (tf\/idf) ratio or metric to obtain the normalization values. This metric may be used as a statistical measure to evaluate the importance of a term or word within a document. The importance of a term may increase proportionally to the number of times the term appears in the document. The importance of the term may be offset by the frequency of the word within a superset of documents (e.g., corpus) comprising the document. The linking system may use the tf\/idf metric to score or rank a document's relevance in a given search query. The linking system may use the tf\/idf metric to normalize or diminish the weight of terms (e.g., \u201cthe\u201d, \u201cof\u201d) that occur very frequently in the corpus and increase or normalize the weight of terms (e.g., \u201chibernation\u201d, \u201comnibus\u201d) that occur rarely.","In some embodiments, the tf\/idf metric comprises a term frequency (tf) and the inverse document frequency (idf) components. The tf component may represent the occurrence count of a term in a document. The tf component may be determined from the number of times a given term appears in that document, normalized to prevent a bias towards longer documents to give a measure of the importance of the term i within the particular document j. For example, in a document containing 100 words wherein the word brown appears 3 times, the tf value for brown may be determined as (3\/100)=0.03. In some embodiments, the tf value is expressed in logarithmic form, e.g., log(0.03).

In some embodiments, the recommendation system may receive an encoded URL and decodes the encoded URL.","The recommendation system, such as a responsive to receipt of a URL , may be designed and constructed to read, process or query a click co-occurrence map for or corresponding to the URL. The recommendation system may obtain or retrieve via the database a corresponding click co-occurrence map, such as by using the input URL as an index for retrieval. Via the click co-occurrence map, the recommendation system may identify or query the URLs that are mapped to the input URL. The recommendation system may output the set of mapped URLs  via any the interface, such as displaying via a graphical user interface, output via a command line interface or via a response of a programmatic interface. The recommendation system may rank the mapped URLs by the number of clicks on the mapped URLs. The recommendation system may output an enumeration of URLs  by ranking.","The recommendation system may filter any of the ranked or unranked URLs  based on a number of clicks threshold. The recommendation system may filter any of the ranked or unranked URLs  based on domain filtering. The recommendation system may filter any of the ranked or unranked URLs  using content based or content specific filtering. In some embodiments, if a user is also specified with the URL input, the recommendation system may also provide a relevance score for each of the URLs  by using any of the relevance scoring systems, methods and techniques previously described herein.","Referring now to , an embodiment of a method for providing a recommendation list of URLs or links given an input or URL link is depicted. In brief overview, at step , the system, such as any embodiments of linking system , identifies the users who clicked on an encoded URL. At step , the system identifies the plurality of other encoded URLs those users clicked on. At step , the system generates a click co-occurrence map, such as to correlate the encoded URL of step  to the plurality of other encoded URLs clicked by each user at step  who also clicked the encoded URL. At step , the system received a URL as input and at step , as output, the system provides an enumeration of recommended URLs based on a click co-occurrence map. In some embodiments, the output may also include a ranking and\/or recommendation score.","At step , the system identifies each of the users who clicked on an encoded URL , requested to decode an encoded URL  or otherwise interacted with the encoded URL or corresponding URL. For each click stream and\/or decoding of the encoded URL, the system may track for each encoded URL the users who clicked on the encoded URL. The system may identify each user via a user id . In some embodiments, the system identifies the user via an account or login of the linking system . In some embodiments, the system identifies the user via a cookie . The system such as via the link encoder and user tracker may track each instance of the user decoding an encoded link and store that information to the database  and\/or to the user's profile . The system may track when the user decoded the link, what encoded link was decoded and identification of the link and store this information to the database, such as in the user's user profile.","At step , for each of the users identified as clicking on the encoded URL , the system identifies the other encoded URLs  those users also clicked or have clicked. The system via user tracker and click tracker may store in the database a history of encoded URLs each of the users have previously clicked on. The system may also continue to track, such as in real-time, the encoded URLs each of the users are clicking on. For each click stream and\/or decoding of an encoded URL, the system may track by user the encoded URLs that user has clicked on. The system may track and store in the user's user profile any information identifying the encoded URLs\/URLs that user has clicked on or otherwise interacted with.","At step , the system correlates the user and click tracking information, such as the user and click information obtained via steps  and  to generate and\/or maintain one or more click co-occurrence maps. For each encoded URL  and for each of the users that clicked on or interacted with each encoded URL , the system may identify the other encoded URLs  that user also clicked on or interacted with. For each encoded URL , the click co-occurrence map may identify or track the number of such users who clicked both the encoded URL  and each encoded URL . The system may maintain a click co-occurrence map to correlate each encoded URL\/URL  to the other encoded URLs\/URLs . The system may maintain a separate click co-occurrence map for each encoded URL\/URL. The system may maintain a click co-occurrence map for all encoded URL\/URLs that is indexed by or organized by encoded URL. The system may update the click co-occurrence map upon processing each click stream. The system may update the click co-occurrence map upon decoding each encoded URL.","At step , the system receives an input identifying or comprising a URL. The system may receive the input via a request. The system may receive the URL as input via a graphical user interface. The system may receive the URL as input via a command line interface. The system may receive the URL as input via a programmatic interface. For example, the system may receive the URL as input via an API call, such as a web service call. The system may receive the URL as input via an HTTP request. The system may receive the URL as input from any component of the linking system . The system may receive the URL as input from any third party system, including applications, servers and systems. The system may receive the URL as input from a web page, script or other executable instructions executing on a web page or web server. The system may receive the URL as input from any type and form of mobile application executing on a mobile device, such as a smart phone.","The system may also receive with the URL input or otherwise associated with a request, any one or more parameters for filtering the output. These parameters may include geography information. These parameters may include language information or identification. These parameters may include identification or specification of domain filters and\/or content filters. These parameters may include identification or specification of any thresholds, such as number of recommended URLs. These parameters may include identification or specification of a ranking or ordering of the output. These parameters may include identification or specification of providing or generating a score for the URLs in output, such as using any of the relevance scoring techniques described herein.","At step , the system provides as output  one or more URLs. The system may provide the output responsive to receipt of the URL  as input. The system may use the input URL to retrieve, lookup, query or obtain a click co-occurrence map, such as from database , for or corresponding to the input URL. Via the click co-occurrence map, the system may identify a plurality of encoded URLs clicked on by users who also clicked on the input URL. Via the click co-occurrence map, the system may determine a plurality of encoded URLs clicked on by the largest number of users who also clicked on the input URL. The system may provide the output  via a graphical user interface or command line interface. The system may provide the output  as a response to a request, such as an HTTP response to an HTTP request. The system may provide the output  as a response or data structure to an API call. The system may provide the output as an enumerated list of URLs. The system may provide the output as an enumerated list of URLs ranked in order based on number of user interactions\/clicked and\/or relevance.","The system may apply any filtering, such as domain or content filtering, based on any filtering parameters specified via the input or request. For example, the system may exclude URLs from the output that match or correspond to a domain. In another example, the system may exclude URLs from the output that link to or comprise content corresponding to or having keywords corresponding to specified content. The system may apply any threshold based on any threshold parameters specified via the input or request. For example, the system may provide as output a top 10 ranking of URLs. In another example, the system may provide an output of URLs that had at least a predetermined number of clicks (e.g., 100, 1000, etc). As may be requested via the input or the request or otherwise as a default, the system may determine or provide a score with each URL  in the output. The system may give each URL in the output a score based on the level or degree of matching or recommendation from analysis of the click co-occurrence map. If a user is specified with the input URL, the system may give each URL in the output a score based on any of the relevance scoring techniques described herein.","It should be understood that any of the systems described above may provide multiple ones of any or each of those components and these components may be provided on either a standalone machine or, in some embodiments, on multiple machines in a distributed system.
