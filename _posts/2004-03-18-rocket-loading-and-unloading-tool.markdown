title: Rocket loading and unloading tool
abstract: A tool conforms at one end to an annular nozzle end of a rocket and conforms peripherally to a tube of a launcher for the rocket so that the tool may be inserted into the tube to urge the rocket precisely into a loaded position without slipping from the nozzle and damaging elements inside the nozzle. The tool is configured to receive a blast paddle of the launcher when the paddle is pivoted across the tube to engage a detent and an igniter contact with the rocket in the loaded position. The tool is configured to urge the rocket from the loaded position for unloading from the tube and is constructed of static dissipative material.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for government purposes without the payment of any royalties therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to ordnance and, more particularly, to rammers and to devices for transferring a rocket to a launcher.","(2) Description of the Related Art","A representative operating environment for the both the prior art and the present invention is shown in  in which various elements are foreshortened and fragmentarily represented for illustrative convenience.  show a rocket loading and unloading tool which incorporates the principles of the present invention and is indicated generally by the numeral . The tool, which will subsequently be described in detail, includes a head  and a handle . The operating environment includes a rocket  and a launcher  adapted to the rocket, the rocket being depicted within an interiorly cylindrical launching tube  of the launcher.","Rocket  has a nose end  and an aft end  and resembles a type of military rocket which has a nominal diameter of 2.75 inch (about 70 mm) diameter. Such a rocket typically has, at its aft end, features such as folding fins which are not involved in the present invention and, accordingly, are omitted from the present application.","Such a rocket corresponding to rocket  is loosely and slidably fitted to a tube, which corresponds to tube , for loading and discharging through an open forward end  of the tube. When loaded, the rocket extends substantially the length of the tube toward a generally open aft end  thereof.","Tube end  is associated with subsequently described devices for retaining the loaded rocket, igniting it, and subsequently releasing it. As will be described in detail, a rocket loading and unloading tool of the present invention is characterized by its cooperation with such a rocket and such devices. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the ordnance art that the principles of present invention are applicable to other rocket and launcher structures and cooperative arrangements than those shown and described in the present application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIGS. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","4","5","25","23","15","17","22","25","21","26"]},"Transversely, stop  has a wing-like configuration when viewed forwardly of tube  from tube end  as in . This configuration serves no purpose with the depicted rocket , but was required for fins of other rockets to which a launcher, such as launcher , was adapted, this stop configuration being accommodated by the structure of tool  in a manner subsequently described.","The portion of rocket  just forward of its aft end  has a number of features associated with tool , the depicted features being somewhat schematically represented and best shown in . This portion of the rocket is constructed of steel or other substantial material and serves as a wall  defining a converging-diverging nozzle  and terminating at end  as annular surface , which circumscribes the nozzle and is the region of the rocket engaging stop  on loading. A thin, disk-like end shield  covers surface  and the otherwise open end of nozzle . This shield is, typically, constructed of aluminum and is 0.005 inch (0.127 mm) thick.","Somewhat forwardly of surface , rocket  has an electrically conducting igniter contact band  extending around the rocket periphery and electrically isolated from wall  by an insulating layer . An igniter wire  extends generally centrally through the nozzle from a propulsion motor igniter, not shown, to a location axially aligned with band  and then turns, as shown in , for connection with this band by way of an insulator extending through wall . A plug-like weather seal , through which wire  extends, closes the nozzle forwardly of band  and is, typically, constructed of mylar material. Wall  has a detent engaging ring  which extends about the periphery of this wall at a location forwardly of band . Ring  may be formed between grooves in the wall associated with fins, not shown, of the rocket.","Referring to , it is seen that launcher  has a detent and contact mechanism  which is disposed at tube end  and extends along tube  diametrically oppositely of stop . This mechanism includes a blast paddle , a rocket detent , and an igniter contact  that cooperate with rocket . Since the present invention is only functionally related to mechanism , the internal construction thereof is not shown.","It is seen that blast paddle  has a pivot  disposed somewhat aft of tube  and oppositely thereof from stop . The paddle moves pivotally between a first position  extending parallel to the tube axis, as shown in , and a second position  shown in  where the paddle extends transversely across the tube, aft of a loaded rocket, and generally toward stop . The length of the paddle is such that, in the second position, the paddle extends across the tube for about half its diameter. As seen in , the paddle is U-shaped with its concave side facing the tube in the second position. Mechanism  provides paddle  with an \u201cover-center\u201d action to retain the paddle in its position  or  when the paddle is moved into each of these positions, the paddle moving into its second position  with an audible \u201csnap\u201d for a purpose subsequently described.","Contact  and detent  are spaced successive distances forwardly of stop  such that, axially of tube , they align exactly and respectively with contact band  and detent ring  of a rocket  when the rocket is in a loaded position . In this position, which is shown in , rocket surface  is somewhat forward of stop  and paddle  is spaced a distance axially of tube  from rocket surface .","Mechanism  is constructed so that, when paddle  is in its  or first position , contact  and detent  are retracted from the interior of tube  so that a rocket  may move axially of tube  for loading, firing, or unloading. However, when paddle  is in its  or second position , contact  and detent  extend into tube . As a result, when a rocket is in loaded position  and the paddle is moved to this second position, contact  electrically engages band  for ignition of the rocket motor and detent  engages ring  to hold the rocket in the tube. When paddle  is subsequently returned to its first position, as by blast through nozzle  following motor ignition or by manual movement of the paddle for unloading the rocket, the rocket is freed for movement from tube .","It is apparent from the foregoing that, after a rocket  is loaded into tube  against stop  while paddle  is in its position , it is necessary to move the rocket forwardly into its final loaded position . To do this, paddle  is moved nearly into its transverse position , and the rocket is urged forwardly from the stop until position  is attained; whereupon the paddle snaps into its transverse position and detent  and contact  engage the rocket.","In the prior art, the just described movement of a rocket  from engagement with stop  precisely into loaded position  was carried out by the insertion of any convenient object, such as a dowel rod, though tube end  and past paddle  into engagement with rocket end surface . A similar operation was used in unloading an unfired rocket after moving the paddle into its first position; such an object being used against surface  to urge the rocket forwardly until enough of the rocket protruded from tube end  for grasping the rocket to withdraw it from the tube.","It is apparent from FIG. \u2014when visualized with tool  of the present invention omitted\u2014that, when an object such as a dowel rod is placed against surface  and forced forwardly against the rocket, the object is likely to slip from this surface and into nozzle  to, at least, pierce the thin end shield  and, probably, destroy the electrical continuity of igniter wire . If only the shield is damaged, it can be replaced, although not in the field. However, if the igniter continuity is broken, the entire rocket motor must be removed and disposed of.","The following four United States patents show representative prior art arrangements for positioning ordnance items in relation to generally tubular structures.","U.S. Pat. No. 311,974 issued 10 Feb. 1885 to Gatling and discloses a hand loading device having a trough which is received in a gun breech and along which a follower is motivated by a lever to correctly position a cartridge. The face of the follower is recessed to prevent it from touching the primer of the cartridge.","U.S. Pat. No. 1,326,789 issued 30 Dec. 1919 to Schneider and discloses a scoop on which rests a powder charge and which has a forward edge peripherally engaging a projectile. The scoop is inserted into a gun bore to carry the charge therein while ramming the projectile.","U.S. Pat. No. 3,120,785 issued 11 Feb. 1964 to Lorimer et al. for a folding ramming device. FIG. 2 shows a cam 31 on one rod-like guide member disposed in a gun breech to position a pair of such members for sliding an ammunition into the gun. FIG. 8 shows the device subsequently rotated and bearing a \u201cramming bracket\u201d 59 configured to distribute \u201cthe ramming action substantially along a diameter of the ammunition to minimize tilting of the ammunition\u201d.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,675,114 issued 7 Oct. 1997 to Thebault et al. for a loading\/unloading device which carries charges into the chamber of a gun where a lever retains the charges. The device has an transversely arcuate \u201cimplement\u201d insertable entirely into the chamber, with the charges and over this lever, for loading and unloading. The implement has a forward end disposed to stop the device by engagement of the periphery of a projectile forward of the charges. The implement may be made of a conductive material \u201cto enable the evacuation of electrostatic charges.\u201d","The present invention is a tool overcoming the above-identified prior art problems with rocket loading and unloading in the above-described operating environment.","More specifically, the tool has a generally cylindrical head which is, preferably, constructed of material which dissipates static electricity. This head conforms peripherally to the interior diameter of a rocket launcher tube with which the tool is to function so that the head is slidably receivable in the tube and guided thereby for free movement axially therein. The head deviates from a complete cylinder by having at least one omitted segment so that the head has a planar surface parallel to its axis, this surface being disposed so that, when the head is received in the launcher tube, this surface is spaced from the tube interior a distance such that the head freely passes obstructions in the tube interior such as the above-described rocket stop .","The tool head has a forward face conforming to the aft end of a rocket with which the tool is to function. In particular, this face has an arcuate, forwardly projecting rim conforming radially to the above-described annular surface  about nozzle  so that, when the tool is urged against the rocket aft end, this tool face engages the rocket at its surface  without engagement of the tool with rocket end shield .","As a result of the just-described structure, the tool may be inserted into a launching tube to urge a rocket precisely into a loaded position without slipping from the nozzle and damaging elements inside the nozzle.","The tool head has a rectangular slot diametrically opposite the above-identified planar surface. This slot extends radially into the head for a distance somewhat greater than the distance the above-described blast paddle  extends across the launcher tube when the paddle is nearly or fully into its second position . Also, the width of this slot is somewhat greater than the width of the blast paddle. Additionally, the axial depth of the slot is such that the tool head does not engage the blast paddle when the paddle is disposed across the launcher tube but is not fully into the second position of the paddle corresponding to the above-described fully loaded rocket position  where the launcher detent  is engaged with rocket ring  and launcher igniter contact  is engaged with rocket contact band .","As a result of the structure described in the previous paragraph, a tool of the present invention is configured to receive the blast paddle of the launcher when the paddle is pivoted across the launcher tube just before and after engagement of the detent and igniter contact with the rocket when the rocket is urged forwardly by the tool from the rocket's initial position against stop  into the fully loaded position .","Preferably, a tool of the present invention includes a rod fitted to its head and extending axially thereof, the rod being in several sections and having its end opposite the head provided with a T-handle. The head, rod sections, and T-handle may be connected by screw threads for convenient configuration of the tool for loading rockets in close quarters and for storage.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a tool for manipulating ordnance items without damage to the items.","A more specific object is provide a tool for loading or unloading a rocket disposed in a launcher by application of force to an end of the rocket without danger of damaging the rocket.","Another object is to provide such a tool adapted for use with a rocket disposed in a launching tube having elements of predetermined configuration for initial positioning of the rocket.","Still another object is to provide such a tool adapted for use in an operating environment including a rocket disposed in a launching tube associated with elements having predetermined structures and movements thereof for engaging the rocket to retain the rocket in the tube, to provide ignition of the rocket, and to disengage the rocket upon firing or for unloading without firing.","An additional object is to provide such a tool which does not present a static electricity hazard when manipulating electrically ignited ordnance items.","Yet another object is provide such a tool which facilitates the loading and unloading of a rocket in such an operating environment and which may be easily configured for use in a limited space and for storage.","A further object is to provide such a tool which has the foregoing advantages, which is applicable to existing rockets and launchers, which is economical to construct, and which is fully effective.","Referring to , it is seen that head  of tool  may be unitarily constructed from a cylindrical length of any suitable material, a static electricity static dissipative material being preferred so that the tool does not present an electrostatic discharge hazard when loading or unloading a rocket into tube . An acetyl material having surface and volume resistivities of 10to 10ohms\/square, as determined by ASTM Method D257, is effective for this purpose.","As best seen in , head  has a generally cylindrical peripheral surface  somewhat smaller across its greatest dimension than the diameter of the interior of tube . Head  thus conforms peripherally to the tube interior for slidable movement axially along the tube with the head and tube in generally coaxial relationship. Head  has a planar surface  extending entirely along one side of the head and parallel to the axis of surface  so that generally cylindrical configuration of the head lacks a segment bounded by surface . Radially of the head, surface  is spaced from the axis of surface  a distance such that, when the head is received in tube  with surface  facing wing-like rocket stop , surface  clears and does not engage the stop.","As best seen from , it is apparent that surface  is an arcuate peripheral surface of head  and conforms to a segment of a cylinder having a predetermined axis, and surface . It is also apparent that surface  is a planar peripheral surface of the head and subtends surface . It is further apparent that surface  extends parallel to this axis and is disposed oppositely thereof from the center of an arc conforming to surface .","Head  has a forward face  conforming to the aft end of the rocket. In particular, this face has a generally central and circular recess  so that, peripherally, the face has an arcuate rim  with an interior radial dimension substantially equal to the corresponding dimension of annular surface  at rocket aft end . The surfaces of recess  and rim , which are disposed toward rocket end  when head  is engaged therewith, are depicted as planar and normal to the axis of surface . As best seen in , rim  extends radially inwardly from surface , and recess  extends inwardly of head  in a direction along this axis from the rim. It is evident from , that face  is a circular segment bounded by surfaces  and  and that surfaces  and  of the face terminate surfaces  and .","It is evident from the structure described in the preceding paragraph that face  is configured to engage the rocket periphery while the rocket end shield  is not engaged by the tool.","Head  defines a rectangular recess or slot  opposite surface  and extending radially into the head for a distance somewhat greater than the distance blast paddle  extends across tube  when the paddle is in its second position . Transversely of the head, the width of slot  is somewhat greater than the width of the blast paddle as best seen in . As seen in , slot  extends axially into the head a distance somewhat greater than the distance the aftmost portion of the paddle is spaced from the rocket aft end when rim  is pressed against rocket surface  and the rocket is in its fully loaded position  as established by engagement of launcher detent  with ring  of rocket .","From the above, it is evident that, when paddle  is in its transverse position  and a rocket  is in its initial position , head  is insertable into tube , without the head engaging the paddle or stop , for urging the rocket into its final position  by engagement of head face  with rocket annular surface  without tool  slipping from the annular surface and damaging the rocker.","As seen in , tool handle  includes a rod  fitted to head  and extending axially thereof from an end  thereof opposite face . The end of the rod opposite the head is, preferably, provided with a detachable T-handle . The rod and handle are, typically, constructed of aluminum, and the rod may be provided in several attachable and detachable sections  for convenience in storage and use of tool  in close quarters. For use with actual rockets of the above-identified type of 2.75 inch nominal diameter, which have a length of about 6 feet (about 1800 mm), rod  may have two such sections about 14 inches (350 mm) in length. For convenient and releasable interconnection, head , T-handle , and each section  may be provided with suitable screwthreads as indicated at head end  by numeral .","It is evident that, as a result of the structure of head  which defines the above-described surface  and slot , tool  is configured to pass, without engaging, the obstruction in tube  represented by stop  and to receive, without engaging, blast paddle  when this paddle is pivoted across tube  nearly or completely into position . It will also be evident that, in loading a rocket  into the tube, the structure of head , by virtue of surface  which conforms to the tube interior, cooperates peripherally with the tube and, by virtue of face  which conforms at rim  to rocket surface , cooperates axially with the rocket aft end  so as to prevent damage to the rocket by the tool slipping from the rocket aft end or into nozzle .","In such loading of a rocket , tool  is assembled by connection of its head , a convenient number of the rod sections , and T-handle . A blast paddle , which is associated with a launcher tube , is placed in first position , and then the rocket is inserted fully into the tube from its forward end  until rocket surface  engages stop . The paddle is then moved substantially into its second position , and tool head  is then inserted forwardly into tube end . As this is done, it is apparent that cooperation between the tube interior and the conforming head surface  guides the head to move substantially coaxially with the tube and that surface  is guided by tube  so that the head passes paddle  in its transverse position  and surface  passes stop  so that face  can engage rocket end . As a result, further movement of the tool causes rim  to contact rocket surface  without engagement of the tool head with either the stop or the blast paddle and without danger of the tool head slipping from its peripheral engagement with surface  so as to damage end shield  or any element of the rocket within nozzle . The tool is then urged forwardly, until the rocket moves into its fully loaded position  and the paddle snaps audibly and fully into its second position  in which the rocket is retained by detent  and engaged for ignition by contact . Head  is then withdrawn from tube  through tube end  so that the rocket remains in the loaded position engaged by the detent with end shield  and igniter wire  undamaged.","Typically and as seen in , both rod sections  are utilized in unloading a rocket  which has not been fired. Such unloading is carried out by returning blast paddle  to its first position  to release the rocket from launcher tube  and then applying tool head  to rocket aft end  and urging the rocket forwardly so that enough of the rocket protrudes from tube end  for grasping to fully withdraw the rocket from the tube. As this is done, surface  is guided by tube  so that the head passes paddle  in its extended position  and surface  passes stop  so that face  can engage rocket end .","It is evident that, as in loading a rocket, the previously described conforming relation of the head to the tube interior and to the rocket aft end, prevents damage to the rocket by the tool slipping into nozzle . Head  is then withdrawn from tube  through tube end  so that the rocket remains in such a protruding position with end shield  and igniter wire  undamaged.","It is apparent that, in both loading and unloading a rocket  from a tube  in accordance with methods of using a tool  of the present invention, the rocket is disposed in the tube; the blast paddle is in the extended position\u2014initially on loading and before inserting tool head  into the tube on unloading; and the head is inserted into tube end  with surface  guided by the tube so that surface  passes rocket stop and tool face  engages rocket annular surface  without slipping therefrom and affecting end shield  or igniter wire . The tool and rocket are then urged toward tube end  until the rocket is in a desired position\u2014position  on loading and a position protruding from this tube end on unloading.","Although the present invention has been herein shown and described in connection with what is conceived as the preferred embodiment, it is recognized that departures may be made therefrom within the scope of the invention which is not limited to the illustrative details disclosed."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and other objects, advantages, and novel features of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description when considered with the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
