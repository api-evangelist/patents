title: Systems and methods for generating called device location based on cell sector information
abstract: Implementations relate to systems and methods for generating called device location based on cell sector information for the called mobile device. Implementations relate to platforms and techniques relate in which a calling device can call a called device, such as a cellular telephone or network-enabled media player. The network can locate the called device using a paging process transmitted via the mobile switch(es) and associated base station(s) of the called device service provider. The called device can respond to the paging process by transmitting a message. The cell sector location of the base station to which the called device responds can be captured as the current location of the called device. The network can report the location of the called device to the calling device using different message formats, including SMS or USSD messages.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present teachings relate generally to method and apparatus for generating a called device location based on cell sector information, and more particularly to platforms and techniques for capturing the location of a called mobile device in the network based on the responding cell sector location serving the called device.","Location-based services have enjoyed increasing popularity with mobile cellular and other service providers. The identification of a current location of a mobile device allows the user to search for content, service, social network, and other opportunities based on their proximity to locations of interest. Applications continue to be developed for users wishing to receive location-based content based on the location of their mobile device. In many cases, the location data used to derive value-added location content is based on Global Positioning System (GPS) location capability built into the mobile device.","For some users, there may be additional interest in gaining location information reflecting the location of the mobile device to which the user wishes to place a telephone call. For example, a supervisor or manager in a business organization may wish to learn the location of employees or business assets. In this type of application, for example, a manager at a shipping company may wish to locate the driver of a delivery truck on a certain delivery route. For further example, parents may wish to check the location of children to ensure their security. For another example, friends who subscribe to a social networking service or otherwise may wish to receive an update on the location of friends with whom they plan to congregate for a concert, dinner, or other function. In general, location-based services based on the location of a called device are lacking in the marketplace, particularly in cases where the called device is not equipped with GPS capability.","According to the present teachings in one or more aspects, systems and methods for generating a called device location based on cell sector information are provided. Various aspects relate to a method of generating location data for a mobile device. The method includes initiating a voice call from a calling device to a called mobile device, receiving a request from the calling device to capture location data of the called mobile device, initiating a paging process to locate the called mobile device via a called device service provider, identifying a cell sector location for the called mobile device based on a paging response of the called mobile device via the called device service provider; generating called device location data for the called mobile device based on the cell sector location identified via the called device service provider, and transmitting the called device location data to the calling device.","Various aspects relate to a system for generating location data for a mobile device.

The system includes means for serving data to a called mobile device. The means for serving data is configured to initiate a voice call from a means for calling to the called mobile device, receive a request from the means for calling to capture location data of the called mobile device, initiate a paging process to locate the called mobile device via a called device service provider, identify a cell sector location for the called mobile device based on a paging response of the called mobile device via the called device service provider, generate called device location data for the called mobile device based on the cell sector location identified via the called device service provider, and transmit the called device location data to the means for calling.","Various aspects further relate to a computer program product comprising computer-readable medium. The computer-readable medium comprising or encoding at least one instruction for causing a computer to initiate a voice call from a calling device to a called mobile device, at least one instruction for causing a computer to receive a request from the calling device to capture location data of the called mobile device, at least one instruction for causing a computer to initiate a paging process to locate the called mobile device via a called device service provider, at least one instruction for causing a computer to identify a cell sector location for the called mobile device based on a paging response of the called mobile device via the called device service provider, at least one instruction for causing a computer to generate called device location data for the called mobile device based on the cell sector location identified via the called device service provider, and at least one instruction for causing a computer to transmit the called device location data to the calling device.","Various aspects in further regards relate to a method of receiving location information for a called device. The method includes initiating a voice call to a called mobile device serviced by a called device service provider, generating a request to capture location data of the called mobile device, initiating a paging process to locate the called mobile device via the called device service provider, and receiving called device location data for the called mobile device based on a cell sector location identified via the paging process of the called device service provider.","Various aspects likewise relate to a communications device. The device including an interface to a called device service provider and a processor, communicating with the interface. The processor is configured to initiate a voice call to a called mobile device serviced by the called device service provider, generate a request to capture location data of the called mobile device, initiate a paging process to locate the called mobile device via the called device service provider, and receive called device location data for the called mobile device based on a cell sector location identified via the paging process of the called device service provider.","Various aspects relate to a communications device. The device includes means to provide an interface to a called device service provider and means for processing communicating with the interface. The means for processing being configured to initiate a voice call to a called mobile device serviced by the called device service provider, generate a request to capture location data of the called mobile device, initiate a paging process to locate the called mobile device via the called device service provider, and receive called device location data for the called mobile device based on a cell sector location identified via the paging process of the called device service provider.","Various aspects in further regards relate to a computer program product comprising computer-readable medium.

The mobile network can be configured to receive the request to initiate the call to the called device, and proceed to locate the called mobile device via a paging process which searches for the called mobile device over a paging channel in the called device service provider's service area. The network can detect the responding base station to which the mobile device responds, and capture cell sector information for that base station, including cell sector ID, and\/or location specified by latitude\/longitude data points for that base station. The called device service provider can extract such location information from the terminating network edge of the call, and encapsulate that data in one of multiple formats to transmit to the calling device. Those formats can include, for instance, SMS (Short Messaging System) messages, USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) messages, and\/or other data formats or protocols. Upon receipt of the called device location information, the calling device can display the location of the called device on a graphical interface or other output. The location can, in one or more implementations, be updated as the called device travels throughout different areas. In one or more implementations, the location information for the called device can be received on an automatic or user-requested basis, and can represent a value-added service to which the user of the calling device subscribes, for instance, for a fee. Other service arrangements can be used, but in all cases, called-device location data can be generated without a necessity for the called device to be equipped with GPS capability, since location information is generated by network resources themselves.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the one or more aspects comprise the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims.

Also, any connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium. For example, if the software is transmitted from a website, server, or other remote source using a coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, digital subscriber line (DSL), or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave, then the coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, DSL, or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave are included in the definition of medium. Disk and disc, as used herein, includes compact disc (CD), laser disc, optical disc, digital versatile disc (DVD), floppy disk, and blu-ray disc where disks usually reproduce data magnetically, while discs reproduce data optically with lasers. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media. The steps of a method or algorithm described in connection with the implementations disclosed herein may be embodied directly in hardware, in a software module executed by a processor, or in a combination of the two. A software module may reside in RAM memory, flash memory, ROM memory, EPROM memory, EEPROM memory, registers, a hard disk, a removable disk, a CD-ROM, or any other form of storage medium known in the art. An exemplary storage medium is coupled to the processor, such that the processor can read information from, and write information to, the storage medium. In the alternative, the storage medium may be integral to the processor. The processor and the storage medium may reside in an ASIC. The ASIC may reside in a user terminal. In the alternative, the processor and the storage medium may reside as discrete components in a user terminal.","For further example, while implementations have been described in which one calling device service provider  and one called device service provider  interact to locate called device  and report the location of that device to calling device , in one or more implementations more than one service provider and\/or base station or other resources can support either calling device  or called device . For yet further example, while implementations have been described in which the location information for called device  is reported in either SMS (Short Message Service) or USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) formats, in one or more implementations, different or additional formats or messaging channels or types can be used. In one or more implementations, more than one format or channel can be used in the course of one call event. Other resources described as singular or integrated can in one or more implementations be plural or distributed, and resources described as multiple or distributed can in one or more implementations be combined.
