In particular, the invention relates to devices designed to resolve very small angular shifts by quantum weak measurements.","A fiber optical gyroscope (FOG) measures or maintains orientation, analogous to the function of a mechanical gyroscope based on the principles of conservation of angular momentum. The FOG's principle of operation is instead based on the interference of light that passes through a coil of an optical fiber, and contains no moving components. FOGs have been employed for inertial navigation in guided missiles.","In a conventional FOG, a laser emits a beam of photons that are separated by a beam splitter into two polarized beams. Both beams enter into a single optical fiber but in opposite directions. Due to the Sagnac effect, the beam travelling against the rotation experiences a slightly shorter path delay than the other beam. Interferometry enables the resulting differential phase shift to be measured. This translates one component of angular velocity into an interference pattern shift that can be measured photometrically.","Beam-splitting optics launches light from a laser diode into two waves propagating in the clockwise and counter-clockwise directions through a coil consisting of many turns of optical fiber. The Sagnac effect's strength depends on the effective area of the closed optical path, and thus relates to the geometric area of the loop and the number of turns in the coil.","Conventional fiber optical gyroscopes yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, resolution of small angles can be enhanced using quantum weak measurement by embodiments described herein to improve precision.","Various exemplary embodiments provide an optical gyroscope for detecting an angular difference. The gyroscope includes a laser, a pre-selection polarizer, a first polarizing beam splitter, a coil of optical fiber, a second recombining beam splitter, a post-selection polarizer, a spectrometer and an analyzer. The laser emits a pulse beam of coherent photons. The beam has pulse duration \u03c3. The pre-selection polarizer pre-selects the photons, and the polarizing beam splitter separates the photons by their horizontal |+ and vertical |\u2212 polarization eigenstates.","The coil has radius r and preserves the polarization of photons. The coil rotates during said pulse duration \u03c3 by a difference rotation angle \u0394\u03b8. After beam recombination by the second beam splitter, the post-selection polarizer post-selects the photons. The spectrometer collects these photons and determines an associated frequency translator \u03b4\u03c9. The analyzer determines the difference rotation angle as",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0009"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["\u0394","\u03b8"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":"\u00b1","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":["c","tan","\u03c7"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}}],"msup":{"mi":"\u03c3","mn":"2"}},{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"r"}]}}},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"\u03b4\u03c9"}],"mo":"="},"mo":","}}},"br":{}},"In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","In accordance with a presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, the components, process steps, and\/or data structures may be implemented using various types of operating systems, computing platforms, computer programs, and\/or general purpose machines. In addition, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that devices of a less general purpose nature, such as hardwired devices, or the like, may also be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the inventive concepts disclosed herewith. General purpose machines include devices that execute instruction code. A hardwired device may constitute an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or a floating point gate array (FPGA) or other related component.","Various exemplary embodiments provide a fiber optical gyroscope that uses the Aharonov-Albert-Vaidman (AAV) amplification effect. Photons in a laser pulse that have traversed a circular rotation sensing loop of fiber and have their polarization states pre- and post-selected yield a frequency shift produced by the rotation of the fiber. A pure imaginary weak value amplifies small frequency shifts from which small rotation angles are obtained. When ideal conditions prevail, rotation angles of \u02dc750 femtoradians can be measured.","The weak value Aof a quantum mechanical observable \u00c2 was described a quarter century ago by Y. Aharonov et al., \u201cHow the Result of a Measurement of a Component of the Spin of a Spin-\u00bd Particle Can Turn Out to be 100\u201d, 60, 14, 1351 (1988) and known as \u201cAAV.\u201d See http:\/\/www.tau.ac.i1\/\u02dcvaidman\/1vhp\/m8.pdf for details.","This weak quantity is the statistical result of a standard measurement procedure performed upon a pre- and post-selected (PPS) ensemble of quantum systems when the interaction between the measurement apparatus and each system is sufficiently weak, i.e., when it is a weak measurement. Unlike a standard strong measurement of \u00c2, which significantly disturbs the measured system (i.e., it \u201ccollapses\u201d the wavefunction), a weak measurement of observable \u00c2 for a PPS system does not appreciably disturb the quantum system and yields Aas the observable's measured value.","The peculiar nature of the virtually undisturbed quantum reality that exists between the boundaries defined by the PPS states is revealed in the eccentric characteristics of A, namely that","(i) Acan be complex valued;","(ii) Re Acan lie far outside the eigenvalue spectrum limits of operator \u00c2; and","(iii) the magnitude of Im Acan be extremely large.","Characteristics (ii) and (iii) are referred to as the AAV amplification effect.","Experiments have verified several of the interesting unusual properties predicted by weak value theory. These include reports by N. Ritchie et al., \u201cRealization of a Measurement of a \u2018Weak Value\u2019\u201d, 66, 1107 (1991); A.

Further, an AAV amplification of 10(i.e., ten-thousand) has recently been achieved and used to observe the previously unobserved spin Hall effect of light, as reported by O. Hosten et al., in \u201cObservation of the Spin Hall Effect of Light via Weak Measurements\u201d, 319, 787 (2008).","This disclosure describes a concept for a fiber optical gyroscope (and rotation angle sensor)\u2014the Aharonov-Albert-Vaidman effect fiber optical gyroscope AAVFOG that uses the AAV amplification effect along with associated findings recently supported by N.

Under certain ideal conditions, rotation angles on the order of several hundred femtoradians can be measured.","The following presents a brief review of weak measurement and weak value theory.
