title: Travelogue locating mining for travel suggestion
abstract: A location extraction component analyzes a set of travelogues to identify all of the locations mentioned therein. A co-occurrence extraction component computes co-occurrence values for the identified locations. When the identity of a specified location is received, suggested locations for the specified location are identified through the use of the co-occurrence values. A map is displayed that encompasses an area including the specified location and the suggested locations. The map might include indicators for the specified location and for each of the suggested locations. Attributes of the indicators, such as their size or color, can be modified based upon the co-occurrence value associated with the corresponding suggested location.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Travelogues are textual descriptions of a person's experience with a particular location. For instance, a person might travel to New York City and write a travelogue that describes their travel experience. In addition to a description of the person's travel experience with a particular location, a travelogue might also include a description of the person's experience with other, related locations. For instance, a travelogue regarding New York City might also include information regarding other nearby locations, like Brooklyn. Such a travelogue might also include information regarding tourist attractions, restaurants, shopping destinations, and other locations in or near New York City.","Travelogues are currently written and shared in a variety of different ways on the Internet. For instance, travelogues can be shared by way of World Wide Web (the \u201cWeb\u201d) sites, Web forums, blog sites, social networking sites, and in myriad other ways. A large number of such sites are currently available on the Internet for writing and sharing travelogues. Such a large number of disparate sites containing travelogues can make it very difficult, however, for users to identify locations of particular interest with respect to a given travel destination. For instance, a person that plans to travel to New York City in the future may have a difficult time identifying locations of interest due to the sheer volume of sites that contain travelogues.","It is with respect to these and other considerations that the disclosure made herein is presented.","Concepts and technologies are described herein for travelogue-based travel suggestion. Through an implementation of the concepts and technologies presented herein, functionality can be provided for assisting a user in identifying locations of interest relevant to a user-specified location. For instance, suggested locations in or near New York City may be provided to a user in response to a search for information regarding New York City. In this manner, the user does not have to search a large number of travelogue sites in order to find locations of particular interest with respect to a specific travel destination.","According to one aspect presented herein, travelogues are retrieved from a variety of travelogue sites and stored. For instance, travelogues might be retrieved from Web sites, Web forums, blog sites, social networking sites, and other types of sites. As discussed above, a travelogue is a text description of an experience with a location. Travelogues might also include a text description of an experience with other, related locations, such as nearby geographical locations, tourist attractions, restaurants, shopping destinations, and other types of locations.","Once the travelogues have been obtained and stored, a location extraction component is executed that analyzes the travelogues to identify all of the locations mentioned therein. The location extraction component might utilize a gazetteer containing location names in order to identify the locations mentioned in the set of travelogues. For instance, the gazetteer might be utilized to identify possible name candidates, a classifier might then be utilized to identify location names from the candidates, and ambiguity resolution might then be performed to distinguish between different locations that have the same name.","After the locations mentioned in the set of travelogues have been identified, a co-occurrence extraction component is executed that computes co-occurrence values for the identified locations. Each co-occurrence value is an integer value that specifies the number of times two locations are mentioned in the same travelogue for the entire set of travelogues. Co-occurrence values are, therefore, computed for pairs of identified locations. The co-occurrence values are then stored for use in identifying suggested locations.","When the identity of a specified location is received, such as through the submission of the identity of a location to a search Web site, suggested locations for the specified location are identified through the use of the co-occurrence values. In particular, the co-occurrence values are searched in order to identify those other locations that have non-zero co-occurrence values with respect to the specified location. The other locations having non-zero co-occurrence values with respect to the specified location can then be displayed to a user as suggested locations. In one embodiment, only those other locations having the highest co-occurrence values with respect to the specified location may be displayed.","In one embodiment, a map is displayed to the user that encompasses an area including the specified location and the suggested locations. Indicators might be displayed on the map for the specified location and for each of the suggested locations. In one embodiment, attributes of the indicators, such as their size or color, are modified based upon the co-occurrence value associated with the corresponding suggested location. In another embodiment, lines are displayed between the indicator for the specified location and the indicators for the suggested locations. Attributes of the lines, such as their thickness or style, might also be modified based upon the co-occurrence value associated with the corresponding suggested location.","It should be appreciated that the above-described subject matter might also be implemented as a computer-controlled apparatus, a computer process, a computing system, or as an article of manufacture such as a computer-readable storage medium. These and various other features will be apparent from a reading of the following Detailed Description and a review of the associated drawings.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.
