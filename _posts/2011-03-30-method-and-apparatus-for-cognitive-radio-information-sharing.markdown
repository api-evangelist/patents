{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SOME EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS","DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Mobile devices with various methods of connectivity are now for many people becoming the primary gateway to the internet and also a major storage point for personal information. This is in addition to the normal range of personal computers and furthermore sensor devices plus internet based providers. Combining these devices together and lately the applications and the information stored by those applications is a major challenge of interoperability. This can be achieved through numerous, individual and personal information spaces in which persons, groups of persons, etc. can place, share, interact and manipulate (or program devices to automatically perform the planning, interaction and manipulation of) webs of information with their own locally agreed semantics without necessarily conforming to an unobtainable, global whole.","Furthermore, in addition to information, the information spaces may be combined with webs of shared and interactive computations or computation spaces so that the devices having connectivity to the computation spaces can have the information in the information space manipulated within the computation space environment and the results delivered to the device, rather than the whole process being performed locally in the device. It is noted that such computation spaces may consist of connectivity between devices, from devices to network infrastructure, to distributed information spaces so that computations can be executed where enough computational elements are available. These combined information spaces and computation spaces often referred to as computation clouds, are extensions of the \u2018Giant Global Graph\u2019 in which one can apply semantics and reasoning at a local level.","Networks composed of mobile and immobile devices associated with the wide spectrum of distributed information and computation spaces communicate with each other via methods of connectivity based on various paradigms of communication (or radio) such as, for example, cognitive radio wave, telephony, fiber optics, orbiting satellites, the Internet, etc. A recent development in radio communication technology referred to as \u201ccognitive radio\u201d provides a paradigm for wireless communication in which either a network or a wireless node changes its transmission or reception parameters to communicate efficiently while avoiding interference with other users, either licensed or unlicensed. In one embodiment, this alteration of parameters is based, at least in part, on the active monitoring of several factors in the external and internal radio environment, such as radio frequency spectrum, user behavior and network state. By way of example, cognitive radio can provide many advantages over traditional radio communication paradigms, for example, by (1) enabling use of all available frequencies leading to efficient use of the radio spectrum, (2) providing each user with the optimal connectivity for the use and the occasion, (3) providing easy access control and identification management, (4) providing new levels of interaction among various radio types, etc. Because of the benefits of cognitive radio, many network managers may opt for using cognitive radio as their preferred way of communication. However, service providers and device manufacturers face significant technical challenges to recording and\/or sharing cognitive radio parameters and related information among participating communication nodes to ensure efficient use of available radio frequencies.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach for providing cognitive radio information sharing via information spaces.","According to one embodiment, a method comprises determining one or more cognitive radio parameters associated with one or more locations. The method also comprises causing, at least in part, storage of the one or more cognitive radio parameters in at least one distributed information space constituted by one or more namespaces, wherein the one or more namespaces within the at least one distributed information space are accessible to one or more cognitive radio devices.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises at least one processor, and at least one memory including computer program code, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to, with the at least one processor, cause, at least in part, the apparatus to determine one or more cognitive radio parameters associated with one or more locations. The apparatus also causes, at least in part, storage of the one or more cognitive radio parameters in at least one distributed information space constituted by one or more namespaces, wherein the one or more namespaces within the at least one distributed information space are accessible to one or more cognitive radio devices.","According to another embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium carries one or more sequences of one or more instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause, at least in part, an apparatus to determine one or more cognitive radio parameters associated with one or more locations. The apparatus also causes, at least in part, storage of the one or more cognitive radio parameters in at least one distributed information space constituted by one or more namespaces, wherein the one or more namespaces within the at least one distributed information space are accessible to one or more cognitive radio devices.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises means for determining one or more cognitive radio parameters associated with one or more locations. The apparatus also comprises means for causing, at least in part, storage of the one or more cognitive radio parameters in at least one distributed information space constituted by one or more namespaces, wherein the one or more namespaces within the at least one distributed information space is are accessible to one or more cognitive radio devices.","In addition, for various example embodiments of the invention, the following is applicable: a method comprising facilitating a processing of and\/or processing (1) data and\/or (2) information and\/or (3) at least one signal, the (1) data and\/or (2) information and\/or (3) at least one signal based, at least in part, on (or derived at least in part from) any one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising facilitating access to at least one interface configured to allow access to at least one service, the at least one service configured to perform any one or any combination of network or service provider methods (or processes) disclosed in this application.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising facilitating creating and\/or facilitating modifying (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality, the (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality based, at least in part, on data and\/or information resulting from one or any combination of methods or processes disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention, and\/or at least one signal resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising creating and\/or modifying (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality, the (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality based at least in part on data and\/or information resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention, and\/or at least one signal resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","In various example embodiments, the methods (or processes) can be accomplished on the service provider side or on the mobile device side or in any shared way between service provider and mobile device with actions being performed on both sides.","For various example embodiments, the following is applicable: An apparatus comprising means for performing the method of any of claims -.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Examples of a method, apparatus, and computer program for providing cognitive radio information sharing are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In one embodiment, cognitive radio may provide the possibility to multiply the current network speeds and\/or capacity. For example, cognitive radio technology can be configured to understand the language of any radio protocol. This characteristic of the cognitive radio, combined with new simple radios embedded in any object, can provide interaction between any physical objects. This can also provide solutions for communication between people using communication devices with different setups, such as for example, different languages and cultures, etc.","For example, at a big event such as a concert or a sports event the local network may get overloaded. Based on the current spectrum usage limitations, the provided capacity may not be enough for all the users. In one embodiment, cognitive radio technology can use all available frequencies and connectivity methods. It can quickly adapt to the unusual situation and ensure proper operation of the networks. The devices can connect not only through the network cells, but also by forming spontaneous networks. This enables many more users to transmit information such as, for example, messages, phone calls, real time video streams, etc.","Furthermore, the cognitive connectivity and radio communication paradigm generally provides and\/or relies on location dependent information on available bandwidth, rules, and tuning setups associated with a communication network. Accordingly, a cognitive radio enabled system often is equipped with one or more centralized databases in addition to local coexistence management for every device to interact and request operational parameters. More specifically, cognitive radio enabled devices can request and\/or inform their (spectrum) findings to the cognitive radio database and local coexistence management, and in return receive settings and other response information to configure devices and utilize settings correctly at certain locations, which are under certain regulations. These interactions often involve sharing and\/or distributing cognitive radio information among participating devices. Therefore, there is a need for an approach for integrating services and architectures to offer cognitive connectivity with other existing systems to provide more efficiency, flexibility and scalability.","To address this problem, a system  of  introduces the capability to share cognitive radio information via information spaces in a distributed information and\/or computation environment (e.g., cloud computing environment).","The cloud computing environments provide aggregated sets of information (information spaces) and computations (computation spaces) from different sources. This multi-sourcing is very flexible since it accounts and relies on the observation that the same piece of information or computation can come from different sources. In one embodiment, information and computations within the cloud are represented using Semantic Web standards such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), RDF Schema (RDFS), OWL (Web Ontology Language), FOAF (Friend of a Friend ontology), rule sets in RuleML (Rule Markup Language), etc. Furthermore, as used herein, RDF refers to a family of World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifications originally designed as a metadata data model. It has come to be used as a general method for conceptual description or modeling of information and computations that is implemented in web resources; using a variety of syntax formats.","The basic concept of information space technology provides access to distributed information for various devices within the scope of the cloud, in such a way that the distributed nature of the information is hidden from users and it appears to a user as if all the information exist on the same device. The information spaces also enable a user to have control over information distribution by transferring information between devices that the user has access to. For example, a user may want to transfer information among work devices, home devices, and portable devices, other private and public devices, etc. Furthermore, as computing environments become more and more personalized as well as localized, the need for more sophisticated sharing mechanisms between information spaces increases. These sharing mechanisms while at the outset appear to be simple union and partitioning of the information proved more difficult because of the internal interactions of the information and the semantic structures governing that information. For example, operations such as split (dividing an information space into two or more smaller information spaces), merge (joining two or more information spaces into larger information spaces), projection (extracting information from an information space), injection (adding information to an existing information space), etc. facilitate sharing information among devices.","In one embodiment, cognitive radio enabled communication networks interact with the information spaces of a cloud environment, create mappings between related architectures, find commonalities in order to determine how cognitive radio can fit into wireless mobile environments (e.g., via platform application programming interfaces (APIs) such as core APIs and\/or mobile functionality specific APIs, wherein platform APIs add mobile device features to the standard application development platforms).","In one embodiment, a distributed information space is constituted by different namespaces, wherein a namespace is an abstract environment holding logical groupings of unique identifiers associated with the information space content. In this embodiment, the information associated with cognitive radio (e.g. cognitive radio parameters) may be stored in different namespaces associated with distributed information spaces and the namespaces within the distributed information spaces are accessible to one or more cognitive radio enabled devices so that the cognitive radio enabled devices can use the stored parameters for communication within the wireless environment.","In one embodiment, integrated services and architectures enable the cognitive radio communication networks and other systems such as distributed information spaces and communication spaces in a cloud environment to communicate with each other via a common language. In this way, information spaces or cloud entities can be considered as aggregated information sets from different sources. In one embodiment, this multi-sourcing provides considerable flexibility by enabling the same piece of information to come from different sources.","It is noted that cognitive radio may use any available radio spectrum. For example, in the United States, cognitive radio devices include TV band devices (TVBDs) that can use available TV white space spectrum (or the unused TV spectrum) for communications. To facilitate such use, a cognitive radio database can be created to record uses or applications of the TV white space to ensure that cognitive radio uses do not interfere with other uses of the same radio frequencies (e.g., for TV broadcasts, etc.) In other words, the application of cognitive radio technology to white spaces may provide intelligent combination of the white spaces with other licensed and unlicensed bands to increase total system capacity and reliability. Additionally, cognitive radios can be programmed to select channels with the least congestion, longest range, most robust connection or a combination thereof, which may enable the users to get the most reliability and capacity possible in any situation. Implementing a cognitive radio system in conjunction with the guidance of a central database can significantly improve the efficiency of wireless spectrum. Cognitive radio technologies take TV white space beyond simple database control, thus helping unleash the full potential of white space as a broadband delivery system.","As shown in , one or more user equipment (UEs) -may have access to cognitive radio information via clouds -, which in turn include information spaces -and computation spaces -. By way of example, the cognitive radio information can include, at least in part, a cognitive connectivity white space database architecture, other cognitive connectivity information, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the cognitive radio management platform  provides accessibility to the information via clouds -comprising one or more information spaces, computation spaces, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the clouds -provide means for the UEs -to exchange information with their local surroundings including information associated with cognitive connectivity.","In one embodiment, the cognitive radio information may include and\/or the cognitive radio structure may utilize services provided by the Wireless Universal Resource File (WURFL), which has been developed for presenting information about capabilities and\/or features of a wide variety of wireless devices. However, the information included in the WURFL generally does not include locally determined cognitive radio information. Accordingly, various embodiments of the approach described herein can supplement or otherwise leverage external data sources such as WURFL to provide cognitive radio information.","For example, in one embodiment, the cognitive radio management platform  extracts cognitive radio specific services from the WURFL and moves and\/or translates the cognitive radio parameters into cognitive radio specific expressions (formats), wherein the cognitive radio specific parameters may include location, frequencies, regulations, legislations, etc. or any combination of one or more of these parameters.","In various embodiments, the cognitive radio management platform  may extract cognitive radio parameters via different methods such as sniffing, interrogation, or a combination thereof, wherein sniffing involves scanning the environment, whereas interrogation provides more local and global interactions and selection of user setups. It is noted that sniffing can be considered as a subset of interrogation, since interrogation provides more information.","In one embodiment, the cognitive radio management platform  enables local sharing of the cognitive radio spectrum and UEs -settings. In this embodiment, the clouds -(e.g., information spaces and\/or computation spaces) provide local and global interactions or a combination of the two, where connected and agreed locally. This provides a broader information sharing structure compared to, for example, what WURFL provides. It is noted that cognitive radio structure can utilize WURFL as a service. WURFL may access to  remote backend, providing then direct cognitive radio specific access to device with necessary parameters.","As shown in , the system  comprises sets -of user equipments (UEs) -having connectivity to the cognitive radio management platform  via a communication network . By way of example, the communication network  of system  includes one or more networks such as a data network (not shown), a wireless network (not shown), a telephony network (not shown), or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), a public data network (e.g., the Internet), short range wireless network, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network, and the like, or any combination thereof. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), wireless LAN (WLAN), Bluetooth\u00ae, Internet Protocol (IP) data casting, satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like, or any combination thereof.","The UEs -are any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, notebook computer, netbook computer, tablet computer, personal communication system (PCS) device, personal navigation device, personal digital assistants (PDAs), audio\/video player, digital camera\/camcorder, positioning device, television receiver, radio broadcast receiver, electronic book device, game device, or any combination thereof, including the accessories and peripherals of these devices, or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE  can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.).","By way of example, the UEs -, and the cognitive radio management platform  communicate with each other and other components of the communication network  using well known, new or still developing protocols. In this context, a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network  interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node, from generating and receiving physical signals of various types, to selecting a link for transferring those signals, to the format of information indicated by those signals, to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.","Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises (1) header information associated with a particular protocol, and (2) payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols, the packet includes (3) trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet, its destination, the length of the payload, and other properties used by the protocol. Often, the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different, higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet, typically include a physical (layer ) header, a data-link (layer ) header, an internetwork (layer ) header and a transport (layer ) header, and various application (layer , layer  and layer ) headers as defined by the OSI Reference Model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["103","103","201","203","205","207","209","211"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 8","FIG. 3"],"b":["103","300","301","201","107","107","107","107","111","111","211","113","113","111","111"],"i":["a","i","a","i ","a","n ","a","m ","a","n"]},"In one embodiment, the cognitive radio parameters may provide guidelines and methods for determining other cognitive radio parameters.

The captured parameters can then be analyzed and translated into cognitive radio specific expressions. Alternatively, or additionally, the cognitive radio management platform  may use interrogation methods for cognitive radio parameter interaction, wherein interrogation involves collection of knowledge about occupied channels (e.g. channel numbers, users identities, etc.), informing other entities of the knowledge, providing protocols for negotiation with other entities and negotiating with other entities via certain rules, configurations, etc.","In one embodiment, if step  of  shows that the processing of cognitive radio parameters by the cognitive radio parameters determination module  results in one or more sniffing and\/or interrogation methods, per step  of , the cognitive radio parameters determination module  determines one or more other cognitive radio parameters associated with the one or more locations, one or more other locations, or a combination thereof based of the determined method.","In one embodiment, per step  of , the cognitive radio parameters determination module  stores the one or more cognitive radio parameters (and the one or more other cognitive radio parameters) in at least one information space -, storage , or a combination thereof, wherein the parameters are accessible to one or more cognitive radio enabled UEs -","In one embodiment, per step  of , the policy determination module  determines one or more connectivity policies, one or more privacy policies, one or more security policies, or a combination thereof associated with the determined one or more cognitive radio parameters, the one or more locations, the one or more cognitive radio enabled UEs -, or a combination thereof, wherein access to the at least one cloud -is based, at least in part, on the one or more connectivity policies, the one or more privacy policies, the one or more security policies, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the policies are applied on any information that is being shared between and\/or accessed by UEs -, clouds -, etc. The policies may be defined by the users of UEs -, by cloud management entities (not shown) information\/service providers (not shown), or a combination thereof. For example, location related policies may provide instructions on information extraction at the location, information preservation at the location, and information sharing methods among various devices at the location.","In one embodiment, per step  of , the cognitive radio management platform  accesses the at least one information spaces -of the clouds -based on the connectivity policies, the privacy policies, the security policies or a combination thereof.","In one embodiment, per step  of , the device capability determination module  processes and\/or facilitates processing of the at least one accessed information spaces -to determine one or more capabilities of the one or more cognitive radio enabled UEs -, wherein an operation of at least one of the one or more cognitive radio enabled UEs -is based, at least in part, on the one or more capabilities.","In one embodiment, per step  of , the device capabilities determination module , verifies whether device capabilities may be extracted from any external data sources associated with clouds -.

For example device runs SIB which represents information space and at the same time runs the SIB that represents information space ","The system can be implemented on various platforms including mobile devices, personal computers, etc. The main requirement of such implementation platforms is that the devices support the runtime environments and that enough processing power and storage is available. Given that knowledge processors -can be distributed over devices with more processing power and\/or storage as necessary, usually smaller hand-held devices are adequate for running these knowledge processors.","In one embodiment, a SIB -may run on systems supporting the Python runtime environment and additionally versions for C++ specifically exist for Linux\/Unix and Open-C for Symbian operating system, the most widely used open operating system for mobile phones.

RDF has come to be used as a general method for conceptual description or modeling of information that is implemented in web resources; using a variety of syntax formats. The underlying structure of any expression in RDF is a collection of triples, each consisting of three disjoint sets of nodes including a subject, a predicate and an object. A subject is an RDF Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) reference (U) or a Blank Node (B), a predicate is an RDF URI reference (U), and an object is an RDF URI reference (U), a literal (L) or a Blank Node (B).

Insertion and retractions may be combined into a single transactional structure in order to admit atomic updates through the atomic application of retract and insert. All other forms of operations are constructions and refinements of the above. For example, update is constructed out of a set of retracts and inserts. Further rewrite rules can simplify the recurrent application of operations.","In one embodiment, a query is evaluated based on the current snapshot of the information in the information space -. Queries can be performed by Wilbur query language (WQL) or simple RDF triple pattern matching. WQL is a lisp-like path based query language. One important difference between WQL and RDF triple pattern matching is that Wilbur's static reasoning engine only runs with WQL queries. WQL queries return a set of RDF graph nodes, while the pattern queries return an RDF graph. Furthermore, other query languages such as SPARQL are also supported.","In another embodiment, subscriptions are implemented as persistent queries, that is, a given query is evaluated whenever the information in the information space -changes, and thus the same methods are available.
