{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["An enterprise (e.g., company, educational organization, government agency, etc.) typically includes various machines, including computers, storage systems, communications devices, and so forth. The machines include various resources that are accessible by and can be shared by the users in the enterprise. Examples of resources include processing resources, storage resources, communications resources, software resources, and so forth.","An information technology (IT) department of an enterprise typically has a poor understanding of which users are using which resources. In some cases, an IT department may manually perform a census to identify users of particular resources in the enterprise. However, such a manual census technique is time-consuming and expensive.","In accordance with some embodiments, a summarization mechanism is provided to automatically generate a summary of users that have accessed certain resources within an enterprise, (e.g., company, educational organization, government agency, etc.). Examples of resources of the enterprise include processing resources, storage resources, communications resources, software resources, and so forth. In one example, the enterprise may provide one or more server computers on which software applications are loaded, where users at client computers are able to access the server computers to utilize such software applications. Also, storage server systems can also be present that provide storage resources accessible by users for storing data and other information. Communications devices can also be present in the enterprise that provide communications capabilities to allow users in the enterprise to perform communications, such as voice calls, video conferencing sessions, and so forth. Other examples of resources include services provided by machines, files, web resources, file directories, file trees, file groups, and so forth.","Typically, an information technology (IT) department of an enterprise has a relatively poor understanding of which users are accessing certain resources within the enterprise. Conventionally, an IT department may attempt to perform a manual census to determine which users are using what resources, which is typically time-consuming and relatively expensive. However, by using the summarization mechanism according to some embodiments, an automated technique is provided of generating summaries of users that have accessed particular resources in the enterprise. A \u201csummary\u201d refers to any human-understandable report, visualization, or other representation that contains information of interest to the intended recipient of the summary.","For a given resource (where \u201cresource\u201d can refer to one resource or a collection of resources), the summarization mechanism is able to receive information indicating a set of users that have accessed the resource. The summary that is generated by the summarization mechanism according to some embodiments identifies less than all (a subset) of the users in the set that have accessed the resource. In other words, instead of merely identifying all users who have accessed the resource, the summary identifies some subset of the users to provide a more meaningful summarization. Identification of users in the summary includes identifying one or more groups of users, where each group is represented by a human-recognizable name (e.g., sales group of product X, design group for product Y, Sally Z's group, marketing department, accounting department, etc.). A human-recognizable name of a group may be a name that allows a user to recognize the function, role, or other characteristic of the group within the enterprise based on the name. In addition to identifying one or more groups of users, the summary can also identify individual users. For example, the summary can indicate that users who have accessed application B on machine C include personnel in the sales group for product X as well as Tom J. (who is not in the sales group for product X).","The summaries that provide information about who uses what resources within an enterprise have various applications. For example, if the IT department has to take a particular resource down for preventative maintenance, then the IT department can determine (from one or more summaries created by the summarization mechanism) which users to notify (e.g., notify everyone in the marketing department). Another example involves electronic discovery for litigation, where the legal department may wish to find and preserve data stored or used by a particular group of users. Other example uses of the summaries include determining from the summaries how many servers are used by the manufacturing department, the amount of data accessed in a typical day by the marketing department, and so forth. Also, based on the summaries, it can be determined whether any particular resource can be removed or decommissioned. As yet another example, the summary(ies) can be used to determine which employees are backing up their data. As another example, the summaries can be used to determine what a machine is used for (e.g., hosts a sharepoint for the marketing department) and what type of data the machine has (e.g., it is used by the legal department so it probably holds legal documents).","The summarization mechanism according to some embodiments monitors communications between user machines (such as user computers, personal digital assistants, smart phones, etc.) and machines containing resources that are accessed by the user machines. In addition, the summarization mechanism accesses information that identifies groups of users. Based on the monitored communications and information identifying groups of users, the summarization mechanism is able to generate one or more summaries of which users are using what resources. The summarization mechanism allows association between users and corresponding resources to be obtained on a continual basis, and in a relatively inexpensive manner.","In one embodiment, the information that identifies groups of users can be in the form of an organization chart that identifies various departments, divisions, or other groups within the enterprise, and the personnel that are within such corresponding departments, divisions, or other groups. The personnel of the enterprise that are within such groups are referred to as \u201cusers\u201d in this discussion.","In an alternative embodiment, the group information that is used by the summarization mechanism can be one or more email distribution lists, where an email distribution list can include user-defined groups (e.g., sales group for product X, design group for product Y, production group for product Z, etc.). The email distribution lists can reside on user machines, or alternatively, at server computers (such as email server computers). Instead of email distribution lists, the summarization mechanism can employ information identifying text chat or text messaging groups, or other types of communication distribution lists used for other types of communications among users.","Alternatively, instead of relying on groups explicitly defined in email distribution list(s) or other like group indications, the mechanism according to some embodiments can monitor emails (or other types of communications) among the personnel of the enterprise, and based on such monitoring, the enterprise can determine groups of personnel that usually communicate with each other about certain issues (e.g., particular products, particular issues, etc.). This process is referred to as mining communications among users for determining groups of users who communicate with each other.","Other information that can identify groups of users includes access control lists. An access control list specifies a list of users that are allowed to access a particular file. Also, information can be provided that indicates which users are located where (e.g., users in a particular building or floor of a building).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","102","104"]},"The analysis server computer  includes a summarization module  according to an embodiment for summarizing users who are using corresponding resources deployed on machines of an enterprise. The summarization module  can be implemented as a software module that is executable on one or multiple central processing units (CPUs) . The CPU(s)  is (are) connected to a storage subsystem , which can be implemented with disk-based storage, semiconductor storage, and so forth. The storage subsystem  includes group information , with some examples being an organization chart , email distribution list(s) , and mined email groups  (which have been derived based on monitored email communications among users of the enterprise). In other implementations, instead of or in addition to the email distribution list(s)  and mined email group(s) , other types of communication distribution lists or mined communication groups can be provided.","The organizational chart  can be retrieved by the analysis server computer  from a predetermined server (or predetermined servers), such as a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server or other type of server. LDAP defines a protocol for querying and modifying directory services, where a directory is a set of objects with similar attributes organized in a logical and hierarchical manner.","The summarization module  is able to receive information relating to monitored communications between user machines and machines  that are accessed by the user machines. Alternatively, the received information relates to monitored communications between user machines and corresponding resources  of the machines . Such information relating to monitored communications is stored as monitored information  in the storage  of the analysis server computer . The analysis server computer  uses the monitored information  and the group information  to generate at least one summary  that identifies users that have accessed a resource.","In one implementation, the summarization module  is able to compile relationships between users and specific machines. For example, if the client computer of user A has established a communications session with machine X, then the summarization module  determines that user A has accessed machine X, and records that information.","In addition or alternatively, the summarization module  can associate users with resources provided by a machine. A list of resources on each given machine can be compiled based on protocols, ports (including well-known mappings between specific port numbers and services), and processes used to communicate with the machine. For example, if user A has established a communications session with machine X using port , then it can be determined that machine X is running an NFS server. By identifying the resources on each machine and monitoring users accessing such resources, the summarization module  is also able to compile a relationship between users and resources on the machine. For example, it may be that user A but not user B uses the NFS server on machine X, so that there will be a relationship between user A and (machine X, NFS) but no relationship between user B and (machine X, NFS).","As another example, the summarization module  can also associate resources such as files, file directories, websites, etc., with users. The summarization module  may be able to track a path name or URL that has been accessed to determine which files each user is using, or more coarsely, which parts of the file system\/website the user is using. The summarization module  may also be able to distinguish between reads and writes of file systems so as to distinguish between files a user writes and those the user merely reads.","In addition to identify user access of internal resources of the enterprise, the summarization module  may also identify what users are accessing external resources (outside the enterprise).","The monitored information  received by the analysis server computer  is communicated over the network . In one embodiment, the monitored information  is collected by monitoring agents  in respective client computers . The monitoring agent  in a client computer  monitors communications between the client computer  and resources in the enterprise, and stores such monitored information as  in a storage  of the client computer . The monitoring agent  is executable on one or more CPUs  of the client computer . The monitored information  collected by each monitoring agent  is sent over the network  to the analysis server computer .","In an alternative implementation, instead of using the monitoring agents  to monitor communications between client computers  and the machines accessed by clients , monitoring agents can be provided in switches, routers, or other types of communications devices in the network , such as monitoring agent  or  in a switch  or router , respectively, in the network . Alternatively, the monitoring agent  or  can be provided on another machine in the enterprise.","In one example, the monitoring agent , , or  depicted in  can be combined with a firewall agent to make packet inspections cheaper to perform.","As further depicted in , each client computer  includes a network interface  and the analysis server computer  includes a network interface  The network interfaces  and  allow the client computer  to communicate over the network  with the analysis server computer .","The types of information that can be recorded by a monitoring agent (e.g., , , or ) include one or more of the following: an identification of a resource (e.g., a machine, application, file, a requested uniform resource locator (URL) or file identifier, etc.) that the client computer  is communicating with\/requesting; the protocol that is used, such as a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Data Protocol (UDP); the port that is used (e.g., a port number  can indicate that a network file system (NFS) resource is being used while a port number  can indicate that a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) resource is being used, for example); the process that is performing a communication (e.g., a file transfer protocol (FTP) process); the direction of the connection (which machine established the connection with the other machine); the direction in which the majority of data bytes is transmitted; credential or other user identification information (e.g., a username); and so forth.","If a client computer  is shared among multiple users, then the monitoring agent is able to distinguish which user is requesting which communication. This can be performed, for example, by assuming that the user logged in at the client computer  performs all communications.","For each resource, the summarization module  generates a summary of the users accessing that resource. The summarization module  attempts to generate a short, concise summary that will be understandable to most employees in the enterprise. Simply generating a list of the names of all the users, by contrast, is neither understandable nor useful in practice. What is an IT manager to do with a list of 600 names of people the IT manager does not recognize? Instead, the summarization module  uses human-recognizable group names to replace the names of the users in those groups. Thus, the 600 names might be reduced to \u201cThe North American Eastern region sales team and the Massachusetts IT team,\u201d which is both short and meaningful to employees.","Note that this technique only works with groups with short names or descriptions that are recognizable by employees. Such groups can be found in organization charts (\u201cthe North American Eastern region sales team\u201d), email distribution lists (\u201cengineers@acme.widget\u201d), site population lists (\u201cpeople in building 20\u201d), etc. In general, arbitrary sets of users are very unlikely to form such a group.","Some approximation is usually performed to achieve such concise summaries; probably not every member of the North American Eastern region sales team used the resource but if 95% of the North American Eastern region sales team used the resource and 80% of the Massachusetts IT team used the resource and no one else used the resource, then this is probably a good concise summary of the usage. If desired, the percentages can be included as follows: \u201cThe North American Eastern region sales team (95%) and the Massachusetts IT team (80%).\u201d","There is a tension between accuracy (not omitting users that use a resource or including users that don't use the resource) and conciseness. Listing a larger number of smaller groups and individual people increases accuracy at the cost of making the summary longer than using fewer, larger groups and individual people.","There are a number of possible techniques for generating such a summary. One technique involves using the organization chart  to find the lowest (in the sense of farthest away from the chief executive officer or head of the enterprise) group that includes all the accessing users except possibly for a few outliers (the outliers may be listed separately). More generally, the algorithm used by the summarization module  may be configured to find a group of users that is as small as possible that cover all users that have accessed a particular resource, but includes as few non-users (users who have not accessed the particular resource) as possible.","More generally still, this problem can be turned into an optimization problem, where the goal is to maximize the total sums of rewards and penalties. A penalty can be assessed for each group or individual name included in the summary and for each non-user of the resource covered by the summary, and by assigning a reward for each user of the resource covered by the summary. By assigning different weights to these cases, different trade-offs between conciseness and accuracy can be made. For example, if conciseness is valued much more than accuracy, the penalties for making the summary longer (extra group and individual names) can be made much more severe than the penalties and rewards for covering the wrong users. In some embodiments, the penalties may be nonlinear: each additional group name may incur a steadily increasing penalty, for example.","Note that the set of groups considered is restricted to groups with human-recognizable names as discussed above. The penalties\/rewards may also in some embodiments depend on properties of the users. For example, in a summary intended to be used to understand who the heaviest users of a resource are, the penalty\/reward of a group or user might be greater the more that group or user used the resource. By using this technique, the accuracy of the membership of \u201cimportant people\u201d can be increased at the cost of the accuracy of \u201cunimportant people\u201d, while keeping conciseness the same.","Other ways of formulating this optimization problem are possible; for example, instead of rewarding\/penalizing which users are covered directly, a penalty\/reward might be given for the percentages of coverage of each of the group\/names. This allows larger groups to get more absolute members' membership wrong because only their percentage wrong is being considered.","Other embodiments might permit the summary to list excluded group or individual names in addition to included group or individual names. This would allow for summaries like \u201cThe North American Eastern region sales team except for the Vermont sales team and the Massachusetts IT team except for Bob Shaw.\u201d Appropriate penalties would have to be defined for such names; because exclusions are usually harder to understand than inclusions, they should probably have a higher penalty than included group or individual names.","This optimization problem can be solved using one of the many techniques, such as linear programming, constraint programming, or heuristics like genetic algorithms and simulated annealing.","The information regarding who uses what resource evolves over time. Historical records of such information can be maintained to use for such applications as electronic discovery for litigation, where knowing which machines employees have used in the past can be quite valuable. The information can also keep track of how often, how recently, and what time of day a given employee has accessed a given resource. In some embodiments, an association between a user and a resource can be sufficiently old (in the past) such that this association is considered obsolete.","Also, for certain user-resource pairs, it may be desirable to distinguish between incidental use and heavy use. For example, incidental access of a resource can be disregarded when generating a summary.","In addition, temporal information can also be kept about when the communications occur. For example, it may be possible to observe network meetings (e.g., a meeting conducted using Microsoft's NetMeeting software), and which employees attend such network meetings. The summarization module  can generate a summary that summarizes the participants of the meetings (along with the times of such meetings).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["106","104","106","202","120","120","100","102"]},"The summarization module  also receives (at ) group information  () that identifies groups to which users of the enterprise belong.","Based on the received monitored information and the group information, summarization module  generates (at ) one or more summaries that each identify users that have used a particular resource (where \u201cresource\u201d can be a single resource or collection of resources). As noted above, each summary identifies at least one group of users that have accessed the resource, where the group has a human-recognizable name. The summary can also identify outlier users who are not part of the at least one group.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["106","301","120","106","106","302"]},"Another criterion specifies that communications sessions made only during a boot or login process can be ignored. Such communications sessions can be marked as system connections. Such system connections are likely to be connections that relate to antivirus definition updates, checking for up-to-date patches, and so forth.","Alternatively, an application programming interface (API) may be provided by a monitoring agent that allows the system to inform the monitoring agent that a particular communications session is a system connection that should be ignored.","An IT administrator can also specify that any communications session established with a particular list of machines, list of (machine, resource) pairs, list of ports, or list of processes can be ignored.","The above filtering criteria can be applied by a monitoring agent.","Filtering applied by the analysis server computer  can include the following. Any resource that every employee establishes communications with (once) is likely to be uninteresting. Any resource that each employee talks to at most one time is likely to be uninteresting. IT personnel may audit communications sessions and mark some of them as uninteresting or particularly interesting. These labeled training examples can be used as inputs for machine learning algorithms, which can be applied to build classifiers to automatically infer such labels for non-audited communications sessions. The classifiers can be used to automatically mark communications sessions as uninteresting or interesting. It may be desirable to collect additional information about each communications session (e.g., time information) to provide additional features for the classifiers to work on.","Similarly, in cases where which service is being used is uncertain (e.g., such as in scenarios where many services share the same port number), auditing and labeling by a classifier can increase the accuracy of service guesses.","The filtering applied (at ) produces a reduced list of users that have accessed each given resource. For corresponding multiple resources, there may be multiple reduced lists provided. The reduced list of users for a given resource includes a smaller number of users than the universe of all users who have accessed the given resource, due to application of the filtering. After filtering has been applied, the summarization module  generates (at ) weights that represent relative usage of a particular resource among respective users. Some users may more heavily use (e.g., larger amount of data transferred, longer session time, etc.) the particular resource than other users. Weights can be assigned based on such relative usage, with certain users assigned higher weights (to represent heavier usage) and other users assigned lower weights (to represent lighter usage). Some exemplary factors considered in assigning weights include one or more of: frequency of usage of the resource, recency of usage of the resource, and amount of usage of the resource. Moreover, if it is known that a particular user or group of users owns a given resource, then their use of that resource may receive greater weight. Generally, the weights associated with users represent relative importance of usage of the resource by corresponding users. As yet another alternative, weights can be assigned based on the specified purpose of the summary. For example, a user can specify what the summary is to be used for, such as by making a selection from a number of menu items or by turning a knob in a graphical user interface. The specified purpose of the summary can affect the weights assigned.","The weights can be provided in the reduced list for the given resource, to provide a weighted list for each given resource.","The summarization module  also receives (at ) group information  () to identify groups of users in the enterprise. Then, based on the group information and the weighted list of users, the summarization module  generates (at ) a summary for the given resource. In generating the summary based on the weighted list, the summarization module  can attempt to identify a group that contains as many users associated with higher weights as possible\u2014the users associated with lower weights that are not part of the group can be considered outliers who can be individually identified in the summary.","In some implementations, a summary created by the summarization module  can also include weights associated with corresponding users. A summary can indicate that the given resource is used by group G plus 20 incidental other users, rather than just 23 unrelated users. Or, with the previous example, the summary might indicate that the given resource is used 70% of the time by the North American Eastern region sales team and 30% of the time by the Massachusetts IT team.","Additional data provided by IT personnel can also be used in producing the summary produced by the summarization module . For example, it may be known which services are using which ports on a given machine, to avoid the possibility of a wrong guess about which service a particular port on the machine represents. Alternatively, additional information about a particular service on a given machine may be available beyond the name of that service\u2014this information can be attached to any resulting communications session for use in later producing summaries or for viewing.","Instructions of software described above (including the summarization module  and monitoring agents , ,  of ) are loaded for execution on a processor (such as one or more CPUs ,  in ). The processor includes microprocessors, microcontrollers, processor modules or subsystems (including one or more microprocessors or microcontrollers), or other control or computing devices. As used here, a \u201ccontroller\u201d refers to hardware, software, or a combination thereof. A \u201ccontroller\u201d can refer to a single component or to plural components (whether software or hardware).","Data and instructions (of the software) are stored in respective storage devices, which are implemented as one or more computer-readable or computer-usable storage media.
