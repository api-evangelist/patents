title: Self-retracting fully compliant bistable micromechanism
abstract: A micromechanism () with two unique, stable configurations is disclosed. The micromechanism () has a base member () and a shuttle () designed to move in linear fashion. The shuttle () is coupled to the base member () via a coupling () in which flexible members () are placed under axial tension in addition to bending. The coupling () also has a compressive member () that is compressed as the flexible members () are placed in tension. The shuttle () has a displacement between the stable configurations that is suitable for use with thermomechanical microactuators and microswitching applications. Such a micromechanism may have multiple couplings (), which may be disposed on either side of the shuttle () and may be attached to multiple base members (). An electric return signal may be applied to the micromechanism to thermally relax the couplings (), thereby promoting the micromechanism () to return from the second stable configuration to the first stable configuration. Alternatively, a separate return actuator may be used.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","TECHNICAL BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is the National Stage of International Application PCT\/US02\/18769, filed Jun. 14, 2002, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 60\/298,789, filed Jun. 15, 2001, and this application is a continuation-in-part of International Application PCT\/US01\/22661, filed Jul. 18, 2001 and a continuation-in-part of International Application PCT\/US01\/28614, filed Sep. 12, 2001.","This invention was made with government support under Grant Numbers DMI-9624574, DMI-9980835, and CMS-9978737, awarded by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present method and apparatus relates to dual positions mechanisims. More particularly, the invention relates to small displacement complaint bistable mechanisims with self retraction capability.","The term \u201ccompliant mechanisms\u201d relates to a family of devices in which integrally formed flexural members provide motion through deflection. Such flexural members may therefore be used to replace conventional multi-part elements such as pin joints. Compliant mechanisms provide several benefits, including backlash-free, wear-free, and friction-free operation. Moreover, compliant mechanisms significantly reduce manufacturing time and cost. Compliant mechanisms can replace many conventional devices to improve functional characteristics and decrease manufacturing costs. Assembly may, in some cases, be obviated entirely because compliant structures often consist of a single piece of material.","In microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), compliant technology allows each mechanism of a MEMS system to be an integrally formed, single piece mechanism. Because MEMS devices are typically made by a layering and etching process, elements in different layers must normally be etched and formed separately from each other. Additionally, elements with complex shapes, such as pin joints, require multiple steps and layers to create the pin, the head, the pin-mounting joint, and the gap between the pin and the surrounding ring used to form the joint. Due to the limitations of the manufacturing processes involved, the resulting pin joint often will have excessive clearance between the shaft and the hole, thereby providing excessive slop in the joint.","An integrally formed compliant mechanism, on the other hand, may be constructed as a single piece, and may even be constructed in unitary fashion with other elements of the micromechanism. Substantially all elements of many compliant devices may be made from a single layer. Reducing the number of layers, in many cases, simplifies the manufacturing and design of MEMS devices. Compliant technology also has unique advantages in MEMS applications because compliant mechanisms can be manufactured unitarily, i.e., from a single continuous piece of material, using masking and etching procedures similar to those used to form semiconductors. In certain cases, semiconductors and associated MEMS devices may even be manufactured simultaneously on the same chip.","In MEMS as well as in other applications, there exists a need for \u201cbistable devices,\u201d or devices that can be selectively disposed in either of two different, stable configurations. Bistable devices can be used in a number of different mechanisms, including switches, valves, clasps, and closures. Switches, for example, often have two separate states: on and off. However, most conventional switches are constructed of rigid elements that are connected by hinges, and therefore do not obtain the benefits of compliant technology. Compliant bistable mechanisms have particular utility in a MEMS environment, in which electrical and\/or mechanical switching at a microscopic level is desirable, and in which conventional methods used to assemble rigid body structures are ineffective.","Many mechanisms that are currently envisioned for applications such as microswitching are not truly bistable because they are not able to independently remain in two distinct positions. More precisely, such mechanisms often require the presence of a constant excitation voltage, or continuous pressure from an actuator, to keep them in one of the positions.","Furthermore, many known dual position MEMS devices have a displacement that is either too small or too large for a number of applications that require dual position motion. For example, it is desirable for a switch to have a displacement large enough to separate electrical conductors enough to ensure that arcing does not occur when the switch is open (i.e., in the \u201coff\u201d position). It is also desirable for the switch to have a displacement small enough to minimize the energy required to move the switch from one state to another. Many known devices do not provide sufficient electrical isolation when the switch is open, or require excessive voltage to operate. Many effective actuators have a comparatively small displacement, and are therefore incapable of moving a large displacement dual position mechanism without the use of some type of transmission. Often, bistable mechanisms often require a footprint that is excessive in relation to their displacement.","Yet further, known dual position MEMS devices typically require the use of multiple actuators. For example, many such devices require an actuator to move the device from a first position to a second position, and a second actuator to move the device from the second position back to the first position. The additional actuator requires processing time and space on the chip, thereby adding to the cost and volume of the microswitch.","Consequently, it would be an advancement in the art to provide a fully compliant MEMS device with true bistability, i.e., the ability to independently remain in either of two distinct positions. Furthermore, it would be an advancement in the art to provide a compact bistable MEMS device with a displacement that more closely corresponds with the specifications and requirements of microactuators and applications such as switching. Yet further, it would be an advancement in the art to provide a bistable MEMS device capable of independently moving from one position to another upon receipt of an electric signal.","The present invention provides a micromechanism with true bistability, i.e., with a first stable configuration and a second stable configuration. In certain embodiments, the invention also provides a bistable micromechanism with a size and displacement suitable for use with thermomechanical actuators and switching contacts. According to some embodiments, the invention provides a bistable mechanism capable of self-retraction, i.e., motion from one stable configuration to another through the direct application of thermal energy to the micromechanism. Associated microswitches and couplings are also presented herein, in accordance with the invention.","According to one embodiment, a bistable micromechanism has a base member and a shuttle designed to translate with respect to the base member. The shuttle simply translates against a backing member, which helps restrain motion of the shuttle to a straight line. The base member is coupled to the shuttle via a coupling that is integrally formed with the shuttle and the base member, so that the micromechanism is fully compliant. More precisely, the base member has a longitudinal portion arrayed along the direction of motion of the shuttle and a lateral extension that extends toward the shuttle. The shuttle has a longitudinal portion generally parallel to the longitudinal portion of the base member and a lateral extension that extends toward the base member.","The coupling has a first flexible segment that extends from the lateral extension of the base member in a direction generally away from the shuttle. Similarly, a second flexible segment of the coupling extends from the lateral extension of the shuttle in a direction generally away from the base member. Each of the flexible segments has a small thickness so that the flexible segments can flex in a manner that generally approximates a pin joint. The flexible segments are also connected to opposite ends of a compressive segment, which has a much larger thickness.","The geometry of the coupling is such that the coupling approximates the motion of a rigid body double slider mechanism when the slider moves with respect to the base member. A pseudo-rigid body model (PRBM) may be used to analyze the motion and energy storage characteristics of the coupling.","According to the PRBM, each of the flexible segments acts as a pin joint with an attached torsional spring that simulates the restorative force of the flexible segment. The pin joint\/torsional spring combination of the second flexible segment is coupled to a slider to model the linear motion of the shuttle. According to the rigid body model, the pin joint\/torsional spring combinations of the flexible segments are coupled to extensions that extend into the body of the compressive segment. Collinear compression segments extend toward each other from each of the extensions and converge at a linear spring. The linear spring simulates axial compression and\/or bending of the compressive segment.","When the micromechanism is in the first stable configuration, the shuttle is in a first position. When the micromechanism is in the second stable configuration, the shuttle is in a second position. The coupling is formed in an undeflected position; this position is the first stable configuration of the micromechanism. Aside from any residual stresses incident to manufacture, the flexible segments and the compressive segment are unloaded and undeflected. In response to some external force, the shuttle moves in linear fashion with respect to the first base member. The flexible segments bend and elongate, and the compressive segment is compressed. This energy storage is represented in the PRBM by torque exerted by the torsional springs and axial pressure exerted by the linear spring.","Continued motion of the shuttle results in the storage of additional strain energy by the coupling until the compressive segment reaches its most deflected position. Additional shuttle motion results in relaxation of the compressive load on the compressive segment and the tensile loads on the flexible segments, with additional torsional loading of the flexible segments. The micromechanism reaches an unstable equilibrium configuration in which the axial forces of the compressive segment and the flexible segments are balanced against the torques produced by bending of the flexible segments. This balanced configuration may be referred to as an unstable equilibrium position of the micromechanism because perturbation of the shuttle in either direction will commence releasing the stored strain energy to bring the micromechanism to either the first stable configuration or the second stable configuration.","In the unstable equilibrium configuration, the shuttle is in what may be called an unstable position. Further motion of the shuttle toward the second position results in a release of some of the stored strain energy of the coupling, which brings the shuttle to the second position without further external actuation. The micromechanism is then in the second stable configuration, in which the flexible segments store considerable strain energy via bending, but the axial loading of the flexible segments and the compressive segment is somewhat relaxed.","Storage of strain energy in the second stable configuration enables relatively easy actuation of the micromechanism from the second stable configuration back to the unstable equilibrium configuration, and thence back to the first stable configuration. Thus, the force required to \u201creturn\u201d the micromechanism, or move it from the second stable configuration to the first stable configuration, is somewhat less than the force required for the original actuation from the first stable configuration to the second stable configuration. This characteristic facilitates self-returning of the micromechanism.","More precisely, the micromechanism may be moved from the second stable configuration to the unstable equilibrium configuration by applying an electric return signal through the micromechanism. Since the micromechanism is only semi-conductive, electric current traveling through the micromechanism encounters resistance and provides resistive heating, or \u201cjoule heating.\u201d Because the flexible segments are the thinnest portions of the micromechanism, the heating effect is focused on the flexible segments. The flexible segments elongate in response to the joule heating, thereby relaxing the tension on the flexible segments and the compression on the compressive segment. As a result, the strain energy caused by bending of the flexible segments becomes dominant, and causes the shuttle to move such that the micromechanism moves from the second stable configuration to the unstable equilibrium configuration, and thence back to the first stable configuration.","A similar micromechanism may be used in conjunction with other components to form a microswitch. The microswitch has a pair of electrically conductive contacts, an actuator, and a connector in addition to the micromechanism. The micromechanism may be symmetrical, with base members and couplings disposed on either side of a central shuttle. Thus, no backing member is needed. The micromechanism has four couplings, each of which is configured in a manner similar to that of the previous embodiment.","The actuator is a thermomechanical in-plane microactuator (TIM). The TIM also has first and second base members disposed on either side of a central shuttle. Additionally, the TIM has a plurality of legs that extend from each of the base members to the shuttle. The legs are disposed at an angle slightly offset from perpendicularity with the base members and the shuttle. In response to the passage of electric current through the TIM, the legs elongate, thereby urging the shuttle of the TIM toward the shuttle of the micromechanism.","The connector couples the shuttle of the TIM to the shuttle of the micromechanism in a manner that ensures that the shuttles will always remain aligned. More precisely, the connector has a micromechanism prong and a micromechanism plate attached to the shuttle of the micromechanism. Additionally, the connector has a pair of actuator prongs and an actuator plate attached to the actuator. The actuator prongs are disposed on either lateral side of the micromechanism prong, thereby ensuring that the shuttles of the actuator and micromechanism do not become laterally offset from each other. The actuator plate and the mechanism plate prevent the micromechanism prong from moving transversely, i.e., out of the plane of the wafer, with respect to the actuator prongs. Thus, the shuttles are constrained to remain aligned by the connector.","When the TIM receives the electric actuation signal, the actuator shuttle moves toward the micromechanism shuttle, and the actuator plate abuts the micromechanism plate. The TIM exerts force on the micromechanism shuttle until the micromechanism shuttle has moved beyond the unstable position, and the micromechanism shuttle then continues to move toward the second position without requiring further force from the TIM. Prior to reaching the second position, the micromechanism shuttle abuts the contacts. The shuttle has a conductive end, which then provides electrical communication between the contacts. Since the micromechanism is unable to reach the second stable configuration, the shuttle exerts a constant force against the contacts, which tends to enhance the conduction between the contacts and the conductive end of the shuttle.","The microswitch is then in the closed, or \u201con\u201d position. When the microswitch is to be turned off again, the micromechanism receives an electric return signal that induces elongation of the flexible segments of the couplings, thereby moving the shuttle back to the first position in the manner described previously. The conductive end of the shuttle is removed from the contacts, thereby once again electrically isolating the contacts from each other.","According to one alternative embodiment, a microswitch need not be self-retuning, but may be returned to the first stable configuration through the use of a return actuator. For example, a return actuator is added to the previous embodiment in such a manner that the return actuator is able to press the micromechanism shuttle away from the contacts. The return actuator comprises a thermomechanical in-plane microactuator (TIM) similar to the actuator. The return actuator has a shuttle that extends generally between the contacts.","When the microswitch is in the closed configuration, the electric return signal is applied to the return actuator so that the shuttle of the return actuator presses the shuttle of the micromechanism away from the contacts. The return actuator continues to exert force on the shuttle of the micromechanism until the micromechanism shuttle has moved beyond the unstable position. The micromechanism shuttle then moves without the requirement of additional return force to the first position, thereby disposing the micromechanism in the first stable configuration and the switch in the open configuration. Such a return actuation system may provide enhanced operating life.","The micromechanisms, microswitches, and couplings disclosed herein may function substantially in-plane, which entails operation of each component within a single plane. Thus, the micromechanism may be made through film deposition methods similar to those used to construct flat circuits. In fact, a micromechanism according to the invention may even be made simultaneously and unitarily with a circuit so that production can be economically and rapidly carried out. Single layer or multiple layer processes may be used.","The micromechanisms of the invention also provide true bistability in that they are able to stay in each of two configurations without the presence of any continuous activation signal or external actuation force. They have size and displacement characteristics that are suited for use with thermomechanical or electrostatic microactuators, and for use in switching applications. Furthermore, in certain embodiments, they can be moved from a second stable configuration back to a first stable configuration without requiring an additional return actuator.","The purpose, function, and advantages of the present mechanism will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or may be learned by the practice of the invention as set forth hereinafter.","The present apparatus and method will be best understood by reference to the drawings, wherein like parts and steps are designated by like numerals throughout. It will be readily understood that the components of the present mechanism, as generally described and illustrated in the Figures herein, could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following detailed description of the embodiments of the apparatus and method, as represented in the Figures, are not intended to limit the scope of the claim, but are merely representative of present embodiments of the apparatus and method.","For this application, the phrases \u201cconnected to,\u201d \u201ccoupled to,\u201d and \u201cin communication with\u201d refer to any form of interaction between two or more entities, including mechanical, electrical, magnetic, electromagnetic, and thermal interaction. The phrase \u201cattached to\u201d refers to a form of mechanical coupling that restricts relative translation or rotation between the attached objects. The phrases \u201cpivotally attached to\u201d and \u201cslidably attached to\u201d refer to forms of mechanical coupling that permit relative rotation or relative translation, respectively, while restricting other relative motion.","The phrase \u201cattached directly to\u201d refers to a form of attachment by which the attached items are either in direct contact, or are only separated by a single fastener, adhesive, or other attachment mechanism. The term \u201cabutting\u201d refers to items that are in direct physical contact with each other, although the items may not be attached together.","Referring to , one example of a bistable micromechanism , or micromechanism , is shown in a first stable configuration. The micromechanism  is sized for MEMS applications. Although many of the examples presented herein apply to MEMS applications, the present invention is not limited to MEMS, but is rather applicable to compliant mechanisms in general.","The exemplary micromechanism  of  is a bistable micromechanism, or a MEMS device that can be actuated between two stable configurations. The micromechanism  may be used to perform microswitching functions or the like. The micromechanism  may have a longitudinal direction , a lateral direction , and a transverse or out-of-plane direction . The micromechanism  is formed through the use of a multi-layer process such as MUMPS, and may therefore have components on multiple planes in the transverse direction . In the alternative, a bistable micromechanism may have a substantially planar configuration, e.g., all parts of the mechanism may have substantially the same thickness and positioning in the transverse direction .","As shown in , the micromechanism  has a base member  and a shuttle  designed to move in the longitudinal direction  with respect to the base member . In , the micromechanism  is in the first stable configuration, and the shuttle  is in a first position that corresponds to the first stable configuration.","The micromechanism  also has a backing member  against which the shuttle  slides; the backing member  keeps the shuttle  from moving significantly in the lateral direction . The base member  and the shuttle  are coupled together by a coupling  that stores potential energy in such a manner that the micromechanism  has two unique, stable configurations separated by an unstable equilibrium configuration. The manner in which the coupling  acts to provide bistable operation will be described in greater detail subsequently.","As shown in , the base member  has a longitudinal portion  oriented generally along the longitudinal direction  and a lateral extension  that extends generally in the lateral direction  from the longitudinal portion . The coupling  is coupled to the lateral extension  at an anchoring point  on the lateral extension . Similarly, the shuttle  has a longitudinal portion  oriented generally along the longitudinal direction  and a lateral extension  that extends generally in the lateral direction  from the longitudinal portion . The coupling  is coupled to an anchoring point  on the lateral extension .","In compliant mechanisms, small-length flexural pivots are thin cross-sectioned segments that replace traditional pivotal joints while still allowing the joint to be mathematically modeled as a traditional pivotal joint. Small-length flexural pivots bend along their length to allow other elements of a micromechanism to move relative to each other. Small-length flexural pivots can have a wide variety of lengths and shapes to suit multiple designs. Longer small-length flexural pivots allow for a large range of motion, while shorter pivots are easier to model with techniques, such as pseudo-rigid body modeling.","Flexural pivots are often loaded in bending and axial compression. As a result, the flexural pivot enters a buckling condition and relatively large deflection occurs. The result is a relatively large displacement of the compliant mechanism, and a relatively high stress in the flexural pivot.","The present invention utilizes flexible segments, termed \u201ctensural pivots,\u201d that are loaded with a combination of bending and axial tension. The use of tensural pivots avoids buckled beam conditions and utilizes stress stiffening to reduce the displacement of the mechanism. Furthermore, by avoiding buckling, tensural pivots are subject to comparatively smaller stresses, which enhances the life of the mechanism under a constant load or, especially, under fatigue loading conditions. Additionally, tensural pivots can be relaxed through the use of thermal expansion, which may enable tensural pivots to change shape, or even toggle, in response to the application of electric current.","In the micromechanism  of , tensural pivots are incorporated into the coupling . More precisely, the coupling  has a first flexible segment  extending from the anchoring point  of the base member  and a second flexible segment  extending from the anchoring point  of the shuttle . The flexible segments ,  have a small thickness within the plane in which the micromechanism  generally resides. Thus, the flexible segments ,  are able to bend within the plane to approximate the pivotal motion provided by a pin joint.","Each of the flexible segments ,  has a length-to-width ratio selected to provide bending with the desired degree of energy storage. The length or width of the flexible segments ,  may easily be adjusted to modify the energy storage or bending properties of the flexible segments , . The width of the flexible segments ,  may have a minimum value imposed by the manufacturing process used to form the micromechanism . For example, if a MUMPS process is used, the flexible segments ,  may be required to have a width of at least about two microns.","In the first stable configuration, which is shown in , the flexible segments ,  are substantially undeflected, and therefore unstressed, aside from the presence of any residual stresses incident to the manufacturing process. Thus, the flexible segments ,  are each substantially straight, and are generally collinear with each other. Each of the flexible segments ,  acts as a tensural pivot because motion of the shuttle  from the first position toward a second position corresponding to the second stable configuration (i.e., in the direction shown by the arrow) exerts bending and axial tension on both of the flexible segments , .","The coupling  also has a compressive segment  attached to the first flexible segment  at a base anchoring point  and to the second flexible segment  at a shuttle anchoring point . As shown, the compressive segment  has a slightly curved shape with a thickness much larger than that of the flexible segments , . Hence, the compressive segment  can store considerable strain energy with a comparatively small change in length. If desired the compressive segment  may have a different shape, such as a V-shape, a straight shape, or a more sharply curved shape. Such shapes may be used to vary the strain energy stored by the compressive segment  as a function of the motion of the shuttle .","In the first stable configuration of , the compressive segment  is also undeflected and unstressed, aside from any residual stresses. Since any perturbation of the shuttle  away from the first position results in an increase in strain energy stored by the coupling , and therefore a return of the shuttle  toward the first position, the configuration of  represents a stable equilibrium. Motion of the shuttle  toward the second position induces compression and bending of the compressive segment  by virtue of the tension on the first and second flexible segments , , which tends to draw the base and shuttle anchoring points ,  of the compressive segment  toward each other.","The micromechanism  obtains its dual position stability from the existence of two low potential energy positions. The use of potential energy changes to provide bistability provides better control and a larger range of design possibilities than the implementation of residual stress or buckled beam methods. The micromechanism  of  uses the energy storage capabilities of the flexible segments ,  and the compressive segment  to create two low potential energy positions.","The coupling  may be configured in a wide variety of ways, aside from that shown in . Many other embodiments may utilize tension in combination with bending to provide small deflection, bistable motion between the base member  and the shuttle . The configurations of the base member , and shuttle  could similarly be altered to adapt them for use with a coupling having a different configuration.","The use of compliant technology enables a bistable mechanism, such as the micromechanism , to be produced without conventional, separate members and joints. The functions of such members and joints are instead carried out by integrally formed elements that allow for motion similar to that of conventional mechanisms. While a compliant structure can provide motion and displacement similar to that of designs involving conventional rigid elements, the design process for a compliant mechanism has obstacles not present in the case of conventional mechanisms utilizing separate, rigid parts. For example, the flexible segments ,  are loaded in both bending and axial tension. Thus, multiple forces and torques simultaneously act on the flexible segments , . Additionally, comparatively large deflections may occur.","As a result, directly determining how the flexible segments ,  respond to motion of the shuttle  requires complex non-linear equations. The complexity of these equations makes it difficult to obtain closed form mathematical relationships to characterize the potential energy storage of the coupling . Hence, with traditional methods of analysis, it is difficult to create a compliant structure that functions in the desired manner, let alone optimize the structure for a desired function. The process of designing and optimizing a compliant structure can be simplified by modeling a compliant structure as a mechanism with rigid members connected with conventional joints and springs. Such a model may be called a \u201cpseudo-rigid body model,\u201d or PRBM.","Referring again to , a pseudo-rigid body model , or PRBM , of the coupling  is superimposed on the coupling . The various elements of the PRBM  do not physically exist within the micromechanism , but are simply used as tools for analysis.","According to the PRBM , the first flexible segment  is modeled as a stationary pin joint . The stationary pin joint  is positioned in the middle of the first flexible segment  because the first flexible segment  is short enough that bending of the first flexible segment  over a limited range of motion is roughly equivalent to pivotal motion about its center. The bending resistance of the first flexible segment  is represented by a torsional spring . A first extension  represents the attachment of the first flexible segment  to the compressive segment .","The second flexible segment  is modeled as a sliding pin joint , which moves only in the longitudinal direction  to approximate motion of the shuttle . As with the stationary pin joint , the sliding pin joint  is positioned at the center of the second flexible segment . A torsional spring  simulates the bending resistance of the second flexible segment . A second extension  represents the attachment of the second flexible segment  to the compressive segment .","A first compression segment  and a second compression segment  extend toward each other from the ends of the first and second extensions , , respectively. The first and second compression segments ,  represent the length of the compressive segment  between the stationary pin joint  and the sliding pin joint . A linear spring  is positioned within an enclosure  between the first and second compression segments ,  of the PRBM  to simulate the combined axial forces of tension in the flexible segments ,  and compression in the compressive segment , as well as any bending of the compressive segment  that occurs.","Values may be ascribed to the various elements of the PRBM  for purposes of analysis. For example, each of the extensions ,  and compression segments ,  has a length, and the linear spring  and torsional springs ,  have associated spring constants. These values may be derived from the geometry of the flexible segments ,  and the compressive segment . Thicker elements are analogous to springs with large spring constants, and therefore resist deformation more than elements that would be modeled with a smaller spring constant.","Once the geometry of the PRBM  has been fully described, tools of conventional kinematic analysis can then be applied to the PRBM  to determine the motion and energy storage characteristics of the coupling , and thence the entire micromechanism . The micromechanism  may be manufactured in the first stable configuration, as depicted in . Thus, the axial and bending loads on the flexible segments ,  and the compressive segment  may be assumed to be approximately zero. This condition is represented in the PRBM  by zero deflection in the linear spring  and in the torsional springs , . The manner in which the coupling  stores energy to provide dual position stability will be further described in connection with , with continued reference to the PRBM .","Referring to , the micromechanism  of  is shown in an unstable equilibrium configuration, with the PRBM  once again superimposed over the coupling . As shown, the shuttle  has been moved by some external force in the longitudinal direction  to an unstable position corresponding to the unstable equilibrium configuration of the micromechanism . As a result, the center of the flexible segment  coupled to the shuttle  has been moved longitudinally, past the center of the flexible segment  coupled to the base member . Consequently, the flexible segments ,  have each been forced to bend. Additionally, the ends of the flexible segments ,  adjoining the anchoring points ,  have been drawn closer together to place the flexible segments ,  in tension and to place the compressive segment  in a combination of axial compression and bending.","In the PRBM , the sliding pin joint  has moved longitudinally, past the longitudinal position of the stationary pin joint . The bending of the flexible segments ,  is represented in the PRBM  by rotational deflection of the torsional springs , , which is not generally discernable in . The axial loading of the flexible segments ,  and the axial and bending loading of the compressive segment  are indicated by compression of the linear spring , which is clearly visible in . The sliding pin joint  has moved in the longitudinal direction  to simulate the longitudinal motion of the shuttle .","In the unstable equilibrium configuration of , the coupling  stores strain energy that tends to move the shuttle  in either longitudinal direction. More specifically, the flexible segments ,  bend in proportion to the advancement of the shuttle  from the first position to the second position. Consequently, their resilient force continually urges the shuttle  to move back toward the first position.","By contrast, the axial tension on the flexible segments , , as well as the bending and axial compression on the compressive segment , reach their maximum approximately when the centers of the flexible segments , , represented by the pin joints , , are aligned in the longitudinal direction . This maximum energy storage level is represented by maximum compression of the linear spring . As the shuttle  moves from the first position toward the second position, the axial tension on the segments , ,  and the bending of the compressive segment  urge the shuttle  to move back to the first position. However, when the center of the second flexible segment  moves longitudinally beyond the center of the first flexible segment , the axial tension on the segments , ,  and the bending of the compressive segment  begin to decrease. Thus, the shuttle  is urged toward the second position.","In the unstable equilibrium configuration of , the center of the flexible segment  has moved longitudinally beyond the center of the flexible segment . Hence, while the bending resistance of the flexible segments ,  urges the shuttle  back toward the first position, the axial strain of the segments , ,  and the bending strain of the compressive segment  exert an equal force that urges the shuttle  toward the second position. With any significant motion of the shuttle  from the unstable position, the axial load on the segments , ,  and the bending of the compressive segment  may become the dominant force over bending of the flexible segments , . Hence, slight perturbation of the shuttle  in either longitudinal direction results in continued motion of the shuttle, independent of any continued actuation force, in the same direction until the shuttle  reaches either the first position or the second position.","Referring to , a plan view shows the micromechanism  in the second stable configuration. The shuttle  has been moved beyond the unstable equilibrium configuration of ; hence, the shuttle  continued to move as strain energy was released by the coupling  until the shuttle  reached a new stable equilibrium at the second position. More specifically, the axial loading of the segments , ,  and the bending load of the compressive segment  are relieved as the shuttle  moves from the unstable position to the second position. This is represented by the more relaxed state of the linear spring  in , which is not entirely undeflected as in .","Simultaneously, the bending loads on the flexible segments ,  intensify. The second stable configuration is the configuration in which the axial loading of the segments , ,  and the bending load of the compressive segment , represented by deflection of the linear spring , are again balanced against the bending loads of the flexible segments , , which are represented by the torsional springs , .","Thus, the equilibrium of the second stable configuration is obtained through a balance of forces similar to that of the unstable equilibrium configuration. However, despite the continued existence of strain energy within the coupling , the equilibrium of the second stable configuration is stable like that of the first stable configuration because slight perturbation of the shuttle  results in a return of the shuttle  to the second stable configuration. However, the stored strain energy within the coupling  in the second stable configuration may somewhat reduce the force required to move the shuttle from the second position back to the first position.","Consequently, the force required to move the micromechanism  from the first stable configuration to the second stable configuration may be larger than the force required to move the micromechanism  from the second stable configuration to the first stable configuration. According to one embodiment, a force of approximately 120 \u03bcN is required to move the micromechanism  from the first stable configuration to the second stable configuration, and a force of approximately 38 \u03bcN is required for return actuation. Such a difference between toggle forces may be desirable for certain applications, such as microswitching. Furthermore, the comparatively low required return force may facilitate self-return actuation of the micromechanism  from the second stable configuration to the first stable configuration. However, the micromechanism  may be adapted to provide a wide number of ratios between required actuation and return forces. Such adaptation may be carried out depending on the specific implementation of the micromechanism .","Advantageously, the micromechanism  provides a small displacement of the shuttle , while still maintaining true bistability, with a minimum footprint size. In this application, \u201cdisplacement\u201d refers to linear displacement of the output member (for example, the shuttle ), not to angular displacement of supporting elements such as the flexible segments , . The displacement of the shuttle  is necessarily relative to the process limited minimum feature size, or the smallest feature that can be used for the manufacturing process used to form the micromechanism . Thus, for microscale devices, small displacement denotes microscale displacements on the order of the minimum feature size.","For example, if the micromechanism is manufactured using a process such as MUMPS, the minimum feature size may be about 2 microns. The first and second positions of the shuttle  may be separated by a distance ranging from about 5 microns to about 15 microns. Furthermore, the shuttle  may have a displacement ranging from about 7 microns to about 13 microns. Yet further, the shuttle  may have a displacement of about 11 microns. The displacement of the shuttle  is thus approximately five or six times the minimum feature size. Such displacement values correspond generally to the displacements of typical microactuators, and are also suitable for switching applications.","For nanoscale devices, mesoscale devices, or even macroscale devices, the displacement of such a mechanism may again be on the order of the minimum feature size. The configuration of the micromechanism  may be readily adapted for production on any relative scale. A variety of manufacturing process may be used, including, but not limited to, surface micromachining techniques such as MUMPS or SUMMIT V, bulk micromachining, LIGA, and macroscale molding or machining.","A bistable mechanism made by any such process may have a displacement rating, which is defined as the quantity consisting of 10,000 multiplied by the square of the minimum feature size, divided by the quantity consisting of the displacement multiplied by the size of the device. The displacement rating characterizes the ability of a bistable mechanism to achieve a small displacement by comparison with the minimum feature size, while also maintaining a small overall footprint by comparison with the minimum feature size. The displacement rating may be considered as the ratio of minimum feature size over displacement multiplied by the ratio of minimum feature size over mechanism size, multiplied by a constant, i.e., 10,000. The displacement rating is greater for mechanisms with smaller footprints, smaller displacements, and larger feature sizes. Known mechanisms tend to have a comparatively small displacement rating.","Of the values used to obtain the displacement rating, the minimum feature size is the smallest feature that can be created with the process. As mentioned previously, the displacement is the linear displacement of the output member. If no output member is present, it is the largest linear displacement found in the mechanism. The displacement includes the full distance between stable linear positions of the mechanism, even if electrical contacts or other structures obstruct motion of the mechanism along its full displacement.","The size of the device is the width (i.e., in the lateral direction , perpendicular to the direction of linear bistable motion) of the mechanism, excluding any symmetrical elements. Hence, if there were a base member and coupling (not shown) disposed on the opposite side of the shuttle  from the coupling , in a symmetrical disposition, such components would not be included in the calculation of the size of the micromechanism  because they could be omitted without altering the displacement of the micromechanism .","By way of example, the micromechanism  may be manufactured using the MUMPS process, which has a minimum feature size of approximately 2 microns, as mentioned previously. The micromechanism  may have a linear output displacement of approximately 11 microns, and a size of approximately 120 microns. Using the formula provided above, the displacement rating for the micromechanism  is about 30.3.","A somewhat smaller micromechanism (not shown) with a similar configuration may be made with the SUMMIT V process. The SUMMIT V process has a minimum feature size of about 0.7 microns. Such a micromechanism may have a displacement of about 4.5 microns and a size of about 100 microns. The displacement rating for such a micromechanism is about 10.9.","A bistable mechanism according to the invention may advantageously have a displacement rating above about 7.0. Furthermore, such a bistable mechanism may have a displacement rating above about 10. Yet further, such a bistable mechanism may have a displacement rating above about 15. Still further, such a bistable mechanism may have a displacement rating above about 20. Even further, such ah bistable mechanism may have a displacement rating above about 30.","Returning to the micromechanism  of , an electric return signal may, if desired, be applied directly to the micromechanism  to induce the coupling  to relax, thereby permitting the micromechanism  to return from the second stable configuration to the first stable configuration. For example, a voltage may be applied to the base member  and the backing member . The backing member  and the shuttle  are close enough that current will flow relatively freely between them; hence, current flows through the micromechanism , or more precisely, through the coupling . The current encounters considerable resistance within the flexible segments ,  due to the small thickness of the flexible segments , . Consequently, resistance heating, or \u201cjoule heating,\u201d occurs and the flexible segments ,  elongate. In the alternative, heat could be applied in any other way, such as through the use of a laser.","Since the flexible segments ,  are in tension near the second stable configuration, thermal expansion enables them to relax. As the flexible segments ,  lengthen, the compressive segment  rotates in a clockwise direction toward the position of . Motion of the coupling  draws the shuttle  toward the unstable position. If current continues to be applied, the shuttle  will reach the unstable position, and the coupling  will reach a state corresponding to the unstable equilibrium configuration. Once the shuttle  passes the unstable position, the micromechanism  will tend to return to the first stable configuration when the electric return signal is discontinued. The flexible segments ,  may be required to sustain a temperature increase on the order of 450\u00b0 C. in order to effectuate a return from the second stable configuration to the first stable configuration.","Without the application of the electric return signal, or a return force against the shuttle , the micromechanism  remains in the second stable configuration. The micromechanism  may be adapted to suit the stability requirements of any given application. Stability relates to the ability of a bistable micromechanism to remain in the desired stable configuration under normal operating conditions, e.g., without deliberate actuation from the desired stable configuration.","Generally, the stability of a bistable mechanism is proportional to the force required to toggle the mechanism from one stable configuration to another stable configuration. A mechanism requiring a small force to toggle the mechanism is not as stable as a mechanism that requires a large force. Similarly, a highly stable mechanism will require a comparatively larger force to actuate the mechanism between different stable configurations. A high input force may place excessive energy burdens on a system, especially in MBMS applications, in which energy consumption is limited. In such applications, minimizing the toggle force may be desirable.","However, stability may be compromised if the toggle force is too low. For example, vibrations that occur from outside the system may toggle a bistable mechanism with a small input force requirement. Therefore, the application and energy requirements must be considered when selecting a bistable mechanism design.","One method of increasing stability of a bistable micromechanism without altering its displacement is to increase the number of energy storing elements in the bistable micromechanism. Adding energy storing elements also increases the force required to move the micromechanism from one stable configuration to another. Such a configuration will be shown and described in greater detail with reference to a switching application, in connection with .","Referring to , a plan view of one embodiment of a microswitch  is depicted. The microswitch  incorporates a pair of electrical contacts , which are to be electrically coupled when the microswitch  is in the \u201con,\u201d or closed position, but not when the microswitch  is in the \u201coff,\u201d or open position. An actuator  is used to actuate a micromechanism  from a first stable configuration, in which the electrical contacts  are not connected, to a second stable configuration, in which the micromechanism  bridges the gap between the electrical contacts  to permit electricity to flow between the electrical contacts . The actuator  is slidably connected to the micromechanism  via a connector . In , the micromechanism  is shown in the first stable configuration, so that the microswitch  is in the \u201coff\u201d position.","The micromechanism  operates in a manner similar to that of . However, the micromechanism  is symmetrical along the lateral direction . More precisely, the micromechanism  has a first base member  and a second base member  disposed opposite the first base member . A shuttle  is disposed between the base members. Since the base members ,  cooperate to keep the shuttle  from moving significantly in the lateral direction , no backing member  is needed. Instead, the shuttle  is coupled to the first base member  by two couplings  and to the second base member  by two additional couplings .","Each of the base members ,  has a longitudinal portion  extending in the longitudinal direction . Lateral extensions  extend generally inward from the base members , , toward the shuttle . Similarly, the shuttle  has a longitudinal portion  oriented generally parallel to the longitudinal portions  of the base members , . Lateral extensions  extend generally outward from the shuttle , toward the base members , .","The couplings  of  may be identical to those of , or may, in a different configuration, be adapted to provide the desired force and\/or displacement characteristics for the micromechanism . Hence, the couplings  of the micromechanism  may each have a first flexible segment , a second flexible segment , and a compressive segment . Although the PRBM  of  is not shown in , the energy storage and motion characteristics described in connection with the PRBM  apply to the micromechanism  of . Due to the use of additional couplings , the micromechanism  may have comparatively higher input force requirements to move the micromechanism  between the first and second stable configurations. Such a higher requirement also provides additional stability, as described previously.","The actuator  may take the form of a thermomechanical in-plane microactuator, or TIM . The TIM  has a first base member , a second base member , and a shuttle  designed to be movable with respect to the base members , . A plurality of legs  extend from each of the base members ,  to the shuttle  at an angle slightly offset from the lateral direction . When an electric actuation signal passes through the TIM , i.e., between the first and second base members , , resistance to the current induces joule heating within the legs , thereby causing the legs  to lengthen. The legs  may expand relatively proportionately in all directions, or may be configured for preferential thermal expansion along their length. In any case, the legs  elongate to press the shuttle  in the longitudinal direction , toward the shuttle  of the micromechanism .","The micromechanism  may be triggered in a wide variety of ways besides through the use of the TIM . For example, the micromechanism  may be moved from the first stable configuration to the second stable configuration through the use of other types of linear or rotary thermal actuators, electrostatic actuators such as comb drives, or even by the force of acceleration against the shuttle  of the micromechanism .","The shuttle  of the TIM  is slidably coupled to the shuttle  of the micromechanism  by the connector . The connector  is designed to ensure that the shuttles ,  remain aligned in the lateral direction  and in the transverse direction . Hence, the connector  has a micromechanism prong  that extends in the longitudinal direction  from the micromechanism shuttle , and a micromechanism plate  disposed underneath the micromechanism prong  in the transverse direction . Similarly, the connector  also has a pair of actuator prongs  that extend in the longitudinal direction  from the shuttle , and an actuator plate  disposed underneath the actuator prongs  in the transverse direction .","The actuator prongs  are disposed on either side of the micromechanism prong  so that the actuator prongs  are unable to move relative to the micromechanism prong  in the lateral direction . Furthermore, the micromechanism prong  is unable to move in the transverse direction  past the actuator plate , and the actuator prongs  are unable to move in the transverse direction  past the micromechanism plate . Consequently, relative motion between the micromechanism prong  and the actuator prongs  is restricted in either transverse direction . Thus, the shuttle  is constrained by the connector  to remain in alignment with the shuttle  of the micromechanism .","When the shuttle  moves toward the micromechanism , the actuator plate  may abut the micromechanism plate  and press against it, thereby pressing the shuttle  toward the electrical contacts . As mentioned previously, the micromechanism  operates in a manner similar to that of the micromechanism  of . The shuttle  reaches an unstable position induced by strain energy stored within the couplings , and further motion of the shuttle  toward the electrical contacts  causes the strain energy to release somewhat, thereby drawing the shuttle  toward the second position.","The electrical contacts  may be positioned such that the shuttle  abuts the electrical contacts  and, as a consequence, stops moving prior to reaching the second stable configuration. If desired, the electrical contacts  may further be positioned such that the shuttle  abuts the electrical contacts  when the force exerted on the shuttle  by the couplings  reaches its maximum value. Thus, the shuttle  exerts a constant force tending to keep the end of the shuttle  relatively tightly pressed against the electrical contacts . The end of the shuttle  may have a metallic coating or attached metal member that electrically couples the electrical contacts  together, thereby causing the microswitch  to be in the \u201con\u201d position.","Due to the bistability of the micromechanism , the microswitch  will remain in the \u201con\u201d position without the presence of any constant actuation signal. Thus, the electric actuation signal may be decoupled from the TIM  so that the TIM  can return to a relaxed state. The microswitch  does not return to the \u201coff\u201d position until acted upon by some external force or electric return signal.","When the microswitch  is to be returned to the \u201coff\u201d position, an electric return signal may be applied across the micromechanism . For example, a voltage applied to the base members ,  would induce the passage of current through the couplings , and hence through the flexible segments , . In the same manner described in connection with , the electric return signal induces elongation of the flexible segments , , thereby causing the couplings  to relax until the micromechanism  returns to the first stable configuration. The shuttle  is thus drawn away from the electrical contacts  to once again electrically isolate the electrical contacts  from each other.","Thus, no separate return actuator is required to move the microswitch  from the \u201con\u201d position to the \u201coff\u201d position. However, when the microswitch  is to operate over many rapid cycles, it may be desirable to avoid the repeated application of high temperatures to the flexible segments , . Additionally, it may be desirable to provide some type of redundant mechanism for tuning off the microswitch , in case self-return actuation is ineffective. A second actuator may also be used as the primary mechanism for turning off the microswitch , while self-return actuation is reserved as a back-up.  illustrates one embodiment that incorporates an additional return actuator.","Referring to , a plan view illustrates an alternative embodiment of a microswitch  according to the invention. The microswitch  has a configuration similar to that of the microswitch , except that the microswitch  also includes a return actuator . As shown, the return actuator  may take the form of a thermomechanical in-plane microactuator, or TIM , similar to the TIM . Hence, the TIM  may also have first and second base members ,  disposed on either side of a shuttle  and a plurality of legs  that extend from the base members ,  to the shuttle .","When the microswitch  is to be actuated form the \u201con\u201d position to the \u201coff\u201d position, an electric return signal is applied, not to the micromechanism , but to the TIM . The legs  of the TIM  elongate in response to the application of the electric return signal, thereby urging the shuttle  toward the shuttle  of the micromechanism . As shown, the shuttle  of the TIM  may be positioned to extend generally between the electrical contacts  to abut against the center of the shuttle  of the micromechanism . Due to the placement of the electrical contacts , and the widened configuration of the portion of the shuttle  that abuts against the electrical contacts , no connector may be needed to maintain alignment between the shuttle  of the TIM  and the shuttle  of the micromechanism .","The shuttle  of the TIM  presses the shuttle  away from the electrical contacts  until the shuttle  passes the unstable position. Then, the micromechanism  moves of its own accord back to the first stable configuration (shown in ), thereby moving the microswitch  to the \u201coff\u201d position. The TIM  may then be allowed to retract to avoid obstructing motion of the shuttle  back toward the electrical contacts  when the microswitch  is to be moved back to the \u201con\u201d position.","As with the TIM , a wide variety of other actuator types may alternatively be used to provide return actuation of the micromechanism . The TIM  may also be used as a backup to self-return actuation of the micromechanism , or vice versa. Thus, redundant retraction capability may be provided.","Through the use of the microactuators, microswitches, and couplings of the present invention, bistable motion may be provided in a manner that enhances a wide variety of MEMS applications. Micromechanical devices can be maintained in one of two stable positions without the application of a continuous maintenance signal. Displacements suitable for use with thermomechanical actuators and switching applications may also be obtained. Furthermore, if desired, self-return actuation may be utilized to obviate a separate return actuator.","The mechanisms disclosed herein may be modified in many other ways to suit a wide variety of applications.
