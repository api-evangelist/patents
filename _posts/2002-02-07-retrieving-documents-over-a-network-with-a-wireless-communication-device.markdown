{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to a system and method for accessing information from a network, and more particularly, to a system and method for retrieving documents via a proxy server and routing them to a plurality of wireless communication devices.","To a large degree, the information age has been brought about by rapid advances in the field of computers, networking and communications. Increasingly, information which could formerly be presented in tangible, permanent media is reformatted and rendered for display and transmitted to remotely located screens and monitors. Virtually any a type of data presentable as text and\/or graphics is being converted into suitable electronic messages or packets for shuttling across networks, such as the Internet.","Networks typically provide an infrastructure for resources or content providers to make packets available through service providers to users who subscribe to the service. The actual transmission takes place over the communication links of various bandwidths and types which make up the network. Content providers typically store this electronic data on servers connected directly to the Internet in standard format. The data is broken down into packets and these packets are then transmitted over the communication link. Among the diverse types of information that may be placed on the Internet in this way are articles, news briefs and updates, weather maps, books, summaries, files, software, catalogues, documents, pictorials, video files, public records, commercial literature and so forth. The act of accessing this information has come to be known as \u201csurfing.\u201d","Until recently, surfing the Internet and, more particularly the world wide web or web, was an activity restricted to users operating full-size client computers (e.g., lap-top, desktop, and mini computers) located in a home or business. This was true because the principal method for accessing the Internet required a computer with access to a special navigation program called a web browser or browser. Browsers allow a user to access servers located throughout the world, peruse the information stored on the servers and retrieve information from the servers by sending files or data packets from the server's resources to the user's computer. Historically, browsers were too large and complicated to be loaded in the memory of smaller, less capable clients such as wireless communication devices. This consequently limited access by wireless devices to the Internet and correspondingly delayed their widespread acceptance and use.","However, with the advent of wireless communication protocols, information stored on the Internet became accessible to wireless communication devices previously ill-equipped to access the Internet. For example, mobile phones, personal data assistants (PDAs) and other hand-held computers were suddenly capable of logging onto the Internet and retrieving data therefrom. While the combination of size and functionality led to the emergence of these computing devices as valuable necessities, it also prevented them from providing the features routinely accessible using a conventional computer keyboard and full-sized color monitor. Consequently, many existing hand-held computing devices still lack the functionality necessary to browse as effectively as a user on a conventional desktop computer.","Efforts have been made to increase Internet accessibility for these hand-held devices in spite of their existing processing and display capabilities. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,727,159 disclosed a system in which relatively low-end computers such as portable, battery-powered computers may be used to browse the Internet The system utilizes an arrangement comprised of a proxy server with adequate computing power to perform all web browsing and downloading functions for the portable computer. Recognizing that these small computers have limited processing and data display capabilities, the disclosed system provides the capability in the proxy server for transposing the downloaded files into an alternate, low-information density form suitable for rapid processing and display by connected portable computers. Unfortunately, in the process of transposing the data, the system leaves open the possibility that subtle but nevertheless important data could be removed or filtered out.","Under these circumstances, what is needed is a system and method for retrieving documents from a server and then routing them to small, portable computers in their original form. It is also desirable to have a system and method that allows a user to easily navigate through various types of documents with one hand, using the cursor keys typically found on PDA's, mobile telephones and other portable computing devices.","The present invention provides a system and method for retrieving documents from a network using a proxy server and routing them to a plurality of different types of wireless communication devices. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a wireless communication device is provided that includes a display and a plurality of cursor control keys. The wireless communication device is connected to a proxy server, preferentially through a base station of a wireless communication system. The proxy server is also coupled to at least one remote server via a network connection. During operation, the wireless communication device is programmed to generate a menu that includes a plurality of entries. Each entry provides a link to at least one web page that may be selected and accessed by the user of the wireless communication device.","In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, during operation a user that is logged onto the proxy server can scroll through menu items generated on the wireless communication device using cursor keys found on the wireless communication device to select a desired web site. Once the user selects a menu item from the menu, a site request that corresponds to the selected item from the menu is encoded and transmitted to the proxy server from the wireless communication device where the site request is then decoded into a universal resource locator (URL). The proxy server then contacts the site corresponding to the URL and the web page or markup language file is then retrieved from a remote server that is connected to the network.","The present invention provides a shorthand way of requesting web pages using one hand and a minimal number of keystrokes. Once the proxy server receives the mark-up language file, it separates the file into a predetermined number of viewable segments and then sends the first viewable segment to the wireless communication device. After the user has perused the received text and\/or graphics sent in the first viewable segment, they are able to request the next viewable segment and so on. This process continues until the user of the wireless communication device has received the entire mark-up language file or decides to access another mark-up language file altogether.","Additional objectives, features and advantages of the present invention are set forth in the following description, apparent from the description, or may be learned by practicing the invention. Both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.","Referring to , the present invention discloses a proxy network system  that includes at least one wireless communication device  that is equipped with a display and a plurality of cursor control keys. The wireless communication device  is connected to a base station , which is in turn, connected to a proxy server . The base station  is used to transmit and receive radio signals to and from the wireless communication device . The proxy server  is connected to a network connection  that is connected to at least one remote server . Although not specifically illustrated in , preferentially the network connection  is an Internet connection that connects the proxy server  to the Internet.","During operation, the wireless communication device  is programmed to generate a menu comprised of a plurality of entries. Each entry corresponds to a link to at least one mark-up language file that can be accessed by the user of the wireless communication device . As such, a user of the wireless communication device  can scroll through the menu items using the cursor keys found on the wireless communication device  to select a desired site. Once the user locates and selects a desired listing from the menu, a site request is encoded and transmitted to the proxy server where the site request is then decoded into a corresponding URL. The URL is then used by the proxy server  to contact the appropriate remote server  and the mark-up language file corresponding to the site request is retrieved from the remote server . This method provides a shorthand way of requesting and scrolling from one screen to another. Operation of the cursor keys -will be explained in more detail in ,  and . Those skilled in the art should recognize that although a PDA is illustrated in , other types of wireless communication devices may be used.","A detailed diagram of the proxy server  is illustrated in . Proxy server  is comprised of a CPU , a ROM , a RAM , a display adapter , a display , a User Interface (UI) adapter , a mouse or selection device , a keyboard , an IO adapter , a disk storage unit , and a communication adapter . The proxy server  includes an operating system  and a wireless communication device processing application  that is stored on the disk storage unit . As shown, the various components of each proxy server  communicate through a system bus  or similar architecture.","A detailed diagram of the remote server  is shown in . As illustrated, the remote server  is comprised of the same hardware components as the proxy server  and as such, a detailed discussion of those components is not necessary. Stored on disk storage unit  of the remote server  is the data content, mark-up language files  associated with the respective remote server . In connection with the preferred embodiment, it should be appreciated from the schematic overview illustrated by  and the detailed schematics of ,  and  that the present invention may be employed in a distributed computer system environment which has internal, external and intranet networks collectively represented in the schematic overview by the network connection  to connect the wireless communication device  to World Wide Web servers and other servers, which are represented generally by remote server  in the various figures.","Referring now to , the exemplary sequential steps of the proxy interface application  and the wireless communication device processing application  are illustrated for implementing the method for retrieving documents over the Internet in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Note that in this description, the proxy server  is generally discussed as if it were a single device, and functions provided by the proxy server  are generally discussed as being performed by such single device. It is important however to note that the proxy server  preferentially comprises multiple physical and logical devices connected in a distributed architecture, and the various functions discussed below which are provided by the proxy server  may actually be distributed among multiple server devices.","As illustrated in , a user action in the form of a request to access a mark-up language file is generated by the wireless communication device  and is received by the proxy server  at step . The request is communicated to the proxy server  when a user operating the wireless communication device  preferentially selects a menu item displayed by the proxy interface application . and show an example of a menu hierarchy  in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown in , menu  is comprised of a plurality of headings -and subheadings -with associated menu items -","After the request from the wireless communication device  is received by the proxy server , a site request is generated by wireless communication device processing application  that corresponds to a universal resource locator (URL) at step . Preferentially, the request from the wireless communication device  is sent as an encoded message that is decoded by the proxy server . In the preferred embodiment, the proxy server  is also capable of determining the size of the display buffer associated with the display  of the wireless communication device . At step , the wireless communication device processing application  on the proxy server  obtains the requested mark-up language file from the remote server  and determines if the mark-up language file is larger than the display buffer of the wireless communication device . If the web page is smaller than the display buffer, the proxy server  transmits the entire mark-up language file to the wireless communication device  as illustrated at step .","As further illustrated in , if the mark-up language file is larger than the display buffer, the wireless communication device processing application  on the proxy server  divides the mark-up language file into viewable segments that fit within a predetermined viewable area of the display  of the wireless communication device . After being divided into viewable segments, the first viewable segment of the mark-up language file is transmitted to the wireless communication device . At step , if another user input is received by the proxy server , then the wireless communication device processing application  determines if the request is for a new mark-up language file or another viewable segment of the mark-up language file already selected, which is illustrated at steps  and  respectively. If the user has requested a new web page, then the wireless communication device processing application  returns to step  and, if the user requests the next viewable segment of the currently selected web page, then the application returns to step . Those skilled in the art should recognize that this allows users to scroll through various viewable segments of the mark-up language file.","Referring to , an inquiry screen  is illustrated in the form that is displayed on the display  of the wireless communication device  after being connected to the proxy server . The entire screen contains a plurality of objects or menu items associated with predetermined selections. Once the inquiry screen  is displayed, the user can interact with it, for example, by selecting one of the headings -using the user input device  or some other method. For example, should the user want access to a category on the menu in accordance with the present invention, he or she would select heading . This would take the user to the application screen, which is illustrated in . Next, the user would select one of the displayed subheadings -. Assuming the user selects subheading eCommerce , he or she will next be presented with a plurality of menu items as shown in .","Once the user selects a menu item, the proxy interface application  encodes the selection for the selected item and transmits it to the proxy server  for processing. Assuming the user selects \u2018Corporate Strategy,\u2019 the proxy interface application  would transmit a predetermined identifier corresponding to the selected menu item. In the previous example, the proxy interface application  would possibly transmit the identifier \u20181-1-8\u2019 which corresponds to the users selections: 1(Applications)-1(eCommerce)-8(Corporate Strategy). While this specification assumes that the proxy interface application  encodes an identifier corresponding to the item numbers shown on the input screens displayed by the proxy interface application , various encoding schemes could be implemented without departing from the scope and intent of this application. In other embodiments, the actual URL could be encoded and transmitted to the proxy server  where it is decoded and processed.","When the proxy server  receives the encoded identifier, it preferentially decodes it into a URL and retrieves the web page associated with that URL from a remote server . As an example, assume the received code translates into the following URL: \u201chttp:\/\/www.accenture.com\/xd\/xd.asp?it=enWeb&xd=ideas\/outlook\/pov\/pov_wirestrat.xml,\u201d the proxy server  would retrieve an illustrative mark-up language file  illustrated in . As shown, the mark-up language file  is comprised of a graphics portion , a text portion , a query box  and a plurality of links . Once the mark-up language file  is retrieved, the proxy server  determines whether the entire mark-up language file  is larger than the display buffer. If it is, the proxy server  divides the mark-up language file into viewable segments for transmission to the wireless communication device  one viewable segment at a time. The proxy server  may access a display information setting that is stored on the wireless communication device .","In the preferred embodiment, the information contained in the display information setting is used to determine the maximum size of the mark-up language file that can be transmitted to the wireless communication device  without exceeding its memory and display capabilities.  illustrates a possible segmentation of a mark-up language file  that would permit viewable segments of the mark-up language file to be transmitted to the wireless communication device , without overburdening its memory and display capabilities. It is envisioned that in addition to transmitting viewable segments of the mark-up language file , the wireless communication device processing application  also segments the mark-up language file  along logical boundaries (e.g., page breaks, line feeds, etc.) to maximize clarity of the transmitted text. As shown in , mark-up language file  is divided into segments -. Next, the wireless communication device processing application  encodes and transmits viewable segment to the wireless communication device , along with a navigational aid  (shown in ) to aid the user in scrolling through the viewable segments -of the mark-up language file . If the retrieved web page is not larger than the display buffer in the wireless communication device , processing flows directly from step  to step  as illustrated in .","As shown in , when the wireless communication device  retrieves segment , it preferentially displays it as it would appear on a typical laptop or desktop computer. Also shown in the screen is the navigational aid  for directing the retrieval order of the next viewable segment -from the proxy server . The wireless communication device  waits for input from the user (step ). When the wireless communication device  receives input, it determines whether the user is requesting a new mark-up language file  or simply progressing down or up the current mark-up language file . If the wireless communication device  determines that the user is directing it to retrieve the next viewable segment -of the current mark-up language file , processing flows to step . For example, if the user selects the navigational aid  via a touch screen, keyboard or selection buttons, the screen shown in  will be displayed, which is viewable segment in this example. It is also important to note that the user may activate cursor keys -to navigate the web page. If the wireless communication device  determines that the user is directing it to retrieve a new page, as previously set forth processing flows to step  and processing proceeds as explained above.","Although not specifically illustrated, the mark-up language file  may also be encoded by the proxy server  to allow the wireless communication device  into a different form. This would be a form that is compatible with the wireless communication device . The user may also be allowed to scroll left and right on the screen.","As shown in , once the user selects the navigational aid , viewable segment is then transmitted to the wireless communication device . Since mark-up language file  extends in both directions (top and bottom) from segment , a second navigational aid  is displayed in addition to the first navigational aid . Although not illustrated, if the width of web page  extended beyond the left or right boundaries of display , a left and\/or a right navigational would also be displayed. Also shown in  is query box  with its associated activation button , and a plurality of links  with associated activation buttons . When a user wants to enter a search query, he or she enters a search request into the query box  and then activates button , which causes the wireless communication device processing application  to immediately transmit the search query back to the proxy server . Once the proxy server  receives the search query, it passes the search query to the appropriate remote server . When the proxy server  receives the response from the remote server , it processes the mark-up language file  as previously described. A similar process is performed in the event that the user selects button .","The entire mark-up language file  may be transmitted to the wireless communication device  during a single transmission. As such, the wireless communication device  may break up the mark-up language file  in other preferred embodiments. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the disclosed process and product without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 14"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
