title: Host-based printer driver
abstract: A system includes a controller operable to receive a first data set comprising data in a first format type, the first-format-type data representing an image. The system further includes a circuit coupled to the controller, the circuit operable to produce a second data set in a second format type, the second data set based on the first-format-type data, the second data set representing the image.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/840,696, filed May 5, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","Host-based printer drivers are software applications that process print data (i.e., data to be sent to a printer) on a host device, such as a personal computer. By processing the print data on the host device, the printer driver allows the host device to cooperate with printers having minimal processing capability (and, thus, a lower cost) while yielding superior print quality.","However, because such low-capability printers cannot process object-oriented graphics (e.g., vector graphics and associated text fonts), the printer driver typically converts object-oriented images into raster (bitmap) data before the printer can print the images. Unfortunately, such data conversion often places high demands on the processing resources of the host device, and thus can detract from the performance of applications simultaneously running on the host device.","According to an embodiment of the invention, a system includes a controller operable to receive a first data set comprising data in a first format type, the first-format-type data representing an image. The system further includes a circuit coupled to the controller, the circuit operable to produce a second data set in a second format type, the second data set based on the first-format-type data, the second data set representing the image.","Most modern personal computers (PCs) are equipped with video cards (aka video adapters) that have high-level 2D and 3D graphics processing capabilities. Conventionally, PCs employ such video card processing capability solely to process data to be rendered by a video display. According to an embodiment of the invention, a host-based printer driver leverages this video card capability to process print data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","20","30","31","20","40","50","60","31","70","40","80","90","100","110","50","80","90","100","110"]},"In operation, the application  issues a print request, with associated print data representing an image (e.g., graphics or text), to the driver  through defined interfaces associated with the OS . The print data received by the driver  can be in a variety of known application-specific formats, such as, for example, bitmapped graphics, bitmapped text fonts, vector-graphics text fonts and\/or vector graphics. The driver  converts any non-raster print data to raster data so that the printer  can print the associated image.","The driver  translates the vector-graphics-based print data into a set of executable commands. The driver  communicates these commands to the video card  for execution. In one embodiment, the driver  is configured to employ a high-level cross platform API , such as OpenGL\u00ae or DirectX, in order to communicate with the video card . Of course, the driver  can be configured to utilize other custom APIs as well.","In executing the commands received from the driver , the video card  produces bitmapped images of points, arcs, lines, text and other shapes corresponding to the vector graphics, and thus to the associated image. The commands may further instruct the video card  to fill, as appropriate, the rendered bitmapped shapes in a manner and with colors specified by the commands. For example, at the direction of the driver , the video card  may render overlapping objects, only a topmost object, or blended objects in the case of semi-transparent objects.","In a case where the print data includes both vector graphics and bitmap data, the driver  may pass the bitmap data, along with the commands, to the video card . The video card  may cache this bitmap data in a memory (not shown) of the video card , and later place the bitmap data in an appropriate location of the image rendered by the video card .","Once the video card  has rendered into bitmap format the image (or portion thereof) associated with the print data, the video card  communicates the bitmapped image to the memory . The driver  may then employ the CPU  to perform any necessary post processing of the rendered image before providing the image to the printer , via the interface , for printing.","As discussed above, video cards are conventionally used to process data for display on video monitors. Standard video monitors are capable of displaying far fewer pixels than can be displayed on a printed page. If a particular print-data set represents an image that, when in bitmap format, requires a large number of pixels, the video card  may not be able to render the entire image.","As illustrated in , an embodiment of the driver  includes a divider  and an assembler . The assembler  is operable to divide into portions  (only portions -shown) a print-data set received from the application . The driver  translates each vector-graphic portion  into a corresponding instruction set and serially issues each instruction set to the video card  for execution. Each instruction set, once executed by the video card , produces a corresponding bitmap portion  that the video card  subsequently provides to the assembler . The assembler  is operable to assemble the bitmap portions  into the complete bitmapped version of the image. The driver  then provides the assembled bitmapped image to the printer .","In an alternative embodiment, the driver  may allocate a subset of the data portions  to the video card  for processing. The driver  itself may then process the data portions  not allocated to the video card  to produce corresponding bitmap portions . The processing by the driver  of data portions  may or may not be simultaneous with processing by the video card  of data portions .","The preceding discussion is presented to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the invention. Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
