{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by and for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or thereto.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an underwater launch system for launching missiles or weapons, vehicles, countermeasures, etc. from an underwater vehicle, and more particularly a stackable, modular missile launch system for launching numerous small scale missiles from submarine payload bays.","2. Description of Prior Art","Traditionally, submarines have been provided with the capability of launching air borne vehicles, such as missiles, both through vertical launch via specialized launch tubes on the submarine, and horizontal launch via the submarine's torpedo tubes. In some cases, the missiles are quite large, such as the Tomahawk missile, which requires sufficient support for the large warhead on deployment.","Other smaller missiles have been developed which can be used against air borne targets, such as helicopters. However, these missiles have not been deployed from submarines because of launching considerations, such as the ability to launch multiple missiles. U.S. Pat. No. 6,164,179 to Buffman discloses a submarine deployable vertical launch spar buoy for launching small air nautical vehicles from submerged vehicles or platforms.","Existing submarine missile launch systems only have the ability to launch one missile from a single missile tube. If additional missile launches are required they must be fired from other independent missile tubes. The additional missile tubes are typically positioned side-by-side, adjacent to one another. The missile tubes are not positioned above each other, because the upper missile tube would block the lower missiles from launching. The current side-by-side configuration has a low packing density because of the individually dedicated missile tubes and pressure vessels required for each missile that is to be launched.","Accordingly, there is needed in the art a weapon launching system which increases packing densities to allow submarines to carry larger payloads of missiles while being low in cost to construct and operate, reliable, easy to maintain, and safe. Preferably, the weapon launching system should also be simple in design, relatively lightweight, and compact.","The present invention is directed to an underwater missile launch system including one or more missile loading modules for supporting a plurality of missiles in a stackable, in-line configuration within a pressure vessel. The missiles are each preferably arranged inside a protective capsule that is disposed within the launch tubes in the module. The modules may be installed in groups inside a single pressure vessel, or payload bay. A single modular group may be used alone, or multiple groups may be placed in a stacked arrangement, one on top of the other, two or more in height. Preferably, each module is substantially identical including a common size, shape, and payload of missiles with the module above and below it. A one-way positioning latch is provided that prevents the upper capsules from dropping down on top of the lower capsules while allowing the lower capsules to later pass up through the same launch tube as the upper capsules, after the upper capsules have been ejected. The missile modules and capsules are enclosed within a watertight, payload pressure vessel or bay, which protects them from the ocean environment, and may preferably be ejected by a water pump positioned at the base of the vessel.","Referring now to the Figures, a payload pressure vessel  for supporting and launching a plurality of missiles  in a stackable, in-line configuration, from an underwater vehicle such as a submarine is illustrated. Each pressure vessel may preferably contain one or more missile modules , each module including multiple launch tubes , and each launch tube housing at least one protective missile capsule  for supporting a missile  therein. The modules may be used alone or in groups stacked two or more high. The height of the pressure vessel  determines the number and height of modules that can be stacked one on top of the other.","The pressure vessels  are preferably watertight and act to protect the missile modules  and missiles  from long-term exposure to corrosive seawater and from high depth pressures. The pressure vessel  remains closed with a watertight seal as the submarine maneuvers through the ocean environment. One or more lip seals  are preferably placed inside the launch tube of each missile module. The lip seals  are designated to seal against the upper and lower portions of the missile capsule  and limit the amount of pressurized water that leaks past the missile capsule  during the ejection. The seals  may preferably be spaced vertically such that at least one seal always remains in contact with the missile capsule  during ejection. A bay door or hatch  is positioned at the upper or launch end of the vessel and remains closed until ejection of the capsule  is initiated. The interior of the pressure vessel  is preferably filled with low pressure air.","Each missile module  preferably has a common size, shape, and payload of missiles  as the modules disposed above and below it, and are substantially identical in construction. Each module  also preferably includes a common connection for power, communications, piping, and missile alignment, all of which are well known in the art. When stacked two or more high, the missile launch tubes  of stacked modules  are connected and sealed to form a single long continuous missile tube . Flexible seals may be used at the base of each missile module  and launch tube  to minimize the mechanical connection requirements. Each launch tube  within a modular group preferably has the same height, and is vertically positioned to create a concave, or bowl shape at the top of the module. The bowl shape acts as a funnel to assist in draining seawater that may accumulate toward the middle of the module  where a drain  may preferably be located. The concave shape and drain  prevent standing seawater from collecting at the top of the module and from leaking onto the missiles .","Launch tubes  may each preferably include a hinged muzzle closure  disposed at the top, or launch end, which acts as a check valve to limit the amount of seawater that drains into the missile capsules , and other internal missile tube  hardware during use. The muzzle closure  also acts to protect and seal the missiles  disposed in a first or lower module from the high-pressure water used to launch the missiles  above it in a second or upper module , by preventing the build up of water inside the launch tubes . Longitudinal gaps may also be provided along the length of the launch tubes  in order to allow a sufficient amount of water to pass by the capsules . Any excess water will fill the air space above the capsule  while equalizing in pressure and forcing the hinged muzzle closure  open as the missile approaches the top of the launch tube . If the closure  is not open by the force of water, it is free to open in the direction of capsule  ejection as the capsule  makes contact with the muzzle closure . After a capsule has been ejected, a light torsion spring (not shown) and gravity are preferably utilized to close the hinged muzzle  in order to protect the remaining internal components of the launch tube , such as the shock mitigation material  and the latching mechanism, described below.","A latching mechanism  is used to position the capsule  inside the modular launch tube  and is preferably designed as part of the capsule . The latching mechanism  may preferably include a hinged portion supported on the capsule , and a stop mechanism supported on an interior surface of the launch tube . As the capsule  is loaded into a launch tube , it is lowered to the point where the latching mechanism  engages the capsules . The latching mechanism  acts to prevent the capsule  from dropping further down inside the launch tube . The latching mechanism  is automatically released as the capsule  is forced upwards. As will be appreciated, the latching mechanism  allows the capsule  to move upward, in the intended direction of ejection, but not downward. The hinged portion preferably folds down to conform to the outside diameter of the capsule , so that the latching mechanism  will not interfere with the internal tube hardware as the capsule  is ejected. The hinged portion of the latching mechanism  may preferably be discarded with the capsule  while the stop mechanism preferably remains as part of the launch tube .","In the present embodiment, each missile  is preferably protected from launch depth pressure, seawater corrosiveness, and any damaging pressure differentials by a corresponding water tight capsule . Each capsule  preferably includes a body portion sized to receive a missile and a detachable nose cone . Capsules  also provide an interface between the missile  and the launch tube  and can be utilized as storage and handling containers for the missiles . In use, the missile  remains within its protective capsule  as the capsule  is ejected from the launch tube  and ascends to the ocean surface. Depending on the weight of the missile , either the capsule  itself or an expandable buoyancy device , such as an inflatable airbag, may be used to float the capsule  and missile  to the ocean surface, as is known in the art. Once the capsule  surfaces, the nose cone of the capsule  is jettisoned to allow the missile to be launched. Once the missile  is launched, the capsule  can either remain on the surface of the water for later recovery, or sink as an expendable item.","The walls of the launch tubes  may preferably be lined with shock mitigation material  to provide shock protection for the missiles  and protective capsules . The material  also compensates for small structural deformations that occur during missile tube  construction and during normal submarine depth pressure excursions. Preferably, the material  is thick enough to maintain sufficient contact with the missile capsules  to prevent free movement, but is not so thick as to adversely restrict the missile capsule  from launching. A gap or clearance is preferably provided between the material and the missile capsule  to allow a controlled amount of water to pass ahead of the capsule  and assist in opening the muzzle closure .","In order to eject the capsules  from the launch tube , a water pump  is preferably supported at the bottom of the large payload pressure vessel , or payload bay. Pump  operation is preferably independent of depth pressure by ensuring the water supply and discharge points are common with the depth pressure. Thus, launch depth is only limited by the capability of the protective capsule . The water pump  preferably draws in seawater from the top of the topmost missile module , and pumps it underneath the capsule  to be ejected. Piping and valving internal to the module group may be utilized to distribute the water to the desired launch tube . The pressure force should be sufficient to overcome the static friction forces and to force the capsule  out of the launch tube . The lower missile capsules  are unaffected by the water pressure due to the seal provided at the hinged muzzle closure , and the latching mechanism  which prevents the lower missile capsules  from being forced downward. The pump  continues to operate until enough water volume has been pumped to flush or eject the capsule  out of the tube . The required water volume will be greatest for the lowest most capsule , and least for the upper most capsule , due to the relative distances each capsule  must travel to exit the launch tube . The water volumes are varied by simply varying the operating time of the pump . Once ejected from the tube , the water pump  may be shut off, and an inflatable airbag can be deployed or the capsules  own buoyancy can be used to carry it to the surface to ascend the capsule  to the ocean surface, as described below. Alternatively, other known devices may be utilized to launch the missiles , as would be known in the art. For example, gas generators may be used in place of the water pump , or air flasks may be utilized, as would be known to those of skill in the art.","An expendable, inflatable underwater airbag may be provided to give the missile capsule  positive buoyancy after the capsule  leaves the launch tube . The airbag may be inflated using a small pre-charged air flask, a COcartridge, or a small air bag inflator\/gas generator, as known in the art. As the pressurized gas is expanded, the capsule  floats to the water's surface. To ensure that the capsule  ascends vertically, the airbag may preferably be attached to the nose cone of the missile capsule . Once on the water's surface, the nose cone may be automatically jettisoned so the missile  can be launched.","Use of the underwater missile launch system will now be described with reference to the FIGURES.","Initially, each individual missile  is positioned within a corresponding protective capsule  that are then loaded vertically into the modular launch tubes , until the hinged portion of the latching mechanism is engaged. Unloading may be accomplished by releasing the latching mechanism and lifting the capsules  back out. The entire module  is then lowered into the payload bay or pressure vessel . Keyed alignments on the outside diameter of the modules  may be provided to ensure the modules  line up with one another as they are lowered in place. In particular, alignment is needed to allow for air pipe and electrical connections between modules . Once properly loaded, the missiles  are ready for launch.","To initiate launch, the submarine should be first positioned at the desired launch depth. The volume of space under the hatch  of the pressure vessel  is then flooded, and the pressure is equalized with ambient seawater conditions. The hatch  of the pressure vessel  is then opened and the water pump  is activated. The water pressure is provided underneath the missile capsule  to be launched. The water pump  continues to operate until the missile capsule  clears the launch tube  of the upper module . Once the capsule  is extended a sufficient predetermined distance from the muzzle  of the upper launch tube , for example, by 50%, the airbag is inflated. The missile  then floats to the water's surface and remains protected inside the missile capsule . Once on the surface, the capsule nose cone is jettisoned. The missiles  own propulsion is then activated to launch the missile  out of the capsule  and to its target. The capsule  may either remain on the surface for recovery\/reuse or sink as an expendable item.","It will be appreciated that the underwater missile launch system disclosed herein provides an effective way of launching missiles  from a submarine which is low in cost to construct and operate, reliable, easy to maintain, and safe. In addition, the system increases packing density that allows submarines to carry larger payloads of missiles . Packing densities are increased by the ability to stack the missiles  two or more high within the same pressure vessel , and by launching more than one missile  from the same launch tube  thus reducing the amount of redundant hardware required per missile . Sharing a common pressure vessel , launch tube , and water pump  also results in a significant cost and weight savings for the submarine. With increased payload packing densities, either more missiles  can be carried on the same size submarine or the same number of missiles  can be carried on a smaller submarine. The system also provides for easy loading and unloading of the missiles  and the missiles  can be loaded\/unloaded individually or as an entire module .","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims. For example, the protective capsules could be eliminated and replaced by a sabot, as would be known to those of skill in the art."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["It should be understood that the drawings are provided for the purpose of illustration only and are not intended to define the limits of the invention.
