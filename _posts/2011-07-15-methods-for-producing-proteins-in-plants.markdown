International Application No. PCT\/EP2011\/062180 also claims priority to European Application No. 10169888.4, filed Jul. 16, 2010.","The present invention relates to methods for expressing proteins of interest, particularly pharmaceutically valuable proteins, transiently in plants.","The large scale production of recombinant proteins is an important application of transgenic plants. Although many plants can be successfully used for production of recombinant proteins, few systems have the potential to produce substantial amounts of a recombinant protein within a short time period.","Transient gene expression in plant cells has been developed as a rapid means to produce small amounts of a given protein and for testing genetic constructs. Methods to transiently produce a protein in a plant cell include for example particle gun delivery of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the gene coding for a desired protein in an expressible manner, -mediated delivery of a binary vector comprising the expressible gene, electroporation of protoplasts, and polyethylene glycol-mediated delivery of naked DNA into plant protoplasts.","Particle bombardment usually reaches only a few cells and the DNA must reach the cell nucleus for transcription to be accomplished, and is thus not very efficient for transient expression.","The use of delivered by infiltration (agro-infiltration) can deliver foreign genes to significantly higher number of cells. The original system of infiltration for transient expression was described by Kapila et al., Plant Sci. 122: 101-108 (1997) and was developed for rapid testing of the functionality of a protein thought to be useful for disease resistance of the plant tissue. For this application the protein would not need to be purified or characterized since the entire plant tissue could be used in a bioassay. This system was later used to express pharmaceutically important proteins (Vaquero et al., Mol. Biotechnol. 5: 209-21 (1996)). However, the production from this system was relatively low.","WO 99\/48355 discloses a method of genetic transformation of plants including the steps of (a) immersing plant tissue in a medium including an infective transformation vector such as ; (b) reducing the pressure on said tissue to \u221210 to \u2212100 kPa gauge; (c) maintaining said pressure for 10 to 60 minutes, and (d) raising said pressure to atmospheric pressure or above, wherein the transformation vector allows selection to identify plant cells or tissues in which the transformation vector is integrated into the genome said plant tissues or cells. It is further disclosed that the plant material may be subjected to alternating cycles of reduced and over pressure, wherein the pressure is set forth to be in a range of 10 to 500 kPa (0.1 to 5 bar).","EP 1 662 002 discloses methods for -mediated gene transduction and transformation comprising preparing plant material, infecting the plant material with carrying a vector containing a desired transgene. It is further part of the method to pressurize the plant material during the process of preparing the plant material, or after preparation, but before infection with the ","WO 01\/12828 describes an apparatus that comprises a vacuum chamber, means for generating a vacuum, and a connector between the vacuum generating means and the vacuum chamber and, further, means for affixing or supporting a plant inside the vacuum chamber.","There is a need for systems and methods that can produce a substantial amount of a recombinant protein at a commercial scale within a short time period, such as for example, subunit vaccines for the prevention of pandemic outbreaks or emerging diseases.","The present invention provides the means and methods to meet this need.

pertinent art of plant biology.","All of the following term definitions apply to the complete content of this application. The word \u201ccomprising\u201d does not exclude other elements or steps, and the indefinite article \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d does not exclude a plurality. A single step may fulfil the functions of several features recited in the claims. The terms \u201cessentially\u201d, \u201cabout\u201d, \u201capproximately\u201d and the like in connection with an attribute or a value particularly also define exactly the attribute or exactly the value, respectively. The term \u201cabout\u201d in the context of a given numerate value or range refers to a value or range that is within 20%, within 10%, within 5%, or within 2% of the given value or range.","A \u201cplant\u201d as used within the present invention refers to an intact plant, a substantially intact plant, or to a plurality of intact or substantially intact plants; a whole plant, a substantially whole plant, or a plurality of whole or substantially whole plants, and its progenies, at any stage of its development.

The plant cell may be in form of a protoplast without a cell wall, an isolated single cell, a cultured cell, or a cell as a part of higher organized unit such as, but not limited to, plant tissue, a plant organ, or a whole plant, including a whole and intact plant.","\u201cPlant tissue\u201d as used herein means a plurality of plant cells that are organized into structural or functional units. This includes any tissue of a plant in planta or in culture.","\u201cPlant organ\u201d as used herein refers to a distinct or a differentiated part of a plant such as but not limited to a root, stem, leaf, flower, flower part, flower bud, embryos, seeds or fruits. This includes any organ of a plant in planta or in culture.","\u201cPlant material\u201d as used within the present invention refers to any solid, liquid or gaseous composition, or a combination thereof, including but not limited to secretions or extracts, obtainable from a plant, its tissues and organs either in planta or in culture, including leaves, stems, roots, flowers or flower parts, fruits, pollen, ovules, zygotes, seeds, cuttings, and any other parts of a plant.","\u201cPlant cell culture\u201d as used within the present invention encompasses cultures of plant cells such as but not limited to, protoplasts, cell culture cells, cells in cultured plant tissues, cells in explants, and pollen cultures.","A \u201ctobacco plant\u201d as used within the present invention refers to a plant of a species belonging to the genus , including but not limited to (or ). Certain embodiments of the invention are described herein using the term \u201ctobacco plant\u201d without specifying , such descriptions are to be construed to have included specifically.","The term \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d is used herein to refer to a polymer of nucleotides, which may be unmodified or modified deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA). Accordingly, a polynucleotide can be, without limitation, a genomic DNA, complementary DNA (cDNA), mRNA, or antisense RNA. Moreover, a polynucleotide can be single-stranded or double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single-stranded and double-stranded regions, a hybrid molecule comprising DNA and RNA, or a hybrid molecule with a mixture of single-stranded and double-stranded regions. In addition, the polynucleotide can be composed of triple-stranded regions comprising DNA, RNA, or both. A polynucleotide can contain one or more modified bases, such as phosphothioates, and can be a peptide nucleic acid (PNA). Generally, polynucleotides provided by this invention can be assembled from isolated or cloned fragments of cDNA, genome DNA, oligonucleotides, or individual nucleotides, or a combination of the foregoing.","The term \u201cnucleotide sequence\u201d refers to the base sequence of a polymer of nucleotides, including but not limited to ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides.","The term \u201cgene sequence\u201d as used herein refers to the nucleotide sequence of a nucleic acid molecule or polynucleotide that encodes a polypeptide or a biologically active RNA, and encompasses the nucleotide sequence of a partial coding sequence that only encodes a fragment of a protein. A gene sequence can also include sequences having a regulatory function on expression of a gene that are located upstream or downstream relative to the coding sequence, and intron sequences of a gene.","The term \u201cpromoter\u201d refers to the nucleotide sequence at the 5\u2032 end of a gene that directs the initiation of transcription of the gene. Generally, promoter sequences are necessary, but not always sufficient, to drive the expression of a gene to which it is operably linked. In the design of an expressible gene construct, the gene is placed in sufficient proximity to and in a suitable orientation relative to a promoter such that the expression of the gene is controlled by the promoter sequence. The promoter is positioned preferentially upstream to the gene and at a distance from the transcription start site that approximates the distance between the promoter and the gene it controls in its natural setting. As is known in the art, some variation in this distance can be tolerated without loss of promoter function. As used herein, the term \u201coperatively linked\u201d means that a promoter is connected to a coding region in such a way that the transcription of that coding region is controlled and regulated by that promoter. Means for operatively linking a promoter to a coding region are well known in the art.","As used herein, an \u201cexpression control sequence\u201d includes a promoter and may include, but is not limited to: one or more enhancer sequences, transcription termination sequences, polyadenylation sequences, 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 untranslated sequences, intronic sequences, ribosome binding sites, and other sequences that may stabilize or otherwise control expression of a gene in a plant cell. Expression control sequences may be endogenous (i.e., naturally found in a plant host) or exogenous (not naturally found in a plant host). Exogenous expression sequences may or may not be plant sequences so long as they are functional in a plant cell under selected conditions.","A \u201cheterologous gene\u201d or \u201cheterologous coding sequence\u201d refers to a gene or coding sequence that is exogenous to, or not naturally found in, the plant to be transformed or treated and that encodes a \u201cheterologous polypeptide\u201d or a biologically active fragment thereof. Heterologous gene sequences include viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic sequences. Prokaryotic encoding sequences include, but are not limited to, microbial sequences, bacterial sequences or viral sequences (e.g., for the production of antigens which may be administered as vaccines). Eukaryotic coding sequences include mammalian or human sequences, but may also include sequences from non-mammals, even other plants, including but not limited to leader or secretion signal sequences, targeting sequences, and the like. In one preferred aspect, a heterologous gene nucleic acid encodes a human protein. The term \u201cheterologous gene\u201d or \u201cheterologous coding sequence\u201d includes, but is not limited to, naturally occurring, mutated, variant, chemically synthesized, genomic, cDNA, or any combination of such sequences. The reference to a \u201cgene\u201d encompasses full-length genes or fragments thereof encoding biologically active proteins.","The term \u201cheterologous peptide\u201d or \u201cheterologous protein\u201d, as used herein, refers to a peptide, including oligo- and polypeptides, or a protein that is expressed from a \u201cheterologous gene\u201d or heterologous coding sequence\u201d as defined above. Accordingly, the \u201cheterologous peptide\u201d or \u201cheterologous protein\u201d produced in a plant is exogenous to, or not naturally found in, the plant. The \u201cheterologous peptide\u201d or \u201cheterologous protein\u201d can be a mammalian or human peptide or protein. The \u201cheterologous peptide\u201d or \u201cheterologous protein\u201d may even be a plant peptide or protein if it is a variant or mutated from of a plant peptide or protein or a peptide or protein not naturally found in the producing plant species, line or variety.","As used herein, a \u201cT DNA border\u201d refers to a DNA fragment comprising an about 25 nucleotide long sequence capable of being recognized by the virulence gene products of an strain, such as an or strain, or a modified or mutated form thereof, and which is sufficient for transfer of a DNA sequence to which it is linked, to eukaryotic cells, preferably plant cells. This definition includes, but is not limited to, all naturally occurring T-DNA borders from wild-type Ti plasmids, as well as any functional derivative thereof, and includes chemically synthesized T-DNA borders. In one aspect, the encoding sequence and expression control sequence of an expression construct according to the invention is located between two T-DNA borders.","The term \u201cselected to provide transient expression\u201d refers to an expression construct that has been specifically designed for transient gene expression in plants, in particular by removing elements of conventional binary vectors necessary for stable transformation such as transformation selection genes (see, e.g., R P Hellens et al, Plant Methods 205, 1: 13).","As used herein, the term \u201csurfactant\u201d refers to a surface-active agent that generally comprises a hydrophobic portion and a hydrophilic portion (see, e.g., Bhairi, A Guide to the Properties and Uses of Detergents in Biological Systems, Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. 1997).","Surfactants may be categorized as anionic, nonionic, zwitterionic, or cationic, depending on whether they comprise one or more charged groups. Anionic surfactants contain a negatively charged group and have a net negative charge. Nonionic surfactants contain non-charged polar groups and have no charge. These surfactants are generally the reaction products of alkylene oxide with alkyl phenol, or primary or secondary alcohols, or are amine oxides, phosphine oxides or dialkyl sulphoxides.","Surfactants that can be suitably used in plant infiltration systems are, for example, disclosed in WO\/2005\/076766.","In particular, exemplary nonionic surfactants include, but are not limited to: t-(Triton X-100), polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20), polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate (Tween 21), polyoxyethylenesorbitan monopalmitate (Tween 40), polyoxyethylenesorbitan monostearate (Tween 60), polyoxyethylenesorbitan monooleate (Tween 80), polyoxyethylenesorbitan monotrioleate (Tween 85), (octylphenoxy) polyethoxyethanol (IGEPAL CA-630\/NP-40), triethyleneglycol monolauryl ether (Brij 30), and sorbitan monolaurate (Span 20).","A zwitterionic surfactant contains both a positively charged group and a negatively charged group, and has no net charge.

Preferably, concentrations range from 0.005% to about 0.5%, and more preferably, from about 0.005% to about 0.05%. Generally, lower levels of ionic surfactants will be used than nonionic surfactants.","The term \u201cvacuum infiltration\u201d, as used herein, relates to a method that allows the penetration of pathogenic bacteria, e.g. , into the intercellular or interstitial spaces and in that way to study the interaction between plants and pathogenic bacteria. Physically, vacuum generates a negative atmospheric pressure that causes the air spaces between the cells in the plant tissue to decrease. The longer the duration and the lower the pressure of the vacuum, the less air space there is within the plant tissue. An increase in the pressure allows the infiltration medium, including the infective transformation vector, to relocate into the plant tissue. For plant transformation, vacuum can be applied to a plant part in the presence of for a certain time period.","As used herein, the term \u201catmospheric pressure\u201d defines a force per unit area exerted against a surface by the weight of air above that surface in the Earth's atmosphere. Pressure is a force, or weight, exerted on a surface per unit area, and is measured in Pascals (Pa). The pressure exerted by a kilogram mass on a surface equals 9.8 Pa. The pressure exerted by the whole atmosphere on the Earth's surface is approximately 100,000 Pa. Usually, atmospheric pressure is quoted in millibars (mb). 1 mb is equal to 100 Pa, so standard atmospheric pressure is about 1000 mb. In fact, actual values of atmospheric pressure vary depending on the location, altitude and weather conditions. At sea level, commonly observed values range between 970 mb and 1040 mb. Because pressure decreases with altitude, pressure observed at various locations must be adjusted to the same level, usually sea level.","A pressure exerted on an enclosed fluid at rest in a closed container, is transmitted without loss to every portion of the fluid and to the walls of the container. For a fluid at rest the difference in pressure between two points in it depends only upon the density of the fluid and the difference in depth between the two points. Accordingly, a fluid exerts a pressure on all bodies immersed in it, which is equal to the externally applied pressure on the top of the fluid plus the static fluid pressure from the weight of the liquid.","Technical and scientific terms used herein have the meanings commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention pertains, unless otherwise defined. Reference is made herein to various methodologies known to those of skill in the art. Publications and other materials setting forth such known methodologies to which reference is made are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties as though set forth in full. The practice of the invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of chemistry, molecular biology, microbiology, and plant biology, which are within the skill of the art.","Any suitable materials and\/or methods known to those of skill can be utilized in carrying out the present invention: however, preferred materials and\/or methods are described. Materials, reagents and the like to which reference is made in the following description and examples are obtainable from commercial sources, unless otherwise noted.","The present invention relates to systems and methods for expressing peptides and\/or proteins of interest, particularly for expressing pharmaceutically valuable peptides and\/or proteins, transiently in plants. In particular, the invention provides an improved method for introducing cells into a whole and intact plant, or a plurality of whole plants, or a part of a whole and intact plant including a plant organ or tissue in planta. The method of the invention provides efficient agroinfiltration of many plants singly or simultaneously resulting in a yield of recombinant proteins that is higher than that obtained by other methods. The methods can be readily scaled and automated to meet changing demands of the recombinant protein.","Agroinfiltration of plants is currently performed according to one of these two methods.","The first method uses a syringe filled with a suspension of cells, and injecting each individual leaf with bacteria. The syringe is positioned on the underside of the leaf, and the plunger is gently pushed such that the bacteria suspension spreads throughout the leaf. This method is laborious and not amenable to scaling up.","The second method involves using a vacuum to assist the uptake of the bacteria by the plant. Typically, a plant is placed upside down inside a chamber and its leaves are wholly immersed in a bacterial suspension. The pressure in the chamber is brought to about a few tenths of millibar. The air is initially withdrawn from the leaf by the vacuum, and when air is reintroduced, the leaf draws in the liquid. The vacuum process has at least two disadvantages, it is slow as it takes several minutes to bring the pressure down to a desirably low pressure. The vacuum generates certain non-negligible stress on the infiltrated plants that results in the plants having difficulties to recover from or to survive the infiltration process.","In one aspect, the invention provides an improved method for introducing cells into a whole plant, or a plurality of whole plants, particularly a whole and intact plant or part of a whole and intact plant including a plant organ or plant tissue in planta. The method of the invention provides positive fluid pressure, or a combination or positive and negative fluid pressure, to facilitate cells to infiltrate a whole plant, or the plurality of whole plants, particularly a whole and intact plant or a part of a whole and intact plant including a plant organ or plant tissue in planta, unlike methods known in the art which use a vacuum or negative pressure. The invention also provides systems and means for delivering positive fluid pressure to whole plants, or a plurality of whole plants, particularly whole and intact plants or a part of a whole and intact plant including plant organs or plant tissues in planta that are or have been contacted with cells.","According to the invention, positive fluid pressure is delivered when the whole plant, or the plurality of whole plants, particularly the whole and intact plant or a part of the whole and intact plant, and bacteria are subjected to treatment with one or more pressure cycle(s) under closed conditions. Fluid pressure is the pressure at some point within a fluid, such as water or air. For example, under a closed condition, the volume in which the fluid is contained is constant. In various embodiments of the invention, specifications of the fluid pressure refer to the air pressure within a chamber of a fixed volume.","A fluid pressure is referred to as a positive pressure when it is greater than the ambient air pressure outside of the closed system, at the location where the method of the invention is practiced. Positive pressure or overpressure is provided when the whole plant, or the plurality of whole plants, particularly the whole and intact plant or a part of the whole and intact plant including a plant organ or plant tissue in planta, and bacteria have been exposed to a target pressure that is higher than ambient air pressure. The terms overpressure and positive pressure are herein used interchangeably. Ambient air pressure varies depending on the altitude at the location where the method is practiced and on the weather conditions at the time when the method is practiced, and can be readily determined by techniques and equipment known in the art.","Many units can be used to express the value of a pressure. For example, the bar is a unit of pressure equal to 100 kilopascal, and roughly equal to the atmospheric pressure on Earth at sea level. Atmospheric air pressure is often given in millibars where standard sea level pressure (1 atm) is defined as 1013.25 mbar (hPa), equal to 1.01325 bar.","Positive pressure values useful in the invention can thus be expressed in terms of a percentage value of the ambient air pressure, for example and without limitation, 110%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 250%, 300%, 350%, 400%, 350%, 500%, 550%, 600%, 650%, 700%, 750%, 800%, 850%, 900%, 950%, 1000%, 1050%, 1110%, 1150%, 1200%, or any intermediate value, or any value greater than the foregoing. A similar convention can be used for describing negative pressure which is a pressure value lower than the ambient air pressure.","A positive pressure can alternatively be expressed in terms of an absolute value, for example and without limitation, 1.1 atm, 1.5 atm, 2 atm, 2.5 atm, 3 atm, 3.5 atm, 4 atm, 4.5 atm, 5 atm, 5.5 atm, 6 atm, 6.5 atm, 7 atm, 7.5 atm, 8 atm, 8.5 atm, 9 atm, 9.5 atm, 10 atm, 10.5 atm, 11 atm, 11.5 atm, 12 atm, and so on; or 1.1 bar, 1.5 bar, 2 bar, 2.5 bar, 3 bar, 3.5 bar, 4 bar, 4.5 bar, 5 bar, 5.5 bar, 6 bar, 6.5 bar, 7 bar, 7.5 bar, 8 bar, 8.5 bar, 9 bar, 9.5 bar, 10 bar, 10.5 bar, 11 bar, 11.5 bar, 12 bar, or any intermediate value, or any value greater than the foregoing. Where an ambient air pressure is not provided for comparison in a description herein, the ambient air pressure is intended to be standard atmospheric pressure on Earth at sea level.","The term \u201cpressure cycle\u201d used herein refers to a series of changes in pressure over a period of time. In one embodiment, a pressure cycle comprises a target pressure, that is, the pressure that is to be reached within a given time period. For example, during a pressure cycle, a desired pressure in a chamber starts from being in equilibrium with ambient air pressure, changes to the target pressure, and returns to ambient air pressure. Accordingly, a chamber used in the invention can start a pressure cycle by increasing pressure above atmospheric air and end a pressure cycle by equilibrating with atmospheric air.","In various embodiments of the invention, the start pressure and end pressure may be different, and may each be different from the ambient air pressure. For example, a pulse of positive air pressure is a single pressure cycle. A pressure cycle may in certain embodiments comprise multiple target pressures, e.g., a first target pressure, a second target pressure, a third target pressure, and so on. Thus, different pressure cycles may each have a different start pressure and an end pressure, and any number of discrete intermediate target pressures or a continuous transition from a start pressure to an end pressure.","In the methods of the invention, a plurality of different pressure cycles can be applied and each can be applied one or more times, such as but not limited to two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten times. Accordingly, in a method of the invention or even in a pressure cycle, the variation of pressure over time can be expressed by a graph or a waveform, such as a sine wave, a square wave, a triangle wave, or a sawtooth wave, or any waveform that approximates one of the foregoing.","In various embodiments of the invention, any specifications of the fluid pressure in terms of duration or extent refer to the overall duration of the pressure cycle and the peak value of the pressure applied to the whole and intact plant, or the plurality of whole plants, or a part of the whole and intact plant. For example, a reference to a pressure cycle comprising treating a whole plant or a plant part with a pressure of at least 4.5 bar for 0.5 seconds, means that the overall duration of the pressure applied to the plant is 0.5 seconds, which may include a period of increasing pressure above atmospheric air and of ending the pressure cycle by equilibrating with atmospheric air, with a peak value of 4.5 bar.","Preferably, a pressure cycle of the invention comprises a target pressure that is a positive pressure. In certain embodiments, the method of the invention does not comprise a target pressure that is a negative pressure. In other embodiments, the methods of the invention comprise a first target pressure that is a positive pressure, as well as a second target pressure that is a negative pressure. In other embodiments, the methods of the invention comprise a first target pressure that is a negative pressure, as well as a second target pressure that is a positive pressure. An optional rest period can be included in the method of the invention between pressure cycles.","Such a rest period may last for about 0.01, 0.05, 0, 1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0, 5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, or 5 and up to 10 or more seconds.","In certain embodiments, cells comprising the expression construct are infiltrated into a whole plant, or a plurality of whole plants, particularly a whole and intact plant or a part of a whole and intact plan, including a plant organ or plant tissue in planta. In one embodiment, the infiltration is carried our in the presence of a surfactant, including anionic, cationic, non-ionic, and zwitterionic surfactants.","Non-limiting examples of a surfactant that can be used are Triton X-100 or Silwet L-77, a strong surfactant that shows relatively low toxicity to plants.","After incubating the plant or plant tissue under suitable conditions that allow the expression construct to express the peptide or protein of interest in a plurality of plant cells, the protein can be detected and quantified in the plant or plant part such as the plant organ or plant tissue or in the cells thereof. After harvesting, peptide or protein isolation may be performed using methods routine in the art. For example, at least a portion of the biomass may be homogenized, and recombinant peptide or protein extracted and further purified. Extraction may comprise soaking or immersing the homogenate in a suitable solvent. Purification methods include, but are not limited to, immunoaffinity purification and purification procedures based on the specific size of a peptide, protein or protein complex, electrophoretic mobility, biological activity, and\/or net charge of the peptide or protein to be isolated, or based on the presence of a tag molecule in the protein. Characterization of the isolated peptide or protein can be conducted by immunoassay or by other methods known in the art. For example, peptides or proteins can be analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels by Western blotting, or by Coomassie blue staining when the peptide or protein is substantially purified.","In another embodiment of the invention, systems are provided to treat intact whole plants, particularly whole and intact plants or a plant parts such as plant organs or plant tissues that have been contacted with cells upon application of positive fluid pressure. The systems of the invention comprise a chamber for receiving a whole plant, particularly a whole and intact plant or a plant part such as a plant organ or plant tissue, or a plurality of such whole plants or plant parts, and a means for delivering positive fluid pressure. The chamber can be made of any materials known in the art that maintains a definite shape for the purpose of the invention and is not permeable to fluids used in the invention. The chamber comprises a plurality of inlets and outlets, including at least one opening through which a whole plant or plant part such as a plant tissue can be received and retrieved, and the pressure in the chamber is regulated. In certain embodiments, the chamber comprises an opening and a cover adapted for a sealing engagement with the chamber to close the chamber, means forming a valve opening through the side of the chamber or the cover, and a fastening means for releasably maintaining the chamber and the cover in the sealing engagement to a locking position; and at least one flexible valve means, mounted with respect to the valve opening, for providing a fluid path between the interior and exterior of the chamber.","The systems can optionally provide a means whereby a plurality of whole plants or plant parts are contacted with cells. Preferably, the contacting of the whole plants or plant parts with the cells is performed in the chamber where the positive pressure is delivered. Positive fluid pressure can be delivered by any means known in the art.","In one embodiment, the invention provides that a whole and intact plant is positioned upside down inside a chamber and its leaves are wholly immersed in a liquid comprising cells. The chamber is connected to a source of compressed air through a pressure reducer via an inlet valve. The chamber also comprises a release valve installed on one wall, preferably the lid of the chamber. The pressure reducer and the inlet valve are used to regulate the pressure in the chamber, such that one or more of the target pressure(s) can be attained in the chamber. For example, to initiate delivery of a positive pressure, the chamber is closed, the inlet valve is switched to off and the pressure reducer is set to a target pressure. After the plant is immersed in the liquid, the inlet valve is opened for a first period of time sufficient for the chamber to reach the target pressure and a second period of time when the target pressure is maintained in the chamber. After the periods of time have elapsed, the inlet valve is closed, and the release valve is opened allowing the chamber to return to ambient air pressure.","In another embodiment, the invention provides that a whole and intact plant is positioned inside a chamber that comprises a plurality of nozzles and a release valve on the sides of the chamber. The nozzles are connected to a common manifold which in turn is connected via a first inlet valve to a reservoir of a liquid comprising cells. A source of compressed air is connected to the nozzles though a pressure reducer and a second pressure valve. The pressure reducer is used to set the target pressure that is to be attained in the chamber. For example, to initiate delivery of a positive pressure, the chamber is closed, the inlet valve, the pressure valve and the release value are all closed and the pressure reducer is set to a target pressure. Then, the inlet valve and the pressure valve are opened coordinately such that the liquid comprising the bacteria is atomized or aerosolized by the compressed air, and sprayed through the nozzles onto the plant inside the chamber. The inlet valve and pressure valve, or the pressure valve are opened for a first period of time sufficient for the chamber to reach the target pressure and a second period of time when the target pressure is maintained in the chamber. After the periods of time have elapsed, the inlet valve and\/or the pressure valve are closed, and the release valve is opened allowing the chamber to return to ambient air pressure.","In other embodiments of the invention, it is contemplated that liquid fluid pressure (or hydraulic pressure) is applied to an enclosed volume of infiltration medium in which a whole and intact plant or a part of a whole and intact plant is submerged. Liquid fluid pressure can be supplied by any conventional means, such as but not limited to hydraulic pumps including gear pump, vane pump, and piston pump.","In addition to the above equipment, the systems of the invention may further comprise various other equipment, such as valves (e.g., relief valves, check valves, manual valves, actuated valves, needle valves, and the like, as well as combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing valves), filters (e.g., bacterial filters, particle filters, and the like as well as combinations thereof), sensors (e.g., pressure, temperature, flow, humidity, conductivity, gas mixture, liquid level, and the like, as well as combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing sensors), controls for temperature (such as, heaters, heat exchangers, coolers, dryers, and the like), controls for pressure (such as, compressors, and the like), flow controls (such as, pumps, fans, blowers, and the like), as well as combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing controls, and conduits (e.g., fluid conduits, electrical conduits, and the like), as well as combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing conduits.","In addition to the above equipment, the systems of the invention can optionally further comprise means for transporting a plurality of whole plants or plant parts such as plant organs or plant tissues from a location to the chamber, means for facilitating the contact of a plurality of whole plants or plant tissues with cells, means for receiving a plurality of whole plants or plant tissues in the chamber, means for positioning and repositioning the plurality of whole plants or plant parts such as plant organs or plant tissues in the chamber, means for retrieving the plurality of whole plants or plant parts from the chamber. Preferably, one or more of the foregoing means are automated electro-mechanical systems, and include but are not limited to motorized transport systems, factory automation systems, security systems, process control systems, data communication systems, data storage systems and computing systems.","In one embodiment of the invention, the chamber comprises means for receiving and positioning a plurality of whole and intact plants within the chamber such that the entire plant comes into contact with the infiltration medium containing the cells. In particular, the plurality of plants is positioned such that the entire plant body including its aerial and underground parts is submerged in the infiltration medium containing the cells. In this configuration, the entire plant including the aerial parts as well as the underground parts of the plant comes into contact with the infiltration medium containing the cells. The submerged plants are subjected to one or more pressure cycle(s), wherein at least one of the pressure cycle(s) comprises an increase in pressure relative to atmospheric pressure and, in a specific embodiment, the pressure is maintained for a period of between 0.5 seconds and 60 seconds. During one or more pressure cycle(s), the chamber is closed and sealed, preferably with no or negligible air within it, such that when the pressure is applied onto the enclosed infiltration medium, the chamber becomes pressurized due to resistance from the walls of the chamber and a substantially uniform pressure is transmitted throughout the chamber containing the submerged plants. In this configuration, the pressure acting on the submerged plants is substantially the same as that applied to the system.","In another embodiment of the invention, the chamber comprises means for receiving and positioning a plurality of whole and intact plants within the chamber such that only part of the plant comes into contact with the infiltration medium containing the cells.

In this configuration, the pressure acting on the submerged plants is substantially the same as that applied to the system.","To accommodate aerial parts of whole and intact plant(s) inside a chamber while the underground parts are positioned outside the chamber, one side, typically the top, of the chamber may comprise one or more openings to allow passage of aerial parts of the plants during insertion or removal. The dimensions of an opening are variable due to the presence of parts of the whole and intact plant in the opening. The opening is lined with elastic seals such that the opening can be closed despite the variable dimensions of the opening. The elasticity of the seals may help to protect the plant parts from mechanical damage. Typically, whole intact plants are positioned such that the seal is formed around the main stems due to the elasticity of the seals. The elastic seals can be configured to oppose and slide towards each other to close the opening effectively forming a temporarily airtight or waterproof junction.

Along the edge of the circular opening, a single annular seal may be provided that is inflatable to such extent that it closes the entire opening of the chamber around the stem of the plant such as to provide airtight or waterproof seal.","In a particular embodiment, the invention provides elastic pneumatic or hydraulic seals, wherein the seals each comprise a cavity in which are introduced compressed air or an inert gas or a hydraulic fluid under an inflation pressure. The inflation pressure causes the otherwise deflated seal to expand flexibly into the gaps that exist between the seal and a part of a whole intact plant, effectively forming a temporarily airtight or waterproof junction. In one particular configuration, at least two opposing seals line an opening in which are positioned the main stem of one or more whole intact plants. Upon inflation, the opposing seals expand into the space between them, until they push against each other and trap the main stem(s) of the plants between them to form a temporarily airtight or waterproof junction. Once the seal inflation pressure is removed, the seal returns to its deflated position, effectively relieving the pressure inside the chamber. It is contemplated that, in one embodiment, the application of inflation pressure to the elastic seals and application of hydraulic pressure to the infiltration medium in the chamber can be sequenced. Preferably, the application of inflation pressure to the elastic seals is in advance of the application of hydraulic pressure such that a junction is formed before the chamber becomes pressurized.","Compressed air is commonly utilized as the inflation medium while in some applications hydraulic (liquid) means may be applied. Inflatable seals offer versatile configurations in three different planes: radially in, radially out, and axially. Seals in the form of trips can form closed ends, mitered ends, and continuous loops.

It is a particular advantage of the invention that already grown plants can be used in the methods of the invention or used as a source of plant tissues.","The invention provides systems and methods that make it possible to take advantage of protein production in grown, commercially available plants, tobacco in particular, and provides a novel solution to the problem of procuring the necessary amounts of recombinant heterologous peptides or proteins for therapeutic or prophylactic uses in a short period of time.","In one aspect of the invention, the method comprises introducing an expression construct comprising a sequence encoding a heterologous peptide or protein of interest or biologically active fragment thereof into a whole plant or plant part such as a plant tissue and transiently expressing the protein in the plant or plant part. The encoding sequence is operably finked to an expression control sequence capable of driving transcription of the encoding sequence in the cells and\/or in the extracellular spaces of the plant or plant part.

Preferably, the plant comprises relatively large leaves (e.g., greater than about 7-8 cm in at least one dimension), e.g., ).","The expression construct may be part of an expression vector and can include additional desirable sequences such as bacterial origins of replication (and\/or origins of replication), reporter genes that function in bacteria such as and\/or plant cells (e.g., GUS, GFP, EGFP, BFP, beta-galactosidase and modified forms thereof) and selectable marker genes (e.g., antibiotic resistance genes, and the like). To this end, the foreign DNA used in the method of this invention may also comprise a marker gene, the expression of which allows the separation of transformed cells from non-transformed cells during initial cloning stages. Such a marker gene generally encodes a protein which allows one to phenotypically distinguish transformed cells from untransformed cells. However, it is an advantage of the transient protein production methods according to the invention that marker genes are not required to isolate heterologous peptides or proteins from plant tissues into which expression constructs\/vectors are introduced.","The expression constructs may further be complemented with a silencing suppressor, particularly a viral silencing suppressors, including, without being limited to, the p25 protein of PVX, the P1-HcPro protein of tobacco etch virus, and the p19 protein of tomato bushy stunt virus.","As used herein, level of transient expression refers to the capacity to express of at least about 250 microgram, at least about 500 microgram, at least about 750 microgram, at least about 1 mg, at least about 2 mg, at least about 3 mg, at least about 4 mg, at least about 5 mg, at least about 10 mg, at least about 15 mg, at least about 25 mg, at least about 50 mg, at least about 75 mg, at least about 100 mg, at least about 150 mg, at least about 200 mg, at least about 500 mg, at least about 1000 mg, at least about 1.5 g, at least about 2 g, at least about 2.5 g, at least about 5 g, at least about 7.5 g, at least about 10 g, at least about 15 g, or at least about 20 g per kg of plant tissue mass.

This curve was obtained by reading fluorescence on a Modulus microplate reader (Turner Biosystems) in Fluorescence mode with Blue optical kit from 200 \u03bcL of standard dilutions of TurboGFP control protein (rTurbo GFP, Evrogen #FP552) in plant extract (mock extract from N.b. leaf sample infiltrated with A17 only that does not express TurboGFP) prepared as indicated in the table. Each dilution was read in triplicates and the standard error of the mean (SE) calculated (<0.01\u00d710\u2032000 fluorescence units, not represented). This standard curve was used to quantify TurboGFP concentration in soluble extracts prepared from infiltrated plant material expressing TurboGFP.","Total soluble protein in the extracts was determined using the Coomassie-Plus Assay reagent from Pierce (#24236) by absorbance measurement on a microplate reader at 595 nm. Extracts were diluted 1:10 or 1:20 in ultrapure water and 10 \u03bcL were loaded in triplicate on a flat-bottom microplate. A standard curve was prepared from serial dilutions of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in a concentration range of 100 to 400 \u03bcg\/mL. Results were considered to be valid when variation coefficient (CV) between triplicates was below 8%.","Results","A first infiltration experiment was performed to compare the efficiency of infiltration by vacuum (50 mbar absolute) with positive pressure values ranging from 0.5 bar to 2.5 bar (Table 3).","Efficiency of infiltration was first assessed by looking at the distribution of the inoculum over the leaf area just after infiltration. When observing the abaxial side of the leaves, infiltrated areas appear as dark green. In plants infiltrated by vacuum, almost 100% of the area of all leaves was uniformly infiltrated. Plants infiltrated using positive pressure ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 bar showed a very patchy distribution of inoculum over the leaf area. Bottom leaves were less infiltrated. Plants infiltrated using positive pressure values ranging from 2.0 to 2.5 bar showed a more uniform distribution of the inoculum although infiltration was not as complete as in plants infiltrated by vacuum.","A second experiment was performed using positive pressures ranging from 1.5 bar to 3.5 bar (table 4) to improve the penetration of the inoculum inside the leaf. The addition of 0.01% Triton X-100 to the inoculum in combination with 2.5 bar overpressure condition was also tested. Addition of detergents has been reported to enhance efficiency of infiltration and -mediated transient expression in several plant systems. Three control conditions were used: plants infiltrated by vacuum at 50 mbar, with or without 0.01% Triton X-100, and by syringe.","In this second experiment, the plants used had reached a more advanced developmental stage (stage 10, average 16.5 cm height compared to only 6.5 cm in the first experiment corresponding to a stage 8) with more expanded leaves. Plants were generally better infiltrated than during the first experiment even at the lowest positive pressure used which was at 1.5 bar. There may be two main reasons to this: 1) for practical reasons, the size of the plants made it easier to ensure that all leaves were fully immersed in the inoculum in the overpressure tank and 2) expanded leaves may have been more efficiently infiltrated because of the structure of the leaf tissues with more void in the intercellular space facilitating the spread of the inoculum. A trend was detected as it was first noticed in the first experiment wherein the higher the overpressure, the more uniform and complete the infiltration. Plants infiltrated with 3.0 or 3.5 bar showed a very uniform distribution of the inoculum that seemed comparable to that of plants infiltrated by vacuum. No clear effect of the use of 0.01% Triton-X100 could be detected at this stage.","The phenotype of the plants during the recovery and incubation phase after infiltration was monitored. At the time of harvest, a slight decrease in chlorophyll content (not quantified) was visible in infiltrated leaves, i.e. a paler green colour, independently of the conditions used for infiltration. No other stress-related signs such as wilting, severe chlorosis or necrosis were observed in any of the infiltration conditions.","Expression of TurboGFP in the plants co-infiltrated with A91 and A17 was regularly monitored during the incubation phase (from 2 days post infiltration to the day of harvest) by placing the plants in a black box under blue light and observing or imaging the fluorescence from the TurboGFP with an amber filter. Leaf areas where GFP is expressed emit green fluorescence. Leaf areas where no or low concentrations of GFP are expressed appear in red due to natural autofluorescence from plant tissues.","For all infiltration conditions, low GFP expression was already visible at 2 days post-infiltration and increased with time in infiltrated leaves whilst at the same time, plants continued to develop and newly expanded leaves at the apex that had not been infiltrated did not show GFP fluorescence and appeared in red. In the first and second experiment (not shown as due to the size of the plants, imaging of whole plants was not technically feasible), clear differences in GFP expression were visible between plants infiltrated in different conditions.","These differences may be observed more easily from images of detached leaves taken on the day of harvest. In the first experiment, a very patchy pattern of GFP fluorescence was observed from leaves of plants infiltrated using the lowest overpressure (0.5 to 1.5 bars) with a very weak fluorescence from bottom leaves. A brighter GFP fluorescence was observed from leaves of plants infiltrated by vacuum than from leaves of plants infiltrated in any of the positive pressure conditions including the highest value of 2.5 bar. In this experiment using small plants (average 6.5 cm height), only a small number of leaves (generally 4-6) per plant showed GFP fluorescence at the time of harvest and were collected for quantitation.","Quantitation was performed after total soluble protein extraction from frozen powder obtained from the leaves collected for each plant. Results and statistical analysis (Tables 6 and 7) clearly show that GFP expression in plants infiltrated by positive pressure was significantly lower than that in plants infiltrated by vacuum even at the highest overpressure used in this experiment (2.5 bar). A general trend also appeared: the higher the overpressure used the higher the GFP expression in infiltrated leaves.","It was already noted that plants used in the second experiment were at a more advanced developmental stage (Stage 10, average 16.5 cm height) and were generally better infiltrated than during the first experiment. This was reflected by the number of leaves effectively expressing TurboGFP and collected for each plant by a higher yield of the TurboGFP per unit of biomass which on average was two times higher than the yield obtained in the first experiment. It is important to note that less material was collected from syringe-infiltrated plants since only expanded leaves could be infiltrated by this method resulting in overall less infiltrated leaves than with the other method. Quantitation data (tables 8 to 10) indicate that TurboGFP expression in plants infiltrated with an overpressure of 3.0 bar was not significantly different from that in plants infiltrated by syringe or vacuum (without Triton). Differences in expression in plants infiltrated with pressure values ranging from 2.0 to 3.0 bars were not statistically significant. However, a significantly lower GFP expression was observed in plants infiltrated with 1.5 bar. Addition of 0.01% Triton X-100 to the inoculum lead to a significant but moderate increase (<15% increase per plant) in TurboGFP accumulation in plants infiltrated by vacuum. The effect of adding 0.01% Triton X-100 in conjunction with a positive pressure at 2.5 bar was not as clear.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0206","num":"0212"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

the currently used method of vacuum infiltration when the biomass used has reached the developmental stage currently used for Agro-infiltration (stage 10, 5-6 week-old plants, height of around 15 cm, well expanded leaves and maximum one flower open). Efficiency of infiltration by overpressure was lower than that of infiltration by vacuum when overpressures of 1.5 bar or lower were used or when the plants used for infiltration were at a younger developmental stage i.e. stage 8.","No adverse effect in terms of visible signs of plant stress of using positive pressures as high as 3.5 bar were observed during recovery and incubation post-infiltration.","Given the possibility to use purpose-built equipment, overpressure has the potential to considerably reduce infiltration cycle time as the overpressure brought to the tank by compressed air and the infiltration itself are almost instantaneous (here the positive pressure was maintained for 10 sec) whilst a complete vacuum cycle takes on average 4 to 5 minutes.","The addition of 0.01% triton to the infiltration solution did not improve the efficiency of the infiltration by overpressure at the pressure tested of 2.5 bar. However, use of this detergent at the same concentration during vacuum infiltration led to a significant increase of the expression of GFP in infiltrated leaves.","A direct comparison of vacuum infiltration and the methods of the invention using positive pressure was conducted for the three tobacco varieties. In this experiment a total of 150 tobacco plants (50 per each tobacco variety) were germinated and grown under standard greenhouse conditions: 24\u00b0 C. and 20 hours light. plants were transformed with cultures (Agl1) containing the green fluorescent protein TurboGFP in combination with a suppressor of silencing (SoS) from a tobacco virus. Vacuum infiltration was applied using a commonly used set of conditions (50 mbar, 60 seconds holding time) and 7 different positive pressure conditions. Particularly, two factors\u2014the positive pressure values [1.5-4.5 bar] and the number of pressure cycles (\u201cpulses\u201d) [1-8] were tested while the pressure holding time\/pulse was kept to 1 second to keep the total process time to its minimum.","Infiltrated plants were harvested 5 days after infiltration and GFP expression analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative estimations of GFP were performed by photographing the leaves after infiltration under blue light. Quantitative analysis of GFP abundance in leaves was determined by fluorescence measurement on a Modulus microplate reader (Turner Biosystems) in Fluorescence mode with Blue optical kit (Ex: 490 nm\/Em: 510-570 nm). Leaf disks of approximately 80 mg were collected with a hole puncher from three leaves per plant (fully expanded leaves from positions 1-3, were 0 represents the shoot apical meristem) for all the treated plants. Samples from the three leaves of a single plant were pooled then ground in a TissueLyser (Qiagen) for approximately 2.5 minutes in the presence of 1 mL of GFP extraction buffer (50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). 10 \u03bcL of the supernatant was diluted 1:20 with the GFP extraction buffer and fluorescence quantified. GFP concentration was calculated using a standard curve made with commercial Evrogen tGFP protein. The standard curve was prepared by adding different amounts of TurboGFP control protein (Turbo GFP, Evrogen #FP552) to GFP-free leaves extracts diluted 1:40 in extraction buffer.","A separate two-way ANOVA for each variety was conducted to test the equality of Fluorescence means and to check if there is significant evidence of interactions and main effects. No significant evidence of a Pressure*Pulses interaction for an alpha level of 0.05 (standard level of risk for type I error), but significant evidence of Pressure and Pulses main effects for plant 1 and plant 2, and only of Pressure main effect for plant 3.
