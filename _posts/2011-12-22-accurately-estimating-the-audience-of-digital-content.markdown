{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["In the field of traditional print publishing, publishers of magazines and other periodicals typically sell advertising based on an estimated \u201ctotal audience\u201d reached by a particular publication. The estimated total audience differs from the number of copies printed or sold because each copy may be accessed by multiple people during its lifespan. Therefore, to calculate the total audience, print publishers have historically relied on surveys or panels to estimate the number of people reached by a single copy of the publication. The estimated number of readers per copy is then extrapolated to the total circulation. For example, if a particular issue sells 100,000 copies, and if reader surveys find that a single copy reaches 2.1 people on average, then the total audience may be estimated to be 210,000 individuals. However, because of flaws inherent to the survey-based methodology that is used to collect reader information, the current audience calculations may be flawed and inaccurate measures of the true audience reached by a publication.","Many publishers are now creating digital editions of their traditional print publications. The digital editions are distributed through digital channels and read on digital devices (e.g., tablet devices, personal computers, e-readers, mobile phones, laptop computers, etc.). To measure the circulation of these digital editions, a cookie or device identifier associated with each digital reader may be passed to an analytic system along with usage information when the digital readers access digital content. Other measures of circulation may be based on the number of digital periodical copies sold to readers. However, while these existing measures may be effective at determining the total number of copies that are distributed, the existing measures do not provide the total audience of a digital magazine. In particular, the existing measures do not account for the possibility of multiple people accessing the same digital content on the same device.","For example, a household of three people may have a single tablet device that is shared by all members of the household. Digital magazine purchases delivered to the tablet device may be accessed by all three people within the household. Although the audience for the digital magazine may include all three people who access the digital edition on the tablet device, the existing measures of circulation would attribute all usage on a single device to a single user. Therefore, the existing measures would incorrectly increment the \u201ccirculation\u201d or \u201cunique users\u201d metric by 1 instead of 3. Even the \u201cfingerprinting\u201d of browser software to identify unique instances may fail to provide an accurate measure of circulation when multiple people are sharing a unique instance of the browser. While the traditional method of using surveys and panels may be used instead of digital measures to calculate the true audience, the use of such surveys will be just as flawed and inaccurate for digital content as for print content. Without having an accurate measure of the true audience size of a digital publication, publishers may be unable to demonstrate the true value of their digital publication content to prospective advertisers.","Various embodiments of systems, methods, and computer-readable storage media for accurately estimating the audience of digital content are disclosed. A plurality of user interactions occurring on a digital device may be received while a digital content is displayed on the digital device. For example, the user interactions may be received by a server over a network. Based on the plurality of user interactions, a total number of unique viewers of the digital content on the digital device may be estimated.","In one embodiment, each of the plurality of user interactions may be classified into a respective one of a plurality of usage factors, and a score may be assigned to each of the plurality of usage factors based on the plurality of user interactions. The plurality of usage factors may be determined based on the capabilities of the digital device. A weight may also be assigned to each of the plurality of usage factors. A plurality of behavioral fingerprints may then be determined based on the respective score and respective weight assigned to each of the plurality of usage factors. The total number of unique viewers of the digital content on the digital device may be estimated by determining the number of behavioral fingerprints found in the user interactions on the digital device.","In one embodiment, a particular viewer of the unique viewers may be assigned to a usage segment based on a similarity between the user interactions for the particular viewer and additional user interactions for additional viewers already assigned to the usage segment. In response to assigning the first viewer to the usage segment, the digital content on the digital device may be modified.","While the invention is described herein by way of example for several embodiments and illustrative drawings, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention is not limited to the embodiments or drawings described. It should be understood, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention. The headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not meant to be used to limit the scope of the description. As used throughout this application, the word \u201cmay\u201d is used in a permissive sense (i.e., meaning \u201chaving the potential to\u201d), rather than the mandatory sense (i.e., meaning \u201cmust\u201d). Similarly, the words \u201cinclude,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d and \u201cincludes\u201d mean \u201cincluding, but not limited to.\u201d","In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of claimed subject matter. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, methods, apparatuses or systems that would be known by one of ordinary skill have not been described in detail so as not to obscure claimed subject matter.","Some portions of the detailed description that follow are presented in terms of algorithms or symbolic representations of operations on binary digital signals stored within a memory of a specific apparatus or special purpose computing device or platform. In the context of this particular specification, the term specific apparatus or the like includes a general-purpose computer once it is programmed to perform particular functions pursuant to instructions from program software. Algorithmic descriptions or symbolic representations are examples of techniques used by those of ordinary skill in the signal processing or related arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and is generally, considered to be a self-consistent sequence of operations or similar signal processing leading to a desired result. In this context, operations or processing involve physical manipulation of physical quantities. Typically, although not necessarily, such quantities may take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared or otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to such signals as bits, data, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, numerals or the like. It should be understood, however, that all of these or similar terms are to be associated with appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels. Unless specifically stated otherwise, as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout this specification discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing,\u201d \u201ccomputing,\u201d \u201ccalculating,\u201d \u201cdetermining\u201d or the like refer to actions or processes of a specific apparatus, such as a special purpose computer or a similar special purpose electronic computing device. In the context of this specification, therefore, a special purpose computer or a similar special purpose electronic computing device is capable of manipulating or transforming signals, typically represented as physical electronic or magnetic quantities within memories, registers, or other information storage devices, transmission devices, or display devices of the special purpose computer or similar special purpose electronic computing device.","Embodiments of the systems and methods described herein may be used for accurately estimating the audience of digital content.  is a block diagram illustrating constituent elements of a computer system  that is configured to implement embodiments of the systems and methods described herein.

In addition, the computer system  may include one or more network interfaces  providing access to a network. It should be noted that one or more components of the computer system  may be located remotely and accessed via the network.

As described herein, granular usage information associated with a piece of digital content may be measured accurately, and an analysis may then be performed to detect usage patterns of distinct individuals using the granular usage information. Once distinctive usage patterns are identified, users may be differentiated. For example, the audience for digital content may be estimated accurately.","As used herein, the \u201ccirculation\u201d of a digital publication indicates the number of copies of the digital publication that are distributed to digital devices. As used herein, the \u201caudience\u201d of a digital publication or digital content indicates the number of unique, individual people who view or otherwise access the digital publication. The accurate estimate determined as described herein may permit publishers and advertisers to understand the true audience of a digital publication or digital content and not merely its circulation. Publishers may sell advertising for their digital publications or digital content using this accurate estimate of the audience rather than a flawed estimate generated using existing measures. Additionally, digital content producers may use the information captured in generating the accurate estimate to separate usage patterns for different users in order to provide a better content experience that is customized for individual viewers.","The digital device  may comprise a digital content module  which is configured to display the digital content . In one embodiment, the digital content module  is configured to respond to user input regarding the digital content , such as by modifying the digital content  for display on the digital device . In one embodiment, the digital content module  is configured to present one or more interactive features of the digital content . The digital content  may comprise program instructions which the digital content module  may be configured to execute or interpret.","In one embodiment, when users access digital content on a digital device, detailed information about the user interactions with the digital content is collected. The digital device  may comprise a user interface  for receiving user input, including user input to access, read, direct, control, and\/or interact with the digital content . The user interface  may include a graphical user interface (GUI). As shown in the example of , three sets of user input are collected: a first set of user input A, a second set of user input B, and a third set of user input C. It is contemplated that different amounts and combinations of user input may be received or collected in various embodiments. The user input A, B, and C may be received at the digital device while the digital content is displayed on the digital device. Each set of user input may be received during a different window in time. For example, the first set of user input A may be received during a first window in time, the second set of user input B may be received during a second window in time, and the third set of user input C may be received during a third window in time.","The user input A, B, and C may relate to a plurality of user interactions with the digital device . As shown in , a user interaction capture module  may capture the user interactions  based on the user input A, B, and C. For example, the user interaction capture module  may observe the interaction of the user with the digital content  and\/or digital device  and optionally capture user preferences and other environmental data suitable for identifying a usage pattern. In various embodiments, the user interaction data may be captured on the digital device using any suitable software and hardware. In one embodiment, the user interaction capture module  may include or be in communication with operating system software present on the digital device. The operating system software of a digital device may typically permit the capture of instances of user interaction with various user interface elements. In one embodiment, the user interaction capture module  may capture events generated by the operating system software. In one embodiment, the user interaction capture module  may include custom software used for accessing or reading a particular digital content. For example, the user interaction capture module  may comprise a plug-in module or other set of program code that is embedded in the same application that provides the digital content . In one embodiment, the user interaction capture module  may implement one or more Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) which enable the digital content  to request the capture of the user interactions . In one embodiment, the process performed by the user interaction capture module  may be performed automatically and\/or programmatically.","The captured user interactions  may be sent from the digital device  to a server  for analysis of the user interactions . In one embodiment, the user interactions  may be sent to the server  over a network interface  linking the digital device  to a network. The network interface may permit the digital device  and server  to communicate over any suitable wireless network and\/or wired network, including the Internet. In one embodiment, the user interactions  may be sent to the server  as soon as they are captured (i.e., substantially in real time). In one embodiment, the user interactions  may instead be sent to the server  in bundles. A bundle may be sent to the server  after a suitable amount of user interactions  have been captured and\/or after a suitable time has lapsed since a previous bundle was sent to the server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","226","200","226","300","330","300"]},"The server may comprise a behavior analysis module  configured to analyze the user interactions  with the digital content  on the digital device . Each of the user interactions may belong to one of a plurality of usage factors . Each usage factor  may comprise one or more types of interaction with the digital device  and\/or digital content . For example, one usage factor may include aspects of touch-screen usage. As will be described in greater detail below, the behavior analysis module  may analyze the user interactions  and usage factors  to generate one or more behavioral fingerprints . For example, the first set of user input A may be identified as belonging to a first behavioral fingerprint, the second set of user input B may be identified as belonging to a second behavioral fingerprint, and the third set of user input C may be identified as belonging to a third behavioral fingerprint. Alternatively, two or more of the various sets of user input A, B, and C may belong to the same behavioral fingerprint. Each usage factor may be scored and weighted to identify the one or more behavioral fingerprints  in the user interactions . Each of the behavioral fingerprints  may comprise a pattern of user interaction with the digital content  on the digital device . Each pattern of user interaction may uniquely identify a particular viewer of the digital content  on the digital device . The behavioral fingerprints  may include usage patterns but exclude the real names and other personal data of viewers.","The behavior analysis module  may output an audience estimate  based on the behavioral fingerprints . The audience estimate  may comprise an estimate of the number of unique, individual people who have read or otherwise accessed the digital content  on the digital device . For example, the audience estimate may equal the number of behavioral fingerprints associated with the digital content  on the digital device . In one embodiment, the audience estimate  may comprise an estimate of the total number of unique, individual people who have read or otherwise accessed the digital content  across a plurality of digital devices.","In one embodiment, the role of the server  may be reduced or eliminated, and aspects of the behavioral analysis may instead be performed on the digital device . For example, the identification of the behavioral fingerprints  may be performed on the digital device , and the server  may determine the total number of unique viewers across all devices.","In one embodiment, an Application Programming Interface (API)  may permit customization  of aspects of the usage factors .

In one embodiment, the user interaction data may be sent from the digital device to a separate server for analysis. As shown in block , a total number of unique viewers of the digital content on the digital device may be estimated based on the plurality of user interactions. The sum of all the collected interactions by a particular user with the different factors may be used to determine a behavioral fingerprint that is unique to that particular user on that particular device. Based on the user behavioral fingerprints, the analysis server may determine a number of unique viewers of the digital content for the device. The number of unique viewers across all devices may be aggregated to determine an accurate estimate of the audience for the digital content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},"As shown in block , a plurality of user interactions  occurring on a digital device  may be captured on the digital device.

As shown in block , the user interactions may be sent from the digital device to a server over a network. As shown in blocks -, analysis of the user interactions may be performed on the server. Alternatively, the user interactions may be analyzed on the digital device itself.","The data collected regarding user interactions  may include data belonging to a plurality of usage factors . The usage factors  may include various types of user behavior and user preferences. In various embodiments, different combinations of usage factors  may be used. The inclusion of more usage factors in the analysis may produce a more accurate count of unique viewers. Similarly, the inclusion of more user interaction data collected over time may also produce a more accurate differentiation of viewers. However, the inclusion of more usage factors or more data may also increase the processing cost of analyzing the factors.","In one embodiment, the usage of \u201cnext\u201d and \u201cprevious\u201d navigation elements may be captured as one or more of the usage factors. In one embodiment, user interactions with a touch-screen, including gesture-based interactions, such as swiping patterns, speed\/velocity of touch, and thickness of touch, may be captured as one or more of the usage factors. In one embodiment, user interactions with interactive elements within digital content (e.g., tools, images, video) may be captured as one or more of the usage factors. In one embodiment, the orientation of the digital device (e.g., landscape or portrait) and changes thereof may be captured as one or more of the usage factors. In one embodiment, the amount of \u201cstatic\u201d device movement may be captured as one or more of the usage factors. In one embodiment, the angle of the digital device may be captured as one or more of the usage factors. In one embodiment, non-standard user interactions (e.g., pulling an image off screen and releasing, doodling on the page, etc.) may be captured as one or more of the usage factors. In one embodiment, commands to zoom in and out (e.g., double tap vs. multi-touch drag in and out) may be captured as one or more of the usage factors. In one embodiment, double-tap speed may be captured as one or more of the usage factors. In one embodiment, a \u201ctimespent\u201d metric indicating the time spent on one page or element of digital content may be captured as one or more of the usage factors. In one embodiment, an identifier unique to the device (e.g., a cookie, device identifier, etc.) may be captured as one or more of the usage factors. In embodiments where mouse input is received, the usage factors may include mouse-specific attributes such as double-click speed, drag speed, and scrolling behavior.","Once the usage factors have been collected, each usage factor may be scored and weighted for its importance or relevance in determining unique user patterns. Each of the plurality of user interactions may be classified into a respective one of a plurality of usage factors. The plurality of usage factors may be determined based on the capabilities of the digital device. As shown in block , a score may be assigned to each of a plurality of usage factors based on the plurality of user interactions. For example, score for a particular usage factor may be based on the number of times (if any) a user interacted with the particular usage factor. As shown in block , a weight may be assigned to each of the plurality of usage factors. The weight may indicate the importance or relevance of each usage factor in determining a behavioral fingerprint of a viewer. For example, the angle (or range of angles) at which a viewer holds a tablet device or e-reader may be assigned a high weight if such a usage pattern tends to identify one viewer from another on a particular device. In one embodiment, a higher weight may be assigned to a usage factor based on the number of times an action belonging to the factor was observed from a user. The weights may be default weights, custom weights, or any combination thereof. In one embodiment, all the usage factors may be equally weighted. In one embodiment, the operation shown in block  may generate a weighted score for each usage factor.","The factors used in determining unique viewers may change based on the capabilities of a particular digital device. For example, the usage of the factors may be modified based on whether the device has a touch-screen, whether the device has a multi-touch interface, whether the device is capable of measuring its orientation or angle, etc. The touch-based factors used for behavioral fingerprinting may comprise any suitable user behaviors utilizing the touch-screen capabilities of a digital device. In one embodiment, the usage of a single factor may be scored. In one embodiment, the level of accuracy associated with the unique viewers on the device may also be determined.","As shown in block , a plurality of behavioral fingerprints  may be determined based on the respective score and respective weight assigned to each of the plurality of usage factors. A behavioral fingerprint may comprise a usage pattern or model that distinguishes one user from other users on the digital device . For example, a particular user may use landscape orientation 70% of the time, average fifteen \u201cambient\u201d or static motions per minute, average a fifteen degree tilt while reading, double-tap to zoom in 80% of the time, have a very fast swiping speed, and doodle circles with their finger on a gesture-based interface of a touch-screen device while reading. All of these factors combined with the weight and score of each factor may be used to identify the user as unique from other users interacting with the device. The model associated with a behavioral fingerprint may be strengthened as more user interactions are captured. In one embodiment, a behavioral fingerprint may model the interaction of a user with a plurality of different instances and\/or types of digital content on the same digital device.","In one embodiment, the user interactions occurring during a particular window of time may be associated with a particular user. As described above, a model corresponding to a behavioral fingerprint may be generated for the particular user. Future user interactions may be compared to the existing behavioral fingerprint to determine whether the future user interactions fit the same usage pattern. If the future user interactions do not fit the same usage pattern (e.g., based on the scoring and weighting of the usage factors), then a new behavioral fingerprint may be generated. In one embodiment, an apparent transfer of the digital device from a first user to a second user (e.g., on a tablet device or e-reader including an accelerometer) may be used to close a window of time associated with the first user and open a new window of time associated with the second user.","As shown in block , the total number of unique viewers of the digital content on the digital device may be estimated based on the number of behavioral fingerprints found in the user interactions on the digital device. As shown in block , the number of unique viewers estimated for the digital device may be aggregated with the number of unique viewers for a plurality of additional digital devices to obtain a total number of unique viewers for the digital content.","In one embodiment, the set of behaviors analyzed for uniqueness may be restricted to behaviors captured on a single device. Accordingly, to determine the number of unique viewers on a particular digital device, only the behaviors associated with that device may be considered. A digital device may be distinguished from other devices by its unique identifier (e.g., a cookie, device identifier, etc.). Limiting the set of interactions to include only the interactions on a single unique device may significantly improve the accuracy of the resulting report indicating the number of viewers on the device. Alternatively, the set of user interactions from a plurality of digital devices may be analyzed to generate a plurality of behavioral fingerprints.","Additionally, the number of viewers may be reported for each digital device. For example, the analysis may find that three unique people accessed the digital content on a first device. For a second device, the analysis may find that four people accessed the same digital content. The analysis may yield a report showing a total audience of seven viewers across two devices.","In one embodiment, an Application Programming Interface (API) may be provided for modifying aspects of the accurate audience estimation. In one embodiment, the API may be used to add or remove usage factors from the collection and analysis. In one embodiment, the API may be used to change the weighting or importance assigned to specific factors. For example, a publisher may desire to measure interaction with an interactive element of a particular piece of digital content and then assign a high weight for distinctive usage patterns on that particular factor. In this case, the API may provide a mechanism to collect usage information about the additional interactions and assign a high weight to unique behaviors associated with the interactive element.","In addition to uniquely identifying viewers on a device, distinctive usage patterns may be grouped to assign viewers with a particular usage pattern into a group or segment of similar viewers. The groups or segments may be referred to as behavioral segments or usage segments. For example, viewers who double tap to zoom more frequently than pinching to zoom may be assigned to a double tapper segment. As another example, users with high velocity swiping patterns may be grouped together in another segment for analysis. Once viewers have been segmented in this manner, digital content may be customized for distinctive usage patterns. For example, the viewers in a high-velocity swiper segment may receive additional navigational elements to help them navigate quickly. As another example, users with a \u201cfirst reader\u201d usage pattern could receive a tutorial or other navigational prompts to help them navigate through the digital content. In this manner, the digital content may be configured based on the apparent proficiency of the user.","Distinctive usage profiles may also be compared to usage profiles of known segments (e.g., age, gender, etc.). Usage profiles that are statistically similar between the known and unknown segments may be grouped. For example, if a group of known users share a distinctive \u201cstatic\u201d device movement or tilt pattern, such a pattern could be compared with the algorithm scores of the unknown users. Those unknown users matching the distinctive known usage pattern could be assigned to the same segment. In one embodiment, unknown users may be compared to behavioral touch-based segments or fingerprints from known segments in order to assign the unknown users to a relevant segment.","Although the embodiments above have been described in detail, numerous variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art once the above disclosure is fully appreciated. It is intended that the following claims be interpreted to embrace all such variations and modifications."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
