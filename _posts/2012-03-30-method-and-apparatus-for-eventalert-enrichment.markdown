title: Method and apparatus for event/alert enrichment
abstract: Methods and apparatus to provide alert enrichment in a cloud storage system. In one embodiment, the system performs alert/event identification with information from an identity matching service for the components of the cloud storage system to generate a resource identifier for the component associated with a first one of the processed alerts/events, and use the resource identifier to identify a service, platform, virtual machine, virtual application, virtual data center, organization and/or platform component associate with the first one of the processed alerts/events.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["As is known in the art, storage systems, such as so-called, cloud storage systems, contain a large number of hardware devices and components and software applications, modules, and component. In the presence of a fault, alert, or other condition needing attention, it can be difficult to identify the source of the fault or alert since there are many complex components that may be provided by multiple vendors which may make it difficult to exchange information in an efficient manner.","For example, in a cloud storage environment, alerts and events from various event sources in platforms normally contain limited information that may not be meaningful and may seem unrelated to the environment from which they originate. It is challenging for IT personnel to extract executable data from the alerts and take appropriate action.","With large volumes of alerts\/events constantly coming from various sources, it is challenging to prioritize the alerts\/events and take proper actions without putting the alerts or events in the proper context, such as organizations\/business units, impacted applications, etc. It is time consuming to trouble-shoot events\/alerts, errors, etc., without associating the alerts and events with their relevant physical or logical topology resources or assets. In addition, many of the IT resources are managed in silos by IT personnel specialized in certain technology domains. For example, when a blade in the Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) fails or has performance issues its impact propagates to the ESX server deployed on the blade, to the virtual machines deployed on the ESX server, to the applications or critical services running on those virtual machines, to the critical business that relies on those services. It may take hours or even days to sort through those alerts or events, which may result in significant detrimental impact on an enterprise.","In one aspect of the invention, a method comprises receiving alerts\/events from components of a cloud storage system, processing, using a computer processor, raw data for the alerts\/events, performing alert\/event identification with information from an identity matching service for the components of the cloud storage system to generate a resource identifier for the component associated with a first one of the processed alerts\/events, and using the resource identifier to identify a service, platform, virtual machine, virtual application, virtual data center, organization and\/or platform component associate with the first one of the processed alerts\/events.","In another aspect of the invention, an article comprises a computer readable medium having non-transitory stored instructions that enable a machine to perform: receiving alerts\/events from components of a cloud storage system, processing, using a computer processor, raw data for the alerts\/events, performing alert\/event identification with information from an identity matching service for the components of the cloud storage system to generate a resource identifier for the component associated with a first one of the processed alerts\/events, and using the resource identifier to identify a service, platform, virtual machine, virtual application, virtual data center, organization and\/or platform component associate with the first one of the processed alerts\/events.","In a further aspect of the invention, a system comprises a cloud storage system comprising: a computer layer, a storage layer, a network layer coupled between the compute and storage layer, and a management layer to control the system, the management layer comprising stored instructions to enable the management layer to: receive alerts\/events from components of the cloud storage system, process raw data for the alerts\/events, perform alert\/event identification with information from an identity matching service for the components of the cloud storage system to generate a resource identifier for the component associated with a first one of the processed alerts\/events, and use the resource identifier to identify a service, platform, virtual machine, virtual application, virtual data center, organization and\/or platform component associate with the first one of the processed alerts\/events.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","108"]},"The compute layer  comprises components, such as blade servers, chassis and fabric interconnects that provide the computing power for the platform.

For example, management applications can include a virtualization function, such as VSPHERE\/VCENTER, by VMware of Palto Alto, Calif. A further management application can be provided as the Unified Computing System (UCS) by Cisco. It is understood that the blade chassis and fabric interconnection can be considered part of the UCS. Another management application can includes a management interface, such as EMC UNISPHERE, to provide a flexible, integrated experience for managing existing storage systems, such as CLARIION and CELERRA storage devices from EMC. A further management application includes a platform element manager, such as Unified Infrastructure Manager (UIM) by EMC, for managing the configuration, provisioning, and compliance of the platform.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","502","504","506","506","508"]},"The unified infrastructure manager  further includes a change and configuration management module , a policy-based compliance and analysis module , a unified infrastructure provisioning module , a consolidation topology and event service module , and an operational awareness module . The various modules interact with platform elements, such as devices in compute, network and storage layers, and other management applications.","The unified infrastructure manager  performs platform deployment by abstracting the overall provisioning aspect of the platform(s) and offering granular access to platform components for trouble shooting and fault management.","In one aspect of the invention, a uniform infrastructure management module includes an alert enrichment module to enrich alerts from platform events and alerts to physical infrastructure, logical services, virtual applications, and tenant\/organizations. It is understood that cloud environments can provide storage for multiple tenants\/organizations.","In general, a unified infrastructure management module includes functionality to receive events and alerts from platform components, identify them with and\/or roll them up to manageable IT topological resources, enrich the events\/alerts with physical infrastructure, logical service, virtual application, and\/or tenant\/organization information. Enriching events\/alerts to the physical, logical, virtual and organizational layers enables users to place events\/alerts in the context of organizations to help the IT organizations categorize them, define criticality, deliver the required SLA, and quickly isolate the alerts to the relevant physical or logical components for trouble-shooting.","Exemplary embodiments of the invention enable a unified infrastructure module to identify automatically the events and alerts from various platform components with the high level physical or logical IT resources, such as storage array, storage volume, blade, chassis, fabric interconnect, server, virtual machine, fibre channel switch, IP switch, and the like.","In addition, exemplary embodiments of the invention are useful to automatically enrich, when applicable, the platform alerts and events to relevant services configured in UIM\/provisioning. The configuration and status change events from UIM\/Provisioning are automatically enriched with the services. Exemplary embodiments of the invention are further useful to automatically enrich, whenever applicable, platform alerts and events to platform instances as represented in UIM\/Provisioning, to virtual applications, such as applications represented in VMware vSphere, to organizations, such as those represented in VMware vCloud Director.
