title: Materials, methods and devices to detect and quantify water vapor concentrations in an atmosphere
abstract: We have demonstrated that a surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor coated with a nanoporous framework material (NFM) film can perform ultrasensitive water vapor detection at concentrations in air from 0.05 to 12,000 ppmv at 1 atmosphere pressure. The method is extendable to other MEMS-based sensors, such as microcantilevers, or to quartz crystal microbalance sensors. We identify a specific NFM that provides high sensitivity and selectivity to water vapor. However, our approach is generalizable to detection of other species using NFM to provide sensitivity and selectivity.

Distinguishing features of NFM are rigid organic \u201clinker\u201d groups connected to either metal cations or covalently bound to main-group elements such as silicon and boron. These self-organize into two- and three-dimensional open-pore structures that can have extremely high surface areas. These structures retain their porosity upon removal of \u201cguest\u201d molecules (solvent or other), enabling them to serve as reversible sorbents for a variety of molecular species. NFM crystal structures also exhibit a degree of structural flexibility not found in other nanoporous materials, including zeolites, aerogels, synthetic opals, and nanotubes (both carbon- and non-carbon based).","Upon absorption of molecules from either the gas phase or solution, many NFM undergo reversible changes in the dimensions of their unit cells. These properties suggest several routes to humidity sensing in which the transduction mechanisms are:","1.) the stress induced at an interface between a flexible NFM layer and a static microcantilever (\u03bcCL) equipped with a built-in piezoresistive stress sensor;\n\n","We have demonstrated the feasibility of all three concepts using devices we fabricated, showing that easily measured signals can be generated through adsorption-induced stress or frequency changes caused by uptake of vapor-phase water in NFM layers coated on the above mentioned sensor substrates.","NFM coatings on sensors possess a number of features that make them potentially superior to polymers and other coatings currently used to impart sensitivity and selectivity to chemical sensors. Firstly, large stress-induced signals are observed upon analyte adsorption due to the large changes in lattice dimensions that can be achieved. Secondly, some NFM have been observed to possess surface areas of up to 6000 m\/g: a result approximately six times greater than a zeolite. This makes these materials potentially highly effective sorbents that would increase sensitivity in sensors detecting either mass or stress changes. Third, the ability to tailor NFM pore sizes by changing the chemical nature of the linking molecule; changing the metal center; or changing the pore geometry, enables both the chemical selectivity and adsorption properties to be optimized in a rational way. Fourth, effective mechanical linkages between NFM crystals and a substrate can be created by covalent bonding schemes that anchor the crystal to the sensor surface. These qualities result in robust, stable sensors capable of generating large signals from small quantities of targeted analytes.","We have demonstrated that SAW devices coated with a NFM film can perform ultrasensitive water vapor detection. In particular, we have shown that a metal-organic framework (MOF) and a subclass of a NFM, was used as the nanoporous coating material. CuBTC, also known as HKUST-1, is short-hand nomenclature for copper (II) benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate [chemical formula Cu(BTC)(HO)]. Other NFMs, e.g., NOTT-100 (biphenyl-3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetracarboxylic acid) and NOTT-101 (terphenyl-3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetracarboxylic acid) may be similarly useful but CuBTC is particularly advantageous because it has been shown to be capable of absorbing as much as 40% water by weight (Q. M. Wang et al. 2002, v. 55 (2): pp. 217-230.). We note that Biemmi et al. (Biemmi et al, 2008, v. 114 (1-3): pp. 380-386, herein incorporated by reference) speculated that CuBTC could be used in humidity sensing applications and measured water vapor adsorption isotherms by coating the gold electrodes of a QCM using a thiol-based self-assembled monolayer (SAM) to attach the MOF onto the gold electrodes. Although this method was sufficient to detect high water vapor concentrations (low sensitivity), they found that the device had to be heated to 70\u00b0 C. to achieve full reversibility. However, the time required to fully desorb the water at this elevated temperature was still four hours, severely limiting its use as a practical sensor. In addition, this temperature is at the upper limit of the SAM (self-assembled monolayer) thermal stability and is likely to limit the durability of their device. Ameloot et al (Ameloot et al., 2009, v. 21(13): pp. 2580-2582, herein incorporated by reference) demonstrated moisture sensing with a CuBTC coated QCM down to 6.6% RH (1842 ppmv) with an estimated limit of detection of 30 ppmv water.","Through the use of much more sensitive sensor substrates, we have demonstrated an improvement of this capability by nearly 3 orders of magnitude demonstrating the detection of water vapor at concentrations in nitrogen from less than about 0.05 ppmv to over 12,000 ppmv relative to 1 atmosphere pressure (see TABLE 1 below).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0024"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Frost Point (\u00b0 C.)","PPM(V)","% RH"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["\u221295.0","0.038","0.0001"]},{"entry":["\u221280.0","0.54","0.002"]},{"entry":["\u221270.0","2.59","0.011"]},{"entry":["\u221260.0","10.73","0.046"]},{"entry":["\u221250.0","39.05","0.168"]},{"entry":["\u221240.0","127","0.549"]},{"entry":["\u221230.0","377","1.625"]},{"entry":["\u221220.0","1024","4.413"]},{"entry":["\u221210.0","2582","11.11"]},{"entry":["0.0","6092","26.123"]},{"entry":["10.0","12318","52.492"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Equivalent expressions of water vapor."}]}}]}}},"In our demonstration, the CuBTC coating was grown directly on the silicon oxide surface of the quartz SAW device. The film was deposited using the solution-based methods of Fischer et al. (D. Zacher et al. 2009, v. 38(5): pp. 1418-1429, herein incorporated by reference), that is, for the case of HKUST-1, the two components, anhydrous copper(II)acetate [Cu(CHCO)or CuAc] and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid [CHOor HBTC], were separately dissolved in ethanol having a trace amount of dimethylformamide (DFM): Cu(CHCO)to a concentration of 1 mM-10 mM and HBTC at a concentration of between 0.1 mM-1 mM. These solutions were held at a temperature of between 20\u00b0 C. and 63\u00b0 C. and the substrate immersed into each solution in a cyclic manner for about 30 minutes. Each step was followed by a thorough rinsing in pure ethanol. The deposited MOF layers are found to grow with the [100]direction perpendicular to the surface. Moreover, the resulting covalent bonds established across the exposed silica surface of the SAW eliminated the need for the use of a SAM layer entirely if the coating is deposited between the SAW interdigitated electrodes as shown in , producing a durable, thermally stable coating that can be heated up to 250\u00b0 C. to rapidly and efficiently remove the adsorbed water. The coating may also be deposited over most of the SAW surface such as shown in  but because the surface of the electrodes did not provide a compatible bonding surface without a SAM layer it was found that some delamination resulted between the NFM coating these surfaces.","The coatings that result from this process are polycrystalline and uniform, continuous films with thicknesses proportional to the number of cyclical deposition cycles (see ). The crystallites forming the coating layer are on the order of 100-150 nm in diameter. The designed thickness of the coating can range from below 50 nm to over 1 micron, with the practical thickness limited by viscoelastic coupling of the acoustic energy into the sensing layer in the case of a SAW or QCM, or by mass-induced attenuation of the mechanical motion in the case of a microcantilever. For a SAW the effective thicknesses of these films appears to be limited to about 200 nm (\u02dc60 cycles), as can be seen in , after which the sensitivity of the device no longer increases with increasing coating thickness.","The device described herein was tested by placing the coated SAW sensor in a sealed, confined space and creating a controlled atmosphere using a humidity generator (Model 3900 obtained from the Thunder Scientific Corporation, Albuquerque, N. Mex.) capable of providing a known humidity value traceable to NIST standards.  shows four cycles of data for a CuBTC-coated SAW device as described herein. While the ambient room temperature was stable at 20\u00b0 C., the SAW fixture temperature was slightly elevated at 27\u00b0 C. due to self-heating of the continuously operating SAW. Significant time is allowed for the humidity generator to achieve precise stability (+\/\u22120.1\u00b0 C. Frost Point) at each setting and for the plumbing to equilibrate. However, the CuBTC-coated SAW sensor response was found to be much faster, precisely tracking the in-line chilled mirror reference sensor when the flow rate and dead volume of the vapor generation system between the reference sensor and the downstream SAW are accounted for. The data is summarized in , showing an average standard deviation of +\/\u22127\u00b0 C. frost point. As seen in , the device is able to respond to humidity levels as low as \u221295\u00b0 C. (0.050 ppm HO at standard temperature and pressure). This concentration is approximately 600 times lower than the estimated limit of detection reported by the prior art.","Finally, it is believed that these devices, employing coatings analogous to HKUST-1, are capable of similar behavior. In particular, and as noted above, materials such as the iso-structural MOF polymers of composition [Cu(L)(HO)] (where L is a tetracarboxylate ligand), also known as NOTT-nnn may be useful as sensor materials. As demonstrated by initial results with NOTT-100 and NOTT-101 shown in , respectively, it is apparent that an effect similar to that demonstrated by NKUST-1 is provided. Those skilled in the art would, therefore, anticipate that these and many other similar materials would behave in the same manner.","The combination of these results shows that a practical sensor capable of detecting water vapor down to a frost point of \u221295\u00b0 C. (0.050 ppm HO at standard temperature and pressure) is feasible. This is the lowest water vapor concentration that can be reliably generated by a commercial instrument.","From the foregoing it will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications and other alternatives or adaptations may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention.
