{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This invention relates to an improved electric drive attachment for a conventional wheelchair.","Wheelchair drive units are well known accessories and fall into two distinct categories. The first category is mounted on the wheelchair and drives the tire of one or more wheelchair wheels. The second category, into which the present invention falls, is attached to the wheelchair and has one or more independent drive wheels which rest on and drive against the ground.","It is the action of the drive wheels on the ground which can cause the user problems when they need to negotiate kets or pot holes. While it is known to raise the drive wheel off the ground surface by the use of a cable and lever or screw jack arrangement, these structures and methods are difficult to use or result in minimal ground clearance when actuated.","According to the present invention there is provided an electric drive attachment for a wheelchair comprising a drive housing containing an electric motor, a drive wheel which touches the ground and drives the wheelchair through frictional contact with the ground and speed reducing mechanism between the motor and drive wheel, attachment structure to attach the wheelchair drive unit to the wheelchair, said attachment structure preferably being a pair of clamps one on each side of the frame, each clamp containing a pivoting hinge which can be withdrawn from the clamp by aligning a tang on the pivot with a groove in the clamp, the axis of the hinge being parallel to the axis of the wheelchair rear wheels, two connecting struts of adjustable length fitted between the pivoting hinges and the drive housing, said connecting structure being in the shape of a \u2018V\u2019 so that the drive housing sits centrally between the two clamps and is free to pivot at the clamps on the aforementioned axis and each end of the struts able to pivot in the plane of the \u2018V\u2019 so that the \u2018V\u2019 can open and close and with the ends of the struts at the drive housing incorporating meshing gear teeth so that the struts mesh with each other and therefore open equally about a centerline between them, and such that an angle between the drive wheel ground contact point and the center of the axis of the pivoting hinges, and a vertical line through the center of the pivoting hinges is about 35 degrees, a visible mark on the drive housing that, when vertical, indicates the aforementioned angle is correct. A flexible length adjustable connector that ties the two struts to each other near the clamps thereby limits the extent to which the struts can open and limiting the forces the struts can impose on the frame. A lifting strap of adjustable length is provided which attaches to the drive unit and has a loop at the other end that slips over and is secured by a wheelchair handle. The lifting strap incorporates a shortening device that effectively shortens the length of the lifting strap when activated to thereby raise the drive housing and drive wheel off the ground. The lifting strap also affording a way to quickly raise the drive housing and drive wheel substantially clear of the ground by simply pulling upwards. The lifting strap also acts to stop the drive unit and drive wheel from under running the wheelchair by restricting the degree to which the drive unit can pivot about the pivoting hinges. An optional anti under run roller can also be utilized to further limit the angle which the drive unit can achieve with respect to the ground surface.","Also included are torque dampening systems to reduce the shock of starting the motor, a clutch which enables manual forward movement of a wheelchair without engagement of the motor and without dragging of the drive wheel, an anti under run roller that limits the degree to which the wheelchair drive unit can under run the wheelchair and positive pressurization of the gear works and area surrounding the drive wheel to keep the housing free of debris.","Referring to , a wheelchair  is shown as having an attached wheelchair drive unit  having an outer drive housing , attachment clamps , and adjustable struts  which position the drive unit  at the center of the wheelchair . Wheelchair  is of the small wheel type where the rear wheel has a smaller diameter and an axis of pivot mounted lower with respect to the chair occupant.","Adjustable struts  are each assembled from a clamp half strut  and a drive housing half strut . The length of each strut  can be locked off via wing nut  and a bolt (not shown). Drive wheel  is seen at the bottom of drive unit . Also note, as is seen in a numbering sequenced for , a tie strap  is seen as being connected to each clamp half strut  near the clamp  via connecting shackles . An adjuster  allows the tie strap  to be shortened or lengthened to suit different wheelchair  sizes and may limit the extent to which struts  can open.","Wheelchair  is seen as having near vertical frame members  which will hereinafter be referred to as frame  as it is the aspect of the frame to which the wheelchair drive unit  attaches as seen in FIG. . The attachment may differ where a different wheelchair  is utilized. A lifting strap , adjustable in length by strap adjuster , can be used with an adjuster (discussed more fully below) and is shown as extending from the wheelchair drive unit  outer drive housing  to a wheelchair handle . Wheelchair handle  can be any structure which can secure lifting strap , and the wheelchair handle  was chosen in the view of  due to its prominence and engage ability.","Lifting strap  is shown as having two stable positions. The configuration of lifting strap  and lifter actuator  is to provide a mechanically advantaged method of disengaging the drive unit  from the ground so that such disengaging lifting can be lifted by the wheelchair occupant easily.","The wheelchair unit  is also made for quick and easy complete disengagement from the wheelchair . Clamp half strut  is connected to a removable pivot . The removable pivot has a cylindrical portion extending into attachment clamp . Withdrawal of the removable pivot  from the attachment clamp , along with simple disconnection of the lifting strap  from the wheelchair handle  will complete the mechanical detachment from the wheelchair .","Generally, with reference to , the attachment clamps  which house removable pivots  are each fastened to the wheelchair frame  using standard fasteners (not shown). The pivots  are free to rotate within the clamps . The clamp half strut  is also able to pivot within the pivot .","Referring to , an exposed bottom side view of the drive unit  is seen with a bottom portion of a housing case (not seen) removed. Prominently seen is a motor  with a speed reducing mechanism  which may include belts and gears as shown. Meshing gears  are seen connecting the drive housing half struts  so that they angularly expand about the drive unit  at its midpoint. As such that attachments of the struts  to any object will automatically center the drive unit  at the center of objects, and in this case the wheelchair  when the struts  are adjusted to have equal length. For wheelchair , centering will cause the wheelchair  to be driven from the center and should drive the wheelchair  straight unless some other force or factor is at play.","Also seen is a inner drive housing  which provides the physical support for the motor , and speed reducing mechanism . A set of pivot supports not shown anchor the meshing gears  to the outer drive housing . For clarity, electrical details have been omitted.","Generally, with regard to , the drive housing half strut  is able to pivot within the drive housing  and operate the meshing gears  at the end of each drive housing half strut . This ensures that both halves pivot at the same angular rate with respect to the drive housing .  also shows the general compact relationship of drive wheel , motor  and speed reducing mechanism  within the cut away inner drive housing .","The effect of pivots  is to allow the drive unit  and struts  to pivot up and down relative to the road surface. The effect of the pivots at the end of the clamp half struts  the pivots at the end of the drive housing half struts  and the meshing gears  is to allow the two wheelchair frames  to be brought together in order to fold the wheelchair whilst maintaining the drive unit  centrally between the two attachment clamps .","Referring to , a closeup view of the drive unit  is seen looking toward the rear side of the wheelchair  of , which is shown in  in folded condition. Most wheelchairs  are set to fold in a manner which brings the vertical frame members together in a parallel approach relationship. This is shown in  as the vertical frame members  are shown in close proximity to each other.","As can be seen, the bringing together of the vertical frame members  causes the removable pivots  to be brought together and the struts  brought to a generally parallel orientation. A lower portion of the lifting strap  is seen, with the remaining upper portion of the lifting strap removed for clarity and not shown in FIG. . The dimensionality shown has the vertical frame members  brought close but still far enough to accommodate the width of the struts  and the attachment clamps . Where a wheelchair  has a closer fold, differently dimensioned attachment clamps  may be provided to give a greater clearance. The electrical connections into the drive unit  are also shown as cut, truncated, or removed as both a switch connection and a power connection and will be discussed in further details. To illustrate quick removability, removable pivots  and a lifting strap , as well as the not yet mentioned on\/off switch, battery pack and cables are not shown.  emphasizes the folded wheelchair  in which the struts  lie parallel to each other with the drive unit  maintained centrally between the attachment clamps .","Referring to , a closeup view of a portion of the vertical frame member  at the point of connection of the attachment clamp  is shown. The removable pivot  is shown from an end on view as having a tang  not aligned with a key or recess  in the clamp . The removable pivot  cannot therefore be withdrawn while the tang  is out of alignment with the key or recess . The tang  cannot be brought to a position of disengagement unless the drive unit  is swung extremely below the wheelchair , as by tilting what would have to be an empty wheelchair forward to enable the drive unit  to achieve a low angle. As a result, the drive unit  is in stable position so long as the wheelchair is occupied. Further, because of the positioning of the optional anti under run roller  shown later in , if the wheel  begins to under run the wheelchair  as it pivots on pivots , the anti under run roller  comes into contact with the road surface and reduces the contact force between the wheel  and the ground leading to the wheel  slipping against the ground instead of gripping against the ground.","Referring to , a closeup view of a portion of the vertical frame member  at the point of connection of the attachment clamp  is shown while the clamp half strut  is in a position nearly parallel with the vertical frame member . This has enabled the tang  to align with the keyhole recess  such that the removable pivot  is enabled to disengage the attachment clamp . As can be seen from the angle, and in respect of , the drive unit  would have to be brought so far below as to be in alignment, or nearly in alignment with the vertical frame members . Where attachment to frame members which are other than vertical are desired, clamps  which have a differently located key or recess .","Generally with regard to , the pivot  is emphasized from an end on view with its tang  aligned with the recess  in the attachment clamp . The two pivots  can therefore be withdrawn simultaneously in order to more quickly and easily remove the wheelchair drive unit  from the wheelchair .","Referring to , a profile side view of the wheelchair  is seen with the drive unit in place with its drive wheel  shown to the rear of the ground contact made with a large rear wheel . An angled line is drawn from the removable pivots  generally along side the struts  and to the point of contact of the drive wheel . An angle alpha is shown as taken between the angled line through the contact point of the drive wheel  on the ground and a vertical line taken from the center of the pivot  through to the ground.","It is clear that the attachment clamp  can attach to the vertical frame member  at various points along its vertical extent, such that a low attachment would result in a larger angle alpha and a higher attachment along vertical frame member  would result in a smaller angle alpha. This angle alpha is very important as the vertical force component Fg that pushes the drive wheel  down onto the ground is equal to F multiplied by cosine (alpha) where F is the force produced by the wheelchair drive unit  along the struts .","By having an angle alpha of about 35 degrees, the wheelchair drive unit  does not rely solely upon gravity to maintain sufficient grip to prevent slippage between the drive wheel  and the ground. The minimum angle alpha can be defined as the arctangent of the coefficient of friction between the rubber drive wheel tire  and the ground, any angle less than this will ensure that there is sufficient grip although an angle approaching zero would create a larger force Fg than is necessary. To ensure the angle alpha is optimized a mark  on the wheelchair drive unit indicates that the angle is correct when the mark  is visually positioned by the installer to assume a vertical condition. Again, the installer who is initially positioning the attachment clamps  up and down the vertical frame members  and adjusting the length of struts  can manually adjust the attachment clamps  as the mark  is observed to obtain the optimum position.","Referring to  the top portion of the lifting strap  is shown with the lifter actuator  seen as a rigid member connected to one side of two generally vertical portions of the lifting strap , and is shown in the normal stable first position in which the drive wheel  is seen resting on the ground. A loop  is used to attach the lifting straps to another structure such as the wheelchair handle  which was shown in FIG. .","Four components of the lifting strap  include upper components  and  as well as lower components  and . Components  and  are generally delineated by the point  at which the end of the lifter actuator  is attached. Components  and  are generally delineated by the presence of a stop  which is a doubling over of the strap material as shown in , or some other blocking structure which will prevent further downward movement of the upper curved end  of the lifter actuator .","The use of the lifter actuator  enables a relatively weak person to apply a lifting force to the lifting strap  by applying a much lesser downward force to the lifter actuator . Referring to  the application of this downward force is illustrated. The top of the lifter strap  is shown with the lifter actuator  in the horizontal second stable position to place the lifter strap  in an overall raised position to lift the drive unit  upwardly. Upward movement of the drive unit  while the wheelchair is on a flat ground surface will disengage the drive unit  from the ground. This, in turn, raises the drive wheel  off the ground.","In , the lifting actuator  is shown in a position after the curved end  has been pushed until it rests against the stop  while the connected end of the lifter actuator  pivots about its connection to the junction of portions  and , about a loop . The four components , ,  and  now form a diamond shape, the net effect of which is to shorten the overall length of the lifting strap .","In the installation the wheelchair drive unit  is fitted to the wheelchair  using the clamps . The struts  are then adjusted until the drive unit  is centrally located between the clamps  and the indicator mark  is generally as vertical as possible while the wheelchair is on flat ground. Adjustment of the struts  with horizontal wheelchair members may be accomplished with the clamps  or with other types of clamps, and where other members are used, care should be taken to insure that proper mounting can be effectuated. With the lifting actuator  in the normal, non-lifted position shown in , the loop  is affixed to the handle  and the lifting strap  is then adjusted until there is no significant slack in it.","Once the above adjustment has been made, to raise the drive wheel  and drive unit  off the ground the lifting actuator  is moved to the horizontal, raised position as is shown in FIG. . To drop the drive wheel  and wheelchair drive unit  back onto the ground the lifting actuator  is moved back to the normal position seen in FIG. . The lifter actuator  can be manufactured in a variety of lengths and widths to affect lifting over a variety of height differentials and with a variety of different widths and thicknesses of lifting strap .","While operating the wheelchair under powered movement and in forward motion, to clear a curb stone or other obstruction the drive wheel  and wheelchair drive unit  can be raised instantly and substantially by pulling up the lower strap  directly by hand, if necessary. Raising the drive unit  by hand will minimize the shock and impact to the drive unit . However, for small step downs or step ups, the forward momentum of the wheelchair  and the flexibility of the drive unit  should minimize any disruption.","To quickly remove the wheelchair drive unit  from the wheelchair  the lifting strap  is disconnected by loosening the lifting strap  and removing loop  from the wheelchair handle . The wheelchair drive unit  can then be dropped down until angle alpha is approximately zero typically by up tilting the wheelchair as by raising it or tilting it forward to provide clearance to achieve such a zero angle. Once the zero angle is achieved, the tangs  on removable pivots  then align with recesses  and the removable pivots  can then be easily withdrawn from the attachment clamps . The wheelchair drive unit  can then be withdrawn from the wheelchair  typically after disconnecting a located on\/off switch and battery to be shown below.","Referring to , a closeup of handle  illustrates a plunger switch assembly  which includes a base housing  connected by an electrical cord . Base housing  has a plunger  which includes a vertical member  and an angled thumb support . To activate the switch assembly  to an \u201con\u201d position the thumb support  is depressed gently driving the vertical member  into the base housing .","The position of the thumb support  is generally overlying the handle . In its full downward travel, the thumb support  has a lower surface which rests on either the handle  or a portion of the base housing  which overlies the handle . In this configuration there is good support underneath the thumb support  to guard against any damage from undue or inadvertent thumb pressure. As can be seen by the arrow, the plunger  is rotatable to bring the thumb support  from its position over the handle  and generally to a position parallel with the handle , either forward or rearwardly in direction. In this position the plunger  is locked out of an ability to close the switch to activate the wheelchair drive unit . This feature will prevent accidental triggering of the plunger  and inadvertent turning on of the wheelchair drive unit .","Referring to , a view of an open cloth bag  surrounds a battery . The cloth bag  has a long strap  two or more short straps  and a pair of flaps  and  fitted with areas of hook and loop members  to ensure that the battery  is secured. A connector  is provided to fit closely onto the battery  and has an overbite portion to fit onto the battery terminals and to form a locking relationship with the battery  and battery cable . The close fit of the connector enables the flaps  and  to be brought tightly over the top of the battery  to both securing the battery  within the cloth bag  and thus further securing the connector  and the short length of the battery cable  onto the battery .","Referring to , a rear view of the wheelchair  shows the cloth bag  containing the battery  in place beneath the seat area of wheelchair . The short straps  are used to suspend the battery  and cloth bag  from any convenient horizontal support  on wheelchair . The long strap  can then be used to pull the battery  and cloth bag  away from any tire  that may impinge on it by looping over any further convenient horizontal support  on wheelchair  and pulling it taught enough to take up the slack. The cloth bag  and straps ,  extend generally between horizontal supports  on the wheelchair . However, the straps  provide a configuration such that the battery  and cloth bag  can be attached or suspended from the wheelchair  in any manner which will give it secure support.","Referring to , an exploded view of a drive assembly  includes an ultimate drive gear  having drive teeth  and a space . Within the space  are a series of raised circumferentially inwardly directed engagement structures . Each of the engagement structures  has a circumferentially inwardly predominant axial cam surface  with respect to the overall axis of depth of the space . The axial depth enables a wider profile on the engagement structure  for engagement by an associated one of a series of pawls . The pawls  are individually pivotally attached via pivot pin  pivoting in pawl hole  in clutch plate . Each pawl  has a cam follower half  and a load bearing half  that includes a cam following face . The pawls  are individually pivotally attached via pivot pin  pivoting in pawl hole  in clutch plate . Each pawl  has a cam follower half  and a load bearing half  that includes a cam following face . Each of the pawls  may preferably be made from a polymer material and have a distant curved end  which interfits with a curved space  in one side of the engagement structure . The cam follower half  of pawl  and the cam following face  of the load bearing half  of the pawl  both contact the cam face  of the engagement structure  with causes the pawl  to be moved between two positions. Bearing  fits into ultimate drive gear  to locate it onto a common axle not shown. Bearing  fits into clutch plate  to locate it onto a common axle not shown.","The cam face  is ramped so that force engagement cannot be had from rotation in the other direction. This enables, as will be shown, the wheelchair drive unit  to \u201cover run\u201d or put another way, enables the drive wheel  to turn in the forward direction when the motor  is off. This is useful when the wheelchair is being pushed forward. Otherwise, the lifter actuator  would have to be lifted each time that non-driven forward movement was desired. Otherwise, a positive connection with the drive wheel  would cause it to drag if the wheelchair  is pushed forward when the motor  isn't running. If the ground surface is rough, a dragging drive wheel  could cause flat spots and loss of continuous drive ability.","The clutch plate  supports wheel drive transfer pegs  which fit through matching apertures of the drive wheel  (not shown in FIG. ). A central hub  is a support about which the drive wheel  fits.","Referring to , a semi-sectional view taken from the vantage point of line \u2014 of  illustrates a schematic orientational view of the pawls  prior to engagement into its respective curved space . It can be seen that if the pawls  move counterclockwise with respect to drive gear  and taken in respect of the views of , the pawls  will circle the space  traveling in a counterclockwise direction and bump against, and pass over the engagement structures . This will cause the cam follower half  will come into contact with the cam face  which will move the pawl  to a position in which cam follower face  will contact the cam face  if the drive wheel  continues to rotate causing the pawl to move back to its original position relative to clutch plate  not shown.","However, should the direction of travel of the pawls  be reversed, the distant curved ends  of the pawls  will slide along the cylindrical inner wall of the space  and into engagement with their next closest respective curved space . This is shown in FIG. .  illustrates the position of the pawls  during mechanical driving. If the distant ends  of pawls  were not in the correct position to engage with the next respective curved space , the action of the cam follower half  and cam following face  against the cam face  will move the pawl  into a suitable position as the pawl  rotates due to the driving motion of motor  via speed reducing mechanism .","Referring to  a view of an upper quarter quadrant of the outer drive housing  shown removed to illustrate structure utilized in producing a pressurized gearbox effect. A radial fan  is seen along an upper extent of the inner drive housing . Radial fan  has with curved, pressure inducing blades. The radial fan  is mounted directly on the motor  along with the Pinion. The motor  is also shown connected to a drive sprocket  by a belt . Thus, when the wheelchair drive unit  is powered and moving forward, the radial fan  will operate. The action of the fan is to pressurize the gearbox portion of the inner drive housing  to about 2 millibar of pressure. This pressurization action reduces the amount of dirt that can enter the gearbox and is achieved by having the radial fan  draw air into the gearbox space through a vent  consisting of a series of slots in the outer housing  and a hole in the inner drive housing . The exit point for the air is the space immediately between the drive wheel  and the inner drive housing  and through bleed holes  in the ultimate drive gear  (seen in FIG. ), thereby blowing out dirt that may otherwise find work itself into the inner drive housing  and drive assembly . Holes (not shown) in the inner drive housing  also allow air to stream over the hot motor  and hot electronic components not shown.","In the closeup drawing of , also seen are a few other features, including a charging jack  (shown partially covered) which enables easy access for the recharging of the attached battery  seen in FIG. .","Referring to , a perspective view of the hub  of drive wheel  and illustrating the use of a shock absorbing hub  with polymeric or rubber inserts  in order to limit the transmission of starting and stopping type rotational shocks from the drive wheel , via the hub , is shown. Each of the rubber inserts  includes a large opening  superimposed at one side of an oval cross sectional shape.","The rubber inserts  are also shown as having a smaller bore  which will help control the deformation of the rubber insert  in the direction which it will be compressed between the wheel drive transfer pegs  and the forward side of the associated oval opening  of hub . As can be seen, there are five rubber inserts  matching five oval openings  in hub . The direction of force turning is counterclockwise from the perspective of FIG. . Initial turning tends to compress slightly the five rubber inserts  to create a much gentler beginning motion. Once the rubber inserts  are initially compressed under the instant starting force, and once forward motion starts, the rubber inserts  will decompress slightly as forward motion starts.","Referring to , a second possible embodiment includes a drive wheel  material made of a shock absorbing material which removes the need for individual rubber inserts . A drive wheel  is made of softer material, especially an intermediate layer  which connects a hub  and an outer layer . In this case, the hub  includes circular drive transfer bores  for directly accepting the drive transfer pegs .","Referring to , a third possible embodiment includes a drive wheel  incorporating a hub  that has oval openings  within it. The rubber material of the drive wheel  extends to fill the oval openings  thereby eliminating the need for separate inserts. A smaller bore  will help control the deformation of the rubber in oval opening  of hub  in the direction which it will be compressed between the wheel drive transfer pegs  and the forward side of the associated oval opening  of hub .","Referring to , an overall schematic illustrating a an over current, over temperature, under voltage, soft start and rate of rise\/rate of fall circuit shown within an overall schematic . Where items are named which were seen in earlier figures, the original numbering will be used. The overall block schematic of , as well as the circuitry diagram of  give a control system which can both detect and react to a set reaction conditions, individually or collectively, and which include one or more of an over current condition, a rate of fall condition, a rate of rise condition, a high temperature condition and an under voltage condition","BATTERY  is connected to motor  via MOTOR CURRENT SENSOR block  and controlled via Motor Switch block . When a power switch  (seen physically as the plunger switch assembly ) is switched on, an UNDER VOLTAGE DETECTOR block  begins to monitor the voltage of Battery  and switches the motor  off if battery voltage drops below a predetermined level, or if a MOTOR TEMPERATURE SENSOR block  begins to monitor the temperature of motor  and shuts the motor  down for a minimum predetermined time via a TEMPERATURE SWITCH TIMER block  if the temperature rises above a predetermined limit and the combined action of a RAMP GENERATOR block  and a pulse width modulator PWM GENERATOR block  begin to progressively switch on MOTOR SWITCH block  which causes MOTOR CURRENT SENSOR block  to send a signal to an OVER CURRENT PROTECTOR block  which momentarily switches off the motor via RAMP GENERATOR RESTART block  if the current rises above a predetermined limit, RATE OF RISE (ROR) block  which monitors the current utilized and if the current utilized rises above a predetermined rate (amps per second) the circuit momentarily shuts down the motor  via RAMP GENERATOR RESTART block  and Rate of Fall (ROF) block  which monitors the current utilized and if the current utilized drops above a predetermined rate (amps per second) shuts off power momentarily via RAMP GENERATOR RESTART block .","An OPTIONAL ROR\/ROF PROHIBITOR block  delays the output signal from the MOTOR CURRENT SENSOR block  to the ROR block  and ROF block  until the RAMP GENERATOR block  has completed its ramp generation and the MOTOR SWITCH block  is fully on.","The circuit  has several parts, including the rate of rise (ROR) and rate of fall (ROF) components. The ROR portion monitors the current utilized and if the current utilized rises above a predetermined rate (amps per second) the circuit shuts down the motor . The physical condition which would cause an ROR trip condition is one in which the wheelchair suddenly slows quickly under positive force conditions, for example, as the wheelchair  bumps into a curb or wall. This results in a rapid slowing of the motor leading to a surge in current and torque. The ROR circuit reacts more quickly than a simple over current circuit. A simple over current circuit would allow current to rise all the way up to a preset limit before cutting power, however the ROR circuitry of the present invention will cut power as soon as the current begins to rise rapidly towards the preset limit.","The ROF circuit also monitors the current and shuts off power if the current drops above a predetermined rate (amps per second). The condition which would cause a ROF trip is one in which the wheelchair drive unit suddenly and unexpectedly speeds up. This would occur if the drive wheel was turning slower than its top speed and then suddenly sped up, for example if it slipped on loose gravel, ice, oil or simply bounced up and lost traction with the pavement. The motor would normally suddenly speed up to its no load speed with a corresponding reduction in current.","Referring to , an analog realization of the circuit  provides an operating system for both operation and protection of the motor . At the upper right of  is a flag entitled +12V which represents the positive 12 volt connection to the battery. The flag entitled MOTOR+ indicates the positive lead for the motor . The flag GND is the generalized ground flag. The plunger switch assembly  is shown as connecting the positive 12 volt connection to the battery to the positive lead for the motor .","The motor  power input terminals are paralleled by a capacitor C. A series combination of capacitors C and C are connected in parallel to capacitor C. The center connection of capacitors C and C are connected into the motor  at a center of the stator windings. The motor positive lead is also connected to ground through a parallel combination of capacitor C and capacitor C.","The motor positive lead is connected into the negative input of an operational amplifier U: through a resistor R.
