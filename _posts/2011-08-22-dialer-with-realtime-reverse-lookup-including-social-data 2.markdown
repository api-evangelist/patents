{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to integration of information stored remotely at a social networking system into a real-time reverse lookup dialer application.","The advent of social networking and ubiquitous wireless data networks allow a user of the social network to remotely retrieve an enormous amount of profile data for his or her contacts, or friends, on the social network with little to no latency. The integration of mobile devices using wireless data networks allows the integration of relevant information stored on social networking systems into call dialer screens, enhancing the user experience when making voice calls or composing short message service (SMS) or email messages.","The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.","Overview","Particular embodiments relate to a dialer application that pulls profile information from a social networking system. The dialer application determines whether the dialed number is associated with a friend of the user account associated with the mobile or computing device, and depending on whether the recipient is a friend, displays various information that is deemed to be relevant to the user making the call.","Implementations of the present invention extend these concepts by allowing a dialer application to make the determination locally, and display friend data that is cached locally on the mobile device. Furthermore, in the scenario where the recipient is not a friend of the member of the social network, the social networking system may still pull public profile information for display to the user making the call. Further, when the outgoing number is not associated with any particular user, but a hub page representing a business, the social network may also pull information from the hub page for display to the user. Thus the application provides a user making a call immediate, socially relevant information that he or she may reference during the call.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","180","300","190","210","310","300","200","180","180","180","180","180","310","180","200"]},"Mobile device  interacts with external websites  and other service providers  through a web browser residing on the client device, or a dedicated application local to mobile device . For example, mobile device  may interact with third-party instant VoIP service , such as Google Voice\u2122 or Skype\u2122, by visiting and logging into their account via a web browser, or by installing and running a dedicated application. The same applies for video calls via third-party service providers  such as Apple FaceTime\u2122 or Tango. This disclosure contemplates any type of third-party service provider  connected to network  or PSTN .","A user of mobile device  interacts with social networking system  via an application, such as a web browser or a native application, to perform operations such as browsing content, posting and sending messages, retrieving and sorting messages received from other users, and the like. Messages can be in any electronic message format such as electronic mail (\u201ce-mail\u201d) messages, chat messages, comments left on a user's webpage, and short message service (SMS) text messages. Messages can contain plain text, or they can contain other content such as pictures, videos, and attachments. Each user has a mailbox that includes messages that are both sent and received by the user. Mobile device  may also use an application or browser to pull and view profile information for various user nodes and hubs in social networking system .","Mobile device , connected through wireless network , may also interact with other client devices through the circuit-switched, or non-data, portion of wireless network . For example, a user at mobile device  may transmit and receive a non-VoIP call to a cellular phone or landline in PSTN , transmit and receive a text or multi-media message through the SMS or MMS channels, or receive push notifications through the SMS control channel.","Additionally, third party website  can also interact with the social networking system  via a system-provided application programming interface (API) . For example, the third party website can perform operations supported by the API, such as delivering messages to the social network system , retrieving messages stored by the social networking system , and obtaining social information about users of the social networking system .","Social networking system  comprises an object store , and a graph information store . Object store  stores information on objects, such as users, represented in or by the social networking environment . Graph information store  stores information on the relationships of the objects in object store .","In particular embodiments, the social graph information includes a first set of user nodes that each correspond to a respective user, and a second set of concept nodes that each correspond to a respective concept. As used herein, a \u201cuser\u201d may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third party application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over such a social network environment. As used herein, a \u201cconcept\u201d may refer to virtually anything that a user may declare or otherwise demonstrate an interest in, a like towards, or a relationship with, such as, by way of example, a sport, a sports team, a genre of music, a musical composer, a hobby, a business (enterprise), an entity, a group, a third party application, a celebrity, a person who is not a registered user, etc. In particular embodiments, each node has, represents, or is represented by, a corresponding web page (\u201cprofile page\u201d) hosted or accessible in the social network environment.","By way of example, a user node may have a corresponding user profile page in which the corresponding user can add content, make declarations, and otherwise express him or herself, while a concept node may have a corresponding concept profile page (\u201chub\u201d) in which a plurality of users can add content, make declarations, and express themselves, particularly in relation to the concept. In particular embodiments, the social graph information further includes a plurality of edges that each define or represent a connection between a corresponding pair of nodes in the social graph. In particular embodiments, profile information for user nodes is stored in user store , while hub page information for concepts, such as businesses, is stored in hubs store . Nodes directly connected by a friend edge are considered one degree of separation away, and are listed as \u201cfriends\u201d on the social network. Users of the social network may specify elements or portions of their profile which may be viewed only by friends, or friends of friends (second degree contacts). In particular embodiments, users may define privacy settings that only allow certain groups or individual members of the social network to view portions of their profile. For further detail on hubs, please see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/763,171 titled, \u201cIntegrated Social Network Environment,\u201d previously filed on Apr. 19, 2010 and fully incorporated by reference herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","180","200","201","200","200","202","203","200","204","204","203"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","180","100","204","300","302","180","180","200","302","301","303","304","302","304","180","302","304"]},"Additionally, a user may more quickly visually verify that he or she has entered the correct number even in the situation where the user has incorrectly memorized the number. For example, if the user intends to call Francis Luu, enters the number, but fails to see profile information for Francis Luu, the user immediately knows he or she has entered an incorrect number.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","180","100","400","300","400","401","100","401","400","402","304"]},"In all cases where the users actuates user-selectable button  and  to view the intended recipient's social networking profile, the information displayed to the user is subject to one or more privacy policies maintained by social networking system . For example, the intended recipient may only choose to display some information publicly, or to members of certain networks. Thus, where the user and intended call recipient are not friends, the information displayed to the user is limited to the privacy settings of the intended recipient and the relationship information between the two stored in the social graph. Even in the scenario where the user and the intended call recipient are friends, or first-degree contacts, the intended recipient may have privacy settings limiting the display of any given piece of information from any given member or groups of members. The social data displayed to the user by the dialer application is limited by these policies and the relationship information between the user and the recipient stored in the social graph.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","180","100","100","100"]},"Interface  contains socially relevant information retrieved from the hub page associated with the entered number. In particular embodiments, interface  includes the name  of the entity associated with the hub page, in this example, \u201cDelfina Restaurant.\u201d Interface  may also include the entered number , and, in particular embodiments, socially-relevant information  tailored to the specific user of mobile device . For example, in  displays how many of the user's friends \u201clike\u201d the detected entity. In particular embodiments, temporally-sensitive social information, such as if friends of the user recently checked into the physical location associated with the hub page, may have a higher priority than other social information. This disclosure contemplates any ranking of display of any relevant social information on interface .","Interface  similarly includes user-selectable button , which, when actuated, displays the hub page or a portion thereof to the user. In particular embodiments, mobile-specific information retrieved from the hub page, such as a map to the physical location associated with the hub page, hours of operation, or the like, may be displayed. This disclosure contemplates the display of any suitable portion of the hub page associated with the entered phone number.","The dialer application displays interfaces , , and  substantially simultaneously with the user's input of a user identifier. Although the foregoing examples describe a user entering a phone number, this disclosure contemplates all types of communications and associated user identifiers. In particular embodiments, this outgoing communication is a SMS or MMS text message, and the user identifier is a phone number. In particular embodiments, the outgoing communication is a VoIP call, and the communication source is an account (generally a username) for the VoIP service. In particular embodiments, the communication is a video chat, and the communication is an account (usually a username) for the video chat service. In other embodiments, the incoming communication is an e-mail, direct message from a third-party site, instant message, SMS\/MMS message, and the like. Although this disclosure primarily pertains to real-time full-duplex communications, all other forms of communication are contemplated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["300","400","500","601","180"]},"At Step , mobile device  performs a reverse lookup of the stored contacts in offline storage . Reverse lookups are well-known in the art and are not discussed in detail here. In particular embodiments, dialer application performs the reverse lookup substantially in real-time, narrowing the potentially matching contacts as each digit is entered by the user. In particular embodiments, the dialer application performs the reverse lookup only after all the digits, for example, ten digits in the United States, have been received. This disclosure contemplates any manner or algorithm for performing a reverse lookup.","If the dialer application at Step  determines, as a result of the reverse lookup, that the phone number matches a number stored in association with a friend of the user whose data is pre-cached in offline storage , dialer application displays the relevant social information at Step . The pre-caching of social information may occur at any given time. In particular embodiments, the information is downloaded and stored whenever the user adds a new friend on social networking system . In particular embodiments, the information is downloaded and stored periodically. In particular embodiments, the information is downloaded and stored in response to a synchronization operation. This disclosure contemplates any manner of timing the download and storage, or pre-caching, of friend information. In particular embodiments, because the relevant social information is relatively limited, it is possible to efficiently store all the user's contacts in offline storage .","If the dialer application at Step  determines, as a result of the reverse lookup, that the phone number does not match the numbers stored in association with any of the users friends in offline storage , the dialer application transmits the entered number to social networking system  at Step . In particular embodiments, the dialer application also transmits a user identifier of the member account associated with the user of mobile device  to the server. In particular embodiments, the user of mobile device  associates a social networking user ID with mobile device  when he or she first uses the device, and the user ID is transmitted through a specialized application on mobile device . In other embodiments, the user ID is explicitly transmitted in all transmissions to the social networking system . In other embodiments, the user ID is associated on the server-side of the social networking system with a client device identifier, such as a phone number, IMSI, IMEI, or the like. Regardless, the social networking system associates mobile device  with a particular member, called the \u201cuser\u201d in this disclosure for purposes of simplicity.","In particular embodiments, mobile device  maintains an always-on connection via network  to the servers of social networking system . In particular embodiments, mobile device  initiates a connection with social networking system  via network  when the dialer application is launched. This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of connection initialization and management known those of ordinary skill in the art.","At Step , an application residing on one or more servers of social networking system  receives the entered number. As will be discussed with regard to , the server need not receive the entire number simultaneously to begin the reverse lookup. Given the vast number of phone numbers stored in social networking system , it may be beneficial to begin the reverse lookup as soon as the first digit is received by mobile device .","At Step , the application residing on one or more of the servers performs a reverse lookup for users or other entities associated with the received phone number, and determines whether a matching entity resides in social networking system  at Step . User store  and hubs store  may store phone numbers in conjunction with particular members or concept nodes of the social network. The application attempts to match the number with a number existing in user store  or concept store . After finding a match, the application looks up the social networking user identifier for the user or concept node associated with the number. In particular embodiments, member phone numbers (or other identifiers) may be stored by the user on his or her own profile. In other embodiments, a first user may store phone numbers for a second user in his or her own online phonebook. Naturally, in such a scenario, the reverse look-up would return the user ID of the second user. In particular embodiments, the IDs represent user or concept nodes in the social graph.","If the server cannot find a match, then the process ends at Step . In particular embodiments, at Step , mobile device  displays the prior art dialer screen depicted in . In particular embodiments, mobile device  displays the prior art dialer screen depicted in  until social data is received from the server.","If the application residing on one or more servers of social networking system  determines that the received number matches one associated with an entity of social networking , at Step  the application assesses the relationship between the user transmitting the number and the entity associated with the number by accessing social graph network store . The application residing on one or more of the servers of social networking system  accesses the graph network store to determine the relationship, if any, between the calling user node and the recipient node.","As discussed earlier, the user's access to the member's information depends on one or more privacy policies of social networking system , or one or more privacy policies of a member associated with the received number. After analyzing the social relationship between the user and the entity matching the received number, the application transmits the relevant social information, subject to the aforementioned privacy policies, to mobile device  in Step .","At Step , mobile device  displays the received social information as depicted in . Because of the latency of network , it is possible that the user may be ready to call before the social information is received from the servers of social networking system . In such a case, the social information is simply not displayed. In particular embodiments, dialer application displays a \u201cloading\u201d icon on interfaces  or  to indicate that a match has been found, and that the download of socially relevant information is in progress.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["180","700","100","111","606","701","180","700"]},"In Step , server , immediately upon receiving the first digit (\u201c7\u201d), eliminates all stored phone numbers beginning with digits other than \u201c7\u201d from the set of potential matches. Similarly, in step , the user enters the second digit of the phone number, in this example \u201c1\u201d, and mobile device  immediately transmits the digit to server . Similarly, in Step , server  narrows the set of potential matching phone numbers to numbers beginning with \u201c71.\u201d This process repeats itself until Step , where the last digit is received. In this example, the number is a U.S. 10-digit phone number, but this disclosure contemplates phone numbers or identifiers of any length. Additionally, although not shown, this disclosure contemplates sending a \u201cdelete\u201d or \u201cback\u201d command from mobile device  to server  if the user chooses to delete the previous number due to mistakes in entry.","At Step , an application residing on server  obtains the result of the reverse lookup corresponding to a user ID identifying a specific user or entity of social networking system . Subject to the privacy check of Step , the application residing on server  obtains the socially relevant information, and in Step  transmits the information back to client\/mobile device .
