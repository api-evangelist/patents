RO1-NS40801 and RO1-EB00422 awarded by The National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","Embodiments herein relate to identification of cancer, and, more specifically, to methods and apparatus using magnetic resonance imaging for cancer identification.","Screening for breast cancer represents one of modern medicine's success stories. However, the continued large fraction of false positives in current diagnostic protocols often leads to biopsy\/pathology procedures that cause considerable pain, anxiety, healthcare cost, and possibly increased malignancy risk, but which are potentially avoidable. To address this problem, there have been recent calls for the increased use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in breast screening.","The problems associated with false positive results are not unique to breast cancer screening. Other cancers suffer from large numbers of false positive results, causing significant stress as well as often requiring additional costly and painful procedures to confirm or deny the initial results.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration embodiments that may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope. Therefore, the following detailed description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of embodiments is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","Various operations may be described as multiple discrete operations in turn, in a manner that may be helpful in understanding embodiments; however, the order of description should not be construed to imply that these operations are order dependent.","The description may use perspective-based descriptions such as up\/down, back\/front, and top\/bottom. Such descriptions are merely used to facilitate the discussion and are not intended to restrict the application of disclosed embodiments.","For the purposes of the description, a phrase in the form \u201cA\/B\u201d or in the form \u201cA and\/or B\u201d means (A), (B), or (A and B). For the purposes of the description, a phrase in the form \u201cat least one of A, B, and C\u201d means (A), (B), (C), (A and B), (A and C), (B and C), or (A, B and C). For the purposes of the description, a phrase in the form \u201c(A)B\u201d means (B) or (AB) that is, A is an optional element.","The description may use the terms \u201cembodiment\u201d or \u201cembodiments,\u201d which may each refer to one or more of the same or different embodiments. Furthermore, the terms \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201chaving,\u201d and the like, as used with respect to embodiments, are synonymous.","In various embodiments, methods, apparatuses, and systems using magnetic resonance imaging for cancer identification are provided. In exemplary embodiments, a computing device may be endowed with one or more components of the disclosed apparatuses and\/or systems and may be employed to perform one or more methods as disclosed herein.","Embodiments herein provide a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique and optionally newly developed software\u2014collectively referred to as the \u201cshutter-speed\u201d model\u2014to analyze image data of cancer patients. Embodiments provide a minimally invasive, yet precisely accurate, approach to determining whether tumors are malignant or benign. Exemplary embodiments provide MRI measured biomarkers for tumor malignancy determination, effectively solving the false positive riddle from which current MRI techniques suffer.","Although some embodiments throughout are described with reference to breast cancer or prostate cancer, the methods and apparatuses described herein may be utilized for other cancers, such as brain, esophageal, leg osteosarcoma, etc. as well as for any Dynamic-Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) analysis where water exchange effects are relevant, including tissue differential\/disease state analysis of the brain (Alzheimers, MS, etc.), muscles (such as heart), etc., and quantitative vascular phenotype mapping.","\u201cQuantitative MRI\u201d produces parametric maps of MR, patho-physiological, and\/or pharmacokinetic biomarker properties. The DCE-MRI sub-category is particularly significant because it applies to a wide pathology range. In DCE-MRI, the T-weighted tissue HO MRI signal intensity is acquired before, during, and after the (usually) bolus injection of a hydrophilic, paramagnetic contrast reagent (CR). The CR passage through a tissue region-of-interest (ROI) can cause a transient increase of the longitudinal HO relaxation rate constant [R\u2261(T)] with consequent elevated MR steady-state signal intensity. This elevation may be identified on the MR image.","In DCE-MRI, the neglect of intercompartmental water exchange kinetics considerations can lead to systematic errors in parameters extracted by quantitative analyses. Examples here are the compartmental water mole fractions defining tissue spaces. Therefore, DCE-MRI is also a sub-category of in vivo MR \u201cmolecular imaging\u201d\u2014mapping the distribution and\/or activity of molecules in living tissues.","In essence, in embodiments, the CR plays the role of the nuclear medicine radioactive tracer. However, in nuclear medicine, the tracer is detected directly (by its radioactivity in disintegrations per second (dps)\u2014the amount of tracer present in the tissue, but compartmental localization is not intrinsic to the signal). In contrast, the MRI CR is detected indirectly, via its interaction with water and effect on the nature of tissue HO relaxation (so the water interaction with the CR is what is directly traced). Beneficially, the CR is not radioactive. Also, MRI involves no ionizing radiation.","Affecting the recovery of longitudinal HO magnetization (i.e., in the magnetic field direction) requires (transient) water CR molecular interaction, as depicted in . The three major loci for tissue water, the cytoplasmae, the interstitium, and the blood, are indicated with subscripts i, o (or e), and b (p, for plasma), respectively. There are water binding equilibria depicted in each compartment in which the CR is thought to enter. The compartmental volume fractions are designated as v, v, and v, respectively, though the relative areas in  are not proportional.","The CR and water molecules are never equally distributed in tissue. Therefore, the only way that most water (cytoplasmic) can access CR is via exchange equilibria across cytolemmae and blood vessel walls. These are indicated in  with the unidirectional rate constants, k, k, and k, k, respectively. In existing methods, tracer pharmacokinetic models are applied directly to MRI data\u2014such methods are referred to here as the Standard Model (SM). However, this results in the constraint that all inter-compartmental equilibrium water exchange processes be treated as if infinitely fast (k+k\u2192\u221e, and k+k\u2192\u221e). This is not valid, and the assumption may effectively \u201cshort circuit\u201d MRI determination of CR compartmentalization\u2014the pharmacokinetic essence. In accordance with embodiments herein, the incorporation of equilibrium water exchange MR effects into pharmacokinetic derivation is referred to herein as the Shutter-Speed Model (SSM). This is accomplished by allowing k+kand k+kto be finite.","The SM assumes that water exchange between cells and\/or blood and the interstitial spaces is effectively infinitely fast (in the fast exchange limit\u2014FXL). However, when CR is passing through the tumor tissue, the water exchange systems can depart from this fast exchange limit due to the interaction with the CR (and therefore enter into a fast-exchange regime\u2014FXR). This happens for both benign and malignant tumors; however, the exchange difference between FXL and FXR, as far as Kis concerned, is significantly greater for malignant tumors as opposed to benign tumors. For benign tumors, the exchange difference is typically below 0.025 min, whereas for malignant tumors, the exchange difference is typically above 0.025 min. This differentiating line provides a threshold against which the obtained values may be compared to classify a tumor or tissue sample. In embodiments, a threshold may be established at an exchange difference (delta K) of 0.02 to 0.03 min.","While a single threshold is mentioned above, in embodiments, more than one delta Kthreshold may be established. For example, a first threshold may be established that is intended to include all or a substantial percentage of the malignant tissues above the threshold. A secondary threshold may be established at a lower delta Kvalue with an intention of included all true positive indicators. However, a lower threshold may introduce a larger number of false positives. For a tissue having a delta Kvalue residing between the first and second threshold, additional analysis may be utilized to further classify the tissue.","In an embodiment, the shutter-speed model (SSM) accounts for the FXR (therefore including equilibrium exchange effects when the CR passes through) and thus is better able to pick up the \u201cleaky blood vessel\u201d effect which is common in malignant tumors. At a maximum level of CR in the interstitial space, an interstitial water molecule in a benign lesion may typically encounter a CR molecule an average of 60 times before it enters a cell, whereas in a malignant tumor this may happen 260 times on average (4+ times as often). If that difference is neglected (which the standard model does), then it is sufficient to cause significant K(the volume-weighted CR extravasation rate constant) underestimations in malignant tumors. Because Kvalues are greater for malignant tissues than for benign tissues, if Kis underestimated, then it may make a malignant tumor seem benign (false negative) or vice versa a benign tissue appear to be malignant (false positive). The SSM model accounts for this difference, and by using the delta K(change in K) as well as the Kto kcomparison, classification of tumors may be accomplished. In accordance with an embodiment, kis the unidirectional CR intravasation rate constant\u2014it is Kdivided by the v(the extracellular, extravascular volume fraction available to the contrast agent molecule). The pharmacokinetic analysis of DCE-MRI data yields Kand k.","In accordance with an embodiment, the difference in Kreturned by SSM, as compared to the Standard Model analyses, offers a very high degree of tumor differentiation (i.e., specificity). It is a measure of the shutter-speed effect, which is disproportionally present and important in malignant tumors, that permits differentiation of benign and malignant tumors. The increased permeability of malignant tumor blood vessels exceeds a threshold above which exchange kinetics become influential. This amplification is measured by the delta Kbiomarker, and accounts for the high SSM specificity.","In analyses of DCE-MRI data from patients with suspicious breast lesions initially ruled positive by institutional screening protocols, the SM Kvalues for benign and malignant lesions exhibit considerable overlap. The Shutter-Speed Model (SSM) may allow for finite exchange kinetics thus agreeing with the SM Kvalue for each of the benign lesions. However, it reveals that the SM underestimates Kfor each of the malignant tumors in this population.  illustrates Kvalues obtained by both SM and SSM, and shows how SSM recognizes a difference in Kbetween benign and malignant tissue. The fact that this phenomenon is unique to malignant tumors allows their discrimination from the benign lesions, as validated by comparison with gold standard pathology analyses of subsequent biopsy tissue samples to which the MRI analyses were blinded. Likewise, the SM overestimates k, particularly for the benign tumors. Thus, incorporation of the SSM into the screening protocols may preclude the need for the biopsy\/pathology procedures that otherwise would yield benign findings.","Thus, in embodiments, two binary classifiers have been developed:","1. \u201cdeltaK\u201d\u2014the change in K; thresholds may be established with the goal\/intention of including all true positives. Thresholds may be established as desired to distinguish\/classify the tissues\/tumors. In an embodiment, further analysis may be conducted via a secondary mapping algorithm (plot of (KVS. k) to allow for a second determination with respect to those points that are somewhat unclear or fall below a determined threshold.","2. The use of 2D plots (Kvs. k), where the radius of a circle centered at the origin of the plot may be used as a \u201cbinary classifier.\u201d In embodiments, the radius of the circle may be used as a threshold to distinguish benign from malignant tumors. Such a threshold may be established at approximately 0.2 min, for example, from 0.19 minto 0.25 min.","In embodiments, an MRI examination aided by SSM analysis may provide a clearer diagnosis and may be an intermediate step between a mammographic scan and a biopsy intervention if breast cancer is suspected from both the mammogram and the MRI results. Adding this intermediate diagnostic step may greatly reduce or eliminate the number of unnecessary (and possibly all) biopsy surgeries and also reduce the pain, stress and expense for most patients.","It is important to note that the SSM is a generalization of the SM. That is, the SM is but a special case of the SSM. Thus, if the shutter-speed effect is negligible in any tissue, the program will automatically perform a SM analysis. One can test this by computationally constraining the SSM analysis to a SM form. If there is no difference from the result obtained when the SSM analysis is given free rein, then there is no significant shutter-speed effect for that tissue. In the case of breast tumors, this is the case for the Kbiomarker in only benign lesions. However, there is a shutter-speed effect for the vbiomarker in benign breast lesions, and it is about the same size as in malignant tumors.","To test SSM, SSM was employed to analyze MR images of 22 women volunteers who had previously screened positive for breast cancer by mammography and\/or clinical examination. The shutter-speed software operates by using a complex mathematical formula to track the passage of injected contrast dye through a tumor area. Contrast dyes are commonly used in medical imaging to increase the visibility of tissue abnormalities.","When viewed through the shutter-speed analysis, the MRI data suggested that only seven of the 22 women actually had malignant tumors. These projections were later shown to be 100 percent accurate after each of the study participants underwent subsequent biopsies for pathology determinations. Typically, 75 percent of mammographically-indicated biopsies yield negative pathology results, meaning that an intermediate step such as an MRI determination could greatly reduce or eliminate the number of unnecessary biopsy surgeries.","This population study has been expanded to include 77 breast tumors (in 74 patients) and, with the mapping provision for one rare type of malignant tumor, maintains 100% specificity.  illustrates delta Kresults of the 74 patient data set illustrating 77 lesions.","In addition,  illustrates the multiple threshold concept described previously. The first threshold is intended to capture all or a substantial percentage of the malignant tissues above the threshold. The first delta Kthreshold may be set, for example, between 0.02 minand 0.03 min. The secondary threshold is established at a lower delta Kvalue with an intention of included all true positive indicators. The second delta Kthreshold may be set, for example, between 0.01 minand 0.02 min. For a tissue having a delta Kvalue residing between the first and second threshold, additional analysis may be utilized to further classify the tissue. Such analysis may include heat map analysis of regions of interest to better classify the tissue.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 4","sup":["trans ","trans "]},"For the more limited data set (22 patients), data were obtained with consent from patients with positive mammographic and\/or clinical MRI reports from standard, institutional breast cancer workups and protocols.

Emphasizing practicability and robustness, the data are of a rather routine clinical nature (and they were obtained at two different institutions, with two different instruments, CRs, etc.): the two different data acquisitions were not optimized for DCE-MRI.

The analyses of these ROI data were also conducted independently by two investigators. The algebraic means of the model parameters returned from each investigator's fitting were computed lesion-by-lesion.","Each of the fittings neglects the small blood water proton signal (HO)\u2014thus, these are \u201cfirst generation\u201d versions. For this situation, the MR exchange system of interest is that for equilibrium transcytolemmal water interchange (k, and k, ). The system's condition is given by the comparison of the equilibrium kinetics, k=K+k, with the pertinent MR shutter-speed, T\u2261|R\u2212R|, where Rand Rare the relaxation rate constants for the HOand HOsignals in the absence of exchange. Before CR arrival, R\u2248Rand T<<k. Though k is finite, and invariant throughout the DCE-MRI study, the system is in the fast-exchange-limit (FXL): the kinetics appear infinitely fast, and the measured tissue HO Ris single-valued. As stated above, the Standard Model assumes that the system remains in the FXL throughout the CR bolus passage, so it is referred to also as the FXL-constrained (FXL-c) model (see ). However, as the CRconcentration increases, Rbecomes increasingly larger than Rand Tat least approaches the constant k value. For some period, the measured Rremains effectively single-valued, and this has been defined to be the fast-exchange-regime (FXR). Admitting departure from the FXL for the FXR may be referred to as FXR-allowed (FXR-a) (see ). Further CRincrease may lead to the condition where Ris effectively double-valued: this is referred to as the slow-exchange-regime (SXR). Admitting this is referred to as SXR-allowed (SXR-a) (see ). For the cases here, the results of FXL-c and FXR-a analyses are presented in Table 1. Careful analyses with the SXR-a model suggest that it is incompatible with these data\u2014an example will be seen below. There are a number of potentially variable parameters. For the SM (FXL-c) analyses, the variables were Kand v, while for the SSM (FXR-a) analyses, \u03c4was also varied. In terms of the  notation, K=vk=vk, and \u03c4=k. The values returned for K, a measure of the rate of passive CR transfer across the vessel wall, and k, the unidirectional rate constant for CR intravasation () are given in Table 1. Sample standard deviation measures of parameter uncertainty from individual fittings are given for some entries. These were determined by multiple Monte Carlo fitting calculations. The Kand kvalues for the malignant tumors (top seven entries) are larger than those for the benign lesions.","Table 1 indicates that the SM does not completely separate the malignant tumors (top seven entries) from the benign lesions with either the Kor kparameters. However, the SSM significantly increases Kfor every one of the malignant lesions, and for none of the benign tumors, as compared to the SM. Furthermore, though the SSM reduces kfor both malignant and benign lesions, it does this more for the benign tumors. In embodiments, these changes allow discrimination between the SSM and SM results.","Though neither of the parameters allows the construction of perfect ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristic) plots, the SSM Kand kquantities come very close. These aspects may be seen in the 2D parametric scatter plots of the K(ordinate) and k(abscissa) values presented in . The ROI values for lesions found by pathology analyses (Table 1) to be solely benign are indicated with triangles, while those with major malignant regions are shown as black circles. The two gray circles with black cores also represent malignant tumors and are discussed below. The results from the SM (FXL-c) analyses are seen in panel a, while those from the SSM (FXR-a) determinations are shown in panel b. The values for patient 5 are so large that they are shown in inset panel c and inset panel d.","In comparing with , one can note especially the upward movement (increasing K) of the circles and the leftward movement (decreasing k) of the triangles, in going from the SM to the SSM. This allows the almost complete separation of these points in , which is not achieved in any single dimension of either panel. It is important to note that two of the triangles represent B-5 lesions (Table 1): i.e., they were \u201chighly suggestive\u201d false positives. Retaining 100% sensitivity (not missing any malignant tumor), the PPV values for the SM K, SM k, SSM K, and SSM kdimensions are: 54%, 39%, 70%, and 70%, respectively. In the SSM 2D plot, one can draw a dashed quarter-circle of radius 0.19 min, that also allows a 78% PPV.","Furthermore, consider the annular region between this and the other concentric quarter-circle, of radius 0.23 min. The only two malignant tumors (circles with dark cores within) are those of patients 3 (upper) and 7 (lower). These are cases where the malignant areas are quite small compared with the total tumor area visualized in the biopsy specimen (Table 1). This means that the analyses of whole-tumor ROI-averaged data cause a partial volume dilution of the DCE-MRI parametric values. This can be seen clearly in panels b and c of , which present Kparametric heat maps of the lesion of patient 3. In the SM (FXL-c) and SSM (FXR-a) maps (panels b and c, respectively), a clear \u201chot spot\u201d is seen on the posterior lesion edge. The hot spot has Kvalues above 0.16 minin the FXR-a map, considerably elevated above the ROI-averaged magnitude (Table 1).","The hot regions of all seven malignant tumors in this population have SSM Kvalues exceeding 0.1 min. Except for that of patient 17 (upper triangle in annulus, and which uniquely exhibits ductal dilation (Table 1)), this exceeds the ROI-averaged SSM Kvalues of any of the fifteen benign lesions. With , , and , parametric maps (heat maps) of four of the seven malignant tumors have been presented in several publications referenced below. Some hot spots can be as small as 2 mm in diameter. In another indication of potential staging power, a plot (not shown) of \u201chotness\u201d vs. area of the SSM Khot spots in the malignant tumors of patients 5, 6, and 7 demonstrates that these two independently measured quantities are very highly positively correlated. The fact that the SXR-a Kmap of the patient 3 lesion () does not show increased values relative to the FXL-c map ()\u2014and in fact obliterates the hot spot\u2014is an example of the SXR-a model incompatibility with these data.","The Kand kvalues are rather well correlated in , particularly in panel b. The positions of the panel a and b insets are placed with constant coordinate aspect ratios. Thus, one can visually include the inset points in the correlations. The slope of a line drawn through the points represents the mean vvalue of these lesions. Such a line for has a slope near 0.5.","These results suggest a potential breast cancer screening protocol in accordance with an embodiment herein. The first step of such a protocol would be a clinical examination and\/or mammography. A positive result (B-4 or B-5), or suspicion of a mammographically occult lesion, would occasion referral for diagnostic MRI that includes DCE. The radiologist can circumscribe an ROI from the DCE image showing the greatest enhancement. Alternatively, this can be automated (ex., Jim 4.0 software; Xinapse Systems; Thorpe Waterville, UK). The computer can very quickly (few seconds) conduct SM and SSM analyses on the mean ROI signal time-course data and produce SSM Kand kvalues, which can be compared with 2D scatter plots such as those in . If a patient's point turns out to be in the annulus between the quarter-circles in , the radiologist could proceed to read Kparametric lesion maps made from the same DCR-MRI data, though these require more computational time. Hot spots above 0.1 minwould be very suspicious for malignancy.","Some oncologists advocate a separate regimen for a malignant ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) tumor, possibly simply following it instead of immediate surgery, while others urge excision. The only solely DCIS case in the discussed patient population is that of patient 1. Her position in is the black point closest to the outer quarter-circle. In fact another concentric quarter-circle of radius 0.3 minwould isolate this point. Its position could be \u201cfollowed\u201d or tracked over a period of time to see if it moves up and to the right. Inside the inner quarter-circle, most of the benign LCIS lesions are found in the upper right sector, while all of the FA lesions are found near the bottom.","In the analyses so far, pseudo-absolute parameter values have been employed. The SSM success suggests that neglect of equilibrium transcytolemmal water exchange effects may constitute the most significant systematic error in Standard Model DCE-MRI pharmacokinetic analyses.","For screening purposes, the most striking aspect of the Table 1 and  results is that every one of the malignant tumor ROI Kvalues (dark circles) is clearly decreased by the SM analysis, while every one of the benign lesion ROI values (triangles) is not. This is seen even more clearly in , which presents the 1D scatter plot for \u0394K[\u2261K(SSM)\u2212K(SM)]. There is a wide gap between all seven of the dark circles [group mean, 0.06 min\u22121 (excluding the inset point)], and all 15 of the triangles. The latter set clusters very near zero [group mean, 0.006 min\u22121]. A clean cut-off line is drawn at 0.024 min. Since the only difference between these two models is the allowance for the effect on the NMR signal of finite equilibrium transcytolemmal water exchange kinetics, the NMR shutter-speed effect, this suggests that it is significant (for the Kmagnitude) with the capillary wall permeability obtained for the vascular beds of only malignant breast tumors. Thus, this is very encouraging that analyses of DCE-MRI ROI data first with one pharmacokinetic model and then with the other (which is still accomplished in only seconds) can lead to extremely high specificity in cancer screening. Here, the positive criterion of \u0394K>0.025 minyields 100% PPV.","Apparently, in the vascular beds of malignant breast tumors only, the interstitial (\u201coutside\u201d) CR concentration, (CR), transiently rises to sufficient values during the bolus passage and the equilibrium transcytolemmal water exchange system transiently departs the FXL to sufficient extent and\/or for sufficient duration to substantially invalidate the SM Kdetermination. The SSM interpretation is that, during the bolus passage through malignant lesions, the relaxographic Tvalue for the transcytolemmal water exchange process, |R\u2212R|, transiently approaches or exceeds that for the unchanging exchange rate constant, k+k, (in vivo studies are isothermal) sufficiently for the system to enter at least the fast-exchange regime (FXR), but probably not also the slow-exchange-regime (SXR). Rincreases with CR, while R, remains constant. This is a manifestation of the varying equilibrium competition for interstitial water molecules between diamagnetic cytoplasmic spaces and paramagnetic interstitial CR molecules (). Informative estimates can be made by comparison of the Table 1 patients 8\/4 benign\/malignant lesion pair, with SSM K0.034 and 0.254 min, respectively. For one of the SSM (FXR-a) fittings of each, the (v,\u03c4,) parameters returned are similar: (0.60, 0.40 s), and (0.69, 0.39 s) for benign and malignant, respectively. Thus, the unidirectional rate constants for water cellular entry [k\u2248(v\u22121)\u03c4] are similar (1.7 and 1.2 s, respectively), constant, and not infinitely large. However, before the arrival of interstitial CR, the transcytolemmal water exchange appears infinitely fast in the NMR signal because Tis almost negligible. The interstitial water molecules encounter no paramagnetic CRmolecules before entering a diamagnetic cytoplasm. However, as CRincreases, the rate constant for interstitial water CR encounter, [(CR)\/(HO)]\u03c4, also increases [\u03c4=kin ]. While, for the benign lesion CRmaximizes at 0.52 mM (at \u02dc7.5 minutes), this is 1.6 mM (at \u02dc3.5 minutes) for the malignant tumor. Thus, [(CR)max\/(HO)]\u03c4values are 104 and 313 sfor the benign and malignant lesions, respectively. The interstitial water concentration (HO) was 50 M and the mean water lifetime on the CR, \u03c4, was 10s. At maximum CR, an interstitial water molecule in the benign lesion encounters a paramagnetic CR molecule on average 60 times (104\/1.7) before it enters a diamagnetic cell; sufficient, apparently, for the SM 40% vunderestimation. While in the malignant tumor, this happens 260 times (313\/1.2) on average; more than four times as often. This is sufficient to cause significant Kunderestimations if it is neglected.","For the expanded data set, a total of 74 patients underwent clinical breast MRI protocols and had 77 contrast-enhanced lesions (3 patients presented 2 lesions each) radiologically classified in the BIRADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) 4 (B-4, suspicious, n=67) or 5 (B-5, highly suggestive of malignancy, n=10) categories based on lesion morphology and qualitative enhancement kinetics assessment. These clinical interpretations led to biopsy referrals. The research DCE-MRI data acquisitions were IRB-approved. The data from 6 patients were collected as part of a combined MRI\/MRS protocol prior to excisional or core biopsy. Those from the other 68 patients (71 lesions) were acquired during clinically scheduled MRI-guided preoperative needle localization or core biopsy procedures, just before needle insertions.","The study was conducted at 1.5T using a body transmit and a four- or seven-channel phased-array bilateral breast receive RF coils. A 3D SPGR pulse sequence was used to acquire 12-20 serial sagittal image volume sets continually, spatially covering the whole breast with the suspicious lesion to be biopsied. Other parameters included 10\u00b0 or 30\u00b0 (for the 6 patients) flip angle, 2-5 ms TE, 6-9 ms TR, 3 mm section thickness, 20-24 cm FOV. Depending on the breast size, 16-36 image sections were acquired for each set, resulting in inter-sampling intervals of 13-42 seconds. At the start of the second volume set acquisition, Gd CR was delivered intravenously [0.1 mmol\/kg at 2 mL\/s]. ROIs circumscribing the enhanced lesion and within an axillary artery produced the tumor signal intensity and arterial input function (AIF) time-courses, respectively. Three reliable individual AIFs were measured, which were interpolated with an empirical expression (3) and averaged to generate a mean AIF. The tumor ROI and mean AIF signal time-courses were then subjected to both SM and (fast-exchange-regime-allowed) SSM analyses, which were blinded from the pathology. Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate pharmacokinetic parameter diagnostic accuracies, and the areas under the curve (AUCs) were compared using a Bootstrap nonparametric test.","Upon pathology, only 18 lesions (10 B-4 and 8 B-5) were found malignant and the other 59 (57 B-4 and 2 B-5) benign. Though the clinical MRI protocol sensitivity is 100% (no false negatives), its PPV is only 23%. The SSM KROC AUC (0.973) is significantly (p=0.032) greater than that for the SM K(0.929). Similar results were obtained for other strong biomarkers: k(=K\/v, the unidirectional CR intravasation rate constant) [SSM AUC=0.960, SM AUC=0.861, p=0.006] and [(K)+k[SSM AUC=0.970, SM AUC=0.887, p=0.009]. Maintaining 100% sensitivity, the diagnostic specificities of the SM ROI K, k, and [(K)+k]are 47%, 42%, and 51%, while those for the corresponding SSM parameters are 76%, 61%, and 75%, respectively; each biomarker used as a binary classifier. The SM and SSM vROC curve AUCs are 0.555 and 0.615, respectively, suggesting that vis a poor diagnostic marker.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 3","sup":["trans ","trans ","trans "]},"The SSM DCE-MRI ROI pharmacokinetic parameters consistently perform better than those from SM DCE-MRI and the commonly used clinical MRI protocols for benign and malignant discrimination within this group of 77 suspicious breast lesions. If the simple ROI delta Kanalyses had been integrated into clinical practice, as many as 52 benign lesions (68% of the total population) could have been spared the biopsy procedures. As expected from the earlier study, the malignant lesions cluster almost exclusively on the left of , while the benign lesions are almost all to the right\u2014the axes are independent. The solid cut-off line value, delta K=0.028 min, is very close to that for 100% specificity in the smaller population. It yields only one false positive (the sole tubular adenoma) and one false negative (the sole ILC) lesion. A more lenient, dashed cut-off line can be drawn at delta K=0.012 minto avoid any false negative and still incur only 14 benign biopsies. But, even these might be avoided. The likely reason for a malignant lesion ROI delta Kto fall between the solid and dashed cut-off lines is because of partial volume averaging in the ROI analyses. Consistent with this, the ILC had the very large value of 5 cm as the greatest enhanced ROI dimension. Its pixel-by-pixel SSM Kmap (not shown) features hot spots (K>0.18 min) only in the posterior rim region. Though these are diluted by a very large area of small Kvalues in the ROI, they confirm the lesion as malignant. This suggests that delta Kor SSM Kmaps (parametric heat maps) should be made when an ROI delta Kfalls between the solid and dashed lines.","Other analysis methods may be used to further distinguish the data, such as points falling between delta Kthresholds. For example, the median Kdifference, delta (median K)[SSM median K\u2212SM median K], may be plotted (ordinate) vs. the change in maximum histographic probability (amplitude) (abscissa), delta Amp [SSM amplitude\u2212SM amplitude]. Such an operation indicates a significant negative linear correlation (Pearson correlation=\u22120.82, p=0.0018) for the benign lesions, while the malignant lesions exhibit an almost orthogonal correlation. The ILC (identified for example in ) cannot be distinguished from the benign group with simple ROI delta Kanalyses. However, using quadratic discrimination analysis, the benign and malignant lesions can be completely separated (100% sensitivity and 100% specificity) by the solid partition curve with no misclassification.","Though the ROI delta Kbiomarker achieves high specificity for benign\/malignant breast lesion discrimination, the partial volume averaging effects of ROI analyses can cause overlap in ROI pharmacokinetic parameter values, and thus prevent clearer separation of the two groups. Pharmacokinetic parametric mapping and histogram analyses thus may further improve discrimination. Such analyses are especially important when the lesion ROI biomarker value falls in the vicinity of a binary classifier cut-off value. Thus, it is beneficial to acquire DCE-MRI data with sufficient SNR, since this ensures reliable pixel signal time-course curve fitting. The negative linear correlation of the benign lesions and the orthogonal behavior of the malignant lesions are quite interesting. Compared to malignant lesions that can have noticeable median Kincreases (shutter-speed (SS) histographic shifts) without significant histographic maximum probability changes (SS broadening), the areas in benign lesions where increased blood vessel CR permeability incurs SS effects, if any, are smaller. Considerable SS histographic broadening is associated with even minuscule SS histographic shifting.","Further details regarding the materials and methods used with respect to various embodiments described herein as well as details regarding some of the MRI data acquisitions and analyses may be found in Li, et al., Dynamic NMR Effects in Breast Cancer Dynamic-Contrast-Enhanced MRI, PNAS, Vol. 105, No. 46, 17937-17942 (2008) (and Supporting Online Material); Huang, et al., The MR Shutter-Speed Discriminates Vascular Properties of Malignant and Benign Breast Tumors In Vivo, PNAS, Vol. 105, No. 46, 17943-17948 (2008); Li, et al., Shutter-Speed Analysis of Contrast Reagent Bolus-Tracking Data: Preliminary Observations in Benign and Malignant Breast Disease, Magn.

Such modifications may, for example, decrease the random error scatter in the  point clusters. This may allow further discrimination of pathology sub-types.","The DCE-MRI time-course acquisitions discussed herein were prescribed for radiological considerations and were truncated. Increasing this period would likely improve accuracy and precision of the benign lesion parameters. For these ROIs, the maximum Rvalue is rarely reached in the no more than seven minutes usually allowed. This is the likely source of abnormally large vvalues for some benign tumors. Increasing the period to 15 minutes may help define the shape of the time-course, even for malignant tumors.","The DCE-MRI acquisitions for the data described herein were not particularly exchange sensitive. Even so, exchange effects seem to facilitate very high discrimination of malignant from benign breast tumors.","The tissue Rvalues (the pre-CR HO longitudinal relaxation rate constants) may be mapped, and not simply assumed as they were herein. Individual AIFs may be used as well. A reference tissue method, or an automated AIF determination (ex., Jim 4.0 software; Xinapse Systems; Thorpe Waterville, UK) may be used.","Increased temporal resolution may be achieved without sacrificing spatial resolution or signal-to-noise. Parallel RF excitation\/acquisition may be useful for achieving such increased temporal resolution. With good definition of the DCE time-course first-pass leading edge, the second generation SSM (BALDERO (Blood Agent Level Dependent and Extravasation Relaxation Overview)) analysis, which accounts for blood HO signal pharmacokinetic behavior, may be used to also determine vand kvalues. It is anticipated that tumor vvalues will have significant diagnostic value. Furthermore, vkis the transendothelial water permeability coefficient surface area product, PS\u2032, where S\u2032 is the total capillary bed surface area. The ratio PS\u2032\/PS\u2032 would be the intensive property P\/P. The value of the CR permeability coefficient surface area product (PS\u2032) may be factored from the Kparameter using the blood flow value, which may also be determined from DCE-MRI data.","The DCE-MRI pharmacokinetic images may also be spatially registered to correct for patient motion.","Image acquisition without \u2014HC\u2014 suppression may yield signal intensities much more amenable to precision parametric mapping. The maps require sufficient acquisition contrast-to-noise ratio because pixel-by-pixel analytical modeling is more susceptible to noise. However, care must be taken to avoid contamination of HO by unsuppressed \u2014HC\u2014.","In embodiments, the shutter-speed model may be enhanced by adding a factor for putative T* (transverse relaxation) signal quenching. In an embodiment, there is provided a direct application of a T* reduction factor to the interstitial water signal in the Ernstian MR steady-state DCE-MRI model expression. Assuming the greatest T* reduction will return Kand vvalues for the tumor region of interest about 35% and 15% greater, respectively, than one would find when ignoring this effect. For normal-appearing tissues, these are 11% and 17% greater, respectively. Thus, applying the factor further distinguishes normal tissue from the tumor ROI.  illustrates this relationship.","The SXR-a SSM includes T* neglect and therefore underestimates Kand vto the extent that there is a disproportionate relaxation of compartmental water signals. Embodiments herein provide a way of testing to see if the blood and interstitial water signals have been edited from the detected signal (that is, SXR-a is inappropriate).","DCE-MRI pharmacokinetic modeling usually ignores potential HO signal reduction due to transverse relaxation (T*) effects. Most clinical DCE-MRI applications employ a contrast reagent (CR) dose of 0.1 mmol\/kg which may produce a blood plasma CR concentration above 5.0 mM at its peak during the bolus passage. Here, using exemplary prostate DCE-MRI data, a potential T* effect on DCE-MRI model parameter values is described, by using a water exchange (\u201cshutter-speed\u201d) model along with a simplified factor to account for putative T* signal quenching.","Prostate HO MRI data were acquired with a Siemens TIM Trio (3T) system under an IRB approved protocol. RF transmitting was through the whole body coil and RF receiving was with a combination of Spine Matrix and flexible Body Matrix RF coils. The DCE-MRI sequence employed a 3D TurboFLASH sequence with a 256*144*16 matrix size and a 360*203 mmfield of view, resulting in an in-plane resolution of 1.4*1.4 mm. Other parameters are: slice thickness: 3 mm; TR\/TE\/FA: 5.42 ms\/1.56 ms\/15\u00b0, imaging intersampling interval: 4.16 seconds. Any T*-induced signal reduction is assumed to be proportional to [exp(\u2212(r*(CR)+R)\u00b7TE)], applying to the HO signal from the CR-occupied compartment. For the data here, the most influential CR-containing compartment is the prostate interstitium. Thus, r* and CR represent the interstitial CR transverse relaxivity and concentration, respectively. Since susceptibility effects cross compartmental boundaries, surely r* also has a contribution from capillary blood plasma CR. This T*-reduction factor is then directly applied to the interstitial HO signal in the Ernstian MR steady-state DCE-MRI model expression. Parameter uncertainties were determined with sets of Monte Carlo simulations carried out for each ROI-averaged HO signal with increasing T* quenching accounted for by choosing an increasing r* value (mMs): 0 (no quenching), 5 (a literature value), 20 (an estimated blood plasma value at 3T), or 40. For each r* and each ROI data set, 200 simulation runs were performed with Gaussian noise (\u03bc=0, \u03c3=0.08) directly added to the normalized ROI data time-course. This resulted in a simulated time-course with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) slightly better than that from a single pixel. Random initial guess values were evenly distributed within the parameter space for each simulation fitting.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"i":["a ","a ","b.

This is not because vis actually zero, but only because it is indeterminate due to the very CR-permeable capillary wall. The blood HO signal makes a contribution indistinguishable from that of the EES. Thus, it may be better to use an only two-site model. For consistency, the same two-site model is also used for the normal appearing tissue ROI. The current analysis is conservative in estimating EES signal T*-quenching effects. Interestingly, however, the extracted parameters move exactly in the direction seen comparing analyses with the fast-exchange-regime (FXR)-allowed two-site shutter-speed model with the slow-exchange-regime (SXR)-allowed version. The former neglects a distinguishable interstitial HO signal contribution, which is reduced by exchange and may also be at least partially T*-quenched. For a tumor blood volume estimation using DCE-MRI with extravasating CR, it is prudent to use a lower CR dose.","Any one or more of various embodiments previously discussed may be incorporated, in part or in whole, into a computing device or a system.
