The OTC market generally comprises securities firms and banks that trade fixed income securities either by phone or electronically. Some firms and banks act as dealers who keep an inventory, and buy and sell securities for their own account. Others act as brokers and buy from or sell to other dealers in response to specific requests for liquidity on behalf of their customers. As such, the current fixed income security model consists of manual, person-to-person exchanges in two different markets. The first market is the dealer to dealer market. The second market is the dealer to customer market. The first market generally trades with higher transparency than the second market, and with tighter bid offer spreads. The second market generally trades with lower transparency and wider bid-offer spreads.","This specification describes technologies relating to a fixed income market model, including systems that can be used to implement the model.","In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of: receiving an indication from a computer-based interface device that an initiating party seeks a counterparty for a financial transaction involving the transfer of the fixed income security, accessing data in an electronic database relating to a plurality of potential counterparties for the financial transaction and assigning to one or more of the plurality of potential counterparties an indication as to the likelihood that the potential counterparty will engage in the financial transaction. The indication of likelihood that the potential counterparty will engage in the financial transaction is based on the data in the electronic database.","Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.","In some implementations, the method includes ranking the potential counterparties based on the indication of likelihood assigned to each respective one of the potential counterparties. Moreover, some implementations include enabling the initiating party to view at a computer-based interface device one or both of: the assigned indications of likelihood that the respective potential counterparties will engage in the financial transaction; and the rankings of each potential counterparty based in the assigned indications of likelihood.","According to certain embodiments, the method includes enabling the initiating party to enter a request at the computer-based interface device that a Request For Quote (RFQ) be sent to a specified one or more potential counterparties identified by the initiating party to enter into the financial transaction. Still other embodiments include sending an inquiry over a computer network as to actual interest in participating in the financial transaction to: each of the specified one or more of potential counterparties, if any, and one or more of the potential counterparties with the highest assigned indication of likelihood that the potential counterparty will engage in the financial transaction. Sending the inquiries may be accomplished in a manner that does not reveal the identity of the initiating party.","In some implementations, the method includes receiving one or more responses to the inquiries sent from one or more of the potential counterparties; and enabling the initiating party to access information about the one or more responses at the computer-based interface.","In some of such implementations, enabling the initiating party to access the information is accomplished without revealing the identities of the responding potential counterparties.","In a typical implementation, multiple responses are received and the computer-based method includes combining two or more of the responses to create a single offer that satisfies requirements associated with completing the financial transaction based on information provided by the initiating party. The method can further include enabling the initiating party to view information about the single offer at the computer-based interface device. Moreover, the method can include enabling the potential counterparties, in responding to the inquiries, to specify an expiration time for an offer contained in their response.","At least one of the responses combined to create the single offer may have a specified expiration time and the information about the single offer changes upon expiration of the specified expiration time.","In some

involved in past bids for different fixed income securities with the same yield percentage as the fixed income security.","Determining to what degree the potential counterparty was involved in completed transactions related to the fixed income security can include: determining, based on the data in the electronic database, one or more of the following: to what degree the potential counterparty has completed transactions including the fixed income security, to what degree the potential counterparty has completed transactions including different fixed income securities with the

counterparties to create respective virtual profiles, each of which can include an expression of interest in one or more characteristics associated with fixed income securities. Assigning to each respective one of the plurality of potential counterparties the indication of likelihood that the potential counterparty will engage in the financial transaction further includes determining to what degree a virtual profile associated with one of the potential counterparties includes an expression of interest related to the fixed income security.","The matching engine, in assigning to each respective one of the plurality of potential counterparties an indication of likelihood that the potential counterparty will engage in the financial transaction, can be configured to determine one or more of the following: to what degree the virtual profile associated with the potential counterparty includes expressions of interest in the fixed income security, to what degree the virtual profile associated with the potential counterparty includes expressions of interest in different fixed income securities with the same issuer as the fixed income security, to what degree the virtual profile associated with the potential counterparty includes expressions of interest in different fixed income securities in the same industry as the fixed income security, to what degree the virtual profile associated with the potential counterparty includes expressions of interest in different fixed income securities in the same maturity bracket as the fixed income security, to what degree the virtual profile associated with the potential counterparty includes expressions of interest in different fixed income securities with the same rating as the fixed income security, and to what degree the virtual profile associated with the potential counterparty includes expressions of interest in different fixed income securities with the same yield percentage as the fixed income security.","The sales engine, in some embodiments, is further adapted to: automatically inquire, via the computer network, to what degree a selected one of the potential counterparties wants to conduct the financial transaction in response to a determination, based on the data in the electronic database, that the selected potential counterparty is or was involved in a bid for the fixed income security or completed a transaction for the fixed income security.","According to certain embodiments, the one or more computers are further configured to enable the initiating party and the potential counterparties to post and view orders at an electronic order book that is accessible from computer terminals coupled to the computer network.","In some implementations, the one or more user devices include one or more of the following: a computing device running a web browser, a spreadsheet add-in, an order management system, an application programming interface, a financial information exchange program or the like.","In yet another aspect, a computer-based method is disclosed for processing offers received from potential counterparties to engage in a proposed financial transaction involving a transfer of a fixed income security.

Additionally, the participants are able to access a larger pool of liquidity than was previously possible. Moreover, interactions between initiating parties and potential counterparties are greatly facilitated.","The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.","The following is a disclosure of a fixed income market model, as well as various methods and systems for implementing such a model.","Overview and Fundamentals","An overview of the art is provided to assist the reader's appreciation of the context of this specification, as well as some of the problems that can be solved by certain implementations of systems and methods described herein.","As mentioned, the current fixed income security model consists of manual, person-to-person exchanges in two different markets. The first market is the dealer to dealer market. Institutional investors rely on the dealer to dealer market to (1) find or provide liquidity for securities, (2) locate the best price on those securities, and (3) match buyers and sellers to execute desired trades. When looking to transact in fixed income securities in the dealer to dealer market, investors must give an indication of their intention to trade (sometimes referred to as \u201cindications of interest\u201d or simply \u201cIOIs\u201d). This indication can be given in many forms, e.g., emails, phone calls, bid lists, and axe sheets. In theory, these sources combine to create a small measure of market data on what are generally regarded to be relatively illiquid securities. As a result of the incompleteness of this market data, by some estimates, 97% of the corporate bond market is \u201cdark\u201d\u2014in general, there are no real-time prices available during the day.","Within the bond market generally, there are two ways to find liquidity: inventory based or inquiry based. Inventory based discovery is based on IOIs distributed by dealers (e.g., phone calls, emails, axe sheets, dealer runs, etc.). These IOI's indicate liquidity, but they are generally not executable, and since they are not updated over the course of the day, they are not up to date.","On the other hand, inquiry based discovery is based on market participants who want to trade specific securities. The party that wants to trade generally uses a broker to find a trading partner. It is difficult for brokers to initiate trades, especially large trades, without having the market move against them due to the amount of liquidity they are placing on the market (e.g., pricing moving down with a large sell or prices moving up with a large buy). Additionally, a lack of transparency in the market makes it difficult for customers of brokers to assess the quality of execution of trades.","Market participants can only trade in the market if they know where to search for liquidity. For that reason, customers (e.g., investors and their brokers) tend to trade with dealers, who hold proprietary information about where to locate liquidity. Due to this information disparity, dealers are able to trade with other dealers in a fairly transparent marketplace, while customers do not have access to that marketplace. To trade, the customer must give up large amounts of information to the dealer, which perpetuates the existing information disparity. This leads to the two tiered marketplace already described.","To trade large volumes, market participants (in this case, either customers or dealers) must expose their order either entirely to one dealer, or to the market through multiple dealers. Information leakage is a significant issue in these situations, and the use of multiple dealers causes significant increases in execution costs. Further, fragmentation of the marketplace leads to significant increases in custodial fees. Although involving more than one counterparty is often necessary to insure best execution (i.e., executing portions of an order against multiple, smaller, better priced counterparts as opposed to executing a whole order against a single, larger, worse priced counterpart), that amplifies the effects of fragmentation in the market. This creates significant enough friction in the market that some entities have started providing services such as \u201csingle ticket clearing\u201d to aggregate custodial fees.","The transparency in the first market (dealer to dealer) has benefitted dealers, granting them an \u201cinformation arbitrage\u201d over their customers who must participate in the second market (dealer to customer). Part of this is due simply to the fact that institutional customers do not have access to the existing dealer to dealer market. In reality, however, giving customers access to the dealer to dealer market would present customers with a different, more fundamental set of problems that plague the fixed income market. Such problems include a lack of real-time market data and a lack of systems for (1) aggregating and presenting that real-time market data, (2) finding liquidity without having to expose orders to the entire market, and (3) initiating and responding to trades.","By way of illustration,  shows an example of a two tier marketplace. In the illustrated marketplace, the first market  is a marketplace in which primary dealers  compete. The primary dealers  have access to several Inter-Dealer Broker systems (IDB) . The primary dealers  trade with each other using the IDB systems  in the first market . The IDB systems  include automated systems for posting and viewing available liquidity in the fixed income security marketplace, but are generally only available to dealers. The data contained in the IDB systems  thus provide a limited view of the state of the fixed income security market.","The first market  carries large amounts of information, with a fairly open flow of information between the primary dealers . This leads to a first market  that is generally more transparent and has lower bid\u2014ask spreads than the second market .","The second market , on the other hand, includes traditional buy side clients  trading with the primary dealers . To trade, the traditional buy side clients  generally give substantial amounts of information  to the primary dealers  so that the primary dealers  can generate quotes. Because of the information disparity that this creates, the second market  generally trades with much lower transparency and much larger bid\u2014ask spreads than the first market .","Regional dealers  occasionally exist between traditional buy side clients  and primary dealers . Although the regional dealers  may trade with each other, they generally do not have access to IDBs , and therefore cannot access the majority of information and efficiencies produced in the first market . Regional dealers  often use primary dealers  in order to access liquidity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["105","105","101","101","103","102","105","105","105","105","103","103"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","b","a ","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1A"],"b":["110","105","112","112","112","112","112","112"],"i":["a","b","c","a","b","c "]},"According to the illustrated implementation, each order segment , , is sent to a separate one of the primary dealers , , and . Each primary dealer , , exposes details of its own order segment , , to the marketplace (including, for example, multiple buy side clients ).","In the illustrated embodiment, each primary dealer , , separately settles multiple sub accounts  to satisfy its own order segment , , and . More particularly, in the illustrated implementation, each primary dealer , , separately settles three sub accounts  to satisfy its own order segment. This leads to nine settlements between the three different primary dealers , each of which typically requires separate processing and payment of associated fees.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIG. 1D","FIG. 1A"],"b":["105","110","103"],"i":"a. "},"In the illustrated scenario, the primary dealer routes the order to multiple sub accounts . More particularly, the primary dealer in the illustrated scenario routes the order to three different sub accounts . Using a single dealer for a large purchase typically results in the purchaser receiving a weak price due, at least in part to interacting with a single primary dealer, and the information disadvantage inherent in giving that single primary dealer all of the relevant information about the desired exchange. Additional fees are also incurred by having to pay for processing and associated fees in connection with the separate settlement of the different sub accounts .","The Single Tier Fixed Income Market Model","An implementation of a single tier fixed income market model employs a trading system platform that comprises an \u201call-to-all\u201d protocol, replacing the previous customer to dealer and dealer to dealer marketplaces. This market model provides for direct trading of fixed income securities between institutional investors, brokers, and others.

Typically, this functionality relates to traditionally illiquid securities, such as bonds. Additionally, the system platform  typically can be used by market participants  to investigate multiple bids or offers on one or more bonds. The market participants  also typically can send RFQ's to one or more designated parties or can use other modules described herein to seek out and interact with likely counterparties. Market participants  can choose to either remain anonymous or expose themselves and\/or their preferences to one or more of the potential counterparties.","In some implementations, the order book functionality  enables market participants to access various trading opportunities posted by other market participants. This information can be presented in a variety of ways and may be searchable, sortable, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["228","228","220"],"i":["a ","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 2C","b":["220","230","230","230"],"i":["a","b","c. "]},"According to the illustrated implementation, the initiating party submits a full order , which includes all of the fixed income securities that the initiating party wants to transfer, to the platform  by accessing the platform's RFQ functionality. The full order  is processed by a sales engine and matching engine , which are part of the platform , to identify potential counterparties , , that the matching engine determines to be most likely to engage in the financial transaction. The sales engine then contacts the potential counterparties , , identified by the matching engine. The counterparties , , return their respective offers , , and ","In the illustrated example, none of the offers , , is capable on its own of fully satisfying the requirements (e.g., to supply enough volume) associated with the full order . However, the offers , , can be combined to satisfy the requirements associated with the full order . The offers , , are then processed by a price aggregation engine , which is part of platform , to combine them and generate the best possible single price for the initiating party at which the full order  can be satisfied.","In the illustrated example, the aggregation engine completes the order, reports it on a single ticket, and reports  the order to three separate subaccounts at the same price. When a transaction is completed, it often needs to be distributed to multiple accounts. For example, a fund manager often handles multiple mutual funds. When the manager completes a trade and distributes, the system can distribute it all at the one aggregated price instead of the fund manager having to handle multiple transactions, asset allocations, and fees. Note that from the perspective of the initiating party, all trades are completed at the aggregated price. The results are therefore calculated, processed, and distributed at that price. However, from the perspective of the parties responding to RFQs, the trades are at the prices they proposed. Typically, this is possible due to the system, as a riskless principal, existing in between the parties.","Overview of an Example System for Implementing a Fixed Income Market Model","To implement a single tier fixed income security market (e.g., as described in ), a platform  (e.g., a network of computer devices) can facilitate communications and interactions between various market participants .  is a schematic representation of an exemplary system  that includes an implementation of such a platform . In general, the illustrated platform  is configured to implement both RFQ functionality  and order book functionality .","In most implementations, the platform is administrated by a business entity. In the implementation shown in , the portions of the system within box  would be operated by the administrator of the business entity. Of course, this does not mean that the portions operated by the administrator must be located in the same physical location or that an administrator could not use a third party to assist in administering the platform . Elements within box  generally constitute a sales engine , a matching engine , a price aggregation engine  and an electronic database .","The market participants  can interact with the platform  in a variety of ways. For example, the platform  can be accessed directly through the internet or a spreadsheet add-in, or through the users' order management systems (OMS) alongside an execution management system (EMS) . Users can communicate with the EMS  using several systems, including proprietary management systems and custom Application Programming Interfaces (API). Additionally, the EMS  can communicate with the platform  using industry standard messaging, such as Financial Information Exchange (FIX). Generally, each of the market participants interacts with the platform from a remote location; accordingly, communication between market participants and the platform  is usually accomplished using known communication means, such as wired and\/or wireless networking.","The illustrated platform  includes a sales engine , a matching engine  and a price aggregation engine , which can be implemented, for example, with hardware, software or a combination thereof. The illustrated platform  also includes an electronic database , which can store various information discussed herein and various other information to facilitate the platform's functionality. The platform  has several data libraries, which may be stored in the electronic database or may be stored electronically elsewhere. These include data libraries for customer trade history , customer alerts , customer supplied data , system transaction data  and customer listed securities . In various implementations, the platform  includes other data libraries and\/or organizes data into different data libraries. As discussed herein, the platform  is generally operable to leverage the data stored in these data libraries and\/or in the data stored in the electronic database  to support the functionality disclosed herein.","The platform  is coupled for communications with post-trade and clearing systems . In a typical implementation, after the platform generates or matches a trade, the trade is passed to these systems to provide services associated with post-trade operations and clearing.","The platform  is also coupled for communications with a pricing source . In some implementations, the pricing source  provides pricing estimates to the platform  to help facilitate the functionalities discussed herein.","The platform is also coupled for communications with other parties , which may include, for example, data recipients\/distributors  and regulators . In a typical implementation, the data recipients\/distributors may include various parties that pay to access data associated with the financial transactions facilitated by the platform . In a typical implementation, the platform stores transactional and associated statistical data about the transactions facilitated by the platform . This and other information may be reported out to the other parties and\/or used by the system itself to help identify preferences, for example, of various market participants .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"220"},"According to the illustrated method, the market participant accesses (at ) the platform, including its associated functionality. As discussed above, this can be done in a number of ways. Typically, access is gained from a computer device (i.e., a user terminal) located at the market participant's physical location.","The platform  then enables the market participant (at ) to choose between accessing either the platform's order book functionality or request for quotation (\u201cRFQ\u201d) functionality. This can be accomplished, for example, by presenting a prompt to the market participant to select one of the functionalities or the other.","If the market participant (at ) chooses to access the platform's order book functionality, then the platform  (at ) enables the market participant to access the order book functionality. In a typical implementation, the platform  does this by presenting at the market participant's user interface the information associated with the order book functionality. For example, in response to the market participant selecting a hyperlink associated with the order book functionality, the platform  may cause one or more webpages to become available for viewing at the market participant's user interface. The one or more webpages, in that example, may include a list (or lists) of fixed income securities that other market participants have listed within the order book as being available for purchase or sale.","The list (or lists) of fixed income securities available for purchase can be organized and presented to the market participant in a number of formats. In a typical implementation, the market participant may browse and\/or search the list (or lists) as desired and follow-up accordingly if the market participant has an interest in purchasing a particular one of the listed fixed income securities.","If the market participant chooses (at ) to access the platform's RFQ functionality, then the platform  enables (at ) the market participant to access the platform's RFQ functionality. In a typical implementation, the platform  does this by presenting at the market participant's user interface information associated with the RFQ functionality. For example, in response to the market participant selecting a hyperlink associated with the RFQ functionality, the platform  may cause one or more webpages associated with the RFQ functionality to become available for viewing at the market participant's user interface.","In the illustrated implementation, the platform  (at ) enables the market participant to indicate whether\/to what degree there are any potential counterparties that the market participant is aware of that may be interested in participating in the financial transaction that the market participant is proposing.","If the market participant (i.e., the initiating party) indicates (at ) that there is one or more potential counterparties that the market participant is aware of that may be interested in participating in the financial transaction, then the platform  (at ) enables the market participant to identify those parties to the platform . This may be accomplished, for example, by presenting, at the user interface, a form that the market participant can fill in with identifying data and other data about the one or more potential counterparties.","In the example represented by the illustrated implementation, the market participant identifies three potential counterparties that the market participant is aware of that may be interested in participating in the financial transaction. In a typical implementation and, as shown, the platform , when prompted, sends a Request For Quote (RFQ) (at , , ) to each one of the three identified potential counterparties.

In general, the confidence scores are intended to reflect how likely each of the respective potential counterparties is to enter into the proposed financial transaction. In a typical implementation, the matching engine calculates the confidence scores by considering a number of different characteristics associated with each one of the potential counterparties and increasing or decreasing a numeric tally for that potential counterparty depending on the specifics of each characteristic considered.","In some implementations, the matching engine  ranks the potential counterparties according to the assigned confidence scores. Information related to the identified counterparties, the assigned confidence scores and\/or the top (i.e., most likely to participate) potential counterparties, is returned to the sales engine .","In the illustrated implementation, the sales engine  sends an RFQ (at , , ) to the top three potential counterparties most likely to participate (at , , ).

Factors that can affect the assigned point values can include, for example, trade history of the potential counterparty, any current bids or offers listed by the potential counterparty for the security at issue, positions the potential counterparty holds in the security at issue, any better buyer\/seller signals, and any signal positions in correlated securities. The matching algorithm  uses these (and potentially other) factors to calculate point values to be assigned to each potential counterparties.","In order to select the appropriate number of potential counterparties to contact, the algorithm  returns a database of point values . The platform then generates a tally (at ) of the sum of all point values assigned by the matching algorithm . Some percentage of the total points assigned is then calculated (at ) to be used as a count. This count is then applied to a list of all potential counterparties ordered (at ) from most to fewest points. Starting from the first potential counterparty, the system subtracts (at ) the points assigned to that counterparty from the overall count. The system continues down the list of potential counterparties, subtracting the assigned values for each party from the count until the count is exhausted (at ). The system then generates the list of potential counterparties based on the counterparties that fell within the count and returns the selected counterparties and corresponding confidence scores (at ).","Therefore, if very few of the potential counterparties have a majority of the points, the matching engine will return few potential counterparties. If, however, point scores are generally low and even, the matching engine will return more counterparties, which tends to compensate for a relative lack of available liquidity in the relevant market.","After calculating confidence scores (or point values) for each potential counterparty, the matching engine ranks all potential counterparties in order of decreasing scores, and returns the list of potential counterparties with corresponding confidence scores and the number of parties to contact at .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0124","num":"0123"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A-6F"},"More particularly, the illustrated method includes consideration of the potential counterparty's current bids\/offers (), the potential counterparty's quoting history (), the potential counterparty's transaction history (), the potential counterparty's signaling (), the potential counterparty's portfolio holdings () and information in the potential counterparty's virtual user's profile (). In some implementations, one or more of these considerations may be omitted. Similarly, in some implementations, other considerations may be added (e.g., the time decay and\/or wrong side multipliers).","In general, according to the illustrated implementation, the more confidence points that are assigned to a particular one of the potential counterparties, the more likely that particular one of the potential counterparties will be to complete the proposed financial transaction and, therefore, the more worthwhile that particular one of the potential counterparties will be to contact.
