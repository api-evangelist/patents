title: System and method for interactive electronic media extraction for web page generation
abstract: A system and method for parsing an electronic media database structure to produce tagged data that preserves the content, links, and electronic media structure. In particular, HyperText Markup Language (HTML) data is generated as an Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) (home page) linked into a relative structure of Web pages to support IETM deployment. An extraction process assesses the functionality associated with each node designated for presentation and builds a virtual Web, based on attributes stored in the IETM database. A series of Web pages with links that hierarchically presents IETM data at run time is produced. The method supports a data warehousing strategy that converts any data type eligible within the relational database. This expands support across multiple types of technical and engineering data. The preferred implementation utilizes a relative addressed pure HTML solution viewable in standard Web browsers. This open system implementation is cross platform and infrastructure independent, requiring no special server software. Retaining the hierarchical structure dictated by the relational database in HTML output enhances the supportability and maintainability of the Web implementation. Updates to this Web implementation can be incrementally applied within the hierarchy (small sections of data) or the entire logical sections of Web data.

No. 60\/139,129 entitled \u201cIETM HTML Extract Application\u201d filed Jun. 14, 1999 and Ser. No. 60\/158,129 entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Interactive Electronic Media Extraction for Web Page Generation\u201d filed Oct. 8, 1999 the entire subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to display of Interactive Electronic Media and, more particularly, to a method for parsing a database structure to produce tagged data that preserves the content, links, and structure of the original electronic media description.","2. Background Description","An initiative was started in the 1970's in the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to create a paperless ship environment for technical manuals. Originally the documents were raster scanned paper documents. In 1992, three Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) standards were approved by the DoD. Currently, the U.S. DoD specification, MIL-PRF-87269, \u201cData Base, Revisable: Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals, For the Support Of\u201d is currently the only available published standard for developing IETMs.","Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs) are designed to enable a technician to walk through maintenance procedures in a logical sequence and through fault isolation techniques. An Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) can be one of the many by-products of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)\/eXtensible Markup Language (XML) content tagged data. The use of databases and legacy data for system maintenance\/repair combined with SGML\/XML tagged content can result in an IETM.","There are a number of varieties of IETMs in existence today. Each variation stores a description of the technical manual in a database structure. Some systems may use primitive flat file directory structure and some use more sophisticated relational databases. The stored data is in accordance with the DoD standard, but each system typically uses custom software to retrieve the data and create an interactive session of the manual or document. A technician views the manual on a terminal connected, either directly or via a network, to a host computer on which the database resides. As the technician makes interactive choices regarding which pages or procedures to view, additional data is retrieved from the database in order to format the requested pages.","It has been determined that relational database IETMs enhance data maintainability, thus reducing management costs, and is the best solution for large-scale IETM applications. These applications use tools applicable to Database Management Systems (DBMS), most of which have proprietary data-replication facilities, typically utilize network protocols and procedures different from those used by the World Wide Web, and as such, are not compliant with an interoperable architecture. In particular, Class 4 IETM applications require the services of a separate DBMS as well as the presentation method that is encapsulated in the IETM.","A class 4 IETM represents the group of hierarchically structured IETMs. Class 4 IETMs represent the primary desired IETM class for new acquisition programs currently being procured by the U.S. Navy. Class 4 is a complete departure from previous classes whose data is structured to support a classical publishing environment based on sentence, paragraph, chapters, pages, etc. Class 4 data is created and managed as hierarchical objects within a database. Class 4 IETMs are not bound by a predetermined sequence of presentation, and by building a hierarchical database structure provides the logic and the linkage among and between data that is inherently integral to hierarchical databases. Data is created once with no duplication. Links are provided between the IETM elements controlling navigation and allowing the user a customized view of data.","There are several known problems or disadvantages of viewing IETMs according the state of the art methods. For instance, IETM application developers utilize proprietary viewers for their IETM data. The Web solution for their IETMs require the services of a separate database management system (DBMS), as well as presentation methods that encapsulate the IETM presentation. These methods utilize specialized server and client software, creating additional infrastructure burdens, and resulting in cost and maintenance impacts associated with the products development. Thus, there is a need to enhance cross platform support and technical data interoperability. Class 4 IETMs are difficult to manage in a Web environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","104","108","109","110","104"]},"The aforementioned problems with presenting an IETM in a standalone environment and other problems with the prior art as described in the detailed description, below, are addressed by the present invention and will be understood by reading and studying the following specification. A method for parsing an electronic media database structure to produce tagged data is described which preserves the content, links, and electronic media structure such that the tagged data can be viewed using standard web browsers on a stand alone system. This method also provides an electronic media database structure that allows a user to view the electronic media using traditional IETM presentation methods.","Another advantage of the present invention is that it provides a method for efficiently updating the stand alone versions of electronic media when the database is modified to reflect changes in the electronic media, or technical manuals.","In particular, an illustrative embodiment of the present invention produces HTML data as an IETM (home page) linked into a relative structure of Web pages to support IETM deployment. The extraction process assesses the functionality associated with each node designated for presentation and builds a virtual Web, based on attributes stored in the IETM database. A series of Web pages with links that hierarchically presents IETM data at run time is produced. The preferred embodiment supports a data warehousing strategy that converts any data type eligible within the relational database. The data warehousing strategy implementation stores data in a non-application specific environment and allows any data currently stored in the database to be included in the presentation to the user regardless of the origin of the data. This format free approach to data storage enhances the lifecycle of the data. This expands support across multiple types of technical and engineering data.","The preferred embodiment of a Web IETM implementation utilizes a relative addressed pure HTML solution viewable with a standard Web browser. This open system implementation is cross platform and infrastructure independent, requiring no special server software. Retaining the hierarchical structure dictated by the relational database in HTML output enhances the supportability and maintainability of the Web IETM implementation. Updates to this Web IETM implementation can be incrementally applied within the hierarchy (small sections of data) or the entire logical sections of Web data and sent to the user using many convenient methods, including via e-mail.","According the preferred embodiment, an IETM database is parsed to identify whether a data object is of type menu, narrative, graphic, table, or procedure. If the data object is a menu type, a starting menu is created. The data object information is selected from the Database. An HTML file representing the data object is created. Any links found within the data object information are stored for later processing. The saved links are then processed. Procedure objects are recursively parsed to account for exited-to procedures and yes\/no decision branches in the procedure.","In the following detailed description of the illustrative embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific illustrative embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical, mechanical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.","Referring again to the drawings, and more particularly to , there is shown an overview of the preferred embodiment of the present invention. The method utilizes a database enabled authoring and presentation system for development and display of technical documentation. These applications are Windows\u2122 based and present Menus, Graphics, Text, Table and Procedure data to support user needs in operation and maintenance for the deliverable systems. (Windows is a trademark of Microsoft Corp.)","In order to produce a Web presentation  for IETM solutions operating in a Web architecture, an HTML Filter (Extract Application)  creates a pure HTML-based presentation  from the IETM database . IETM authoring activities  are able to continue as normal, retaining advantages of the DBMS  for development, but IETM deliveries are extracted  to create a Web browser-viewable presentation .","The presentation  consists of an IETM \u201cHome Page\u201d  that references a structure of Web pages that support IETM deployment. The Web page structure uses \u201crelative address\u201d structure, meaning that the entire Web can be relocated to any machine, in any directory, and the hyperlinks, or uniform resource locators (URLs) still operate as desired. The Extract or filtering process  assesses the functionality and data type associated with each IETM data Node designated for presentation, and builds a virtual Web, based on the attributes and data stored in the relational database . This results in a series of Web pages 204 and 206 with links that hierarchically present the information at run time. This implementation estranges, or separates, the IETM presentation system from the DBMS and produces an infrastructure independent deployment model. Utilizing pure HTML (standard Web pages) is an advantage because it produces a thin server\/client IETM deployment that is cross platform compatible.","The Extract process reads IETM data stored in an IETM relational database and generates a relative addressed Web comprising HTML pages hyper-linked together to preserve the structure of the IETM. The Extract application of the preferred embodiment processes five (5) different types of IETM objects: menus, text, tables, graphics and procedures.","Referring now to , a flow diagram of the Extract process  of  is shown. The Extract process connects to the DBMS utilizing operator-defined protocols and controls identified in an initialization file, Extract.ini, resident with the application. An example Extract.ini is shown below, with comments in brackets \u201c{ }\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["[Database]",{}]},{"entry":["DBMS=MSS (Msoft) SQL Server 6.0","{identifies the database"]},{"entry":[{},"management system where the"]},{"entry":[{},"IETM database resides}"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Database=ARCI","{registered name of the database with which to"]},{"entry":[{},"connect}"]},{"entry":["UserId=","{user login (secure data source only)}"]},{"entry":["DatabasePassword=","\u201c\u2009\u201d"]},{"entry":"LogPassword="},{"entry":["ServerName=medialab","{domain name of the server where database"]},{"entry":[{},"resides (remote database only)}"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["LogId=sa","{database user ID}"]},{"entry":"Lock="}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["DbParm=Connectstring=\u2018DSN=Sqlserlmfsauth\u2019","{Connect string based"]},{"entry":[{},"on data server name as"]},{"entry":[{},"registered in the"]},{"entry":[{},"environment}"]},{"entry":"Prompt=0"},{"entry":"DblniFile=\u201clmfsauth.ini\u201d"},{"entry":"[Path]"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["PathDir=g:\\extract","{location to output html data}"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["GraphicsPath=GRAPHICS\\","{when deployed, relative address of images."]},{"entry":[{},"when processing HTML file that contains an"]},{"entry":[{},"image, this information is appended to the"]},{"entry":[{},"image name to provide accurate relative"]},{"entry":[{},"path}"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["[basePaths]","{Collection of applications and items that are eligible for"]},{"entry":[{},"Launching from the IETM content.

This menu provides navigation through various levels of the hierarchy. The user highlights a section of the IETM menu to define the point in the menu structure to initiate the extract process in function block . Using pull-down menus, the user selects the process to initiate, for instance as shown in , HTML is the selected (highlighted) process.","Once the Extract process is initiated, the user makes selections for controls to define the scope associated with the extraction to HTML process in function block . These controls are presented in easy to understand dialogue boxes as shown in . These controls allow the user to make decisions associated with how the HTML will be generated. Based on user selections, a defined menu structure may be designated, or previously generated HTML files may be skipped.","If the user chooses to generate link files in dialog box , all links (or data resources) required for this page or menu will be extracted. The hierarchy is extracted to a logical end. If the user chooses not to generate link files in dialog box , then only the top level menus are generated. This is efficient if the document has been previously generated in incremental pieces. If the user chooses to replace existing files in dialog box , then all previously created HTML files are assumed to have changed and will be regenerated and old files are overwritten. Otherwise, the old files are not overwritten as new files are generated. The user may also choose to generate a text file containing a list of all graphics and photo files which are referenced in the database for easy conversion later.","To enhance cross platform compatibility of the extracted Web IETM, the user is provided a dialog selection that enables the selection of a graphics format to be deployed , as shown in . This selection ensures that graphic filenames referenced in the HTML files will be consistent with the deployed graphics images. Regardless of the graphics file extension referenced in the IETM database, this selection substitutes the selected graphics extension during the HTML Extract process. This process also \u201cnormalizes\u201d the extension case, adding cross platform functionality.","The graphics in the IETM database could be in any number of formats. The graphics files need to be converted to the selected deployed format . In the preferred embodiment, once the user selects the scope of the Extract process, a file may be optionally created that lists every graphic referenced within this hierarchy. This list is used to ensure that only the graphics files actually used are converted. This conversion may be done manually using any number of conversion tools known to one skilled in the art, or it could be implemented as an automatic procedure that reads from the previously generated graphics file list. Because COTS graphics formats are prone to change without notice, the preferred embodiment uses the manual method of conversion to avoid unforseen compatibility problems.","Although the preferred embodiment of the invention allows interactive selections by a user, it would be apparent to one skilled in the art how to modify the procedure to allow predefined or default controls.","While the HTML Extract process is running, the user is presented with a real-time updating dialog that indicates the progress of the automatic procedure , as shown in . All files created are listed, to indicate how far along the process is. This report identifies any errors associated with the Extract process. These errors include data inconsistencies, code errors, and resource descriptions. An Extract Report can be saved to a text file or printed for future evaluation.","The nature and structure of information in an IETM database requires some definition of terms to describe data within the database environment and the specific use of the Extract process. The hierarchical associations defined in the IETM database are defined in Levels.  presents the terms and implied associations to be referenced throughout the following description.","Referring now to , the IETM database structure organizes nodes in a hierarchical structure that supports authoring and presentation of data. A defined system level node  defines the parent or top hierarchical level of the relational database. Data classes  are compartments, or database storage bins defined under a system. Each data class has an associated \u201cedit type\u201d defining the type of data stored in the database. Valid data types are\n\n","Nodes  are the actual database data elements stored in the database. The IETM authors import or edit the data under various data classes. Nodes are stored as plain text in a format free environment. The nodes are parented to a data class retaining the hierarchy of the data.","Referring again to , when extracting the data from DBMS control to HTML in function block , it is important to retain as much of the database structure as possible to enhance data reusability. This is accomplished by implementing a Web structure that closely mimics the database while conforming to HTML relative addressing rules.  illustrates the general flow of the Extract process.","Recalling that a menu structure was selected in  of , the process then extracts a node or data class selected from the menu in block . The links in the selected menu structure are identified in block . When the links are identified in block , as described further below, four pieces of information are saved in array: the system id, class id, node id and name of the IETM object. These four pieces of information are saved in the array only if they are not contained in the array currently. After the identification process terminates, the array of saved links is processed in block .","In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the identification process is called for each saved link, to create the HTML file for the saved system id, class id, and node id. The HTML files generated in block  contain links to other HTML pages via the use of anchor tags. The file, to which the anchor refers, is not created until the link is processed in block , calling the process of block  for processing. The files created in block  are complete and are not modified by the processing in block . Postponing the processing of the links is done to free up resources and speed the performance of the extraction. One should note that during the processing of the links in block , the process of block  is executed and more saved links could be added to the array. Once all of the links have been processed the extract process is complete.","As illustration, suppose IETM object B links to IETM object C. When executing the link identification process for IETM object B and encountering the link to IETM object C, the system id, class id, node id and name of the IETM object C is saved in an array. The identification process completes for IETM object B (all database objects and file objects are closed and destroyed). The saved link for IETM object C is retrieved from the array (block ) and the identification process (block ) is called for the IETM object C. If IETM object C links to IETM object D, the link to IETM object D would be saved. The identification process completes for IETM object C (all database objects and file objects are closed and destroyed). The saved link for IETM object D is retrieved from the array (block ) and the identification process (block ) is called for IETM object D.","In another embodiment of the invention, processing of the links occurs immediately instead of information being saved in an array. For instance, IETM object B links to IETM object C. When executing the link identification process (block ) for IETM object B and encountering the link to IETM object C, the identification process is called immediately to create the file for IETM object C. The database objects and file objects associated with the IETM object B are left open until the processing of IETM object C is completed. If IETM object C links to IETM object D, the identification process is called immediately to handle the link to IETM object D. At this point the database objects associated with the IETM object B and IETM object C would be open. Over time. the number of database and file objects could expand rather quickly. It would be apparent to one skilled in the art that various implementations, all falling within the scope of the invention, could be used for identifying and processing the links to create the HTML pages, and that different methods produce varying results with respect to performance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIGS. 10A and 10B","FIG. 5"],"b":["92","1001","1002","1003","1004","1005","1006","1001","1006","1001"]},"If the IETM data type for the node or data class is of narrative type, as determined in decision block , then the narrative information is selected from the database in block . An HTML file is created for a narrative consisting of paragraph and anchor tags for links to other IETM objects in block . One should note that if the HTML already exists, and the user chose not to replace all files during the control selection phase, then the existing file is not overwritten, and only new files, for links not previously processed, are created. Any links found within the narrative information are saved for later processing in block , if the user selected links to be processed in the control selection phase, and the parsing of this node is now complete.","If the IETM data type for the node or data class is of graphic type as determined in decision block , then the graphic information is selected from the database in block . An HTML file is created for a graphic consisting of an image map with area tags for links to other IETM objects in block . Any links found within the graphic information are saved for later processing in block  and the parsing of this node is now complete.","If the IETM data type for the node or data class is of table type as determined in decision block , then the table information is selected from the database in block . An HTML file is created for a table consisting of table header, table row, and table cell tags in block . Each cell may contain anchor tags to other IETM objects. Any links found within the table information are saved for later processing in block  and the parsing of this node is now complete.","If the IETM data type for the node or data class is of procedure type as determined in decision block , then the procedure information is selected from the database in block . An HTML file is created for a procedure consisting of table row, table cell tags and checkbox tags in block . Anchor tags may be included to link to the other IETM data types. Any links found within the table information are saved for later processing in block  and the parsing. A test to determine whether the procedure has an exit is performed in decision block . If there is an exit, then procedure information for the exited-to procedure is selected in block  and another HTML file is created in block . Otherwise, a test to determine whether the procedure has a decision is performed in decision block . If there is a decision, then the Yes portion of the procedure is recursively extracted in  and then the No portion of the procedure is recursively extracted in block . Otherwise, if there was no decision then the processing for this node is complete.","Utilizing the database generated auto-increment numerical fields, the Extract process converts the hierarchical data properties from the relational database into relative addressing for presentation in a Web browser. Links and relationships and between the IETM nodes are retained utilizing a common and consistent data storage structure. The numerical directories utilized for data storage and naming do not hinder data maintenance. All data is intended to be maintained in the relational database.","Each IETM data type is represented by one HTML page except in the case of the procedure data type. The IETM data is structured hierarchically in a tree, starting with menu items that are hyperlinked to either child menus or one of the other IETM data types. In turn, the child menu could link to another child menu or one of the other IETM data types. The last node in the tree cannot be a child menu; it must be either a text, graphic, table or procedure data type. A menu item can only be linked from another menu item. The Extract process uses recursion to traverse the tree, generating HTML files for each IETM data type encountered.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1100","1101","1102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1201","1202","1203","1204","1205"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["1301","1302","1303"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":"1401"},"A text, table, graphic or procedure data type may contain one or more links to other IETM data type(s), except the menu type. When the Extract process encounters a link to another data type, an HTML anchor tag is written to the file for the data being processed and the application recursively calls itself to process the \u201clinked to\u201d object. The starting date and time is saved in order to avoid extra processing, since one IETM data type can be linked from multiple places. The entire IETM may be generated at once, or incrementally in smaller portions at different times. The user can navigate to the specific piece of the IETM and click a menu option to being the Extract Process.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["1501","1502","1503","1504","1505","1506"]},"According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the code used to present procedures, as outlined previously, utilizes two levels of recursion. When a procedure is authored, the procedure can exit to other common procedures allowing data sharing and non-replication of data. The final HTML presentation of the IETM must mask the details used in constructing the procedure. The other complicating factor in procedures is the process flow of decision steps. Since procedures with decisions are represented in multiple files, sometime when processing a decision branch of an \u201cexited to\u201d procedure the steps after the exit in the parent procedure need to reside in the HTML file of the decision step of the \u201cexited to\u201d procedure. The steps after the exit in the parent procedure need to be included in the yes and no branch HTML files. Whenever an exit to another procedure is encountered a \u201crecursive look ahead\u201d is performed to determine if the \u201cexited to\u201d procedure or any of its descendants contain decisions. The second use of recursion is used to process the yes and no branches of a decision. The application calls itself to process a new HTML file for the yes branch and a new HTML file for the no branch.","Referring again to , once the data has been extracted and the HTML pages are created, the entire relative addressed Web can be exported for use on a standalone machine in function block  and then displayed in function block  by a standard Web browser. This method is advantageous for periodic updates of the electronic media because a small subset of the Web can be regenerated as needed and then exported to the user via a disk or even by e-mail. With traditional methods of displaying an IETM, the DBMS is updated (or re-authored) and the custom client-server system must regenerate the pages viewed by the user as needed. This has been problematic because the user's system must remain connected to the DBMS server in order to receive any updated pages. In contrast, the present invention allows the IETM updates to be received on a diskette, or other media, or sent by e-mail, or downloaded by the user and then subsequently quickly installed on the target machine by the user. The IETM can then be viewed on a standalone machine with an ordinary web browser with no connection to a network or DBMS server.","An advantage of the method of the present invention is the operational performance of the extracted web far exceeds the existing Windows\u2122 based presentation products. Testing for both the stand-alone personal computer (PC) based and URL Server based extract Web provided ten (10) times performance improvements in speed of presenting data to the user. This enhances the overall acceptance of the product.","In addition, the HTML Web created by the Extract process is thin server\/client. When operated in a server mode (connectivity to the intranet) the application requires only minimal storage and a standard Web server (like Internet Information Service) and only a standard Web browser. The HTML files produced by the Extract process support PC stand-alone operation through \u2018file serving\u2019 using a standard web browser with no plug-ins or personal server application with no loss in functionality.","The preferred embodiment of the present invention operates on IETM databases and is described in more detail above in this context. It would be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present embodiment could be easily modified to operate on any database containing data of a hierarchical nature that is desired to be presented to a user in an easily manipulable and navigable format, such as Web pages.
