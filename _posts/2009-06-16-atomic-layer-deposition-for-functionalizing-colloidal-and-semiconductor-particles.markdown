More particularly, the invention is directed to preparation of functionalized nanocomposites of colloidal quantum dots having a deposited layer formed by ALD. A selected film layer can be deposited by ALD to improve electronic properties of the colloidal quantum dots.","This section is intended to provide a background or context to the invention that is, inter alia, recited in the claims. Unless otherwise indicated herein, what is described in this section is not prior art to the description and claims in this application and is not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.","Colloidal semiconductor nanoparticles present very interesting optical and electronic properties due to the ease with which the emission wavelength and the electronic states can be controlled. They can further be assembled by a simple drying process into randomly close packed and even highly ordered solids. Because they are synthesized as colloids, they are covered by surfactants that provide a steric repulsion against aggregation. This organic layer has the additional benefit of electronically passivating the dangling orbitals of the metal cations, therefore removing carrier traps and helping radiative recombination of excitons. However, the organic layer also poses a significant barrier to electron transfer between particles. Typically, organic saturated hydrocarbons presents a negative electron affinity, and thus, would lead to typical energy barriers of the order 5 eV for typical semiconductors. In practice, as determined by tunneling experiments on alkane monolayers, the average barrier height is expected to be significantly lower, of the order 2 eV reduced in part by image potentials. Nevertheless, this is a high barrier in the context of traditional semiconductor heterostructures where barriers of 0.5 eV are the norm. Consequently, initial experiments investigating transport with colloidal quantum dot arrays primarily demonstrated their insulating properties.","At present, conductivity in quantum dot arrays has been achieved by a liquid medium procedure that involves the extraction of the original ligands in the films and their replacement by shorter passivating ligands. For CdSe nanocrystals, of interest for visible light emission, the highest mobility reported by this approach is about 10cm\/V\/s. For a smaller band gap material, PbSe, of more interest as an infrared emitter, mobilities of 10cm\/V\/s up to 1 cm\/v\/s have been reported. This corresponds to hopping times between 1 nanosecond (ns) and 10 picoseconds (ps) between nanocrystals. This characteristic can also can be expressed in terms of a coupling energy of order 0.01 to 1 meV. This is still small compared to Coulomb repulsive energy or polydispersivity (100 meV). As a result, the organic-inorganic composite nanomaterials made by this approach are intrinsically Mott-insulators.","It is a fundamental challenge to achieve \u201cmetallic\u201d behavior in such close-packed arrays. It would also open the door to applications requiring high mobility and high currents, such as electrically driven lasers or photovoltaic devices. Applications of the materials to both cases can be easily motivated. Indeed, the quantum dot lasers based on heteroepitaxy provide insufficient dot density to significantly improve the performance over the existing quantum well laser. With close-packed colloidal dots, dot density is easily increased by 100-fold. The bigger challenge is to draw a high and ambipolar current in the colloidal dot systems. With photovoltaics, such high currents are not required, but it is clear that higher mobilities will be in general very helpful. To overcome the difficulties described hereinbefore due to the organics, a barrier material that is all inorganic has been attempted in the prior art, but has been rather unsuccessful using liquid solution methods. A challenge with liquid solution is to avoid self-nucleation in the liquid phase, as well as pore-clogging in the nanoparticle arrays and to have enough diffusion of the bulky solvated molecules into the array.","In order to efficiently functionalize useful electronic components from colloidal nanoparticle systems, organic layers conventionally used to coat and passivate the starting nanoparticles are replaced with ALD layers of various inorganic materials. The organic layers present a significant barrier to the flow of electrical charge and the resulting high resistivity limits device application. Replacement of the organic layer with a lower electronic barrier material, such as an inorganic semiconductor, leads to greatly improved electronic coupling between the colloidal nanoparticles, enabling a wide variety of electronic, optical and chemical applications, such as photovoltaics, solid state lighting and electrically driven lasers. A preferred method of preparation involves liquid phase deposition of solid colored colloidal quantum dot arrays followed by gas phase ALD of a selected inorganic barrier layer.","In an embodiment, a method for preparing a functionalized nanocomposite is provided. The method comprises providing an atomic layer deposition (ALD) system, a colloidal quantum dot array that comprises a semiconductor material, providing a first precursor reactive with the semiconductor material, the first precursor comprises at least one of a transition metal and a transition metal compound. The first precursor is selected to modify at least one of an electrical and an optical property of the colloidal quantum dot array. The colloidal quantum dot array is exposed to the first precursor within the ALD system for a first period and a monolayer of the first precursor is deposited over at least a portion of the semiconductor material to form a nanocomposite. The nanocomposite comprises an inorganic surface disposed over at least a portion of the semiconductor material.","In an another embodiment, a functionalized nanocomposite that has enhanced electro-optical properties is described. The nanocomposite comprises a semiconductor nanocrystal substrate and an inorganic conformal film deposited over at least a portion of the substrate via monolayer deposition. The inorganic film comprises a transition metal and the nanocomposite is characterized by an enhancement of at least one of an electrical property and an optical property relative to the respective electrical property and optical property of the semiconductor nanocrystal.","In still another embodiment, a method for enhancing an electro-optical property of a nanocrystal semiconductor is provided. The method comprises providing a nanocrystal semiconductor substantially free of interstitial contaminates and a first precursor. The first precursor comprises at least one of a gas-phase transition metal and a transition metal compound. A second precursor is provided that is selected to be reactive with the first precursor. A substantially conforming layer that comprises the first precursor is deposited onto the nanocrystal semiconductor. The second precursor reacts with the first precursor of the substantially conforming layer to form a nanocomposite structure comprising a nanocrystal semiconductor having an inorganic surface layer.","These and other advantages and features of the invention, together with the organization and manner of operation thereof, will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like elements have like numerals throughout the several drawings described below.","Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a thin film growth method relying on alternating, self-limiting chemical reactions between precursor vapors (for example, A and B components) and a solid surface to deposit films in an atomic layer-by-layer fashion. In this method, each \u201cAB cycle\u201d deposits exactly one monolayer of material and the thickness of the film can be controlled precisely on the atomic level by adjusting the number of AB cycles. Gaseous diffusion of the ALD precursor molecules along with termination of the individual ALD reactions following deposition of each complete layer ensure that the resulting films are conformal and uniform in thickness even when the underlying substrate has a complex topography. Consequently, porous substrates can be coated easily by ALD, including nanoporous membranes, aerogels, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and particles.  illustrates this conformality by showing a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of a sample of ZrOnanoparticles that have been coated with an ALD AlOfilm having a thickness of 4 nm (the outer layer of the nanoparticle).","A wide variety of materials can be deposited by ALD methods including oxides, nitrides, and metals. For instance, zinc oxide (ZnO) can be deposited using alternating exposures of diethyl zinc (DEZ) and water vapor; aluminum oxide (AlO) can be deposited using alternating exposures of trimethyl aluminum and water vapor; zinc sulfide (ZnS) can be formed with altering exposures of DEZ and hydrogen sulfide (HS); and ZnSe may be formed with alternating exposures of DEZ and hydrogen diselenide (HSe). An ALD viscous flow reactor  for synthesizing ZnO films and other ALD materials is shown in  and is a conventional system.","Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been used to apply an inorganic-based layer over an underlying nanoparticle pattern to achieve a resulting component product having superior properties. Films of nanocrystals are well suited for ALD. The open structure of nanocrystal films allows rapid diffusion of the gaseous precursor and thus easy layer by layer filling of the interstices present in such layers. Furthermore, the nanometer (nm) size interstices allow saturation after application of only a few monolayers. Thus a complete ALD process on a film of nanocrystals can take place over only a few cycles, and thus be cost-effective.","ALD may be used to create films of nanocrystals, for example, using colloidal CdSe quantum dots and selected appropriate core\/shell structures. In a preferred embodiment to perform ALD within the nanocrystal film, interstices should be as free as possible of hydrocarbons from excess solvent or ligands. Indeed, it is likely that polar gases do not diffuse easily in a hydrophobic matrix and\/or that the polar ALD material nucleate incompletely in such an environment. A preferred preparation involves treating the film with a 3% by weight aqueous ammonium hydroxide (NHOH) (30%) in ethanol. The IR spectra of the NHOH treated films shows a much reduced CH contribution albeit with an increased NH\/OH contribution. While not limiting the scope of the invention, it is believed that the ammonium ions complexes the surface metal ions, displacing the previous ligands which are then soluble in ethanol. The kinetics of removal of the hydrocarbons, measured by infrared absorption of the CH stretches, indicate at least two time constants, where 80-90% is removed in an immersion of about 30 seconds. The remaining hydrocarbon is removed on a much slower time scale and is accompanied by etching of the film, as evidenced by a blue-shift in the absorption spectrum of the quantum dots. Ellipsometry showed that ligand removal by NHOH treatment shrinks the film thickness by about 30% and increases the dielectric constant by about 10%.","To evaluate the extent of infiltration by the ZnO ALD, CdSe nanocrystal films (about 50 nm thickness) were drop cast onto quartz sensors which were used for in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements. The initial ZnO ALD mass uptake is close to the value of 113 ng\/cm\/cycle measured for a clean sensor. Mass uptake increases slowly in subsequent cycles, indicating only modest infiltration. This behavior is understandable because the dried films contain a large fraction of long, hydrocarbon chain ligands which block the interstitial voids and inhibit nucleation of the ZnO ALD. For effective infiltration, the surfaces and voids should be substantially clear, and the surface should react with the ALD precursors. To improve the infiltration, the films were treated with 3% by weight aqueous ammonium aydroxide (30%) in ethanol. Following NHOH treatment of the CdSe films, QCM measurements yielded a significantly higher mass uptake of up to 1400 ng\/cm\/cycle, which is the equivalent of 13 ZnO ALD layers (, solid circles). To estimate the maximum possible uptake, the surface area of a film of thickness d containing spheres of radius R at a volume fraction \u03a6 is 3\u03a6d\/R. Assuming a random-close packed fraction of 0.64, a 50 nm film made of 2.5 nm radius particles should have an uptake of about 40\u00d7. The measured uptake of 13\u00d7 may reflect inaccessible surfaces, or delayed nucleation on the nanocrystal surfaces but it does confirm a large degree of infiltration.","The samples with ZnO deposited by ALD were tested for photoconductivity. ZnO is a good choice because it is a natural n-type conductor. Its bulk conduction band edge is expected to be below that of CdSe so that electrons in CdSe may have a low barrier to tunnel to the other nanocrystals and may even be extracted into the ZnO matrix. Furthermore, although ZnO has a strong tendency to trap holes, its ability to conduct electrons is remarkably resilient to disorder, defects or the large amount of hydroxyl groups which result from the ALD process.","The sample film of CdSe\/CdS colloidal quantum dots is drop cast on a set of interdigitated electrodes (50 sets pf Pt electrodes of 5 mm long, 5 \u03bcm wide and 5 \u03bcm separation on glass) from Abtech Scientific.  shows the bright and dark conductivity of a sample following the various steps in the treatment and after each ZnO cycle, ending with HO. The samples were characterized at room temperature in air after each processing step and ZnO cycle. The bias of 1 V and the current\/voltage response is perfectly linear from 0 to 1 V. The bright conductivity is simply measured with a 3 V handheld flashlamp and only the relative changes are relevant. As shown in , the photoconductivity increases by three orders of magnitude following application of the first two monolayers, and then increases more slowly. The dark current, which is initially in the pA range does not increase following application of the first ZnO monolayers but then increases noticeably. As to not be limited by theory, the results suggest that the first few monolayers facilitate electron transfer by mostly building ZnObridges between the quantum dots, while the subsequent monolayers lead to an increase of the ZnO matrix connectivity. Depending on the application, one may want to minimize the dark current while maximizing the conductivity, which may be achieved with few ZnO cycles.","The dark current and photoconductivity parameters are sensitive to temperature and ambient atmosphere. As shown in , in situ measurements at 100\u00b0 C. of the photoconductivity during the ALD cycles show large swings in the parameters. For the first cycle, the photoconductivity increases typically 1000-fold upon exposure with diethyl zinc, and subsequently decreases about 30 fold when exposed to water. Also, simply pulling vacuum on the sample while under illumination leads to large changes of the dark current and photoconductivity. Finally, for a sample that had been exposed to 10 ZnO cycles, a temperature increase from 20\u00b0 C. to 250\u00b0 C. was determined to result in a reversible three orders of magnitude increase in dark current. These observations, temperature dependence of the dark current and sensitivity to the environment and illumination, have been typically reported only for amorphous or polycrystalline semiconductors such as InOand ZnO in particular. While not limiting the scope of the invention, it is likely that these results reflect the ease with which small changes of the local oxidation state can affect the conductivity of these oxides. For example, the significant photocurrent increase upon diethyl zinc exposure is probably a result of partial electron donation of a \u2014O\u2014Zn-ethyl surface specie.","To optimize the quantum dot photoresponse, while minimizing the dark current, additional assessment was carried out on a three monolayer ZnO cycle specimen.  shows the photoresponse of a \u02dc3.5 nm CdSe sample biased with 1 V. The light source was a 100 W tungsten-halogen lamp filtered through a 10 cm monochromator and 1 mm slits. The photoresponse was normalized to the calibrated response of a Si photodiode. The response follows the optical absorption of the film sample with a small red-shift and broadening compared to the starting solution.","The ZnO ALD modified quantum dot photodiode achieved the fastest response time thus far observed for colloidal quantum dot detectors.  shows time traces measured with a 10V\/A amplifier with a green laser (532 nm) focused on a chopper wheel. The rise time of about 10 \u03bcs for specimen is limited by the chopper and close to that of the amplifier.  shows the unamplified response to an 8 ps 532 nm laser pulse recorded with a 2 GHz oscilloscope. The quantum dot film response shows a sharp sub-nanosecond rise time with a fall time of about 4 nanoseconds. The response time obtained for the same is 3-4 orders of magnitude faster than previous results with CdSe quantum dot photodiodes. Not to be limited by theory, but the fast response implies that electrons are rapidly recombining with holes in the absence of light while the larger photosensitivity must imply a decent mobility.","For a photoresistor, the current is given by I=\u03c4\u03bcVL\u03b7\u03b1eF, where e is the electron charge, \u03c4 is the electron lifetime (3.5 ns), \u03bc is the mobility, \u03b7 is the carrier generation probability per exciton, \u03b1 is the absorption, L is the electrode gap (5 \u03bcm) and F is the incident photon flux. At 532 nm, the responsivity, current divided by incident power, of the sample in  was 5.7 \u03bcA\/W with a 1 V bias. The film absorption for the sample was about 10%. Assuming \u03b7=1, the mobility is 8.7\u00d710cmVs. This result is a lower bound because \u03b7 may be less than 1. At 100 V bias, the sensitivity increases 3-fold, providing a mobility of about 2.6\u00d710cmVs. An independent determination of the mobility is obtained from the I-V curve shown in . The saturation current, I, corresponds to \u03c4\u03bcVL=1 such that I=\u03b7\u03b1eF. Assuming that \u03b7=1 in the linear and the saturation regimes, the slope of I\/Iin the linear regime is \u03c4\u03bcLwhich gives \u03c4\u03bc=2.10cmVand a mobility is 6\u00d710cmVs. The mobilities estimated by two independent methods are thus in satisfactory agreement, in the 10-10cmVsrange. This result is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than previous mobilities measured from photoconductivity and of the order of the highest value observed for n-type CdSe quantum dot films.","Besides the dramatic effect on photoconductivity, ALD also modifies the optical properties of the quantum dot films. The ALD of ZnO in a NHOH treated CdSe quantum dot film increases the index of refraction from about 1.75 to about 2 as the interstices are filled with the high index ZnO, thus waveguiding becomes easier.","One property that is of great importance for quantum dots is the photoluminescence. It was found that ZnO and AlOlead to a complete quenching of the luminescence of CdSe quantum dots. In situ measurements show that photoluminescence (PL) is extensively lost upon diethyl zinc exposure. This may be related to the large concurrent increase of photoconductivity, and the partial electron transfer of adsorbed \u2014O\u2014Zn-Ethyl. Indeed, photoluminescence is partially recovered upon HO exposure. However, after several cycles, the photoluminescence becomes weak. Core\/shell quantum dots are better candidates to prevent charge separation. In agreement with the principal that the electrons are extracted, bright CdSe\/CdS quantum dot films loose their photoluminescence upon ZnO ALD exposure at about 100\u00b0 C. However, Samples of CdSe\/ZnS were found to exhibit the greatest resilience of photoluminescence to ZnO. As shown in , for these samples, the most damaging process is the NHOH treatment and also heating to 100\u00b0 C., which together decreased photoluminescence by 75%. Otherwise, the ZnO ALD itself does not lead to significant decline in the photoluminescence.","Finally, it may be noted that the films do not resist acid treatments, and that the ZnO can be removed by simply dipping the films into dilute acetic acid. However, the ALD leads to nanocrystal films with improved mechanical properties. While nanocrystal films before or after NHOH treatment are easily wiped off with Qtips, the ALD processed films no longer rub off.","The following non-limiting examples are illustrative of the invention method and products obtained therefrom.","The colloidal dots and core\/shells are synthesized following slight modifications of a conventional procedure (see ). As synthesized, the dot solutions have a large excess of non-volatile hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbons are first cleaned off by an initial precipitation and centrifugation with ethanol. The dots are then further cleaned by re-dissolving the precipitate in CCl, with 0.2 vol % tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP) and tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) dissolved, followed by centrifugation, transfer of the clear quantum dot solution to a clean test-tube and precipitation with ethanol by centrifugation. This is repeated twice. Finally, the precipitate is dried and redissolved in a mixture of hexane and octane (9:1). This solution is then centrifuged and filtered. Drop-casting leads to clear dry films between 50 and 80 nm thick and an optical density of 0.01 to 0.05 at the exciton peak (the smaller value is for core\/shells).","Such films are highly insulating and exhibit no observable photoconductivity at the applied bias (<1 V\/\u03bcm). The films are then dipped in a solution of 3 wgt % NHOH in ethanol for some time. For the films, photoluminescence is excited with a 400 nm flashlight and detected with a fiber optic spectrometer. The ALD is performed in a small quartz tube chamber with a base pressure of less than 100 mTorr provided by a mechanical pump and liquid nitrogen trap. The valves are manual and a Nflow maintains the pressure at 1 Torr. Diethyl zinc (Strem Chemical) is let in by opening a valve for 1 second. The pressure rises briefly to 2 Torr. After 20 seconds, the water exposure is provided for 5 seconds at a pressure of 4 Torr. The cycle is repeated after one minute. The sample is prepared on a aluminum block heated by a cartridge heater monitored by a chromel-alumel thermocouple. The chamber allows in situ current measurements down to about 1 pA and optical access. Quartz Crystal Microbalance and in situ photoluminescence measurements are performed in the viscous flow ALD reactor shown in .","In a preferred method of Example 1, a solution of tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) at 300\u00b0 C. is prepared. A solution of Cd and Se precursors (e.g. (CH)Cd+(CH)Se in tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP) is prepared, and this solution is injected into the last TOPO solution. First nucleation of CdSe is obtained by thermal decomposition. The system is rapidly cooled to about 260\u00b0 C. and the slow growth of CdSe quantum dots ensues. The size of the quantum dot is determined by the duration of the growth step. Specific examples are described hereinafter.","Measurements were carried out to determine photoluminescence (PL) under 354 nm UV lamp irradiation following ALD of AlOon various CdSe\/CdS and CdSe quantum dots prepared in the manner described in Examples 1 and 2. As noted in , various ALD temperatures were used and selected samples were subject to an NHOH dip. Of note, is the effect of these parameters on the photoluminescence of the various specimens, and in particular, that higher ALD growth temperatures quench the photoluminescence.","The growth rate was determined for ALD deposited AlOon a CdS\/ZnS:Mn quantum dot film on a QCM sensor. The thickness was measured as a function of ALD deposition cycles.  illustrates the growth rate as a function of various numbers of cycles. The growth rate was enhanced by about 35 times versus a flat surface deposition, demonstrating that the ALD of AlOinfiltrates the quantum dot film to coat substantially all inner surfaces.","This example illustrates the effect of compositional formulation for a ALD of ZnO deposited on the formulations shown in . The formulation, whether there is or is not an NHOH dip, the film thickness and the measured photoluminescence are depicted.","Photoluminescence was measured following a ZnO ALD processing for quantum dots of CdSeS\/CdS\/ZnS treated by an NHOH dip.  shows the intensity of the CdSeS\/CdS\/ZnS sample as a function of time and associated solution treatments at selected times.","Photoconductivity was measured following ALD of ZnO onto CdSe\/CdS (see ). The photoconductivity is illustrated versus bias voltage for light and dark conditions and with and without ALD of ZnO layers.","The foregoing description of embodiments of the present invention have been presented for purposes of illustration and description.
