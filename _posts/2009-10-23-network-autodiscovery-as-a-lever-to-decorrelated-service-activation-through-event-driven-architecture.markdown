title: Network autodiscovery as a lever to decorrelated service activation through event driven architecture
abstract: An autodiscovery system provides content credentials to customer premise equipment through an event-driven architecture. The autodiscovery system includes several modules for implementing the event-driven architecture, such as an autodiscovery front-end module, an autodiscovery back-end module, and a broadcast activation module. The autodiscovery system may also include a subscriber database that stores subscriber records that identify subscribers associated with a level of service, a customer premise equipment identifier, or both. The modules of the autodiscovery system may also communicate with a conditional access system that communicates the content credentials to a data carousel. When the content credentials are made available on the data carousel, the autodiscovery front-end module may notify the customer premise equipment that the content credentials are ready for retrieval from the data carousel.

Technical Field","This application relates to an event driven architecture and, in particular, to an event driven architecture that autodiscovers customer premise equipment and makes content credentials available to the customer premise equipment when the event driven architecture processes an autodiscovery event.","2. Related Art","In order to receive substantive content from a telecommunication service provider, customer premise equipment typically requires content credentials that authorize the customer premise equipment to receive that substantive content. The content credentials are generally issuable by a conditional access system working in conjunction with the telecommunication service provider, and the conditional access system may communicate the content credentials to a data carousel accessible by the customer premise equipment.","However, current telecommunication service providers and conditional access systems typically make the content credentials available on the data carousel at the time of purchase or rental of the customer premise equipment. That is, the telecommunication service provider and the conditional access system make the content credentials available on the data carousel at the time of subscription or purchase of the customer premises equipment. As a data carousel typically has limited storage for storing the content credentials, current conditional access systems allocate a limited time for which the content credentials are available. Current implementations lead to a waste in resources and an inefficient use of the data carousel when the customer premise equipment does not retrieve the content credentials within the allocated time (e.g., because the purchaser does not install the equipment in a timely manner after purchase). Hence, a more efficient system that provides the content credentials to the customer premise equipment is needed.","An autodiscovery system provides content credentials to customer premise equipment through an event-driven architecture. In one implementation, the autodiscovery system includes a computer-readable memory storage device that stores instructions that define one or module modules. The instructions, when executed by a processor, execute the logic of the modules to implement the event-driven architecture. The modules may include an autodiscovery front-end module, an autodiscovery back-end module, and a broadcast activation module. The autodiscovery front-end module, the autodiscovery back-end module, and the broadcast activation module may include one or more additional modules. For example, the broadcast activation module may include an event receiver module and a command sending module.","The autodiscovery front-end module monitors network communications, such as network packets, sent by the customer premise equipment. In one implementation, the autodiscovery front-end module is operative to receive a network notification from customer premise equipment. The network notification may notify a telecommunication service provider that the customer premise equipment is ready to receive service. The autodiscovery front-end module may then communicate the network notification to another module of the autodiscovery system, such as the autodiscovery back-end module.","The autodiscovery back-end module processes network communications received by the autodiscovery front-end module and determines whether to generate an autodiscovery event based on the received network communications. For example, the autodiscovery back-end module may extract an unverified customer premise equipment identifier from a network communication and then generate an autodiscovery event that identifies that the customer premise equipment is not receiving service from the telecommunications service provider. The autodiscovery back-end module may generate the autodiscovery event when the autodiscovery back-end module determines that the unverified customer premise equipment identifier matches a registered customer premise equipment identifier stored in a database.","The broadcast activation module is operative to process the autodiscovery events generated by the autodiscovery back-end module using the event receiver module and the command sending module. The event receiver module is operative to receive the autodiscovery event from the autodiscovery back-end module, and the command sending module is operative to generate a request for content credentials in response to the autodiscovery event. The command sending module may communicate the request for the content credentials to a conditional access system, and the conditional access system may communicate the content credentials to a data carousel accessible by the customer premise equipment. When the content credentials are communicated to the data carousel and are available to the customer premise equipment, the autodiscovery front-end module may notify the customer premise equipment that the content credentials are available from the conditional access system, the data carousel, or both.","Other systems, methods, features and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. All such additional systems, methods, features and advantages are included within this description, are within the scope of the invention, and are protected by the following claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","102","104","140","106","108","110","102","112","114","116","118","120","122","124"]},"The autodiscovery system  may also indirectly communicate with one or more components. For example, the autodiscovery system  may communicate with a conditional access system  through the message queue provider , and the autodiscovery system  may communicate with a database  through the database access module . In addition, the autodiscovery system  may communicate with a conditional access system  through a message queue provider , and the conditional access system  may communicate with a data carousel . As another example, the autodiscovery system  may communicate with a DNS\/DHCP server  through a reboot daemon  and\/or an autodiscovery extension module , and the autodiscovery system  may communicate with a customer premise equipment  through a cable modem termination system , the DNS\/DHCP server , or both.","One or more of the modules shown in  may be implemented in hardware, software, or both. For example, the modules of the autodiscovery system  may be implemented as a Java-based web application running on an Apache\/Tomcat platform under a Solaris operating system. Apache\/Tomcat is an open source software implementation of the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages technologies. Apache\/Tomcat is available from the Apache Software Foundation, which is located in Forest Hill, Md., United States. Java, Java Servlet, and JavaServer Pages are available from Sun Microsystems, Inc. located in Santa Clara, Calif., United States. The Solaris operating system is also available from Sun Microsystems, Inc. The autodiscovery system  may also implement one or more messaging standards, such as the Java Message Service (\u201cJMS\u201d) API, which is a messaging standard that allows application components to send, receive, and read messages. The JMS API is also available from Sun Microsystems, Inc. Alternatively, one or more modules shown in , such as the reboot daemon  and the autodiscovery extension module , may be implemented in another programming language, such as C, which was developed by Dennis Ritchie and Bell Laboratories.","The autodiscovery system  facilitates the distribution of content credentials to authorized customer premise equipment. The autodiscovery system  may require that the customer premise equipment be authorized to prevent the unauthorized distribution of network content to unauthorized customer premise equipment. Alternatively, by requiring that the customer premise equipment be authorized, a telecommunication service provider can control the type and amount of authorized customer premise equipment available to subscribers.","In one implementation, a set of customer premise equipment has a customer premise equipment identifier. The customer premise equipment identifier may be a serial number, a Media Access Control (\u201cMAC\u201d) address, a model number, or any other type of customer premise equipment identifier that distinguishes one set of customer premise equipment from another set. The customer premise equipment identifier may be stored and associated with a subscriber record of the database . For example, the order management module  may receive a notification that a subscriber of a telecommunication service provider has recently purchased or rented a customer premise equipment for use with the telecommunication service provider. The order management module  may also receive a request to register the customer premise equipment identifier of the newly purchased or rented customer premise equipment with the autodiscovery system . The order management module  may communicate the request to the provisioning module , which may then request that the database  store the customer premise equipment identifier as a registered customer premise identifier. In storing the customer premise equipment identifier, the provisioning module  may communicate with the database access module  to access the database .","In effect, the registered customer premise equipment identifier signifies to the autodiscovery system  that the customer premise equipment associated with the registered customer premise identifier is authorized to receive network content from the telecommunication service provider.","In addition to the registered customer premise equipment identifier, the database  may store additional subscriber information. The database  may be any type of database, such as a relational database, a distributed database, a navigational database, an object database, or any other type of database for storing additional subscriber information. In one implementation, the database  is an Oracle Database 11g, which is available from the Oracle Corporation located in Redwood Shores, Calif., United States.","The database  may store a record for each of the subscribers of the telecommunication service provider. Table 1 below lists examples of the type of subscriber\/broadcast information that the database  may store for a subscriber record.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Database Field","Data Type","Brief Explanation"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["BROADCAST_LASTORDER","VARCHAR2(50)","The most recent provisioning"]},{"entry":[{},{},"action performed for the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"customer premise equipment."]},{"entry":["SUBSCRIBER_ACCOUNTNO","INTEGER","The account number for the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"subscriber."]},{"entry":["BROADCAST_CLIENTTRANSREF","VARCHAR2(50)","A client transfer reference"]},{"entry":[{},{},"number for the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"telecommunication service"]},{"entry":[{},{},"provider."]},{"entry":["SMARTCARD_NUMBER","VARCHAR2(20)","A smartcard identification"]},{"entry":[{},{},"number associated with the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"subscriber."]},{"entry":["SMARTCARD_PAIRING_ID","VARCHAR2(20)","A smartcard pairing"]},{"entry":[{},{},"identification number"]},{"entry":[{},{},"associated with the subscriber."]},{"entry":["BROADCAST_PIN","VARCHAR2(10)","A personal identification"]},{"entry":[{},{},"number associated with the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"subscriber."]},{"entry":["BROADCAST_RETURNPATH","CHAR(1)","Specifies whether the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"customer premise equipment"]},{"entry":[{},{},"has a return path."]},{"entry":["SUBSCRIBER_ZIP","VARCHAR2(10)","The postal code of the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"subscriber."]},{"entry":["BROADCAST_IMPULSE","CHAR(1)","Identifies whether the impulse"]},{"entry":[{},{},"mode of the customer premise"]},{"entry":[{},{},"equipment is suspended."]},{"entry":["BROADCAST_SERVICES","VARCHAR2(2000)","Identifies the network services"]},{"entry":[{},{},"available to the customer"]},{"entry":[{},{},"premise equipment."]},{"entry":["CPE_NETWORK_NAME","VARCHAR2(256)","Identifies the network name of"]},{"entry":[{},{},"the customer premise"]},{"entry":[{},{},"equipment."]},{"entry":["CPE_AUTHENTICATIONID","VARCHAR2(20)","Identifies an authentication"]},{"entry":[{},{},"identification number for the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"customer premise equipment."]},{"entry":["CPE_MACADDR","VARCHAR2(100)","Identifies a MAC address for"]},{"entry":[{},{},"the customer premise"]},{"entry":[{},{},"equipment."]},{"entry":["BROADCAST_SUSPENDED","CHAR(1)","Identifies whether the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"customer premise equipment"]},{"entry":[{},{},"is in a suspended state."]},{"entry":["BROADCAST_CUSTOMDATA","CLOB","A block of data reserved for"]},{"entry":[{},{},"use by one or more"]},{"entry":[{},{},"provisioning systems."]},{"entry":["BROADCAST_TS","TIMESTAMP","A timestamp indicator that"]},{"entry":[{},{},"identifies a time when a"]},{"entry":[{},{},"command occurred."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In addition to the exemplary subscriber information shown in Table 1, the database  may also store a level of service identifier associated with a subscriber identifier. Furthermore, one or more of the database fields may correspond to the registered customer premise equipment identifier, the registered subscriber identifier, the level of service identifier, or any other identifiers recognized by the autodiscovery system . For example, the BROADCAST_SERVICES database field may store the level of service identifier associated with the subscriber identifier. As additional examples, the CPE_MACADDR database field or the CPE_AUTHENTICATIONID field may store the registered customer premise equipment identifier, and the SUBSCRIBER_ACCOUNTNO database field may store the subscriber identifier. Depending on the customer premise equipment, the SMARTCARD_NUMBER database field and the SMARTCARD_PAIRING_ID database field may also store the customer premise equipment identifier, the subscriber identifier, or both. Other types of subscriber information are also possible.","The subscriber identifier identifies a subscriber and the level of service identifier associated with the subscriber identifier may identify the level of service to provide to the subscriber associated with the subscriber identifier. In one implementation, a telecommunication service provider has different classes of service, and the level of service identifier identifies the class of service to provide to the subscriber. By distinguishing the levels of service between subscribers, a telecommunication service provider can retain control over the available bandwidth and incoming or outgoing network traffic. For example, the different classes of service may indicate the amount of network bandwidth available to the subscriber. Other types of classes of service are also possible.","In an initial procedure for registering the customer premise equipment, the autodiscovery system  may associate the customer premise equipment identifier with the subscriber identifier, and the autodiscovery system  may distribute the association to one or more components in communication with the autodiscovery system . For example, with reference to , after the provisioning module  receives the customer premise equipment identifier from the order management module , the provisioning module  may communicate the customer premise equipment identifier and the request to register the customer premise equipment identifier to the provisioning system kernel  (). The provisioning system kernel  may then process the request from the provisioning module  to determine the destination and\/or component to receive the request. As the provisioning module  received the request to register the customer premise equipment identifier with a subscriber, the provisioning system kernel  will determine that the register request should be communicated to the database access module  ().","The provisioning system kernel  may then communicate the request and customer premise equipment identifier to the database access module  (). In turn, the database access module  may communicate with the database  to store the customer premise equipment identifier (). As discussed above, storing the customer premise equipment identifier may include associating the customer premise equipment identifier with a subscriber identifier, a subscriber record, or other subscriber information stored in the database . By storing the customer premise equipment identifier and\/or associating the customer premise equipment identifier with a subscriber identifier or subscriber record, the customer premise equipment identifier becomes a registered customer premise equipment identifier.","After storing the customer premise equipment identifier in the database , the database access module  may then communicate a registration message to the provisioning system kernel  that the registration of the customer premise equipment identifier was successful (). Alternatively, the database access module  may communicate another message, such as a failure message indicating that the registration of the customer premise equipment identifier failed or a non-responsive message indicating that the database  did not respond to commands from the database access module . Other message types are also possible.","After the provisioning system kernel  receives a registration message from the database access module , the provisioning system kernel  may then communicate the registration of the customer premise equipment identifier to the directory server . In one implementation, the directory server  is a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (\u201cLDAP\u201d) server. The directory server  may store directory information about subscribers and customer premise equipment such as the association between subscribers and customer premise equipment, whether a set of customer premise equipment is registered with the autodiscovery system , whether a subscriber has access to the autodiscovery system , or other directory information. The directory server  servers as middle-man between the autodiscovery system  and the customer premise equipment that prevents overloading the autodiscovery system  with requests for access to directory information. Although  shows that the directory server  may be a single component, in an alternative implementation, the directory server  may include a master directory server and a replica directory server. In this alternative implementation, the master directory server may allow new directory information to be added to the directory, and the replica directory server may replicate the information stored in the master directory server based on a regionalised pattern. In essence, the replica directory provides segmented data, and thus smaller sample of data, to be propagated and processed by distributed sub-systems. The replica directory server may also limit the type of actions that can be performed on the stored directory information, such as limiting write access, delete access, or limiting other types of access.","In communicating with the directory server , the provisioning system kernel  may communicate with the directory server access module . For example, the provisioning system kernel  may communicate the association of the registered customer premise equipment identifier and the subscriber identifier to the directory server access module  (). In turn, the directory server access module  may communicate the association information to the directory server  ().","Once a set of customer premise equipment is registered with the autodiscovery system , the autodiscovery system  may then wait for the customer premise equipment to join the network of the autodiscovery system  and the telecommunication service provider. With reference to , when the customer premise equipment  is first powered on or otherwise connected to the network, the customer premise equipment  may begin an initialization procedure. In general, the customer premise equipment  communicates with the autodiscovery system  to obtain authorization that the customer premise equipment  should receive network services or network content from a telecommunication service provider. The customer premise equipment  may be any type of customer premise equipment, such as a set-top box, a cable modem, a Digital Subscriber Line (\u201cDSL\u201d) modem, or any other type of customer premise equipment. In addition, the customer premise equipment  may include any of the components shown in , such as the cable modem termination system , the DNS\/DHCP server , the directory server  or combinations thereof. In one implementation, the customer premise equipment  includes components - that are not the modules - of the autodiscovery system .","The initialization procedure may include establishing a level of service for the customer premise equipment , establishing authorization to access the network of the autodiscovery system , confirming the association of the customer premise equipment with a subscriber, or other initialization procedures.","In one implementation, the customer premise equipment  communicates with the cable modem termination system  to establish a level, or class, of service that the customer premise equipment  should receive (). In general, a cable modem termination system  is equipment typically found in the headend of a telecommunication service provider and is used to provide high speed data services. In one implementation, the cable modem termination system  is a Cisco Universal Broadband Router with features that enable it to communicate with a Hybrid Fiber Coaxial (\u201cHFC\u201d) Cable network via a Cisco cable modem card and is available from Cisco Systems, Inc. located in San Jose, Calif., United States. Alternative types of cable modem termination systems are also possible.","In communicating with the cable modem termination system , the customer premise equipment  may send an unverified subscriber identifier and a network notification that notifies the telecommunication service provider that the customer premise equipment is ready to receive service. Alternatively, the customer premise equipment  may only send the network notification or only send the unverified subscriber identifier. The unverified subscriber identifier may include subscriber information such as a username, a password, or other subscriber information. The unverified subscriber identifier may also uniquely identify the owner or renter of the customer premise equipment . The unverified subscriber identifier is unverified because the autodiscovery system  has not yet established that the entity identified by the unverified subscriber identifier is a subscriber of the telecommunication service provider.","The network notification may include an unverified customer premise equipment identifier that identifies the customer premise equipment . As with the registered customer premise equipment identifier, the unverified customer premise equipment identifier may include a MAC address, a serial number, a model number, or any other identifying information for the customer premise equipment . The unverified customer premise equipment identifier is unverified because, at the onset of the initialization procedure, the autodiscovery system  has not yet established that the customer premise equipment  is authorized to access the network services provided by the telecommunication service provider.","After receiving the network notification and unverified subscriber identifier from the customer premise equipment , the cable modem termination system  may send the network notification and the unverified subscriber identifier to the DNS\/DHCP server  (). In one implementation, the DNS\/DHCP server  is a Cisco Network Registrar that provides high-performance, reliable, and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPP) services. Cisco Network Registrar is also available from Cisco Systems, Inc.","The DNS\/DHCP server  processes the network notification and the unverified subscriber identifier to determine that the customer premise equipment  is requesting access to the network services provided by the telecommunication service provider. The DNS\/DHCP server  may communicate the network notification and the unverified subscriber identifier to the directory server  to determine whether the customer premise equipment  is authorized to access the network services provided by the telecommunication service provider ().","When the directory server  first receives the network notification from the DNS\/DHCP server , the directory server  may recognize that the customer premise equipment has not been previously authorized. In addition, the directory server  may determine that a level or class of service has not yet been established for the customer premise equipment . Accordingly, the directory server  may first confirm that the customer premise equipment  is authorized to receive network services from the telecommunication service provider.","In one implementation, the directory server  may employ a single authentication scheme to confirm that the customer premise equipment  should have access to the network services provided by the telecommunication service provider. In the single authentication scheme implementation, the directory server  may extract the unverified customer premise equipment identifier from the network notification and compare the unverified customer premise equipment identifier with each of the registered customer premise equipment identifiers stored by the directory server . When the unverified customer premise equipment matches any of the registered customer premise equipment identifiers, the directory server  may communicate an authorization confirmation to the DNS\/DHCP server  that confirms that the customer premise equipment  is authorized to receive network services and\/or network content from the telecommunication service provider ().","In a second implementation, the directory server  may employ a dual authentication scheme to confirm that the customer premise equipment  should have access to the network services provided by the telecommunication service provider. In this second implementation, the directory server  may compare the unverified subscriber identifier with the subscriber identifier stored in the directory server , and where the unverified subscriber identifier matches a registered subscriber identifier, the directory server  may then confirm that the unverified customer premise equipment identifier matches a registered customer premise equipment identifier associated with the registered subscriber identifier. When the directory server  determines that the unverified customer premise equipment identifier matches a registered customer premise equipment identifier associated with a corresponding registered subscriber identifier, the directory server  may communicate an authorization confirmation to the DNS\/DHCP server  that confirms that the customer premise equipment  is authorized to receive network services and\/or network content from the telecommunication service provider ().","In addition to the authorization confirmation messages, the directory server  may communicate a failure message or a denial message to the DNS\/DHCP server . For example, where the directory server  is unable to confirm that the customer premise equipment  should be authorized to access the network services and\/or network content of the telecommunication service provider, the directory server  may communicate a failure or denial message to the DNS\/DHCP server  that indicates that the customer premise equipment  should be refused service. Hence, by preregistering a customer premise equipment identifier and\/or a subscriber identifier in the database , the autodiscovery system  can quickly and effectively limit access to network services and\/or network content.","After the DNS\/DHCP server  receives the authorization confirmation from the directory server , the DNS\/DHCP server  may initiate a procedure for establishing the level or class of service to provide to the customer premise equipment . With reference to , the DNS\/DHCP server  may communicate a network notification to the autodiscovery front-end module  (). In one implementation, the DNS\/DHCP server  includes an autodiscovery extension module  that handles communications with the autodiscovery front-end module . The autodiscovery front-end module  is an easily deployable module that integrates the operations of the autodiscovery system  with the DNS\/DHCP server . In effect, the autodiscovery extension module  assists in upgrading the capabilities of a DNS\/DHCP server  that is not configured or designed to perform the autodiscovery of the customer premise equipment .","In one implementation, the network notification received by the autodiscovery front-end module  includes a datagram formatted according to a communication protocol exchange defined by the User Datagram Protocol (\u201cUDP\u201d). However, the network notification may also be formatted according to other protocols, such as Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d), the Transmission Control Protocol (\u201cTCP\u201d), a Voice-Over-Internet Protocol (\u201cVoIP\u201d), or any other communication protocol now known or later developed. In one implementation, the network notification includes a datagram or packet that signifies to the autodiscovery system  or the telecommunication service provider that the customer premise equipment  is ready to receive service from the telecommunication service provider. The network notification may also include additional datagrams or packets, such as a datagram or packet that instructs the autodiscovery system  to establish a level of service to provide to the customer premise equipment .","Once the autodiscovery front-end module  receives the network notification from the DNS\/DHCP server , the autodiscovery front-end module  may communicate with the provisioning system kernel  to establish that the customer premise equipment  should be receiving network service and\/or network content from the telecommunication service provider (). In one implementation, the autodiscovery front-end module  communicates with the autodiscovery back-end module  to establish the level of service to provide to the customer premise equipment . In communicating with the autodiscovery back-end module , the autodiscovery front-end module  may send one or more parameters to the autodiscovery back-end module  including, but not limited to, a MAC address parameter for the MAC address of the customer premise equipment , an IP address parameter for the IP address of the customer premise equipment , an IP address parameter for the IP address of the cable modem termination system , an IP address parameter for the IP address of the DNS\/DHCP server , and a class identifier for the customer premise equipment . Additional or other types of parameters are also possible.","The provisioning system kernel  may then update the subscriber record stored in the database  with information from one or more parameters passed by the autodiscovery front-end module  (). For example, the provisioning system kernel  may update the subscriber record stored in the database  with the MAC address of the customer premise equipment , the IP address parameter of the customer premise equipment , the IP address parameter the cable modem termination system , the IP address of the DNS\/DHCP server , the class identifier for the customer premise equipment , or any other parameter passed by the autodiscovery front-end module .","After updating the subscriber record in the database , the provisioning system kernel  begins the updating procedure and the activation procedure for the customer premise equipment . With reference to , the provisioning system kernel  requests various parameters from the subscriber record stored in the database  for updating the directory server  (). In one implementation, the provisioning system kernel  requests data from one or more of the parameters shown in Table 1 above. For example, the provisioning system kernel  may request data from the SUBSCRIBER_ACCOUNTNO database field, the BROADCAST_SERVICES database field, the CPE_AUTHENTICATIONID database field, the CPE_MACADDR database field, or any of the other database fields shown in Table 1.","The provisioning system kernel  then updates the directory server  with the data retrieved from the database  (). By updating the directory server  with the data retrieved from the database , the autodiscovery system  can ensure that the customer premise equipment  is assigned its allocated level of service when the customer premise equipment  next communicates with the directory server . Hence, after an autodiscovery event occurs with the customer premise equipment , the autodiscovery system  need not directly communicate with the customer premise equipment  but may instead rely on the directory server  to properly update the customer premise equipment  with the proper authorization credentials, level of service identifiers, or other information. After updating the directory server , the directory server  may send an acknowledgment confirmation to the provisioning system kernel  that the updating procedure has completed (). Alternatively, the directory server  may send another message to the provisioning system kernel , such as a failure message indicating that the updating procedure has failed or a non-responsive message indicating that the directory server  is unable to complete the updating procedure.","As discussed above with reference to , the directory server  may be implemented as a master directory server and a replica directory server. Where the directory server  is implemented as a master directory server and a replica directory server, the replica directory server may replicate the updated directory information stored in the master directory server. In this implementation, the master directory server may send an acknowledgement confirmation to the provisioning system kernel  after the replica directory server has completed replicating the updating directory information stored in the master directory server. As previously discussed, the replica directory server provides segmented data, and thus smaller sample of data, to be propagated and processed by distributed sub-systems.","After updating the directory server , the provisioning system kernel  may then instruct the DNS\/DHCP server  to re-initialize or reboot the customer premise equipment  via a reboot daemon  stored within the DNS\/DHCP server  (). The reboot daemon  may be implemented in hardware or software and may reside on the DNS\/DHCP server  for communicating reboot commands to the customer premise equipment  issued by the autodiscovery system . As the reboot daemon  is a portable module, the reboot daemon  assists in upgrading the capabilities of a DNS\/DHCP server  that is not configured or designed to perform the reboot of the customer premise equipment . The reboot command sent to the reboot daemon  may include one or more reboot parameters such as the customer premise equipment identifier of the customer premise equipment , a location identifier of the customer premise equipment  or any other reboot parameter. In addition, the reboot command may be issued by one or more modules in communication with the provisioning system kernel , such as the DOCSIS activation module , the message queue access module , the autodiscovery front-end module , or any of the other modules.","Prior, or subsequent to, the reboot of the customer premise equipment , the provisioning system kernel  may activate one or more network services for the customer premise equipment  available from the autodiscovery system  or the telecommunication system provider. In one implementation, the DOCSIS activation module  facilitates the activation and deactivation of network services for the customer premise equipment . As the autodiscovery system  may not have direct access to the customer premise equipment , the DOCSIS activation module  may communicate with the directory server  for the activation and deactivation of network services for the customer premise equipment . In general, activation and deactivation refer to establishing network services with the customer premise equipment . Thus, the customer premise equipment  may be activated for one or more network services, such as a television network programming, but the customer premise equipment  may also be deactivated for one or more network services, such as Internet, telephony, or other network services. The customer premise equipment  may be activated or deactivated for the network services when the customer premise equipment  next communicates with the directory server  after a reboot command is issued by the reboot daemon .","In addition to activating and deactivating network services for the customer premise equipment , the DOCSIS activation module  may also issue commands to the directory server , the DNS\/DHCP server , or the customer premise equipment  that affect the ability of the customer premise equipment  to communicate with the autodiscovery system  or the telecommunication service provider. For example, the DOCSIS activation module  may issue commands that assign or unassign an IP address to the customer premise equipment , reinitialize the customer premise equipment , reboot the customer premise equipment , or any other command that affects the ability of the customer premise equipment  to communicate with the autodiscovery system  or the telecommunication service provider.","Subsequent, or prior to, the customer premise equipment  completing the reboot procedure, the autodiscovery system  may communicate with a conditional access system  to make content credentials available to the customer premise equipment  (). Thus, in response to the autodiscovery event of the customer premise equipment , the autodiscovery system  generates a request for content credentials issuable by the conditional access system . In general, the content credentials identify the network content receivable by the customer premise equipment . The request for content credentials may be sent using one or more modules such as the message queue access module , the broadcast activation module , the message queue provider , or any other modules of the autodiscovery system .","When the conditional access system  receives the request for content credentials, the conditional access system  may communicate the content credentials to a data carousel  accessible by the customer premise equipment . The autodiscovery system  may then confirm that the content credentials are available to the customer premise equipment . For example, the provisioning system kernel  may communicate a confirmation request to the conditional access system  to confirm that the content credentials are available to the customer premise equipment , and the provisioning system kernel  may await the receipt of an acknowledgement confirmation that the content credentials are available to the customer premise equipment . By confirming that the content credentials are available to the customer premise equipment , the autodiscovery system  ensures that the customer premise equipment  does not waste time and resources in attempting to receive content credentials that may not be available. In alternative implementations, the autodiscovery system  may not confirm that the content credentials are available on the data carousel .","As the request for content credentials is sent to the conditional access system  in response to the autodiscovery of the customer premise equipment , the amount of time and resources spent in provisioning the content credentials is significantly reduced. Unlike conventional systems, the transmission of the content credentials to the data carousel  occurs when the autodiscovery system  autodiscovers the customer premise equipment . Hence, the content credentials become available to the customer premise equipment  when the customer premise equipment  is ready to receive content credentials. Thus, the content credentials do not languish on the data carousel  and the limited resources of the data carousel  are not wasted on content credentials for other sets of customer premise equipment that are not ready to receive the content credentials.","After the content credentials are placed on the data carousel , the provisioning system kernel  may notify the customer premise equipment  that the content credentials are available (). Alternatively, or in addition to, the provisioning system kernel , the network notification to the customer premise equipment  may be sent by any one of the modules of the autodiscovery system , such as the autodiscovery front-end module , the message queue access module , or any other module.","Turning next to  is one example of the broadcast activation module  in communication with a message queue access module  of the autodiscovery system  of .

In one implementation, the message queue access module  includes an autodiscovery event topic  that receives autodiscovery events from the autodiscovery back-end module . The back-end module  may include an autodiscovery back-end programming interface  that receives network notifications about the autodiscovery event from the autodiscovery front-end module . Like the broadcast activation programming interface , the autodiscovery back-end programming interface  may be implemented as part of the Java Remote Method Invocation application programming interface.","The message queue access module  notifies the broadcast activation module  when new customer premise equipment  is autodiscovered by the autodiscovery system  via the autodiscovery event topic . For example, the autodiscovery event topic  may post the autodiscovery event to the event receiver module . In turn, the broadcast activation module logic  may process the autodiscovery event and perform one or more operations in response to the autodiscovery event. For example, as discussed with reference to the updating procedure of the database , the broadcast activation module logic  may update a subscriber record stored in the database  with data received as part of the autodiscovery event.","The message queue access module  is also configured to disseminate commands from the broadcast activation module  to one or more modules of the autodiscovery system  or one or more components in communication with the autodiscovery system .
