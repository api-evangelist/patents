{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present application relates to novel substituted annellated pyrimidines, methods of production thereof, use thereof alone or in combinations for treating and\/or preventing diseases and use thereof for the production of medicinal products for treating and\/or preventing diseases, in particular for treating and\/or preventing cardiovascular diseases.","One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitric oxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. The guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The currently known representatives of this family can be divided, both on the basis of structural features and according to the type of ligands, into two groups: the particulate guanylate cyclases that can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases that can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and most probably contain one haem per heterodimer, which is a part of the regulatory centre. This is of central importance for the activation mechanism NO can bind to the iron atom of haem and thus greatly increase the activity of the enzyme. In contrast, haem-free preparations cannot be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also capable of binding to the central iron atom of haem, but stimulation by CO is far less than by NO.","Through the formation of cGMP and the resultant regulation of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays a decisive role in various physiological processes, in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and adhesion, in neuronal signal transmission and in diseases that result from disturbance of the aforementioned processes. In pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system can be suppressed, which can lead for example to high blood pressure, platelet activation, increased cellular proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, arteriosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, myocardial infarction, thromboses, stroke and sexual dysfunction.","A possible NO-independent treatment for such diseases that aims to influence the cGMP signalling pathway in organisms is a promising approach in view of the expected high efficiency with few side-effects.","Up till now, compounds such as organic nitrates, whose action is based on NO, have been used exclusively for therapeutic stimulation of the soluble guanylate cyclase. The NO is formed by bioconversion and activates the soluble guanylate cyclase by acting on the central iron atom of the haem. In addition to the side-effects, the decisive disadvantages of this method of treatment include development of tolerance.","Some years ago, some substances were described that stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly, i.e. without prior release of NO, such as for example 3-(5\u2032-hydroxymethyl-2\u2032-furyl)-1-benzylindazole [YC-1; Wu et al., 84 (1994), 4226; M\u00fclsch et al., 120 (1997), 681]. The newer stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase include inter alia BAY 41-2272, BAY 41-8543 and riociguat (BAY 63-2521) (see e.g. Stasch J.-P. et al., 2006; 5: 755-768; Stasch J.-P. et al., 2009; 4: 853-865. Stasch J.-P. et al., 2011; 123: 2263-2273). Interestingly, some of these sGC stimulators, for example YC-1 or BAY 41-2272, display PDE5-inhibitory action in addition to direct guanylate cyclase stimulation. To maximize the cGMP-pathway, it is pharmacologically desirable to stimulate the synthesis of cGMP and simultaneously inhibit the degradation via PDE-5. This dual principle is especially advantageous pharmacologically (cf. Oudout et al., Eur. Urol. 2011, 60, 1020-1026).","The dual principle is fulfilled, in the sense of the present invention, if the compounds according to the invention display an action on recombinant guanylate cyclase reporter cell lines according to the test under B-2 as minimal effective concentration (MEC) of \u22663 \u03bcm and inhibition of human phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) according to the test under B-6 as IC50<100 nm.","Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) is the name for one of the enzymes that cleave the phosphoric acid ester bond in cGMP, with formation of 5\u2032-guanosine monophosphate (5\u2032-GMP). In humans, phosphodiesterase-5 occurs mainly in the smooth muscles of the cavernous body of the penis (corpus cavernosum penis) and the pulmonary arteries. Blocking of cGMP degradation through inhibition of PDE5 (with for example sildenafil, vardenafil or tadalafil) leads to increased signals of the relaxation signalling pathways and especially to increased blood supply to the cavernous body of the penis and lowering of pressure in the blood vessels of the lung. They are used for treating erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension. In addition to PDE5, there are other phosphodiesterases exclusively cleaving cGMP (Stasch J.-P. et al. 2011).","As stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase, annellated pyrazole derivatives are disclosed in WO 00\/06568 and WO 00\/06569 and carbamate-substituted 3-pyrimidinyl-pyrazolopyridines in WO 03\/095451. 3-Pyrimidinyl-pyrazolopyridines with phenylamide substituents are described in E. M. Becker et al., 1 (13), 2001. WO 2004\/009590 describes pyrazolopyridines with substituted 4-aminopyrimidines for treating CNS disorders. WO 2010\/065275 and WO 2011\/149921 disclose substituted pyrrolo- and dihydropyridopyrimidines as sGC activators. As sGC stimulators, annellated aminopyrimidines are described in WO 2012\/004259 and annellated pyrimidines and triazines in WO 2012\/004258. WO 2012\/28647 discloses pyrazolopyridines with various azaheterocycles for treating cardiovascular diseases.","The problem to be solved by the present invention was to provide novel substances that act as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and inhibitors of phosphodiesterase-5 (dual principle) and have an equal or improved therapeutic profile versus the compounds known from the prior art, for example with respect to their in-vivo properties, for example their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behaviour and\/or their metabolic profile and\/or their dose-effect relation.","The present invention relates to compounds of general formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"45.21mm","wi":"69.93mm","file":"US08859569-20141014-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["L stands for a group #\u2014CRR\u2014(CRR)\u2014#,\n    \n    ","Rstands for \u2014ORor \u2014NRR,\n    \n    ","Rstands for fluorine, chlorine, cyano, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, (C-C)-alkyl, (C-C)-cycloalkyl or (C-C)-alkoxy,","n stands for a number 0, 1 or 2,","Rstands for trifluoromethyl, (C-C)-alkyl, (C-C)-cycloalkyl, phenyl or 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl,\n    \n    "]}},"Compounds according to the invention are the compounds of formula (I) and their N-oxides, salts, solvates and solvates of the N-oxides and salts, the compounds covered by formula (I) with the formulae stated hereunder and their N-oxides, salts, solvates and solvates of the N-oxides and salts and the compounds covered by formula (I) stated hereunder as practical examples and their N-oxides, salts, solvates and solvates of the N-oxides and salts, provided the compounds stated hereunder that are covered by formula (I) are not already N-oxides, salts, solvates and solvates of the N-oxides and salts.","Physiologically harmless salts of the compounds according to the invention are preferred as salts in the context of the present invention.

Certain isotopic variants of a compound according to the invention, such as in particular those in which one or more radioactive isotopes are incorporated, can be useful for example for investigating the mechanism of action or the distribution of active substances in the body; owing to the comparative ease of production and detection, compounds labelled with H- or C-isotopes are particularly suitable for this. Furthermore, the incorporation of isotopes, for example deuterium, can lead to certain therapeutic advantages as a result of increased metabolic stability of the compound, for example a longer half-life in the body or a decrease in the effective dose required; such modifications of the compounds according to the invention can therefore optionally also represent a preferred embodiment of the present invention.

The transmitter housing is fixed intraperitoneally on the abdominal wall musculature and the wound is closed layer by layer.","Postoperatively, an antibiotic is administered to prevent infection (Tardomyocel COMP Bayer 1 ml\/kg s.c.)","Substances and Solutions","Unless described otherwise, the test substances are in each case administered orally by stomach tube to a group of animals (n=6). Corresponding to an application volume of 5 ml\/kg body weight, the test substances are dissolved in suitable solvent mixtures or suspended in 0.5% Tylose.","A group of animals treated with solvents is used as control.","Test Procedure","The present telemetry measuring device is configured for 24 animals. Each test is recorded under a test number (test year month day).","The instrumented rats living in the unit are each assigned their own receiving antenna (1010 Receiver, DSI).","The implanted transmitters can be activated from outside by an in-built magnetic switch. They are switched to transmission at the start of the tests. The signals emitted can be recorded online by a data acquisition system (Dataquest\u2122 A.R.T. for WINDOWS, DSI) and processed appropriately. The data are saved in each case to a folder opened for this, which bears the test number.","In the standard procedure, the following are measured, in each case for 10 seconds:\n\n","Recording of the measured values is repeated at 5-minute intervals under computer control. The source data recorded as absolute value are corrected in the diagram with the currently measured barometric pressure (Ambient Pressure Reference Monitor; APR-1) and saved in individual data. Further technical details can be found in the extensive documentation of the manufacturer (DSI).","Unless described otherwise, the test substances are administered on the test day at 09.00 hours. Following application, the parameters described above are measured for 24 hours.","Evaluation","After the end of the test, the individual data recorded are sorted with the analysis software (DATAQUEST\u2122 A. R.T.\u2122 ANALYSIS). The 2 hours before application are taken as the blank value here, so that the selected data set comprises the period from 07:00 hours on the test day to 09:00 hours on the next day.","The data are smoothed for a pre-settable time by mean value determination (15-minute average) and transferred as text file to a storage medium. The pre-sorted and compressed measured values are transferred to Excel templates and presented as tables. The data recorded are saved per test day in a specific folder, which bears the test number. Results and test protocols are filed in folders, sorted in paper form by numbers.","Literature","Klaus Witte, Kai Hu, Johanna Swiatek, Claudia M\u00fcssig, Georg Ertl and Bj\u00f6rn Lemmer: Experimental heart failure in rats: effects on cardiovascular circadian rhythms and on myocardial \u03b2-adrenergic signaling.

Determination of Pharmacokinetic Parameters after Intravenous and Oral Administration","The pharmacokinetic parameters of the compounds according to the invention are determined in male CD-1 mice, male Wistar rats and female beagles. Intravenous administration takes place in mice and rats using a species-specific plasma\/DMSO formulation and in dogs using a water\/PEG400\/ethanol formulation. Oral administration of the dissolved substance by stomach tube is carried out in all species on the basis of a water\/PEG400\/ethanol formulation. To simplify collection of blood, prior to administration of the substance the rats are fitted with a silicone catheter in the right vena jugularis externa. The operation is performed at least one day before the test under isoflurane anaesthesia and with administration of an analgesic (atropine\/Rimadyl (3\/1) 0.1 mL s.c.). Blood collection (as a rule more than 10 time points) takes place in a time window that includes terminal time points from at least 24 to max. 72 hours after administration of the substance. On collection, the blood is led into heparinized tubes. Then the blood plasma is obtained by centrifugation and optionally stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until further processing.","An internal standard (which can also be a chemically unrelated substance) is added to the samples of the compounds according to the invention, the calibration samples and the qualifiers and then protein precipitation is carried out using acetonitrile in excess. After adding a buffer solution, which is suitable for the LC conditions, and then vortexing, centrifugation is carried out at 1000 g. The supernatant is measured by LC-MS\/MS using C18-reversed-phase columns and variable eluent mixtures. The substances are quantified on the basis of the peak heights or areas from extracted ion chromatograms of specific selected ion monitoring experiments.","The pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC, C, t(terminal half-life), MRT (mean residence time) and CL (clearance) are calculated from the plasma concentration-time curves obtained by means of validated pharmacokinetics software.","As substance quantification takes place in plasma, the blood\/plasma distribution of the substance must be determined for appropriate adjustment of the pharmacokinetic parameters. For this, a defined amount of the substance in heparinized whole blood of the corresponding species is incubated for 20 min in the tumbling roller mixer. After centrifugation at 1000 g, the concentration of the plasma is measured (by LC-MS\/MS; see above) and the C\/Cvalue is determined by finding the quotient.","B-5. Investigation of Metabolism","To determine the metabolism profile of the compounds according to the invention, these are incubated with recombinant human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, liver microsomes or with primary fresh hepatocytes of various animal species (e.g. rat, dog) as well as of human origin, in order to obtain and compare information on hepatic phase I and phase II metabolism that is as complete as possible and on the enzymes involved in metabolism.","The compounds according to the invention were incubated at a concentration of about 0.1-10 \u03bcM. For this, stock solutions of the compounds according to the invention with a concentration of 0.01-1 mM were prepared in acetonitrile, and then pipetted at 1:100 dilution into the incubation preparation. The liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with and without NADPH-generating system, consisting of 1 mM NADP, 10 mM glucose-6-phosphate and 1 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Primary hepatocytes were also incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in suspension in Williams E medium. After an incubation time of 0-4 h, the incubation assays were stopped with acetonitrile (final concentration approx. 30%) and the protein was centrifuged off at approx. 15000\u00d7g. The samples stopped in this way were either analysed directly or were stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until analysis.","The analysis takes place by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and mass-spectrometry detection (HPLC-UV-MS\/MS). For this, the supernatants of the incubation samples are chromatographed with suitable C18-reversed-phase columns and variable eluent mixtures of acetonitrile and 10 mM aqueous ammonium formate solution or 0.05% formic acid. The UV chromatograms in conjunction with mass-spectrometry data serve for identification, structure elucidation and quantitative estimation of the metabolites, and the quantitative metabolic decrease of the compound according to the invention in the incubation assays.","B-6. Inhibition of Human Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5)","PDE-5 preparations are obtained from human platelets by lysis (Microfluidizer\u00ae, 800 bar, 3 passages), followed by centrifugation (75000 g, 60 min, 4\u00b0 C.) and ion-exchange chromatography of the supernatant on a Mono Q 10\/10 column (linear sodium chloride gradient, elution with a 0.2-0.3M solution of sodium chloride in buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.2, 2 mM magnesium chloride). Fractions that have PDE-5 activity are combined (PDE-5 preparation) and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C.","For determining their in-vitro action on human PDE-5, the test substances are dissolved in 100% DMSO and serial dilutions are prepared. Typically, dilution series (1:3) from 200 \u03bcM to 0.091 \u03bcM are prepared (resultant final concentrations in the test: 4 \u03bcM to 0.0018 \u03bcM). In each case 2 \u03bcL of the diluted solutions of the substance are put in the wells of microtitre plates (Isoplate-96\/200W; Perkin-Elmer). Then 50 \u03bcL of a dilution of the PDE-5 preparation described above is added. The dilution of the PDE-5 preparation is selected so that during subsequent incubation less than 70% of the substrate is reacted (typical dilution: 1:100; dilution buffer: 50 mM Tris\/hydrochloric acid pH 7.5, 8.3 mM magnesium chloride, 1.7 mM EDTA, 0.2% BSA). The substrate [8-H]cyclic guanosine-3\u2032,5\u2032-monophosphate (1 \u03bcCi\/\u03bcL; Perkin-Elmer) is diluted 1:2000 with assay buffer (50 mM Tris\/hydrochloric acid pH 7.5, 8.3 mM magnesium chloride, 1.7 mM EDTA) to a concentration of 0.0005 \u03bcCi\/\u03bcL. The enzyme reaction is finally started by adding 50 \u03bcL (0.025 \u03bcCi) of the diluted substrate. The test preparations are incubated for 60 min at room temperature and the reaction is stopped by adding 25 \u03bcL of a suspension of 18 mg\/mL of Yttrium Scintillation Proximity Beads in water (phosphodiesterase beads for SPA assays, RPNQ 0150, Perkin-Elmer). The microtitre plates are sealed with film and left to stand for 60 min at room temperature. Then the plates are measured for 30 s per well in a Microbeta scintillation counter (Perkin-Elmer). ICvalues are determined on the basis of the graphs plotted of the substance concentration versus the percentage PDE-5 inhibition.","Representative ICvalues for the compounds according to the invention
