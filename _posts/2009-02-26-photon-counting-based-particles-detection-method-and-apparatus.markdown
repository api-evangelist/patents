{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/032,615, filed Feb. 29, 2008.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.","This document relates to detection of aerosols by illumination with ultraviolet radiation.","It is well known that biological materials and organisms fluoresce under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. UV light in the 380 nanometer (nm) wavelength range, for example, excites biological metabolic products such as Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, which is a coenzyme found in most living cells, and flavins, a group of organic compounds based on pteridine, to fluoresce. Higher energy UV, such as light in the 260 nanometer wavelength range, excites proteins. Since vegetative and spoor forms of bacteria contain these biochemicals, the bacteria will also fluoresce when irradiated with UV light. If these biological molecules are present in an aerosol exposed to UV light, they will also scatter part of the excitation light. Both the fluorescent and scattered light can be detected using existing light detectors such as a Photomultiplier Tube (PMT). The presence of both the fluorescent and scattered signal can be used to detect the presence of biological materials or organisms.","Some devices exploit this phenomenon to detect biological aerosol. These detectors typically use a pump to pull in ambient air containing the biological aerosols into some optical interrogation volume. An irradiative UV light, typically from a laser, light emitting diode or xenon lamp, is directed to the particles. The presence of biological particles in the optical interrogation volume will produce fluorescent and scattered photons. These photons are detected using a PMT or equivalent optical detector to produce an electrical signal. The relevant and absolute magnitude of this detected signal can be used to determine the presence of a biological particle. Since differing excitation wavelengths may be used to detect different classes of biological molecules, the excitation wavelength can be chosen to detect specific classes of biological molecules such as proteins, flavinoids, and metabolite products.","A biological aerosol detector of the type described above is described in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 7,375,348, which is incorporated herein by reference.","Biological aerosol detectors are typically placed in locations where the potential for a biological attack or industrial accident exists. Under operating conditions, these detectors can be expected to continuously collect data for long periods of time, such as days, weeks, or months. The data is expected to consist largely of background signals and events, and to reflect the absence of signal events that indicate the presence of biological particles. To be effective under such operating conditions, biological aerosol detectors must be able to accurately and efficiently detect biological particles in an aerosol sample even when the particles are only present for relatively short periods of time within much longer observation periods.","Biological aerosol detectors typically detect the presence of particles using some form of peak detection algorithm. Peak detection algorithms, as their names imply, detect peaks in a data stream that rise above a background signal level, and that are indicative of signal events. There are a number of challenges in applying existing peak detection algorithms to biological aerosol detection. Photon detectors are susceptible to background noise, there is significant variability across detectors even when the detectors are from the same manufacturer and are of the same model, and detectors drift over time, temperature, and humidity conditions.","Accordingly, what is needed is a method of detecting biological aerosols using a photon counting technique that possesses a greater level of noise immunity, compensates for the variability across detectors, and mitigates detector drift. Also needed is a method to prevent over counting of biological particles that would otherwise result when photon signals produced from a single particle are distributed into more than one sampling bin.","A method of detecting biological aerosols using a photon counting technique receives two channels of signals, a first channel indicative of a fluorescent photon count and a second channel indicative of a scattered photon count. Each photon count represents the number of photons detected in a time-based sampling bin. The method updates counting variables comprising the mean and standard deviation of photon counts across the sampling bins for each channel; calculates sigma values using the photon count and counting variables for each channel; performs a Schmitt trigger operation using the sigma value and mean to produce a Schmitt trigger count for each channel; counts the number of trigger counts over a set period of time, and alarms when one or more of the trigger counts exceed a specified threshold.","Aspects of the invention may include one or more of the following. A coincident Schmitt trigger may be determined and counted when Schmitt triggers occur at the same time in both channels. The alarm may be conditioned on a Schmitt trigger count that exceeds a specified threshold for the fluorescent channel, scattered channel, coincident count, or any combination thereof. A further condition for an alarm may be that the threshold is defined as a number of standard deviations above the mean. An additional condition may be that the ratio of fluorescent to scattered trigger counts must exceed a threshold.","The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.","A method  for detecting biological aerosols using a photon counting technique to determine the presence of biological particles is shown in . This process is performed in parallel for both the fluorescent and scattered light signals obtained from a detection device of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,375,348. This process can be applied and utilized with a wide range of other detectors as illustrated by the description below.","At step  the counting variables are reset to initial values. Typical counting variables and initial values are provided in reference to Table 1. The photon count for a preset period of time within a sampling bin, such as 200 microsecond (\u03bcs) in this illustration, is obtained at step . This is also referred to herein as a time-based sampling bin. This choice of sampling duration to define a bin is dependent on both the speed of the signals to be processed as well as the hardware being used. The photon signals are very fast with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of about 4 nanosecond (ns). In the detection device described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,375,348, current pulses from the scattered and fluorescence PMTs are amplified and converted to a voltage pulse. These signals are not digitized directly to avoid sampling rates in excess of 500 millihertz (MHz). Instead, the voltage pulse is directed towards a comparator which determines that a photon signal is present when a voltage threshold is exceeded. Typical values used for these thresholds are provided below. The comparator output is directed to a digital counter clocked at 1 MHz such that one or more photon signals within a microsecond results in a photon count. This counter is cycled every 200 \u03bcs so that the resulting output from both detector channels is the number of photon counts per 200 \u03bcs bin.","In this illustration, the process steps in the flowchart of  from step  to step  are repeated 5,000 times corresponding to 5,000 sample bins. For a 200 \u03bcs bin, 5,000 iterations correspond to a total elapsed time of 1 second. These variables can be adjusted for a given device or application by changing either the bin size, the number of samples taken before moving to step , or both.","After the photon count is obtained at step , the counting variables are updated at step  using the new photon count data for the most recent sampling bin. By way of example, the photon count cumulative value is obtained by adding the photon count from the current sampling bin to the previous cumulative value. A value referred to as the sigma value or with the symbol a is then calculated at step  based upon the photon count, mean, and standard deviation.","At step  a trigger variable is checked to determine if it is set as true or false. That is, the trigger is a binary variable used to perform the logical operation illustrated at step . A triggering method, referred to as a Schmitt trigger, is used to prevent over counting of biological particles that would otherwise result when photon signals produced from a single particle are distributed into more than one sampling bin. The Schmitt trigger, which is a comparator with positive feedback, also provides greater stability and noise immunity.","In the case that the trigger is false, the a value is compared to a predefined high threshold value, \u03c3, at step . If the a value exceeds the threshold value, \u03c3, the Schmitt count, also referred to herein as the trigger count or Schmitt trigger count, is incremented by one at step . If this condition is not satisfied, corresponding to a false outcome at step , the Schmitt count remains at its prior value. In the case that the trigger is true, the \u03c3 value is compared to the predefined low threshold value, \u03c3, at step . If the a value drops below the threshold value, \u03c3, the trigger is reset at step  to false. If this condition is not satisfied, corresponding to a false outcome at step , the trigger value remains at its current state. As this Schmitt trigger count operation is performed simultaneously for both the fluorescent and scattered photon channels, a coincident Schmitt trigger count can be determined to reflect the number of times that Schmitt triggers occurred in both channels simultaneously. That is, the coincident trigger count is incremented when the trigger counts for both the fluorescent and scattered photon channels are incremented, but is not incremented if either or both of the trigger counts for the two channels are not incremented.","Typical values for \u03c3are 4 multiples of the standard deviation over the mean for the scattered photon count and 8 multiples of the standard deviation over the mean for the fluorescent photon count. Typical values of \u03c3are 2 multiples of the standard deviation over the mean for both fluorescent and scattered. These values were determined empirically using the device described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,375,348 under various test conditions.","At step , the number of sample iterations representing the processing of individual 200 \u03bcs sampling bins is checked. If the number of iterations has yet to reach a predetermined value, which in this illustration is established as 5000 sampling bins, then the operation returns to step . If the condition at step  is true, corresponding to the processing of the predetermined number of sampling bins, then at step  the counting statistics are updated, including the mean and standard deviation.","At step , the history function illustrated in  is performed. Upon return from this routine or loop, the alarm function is performed at step , which is further illustrated in . Upon completion of the alarm function of step , operation is returned to step  where the process is repeated.","As will be described more fully below, the logic for alarming is based on the detection of sudden changes or deviations in the trigger counts above given thresholds. The thresholds are determined by averaging the trigger counts with a rolling average over a set time, such as 30 seconds, 1 minute, several minutes, or more. An alarm is based on several conditional events occurring within the same sample time interval, one second in this illustration, in comparison to the historical data. Just as the length of the historical data can be varied, so too can the comparison sample interval by changing either the sample bin size or number or iterations performed as described above.","Turning to , a history loop  is illustrated for calculating and storing historical data. At step , the current Schmitt count is obtained from the main loop illustrated in . This value of the current Schmitt count is stored in memory at step  and alarm statistics are updated at step  to include the new mean and standard deviation of the stored Schmitt count data. A history buffer with a predefined size can be used by replacing the oldest Schmitt count value with the newest Schmitt count value once the buffer becomes full. In this way, adequate history data are maintained while limiting the size of the buffer. Performance does not suffer as the older data are less relevant and could even produce an incorrect alarm outcome if kept too long and given the same weight as the more current data. The history loop ends at step , returning to the main loop illustrated in .","Turning to , an alarm function  is illustrated. Note that trigger count is used in  and elsewhere as a synonymous term for Schmitt count or Schmitt trigger count. Alarm conditions are provided for both indoor and outdoor applications. As detectors can easily be equipped with a physical or software switch for the user to designate whether the device is being used in an indoor or outdoor environment, both functions can be preset in the device. The user can thus select an indoor or outdoor operating mode without the need for any additional input.","Starting With the illustration for indoor use, at steps , , and , three conditions are established for an alarm to be triggered as follows. The value of one of the trigger counts must exceed a predefined minimum number, such as 300; its value or that of another trigger count must exceed a significant increase over the time-averaged mean at step , illustrated here as 4.8\u03c3; and the ratio of trigger counts for fluorescent over trigger counts for scattered must exceed a predefined ratio at step , which is illustrated here as 0.5. For example, the trigger count used in step  may be the coincident trigger count and the trigger count used in step  may be the fluorescent trigger count. This combination aids in preventing the over counting of biological particles that would otherwise result when photon signals produced from a single particle are distributed into more than one sampling bin or as the result of signal noise.","The AND function at step  produces a true outcome if all three of these conditions are met and a false outcome otherwise. At step , a true outcome from step  will trigger the alarm at step  while a false outcome will proceed to step  for a no alarm condition.","Steps , , and  provide values that are typical for outdoor use. Here, the value of the trigger count for one of the triggers must exceed a similarly predefined minimum number, such as 100; its value or that of another trigger count must exceed a significant increase over the time-averaged mean at step , illustrated here as 3\u03c3 for the outdoor application; and the ratio of trigger counts for fluorescent over trigger counts for scattered must exceed a predefined ratio at step , which is illustrated here as 0.5. The trigger count used in step  may be the coincident trigger count and the trigger count used in step  may be the fluorescent trigger count. This combination aids in preventing the over counting of biological particles that would otherwise result when photon signals produced from a single particle are distributed into more than one sampling bin or as the result of signal noise. The subsequent process steps of , , , and  serve the same function as those described above for the indoor application.","As illustrated above, there are several conditions required to activate an alarm as taught herein. The trigger count must rise quickly compared to the historic background data. A fast increase would typically be expressed as a 3\u03c3 change over the mean for an outdoor applications and a 4.8\u03c3 change over the mean for indoor applications. The fluorescent and scattered responses must also have a reasonable distribution ratio. For example, if there is an extremely high scattered signal compared to the florescent response, this is typically viewed as an interferent signal and the alarm should therefore be overruled. Finally, the change in trigger count value must exceed some minimal value. This is to prevent false alarms due to extremely small signals corresponding to very clean environments.","Having described the invention above using reference to flowcharts, pseudocode modules are provided in Tables 1-3 to further illustrate the invention.","Table 1 illustrates a pseudocode module for one embodiment of the main loop of the process corresponding to the flowchart of . This loop is executed for both the scattered and fluorescent channels. The following values are based on testing of the device described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,375,348 under various conditions. Typical values found to work well are as follows. For fluorescence data the SigmaHighThreshold is typically established at 8. The SigmaLowThreshold is typically 2 based on observed data. For scattered data, the SigmaHighThreshold is typically 4 and the SigmaLowThreshold is typically 2. The variable n is typically 5000. This represents one second of data with counts provided every 200 microseconds. This value was determined empirically and is also a function of the available memory onboard the central processing unit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Main Loop"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"REPEAT"},{"entry":"\u2002SET Sum, SumSquared, and SchmittCount to zero"},{"entry":"\u2002SET HighLatch to FALSE"},{"entry":"\u2003REPEAT"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002GET PhotonCount"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002Sum \u2190 Sum + PhotonCount"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002SumSquared \u2190 SumSquared + PhotonCount{circumflex over (\u2009)}2"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002IF Mean and StandardDeviation have been calculated"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003Sigma = (PhotonCount \u2212 Mean)\/StandardDeviation"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003IF HighLatch is FALSE"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002IF Sigma > SigmaHighThreshold"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003SET HighLatch to TRUE"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003INCREMENT SchmittCount"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002END IF"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003ELSE IF HighLatch is TRUE"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002IF Sigma < SigmaLowThreshold"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003SET HighLatch to FALSE"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002END IF"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003END IF"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002END IF"},{"entry":"\u2002UNTIL n sequential PhotonCounts have been read"},{"entry":"\u2002Mean \u2190 Sum\/n"},{"entry":"\u2002StandardDeviation \u2190 sqrt(SumSquared\/(n-1) \u2212 n\/(n-1)*Mean{circumflex over (\u2009)}2)"},{"entry":"\u2002GOTO HistoryLoop"},{"entry":"UNTIL system is shut down"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Table 2 illustrates a pseudocode module for one embodiment of the history loop of the process.

On the 19sample, the Sigma value for the photon count again exceeds the high threshold and increments the Schmitt count accordingly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIGS. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","b ","a "],"b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"315pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 4"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Sample Data"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"315pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Statistics from previous n Samples:"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"126pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Scattered","Fluorescence"]},{"entry":["Mean","8.13","0.81"]},{"entry":["Standard Deviation","1.75","2.76"]},{"entry":["SigmaHighThreshold","4","7"]},{"entry":["SigmaLowTreshold","2","2"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Sample Calculations:",{},{}]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Scattered","Fluorescence"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"11"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"11","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Photon",{},"Sum",{},"Schmitt","Photon",{},"Sum",{},"Schmitt"]},{"entry":["Sample","Count","Sum","Squared","Sigma","Count","Count","Sum","Squared","Sigma","Count"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"11","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["1","1","1","1","\u22124.1",{},"1","1","1","0.1",{}]},{"entry":["2","3","4","10","\u22122.9",{},"0","1","1","\u22120.3",{}]},{"entry":["3","10","14","110","1.1",{},"1","2","2","0.1",{}]},{"entry":["4","8","22","174","\u22120.1",{},"0","2","2","\u22120.3",{}]},{"entry":["5","17","39","463","5.1","1","25","27","627","8.8","1"]},{"entry":["6","18","57","787","5.6",{},"21","48","1068","7.3",{}]},{"entry":["7","16","73","1043","4.5",{},"23","71","1597","8.0",{}]},{"entry":["8","12","85","1187","2.2",{},"7","78","1646","2.2",{}]},{"entry":["9","14","99","1383","3.4",{},"9","87","1727","3.0",{}]},{"entry":["10","14","113","1579","3.4",{},"8","95","1791","2.6",{}]},{"entry":["11","13","126","1748","2.8",{},"16","111","2047","5.5",{}]},{"entry":["12","17","143","2037","5.1",{},"21","132","2488","7.3",{}]},{"entry":["13","20","163","2437","6.8",{},"24","156","3064","8.4",{}]},{"entry":["14","4","167","2453","\u22122.4",{},"0","156","3064","\u22120.3",{}]},{"entry":["15","9","176","2534","0.5",{},"0","156","3064","\u22120.3",{}]},{"entry":["16","13","189","2703","2.8",{},"7","163","3113","2.2",{}]},{"entry":["17","12","201","2847","2.2",{},"7","170","3162","2.2",{}]},{"entry":["18","11","212","2968","1.6",{},"1","171","3163","0.1",{}]},{"entry":["19","16","228","3224","4.5","2","26","197","3839","9.1","2"]},{"entry":["20","18","246","3548","5.6",{},"22","219","4323","7.7",{}]},{"entry":["21","4","250","3564","\u22122.4",{},"0","219","4323","\u22120.3"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"11","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The invention can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations thereof.
