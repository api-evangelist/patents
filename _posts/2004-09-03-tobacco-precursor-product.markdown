title: Tobacco precursor product
abstract: The present invention relates to methods for hindering formation of tobacco-specific nitrosamines during processing of dark fire tobacco, as well as a facility in which at least portions of these methods may be conducted. According to the present invention, dark fire tobacco that has been harvested and that is generally green and/or yellow is exposed to an uncontrolled, yet active, ambient airflow so as to provide a substantially aerobic environment about the tobacco. This exposure of the dark fire tobacco to the ambient airflow may be done until the tobacco is substantially brown and/or substantially free of enzymatic activity. Subsequently, the tobacco is exposed to gaseous emissions (e.g., smoke) from combusting sawdust/wood. This step may be conducted at least until the tobacco exhibits a moisture content of no more than about 16% and/or until the tobacco exhibits a gloss or shine on a surface of the tobacco.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT REGARDING SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","REFERENCE TO A MICROFICHE APPENDIX","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","EXAMPLES"],"p":["Not applicable.","Not applicable.","The present invention generally relates to tobacco products, and more particularly to methods for hindering formation of tobacco-specific nitrosamines in the manufacture of tobacco products and the products made thereby.","In recent years, various attempts have been made to hinder, or ideally, substantially prevent formation of nitrosamines in tobacco products. Further, a number of attempts have been made to prevent exposing tobacco users to nitrosamines. For example, numerous filters have been employed in smoking tobacco products to at least generally attempt to filter out some of these nitrosamines. However, these efforts have not proved beneficial in smokeless tobacco products.","By way of introduction, fresh-cut, green tobacco has effectively no nitrosamines associated therewith. However, this fresh-cut, green tobacco is generally unsuitable for smoking and\/or use in smokeless tobacco products such as chewing tobacco and\/or snuff. In contrast, cured tobacco products manufactured in conventional manners are known to contain a number of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) such as N\u2032-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), 4-(N-nitrosomethylamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), N\u2032-nitrosoanatabine (NAT), and N\u2032-nitrosonoanabasine (NAB).","The above-mentioned TSNAs are believed to be formed at least generally post-harvest, such as during and\/or after conventional curing processes. More particularly, it is believed that an amount of TSNAs in a cured tobacco plant is at least generally dependent upon a presence of nitrites that accumulate on the plant during senescence (e.g., process of aging from full maturity to death of the tobacco plant's cells). Moreover, these TSNAs are believed to be formed during curing at least in part due to a chemical reduction of nitrates facilitated or at least generally catalyzed by exposure of the tobacco to an at least generally anaerobic (oxygen deficient) environment. This reduction of nitrates to nitrites is believed to occur via metabolic processes of micro flora, and more particularly, microbial nitrate reductase activity, associated with the tobacco plant under at least generally anaerobic conditions. The existence of such an at least generally anaerobic condition around the tobacco plant may be fostered by the fact that tobacco plants typically emit carbon dioxide during at least part of the curing process. Indeed, the reduction of nitrates to nitrites has been found to be particularly pronounced under humid conditions in which it is believed that the increased humidity increases a microbial load on the plant. In any event, once these nitrites are formed, the same are believed to combine with various tobacco-associated alkaloids, such as certain pyridine-containing compounds, in a process known as \u201cnitrosation\u201d to form nitrosamines such as those mentioned above.","One conventional method of curing tobacco, known as \u201cflue curing,\u201d at least generally involves placing tobacco plants, or at least the leaves thereof, in a curing barn and exposing the tobacco to convective heat in the form of one or more hot gaseous streams that includes combustion exhaust gases. When such convective heat is used to dry the tobacco, the combustion exhaust gases, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen (e.g., NO), and water are introduced to and may even be said to pass at least generally through the tobacco. It has been shown that exposure of the tobacco to such combustion gases during curing may produce tobacco specific nitrosamines through reactions of tobacco alkaloids with alternative nitrosating agents.","Another conventional curing method includes a variation of a flue curing process in which a heat exchanger is utilized. More particularly, fuel is burned to heat air, and the heated air is passed through flue pipes into a curing barn in which the tobacco plants are disposed. This generally results in a flow of heated air that passes through the curing barn. Moreover, this process utilizes primarily radiant heat emanating from the flue pipes to heat the air, thus substantially preventing exposure of the tobacco to combustion exhaust gases during curing.","Still another conventional curing method known as \u201cair curing\u201d generally involves placing the harvested tobacco plants in a curing barn and subjecting the plants to ambient air curing. This curing method is typically accomplished with little or no governance of environmental conditions. However, it is known to at least generally regulate airflow to at least roughly affect temperature and\/or humidity in the curing barn.","Yet still another conventional curing method relates to a specific group of tobacco cultivars known as \u201cdark fire tobaccos.\u201d Typically, these dark fire tobaccos are harvested and hung in a curing barn while the leaves are yellow, green, or a combination thereof. A day or two after the tobacco is hung (and sometimes on the same day), the tobacco is exposed to heat and gaseous emissions (e.g., smoke) from combustion of appropriate materials such as wood and\/or sawdust. This exposure is typically referred to as \u201cdark firing\u201d the tobacco and is generally done for several weeks. When the tobacco has reached a desired finish, the fire is extinguished, and the tobacco is allowed to come into order (or case) and subsequently removed from the barn for further processing. While the exposure of the tobacco to dark fire curing has traditionally been desirable to achieve a preferred flavoring of the tobacco, such conventional dark fire curing methods have not provided (or produced) tobacco products having reduced amounts of TSNAs.","Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a method of treating harvested tobacco that hinders formation of TSNAs. More particularly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of hindering TSNA formation in dark fire tobacco. Relatedly, it is another object of the present invention to provide a method of treating tobacco that hinders nitrate reductase activity in harvested tobacco. Yet another object is to provide a method of treating tobacco that hinders TSNA formation yet allows for exposure of the tobacco to exhaust gases (e.g., smoke) for extended periods of time. Still another object is to provide a method of treating tobacco that provides a resultant dark fire tobacco product exhibiting a low TSNA content. These objectives, as well as others, may be met by the present invention described herein.","A first aspect of the invention is directed to a method of treating harvested tobacco that may at least generally be characterized as including both an ambient air treatment phase and a separate dark fire treatment phase. More particularly, when the tobacco is green, yellow, or a combination thereof, the tobacco is exposed to an ambient airflow substantially devoid of combustion emissions at least until the tobacco is substantially brown. Then, the tobacco is exposed to gaseous emissions from the burning of at least one carbonaceous material, such as wood and\/or sawdust.","Exposing the tobacco to the above-noted ambient airflow may be said to provide a substantially aerobic environment about the tobacco. In one characterization, this ambient airflow may be said to provide a sufficient amount of oxygen to and\/or about the tobacco to substantially prevent metabolic activity of at least one anaerobic microorganism (e.g., those capable of microbial nitrate reductase activity) associated with the tobacco. In another characterization, the above-described ambient airflow may be said to provide enough oxygen to and\/or about the tobacco to hinder or even substantially prevent formation of at least one tobacco-specific nitrosamine. Indeed, the lack of combustion emissions in this ambient airflow may be characterized as airflow that is free of smoke generated from the burning of wood.","The color-change of the tobacco from green and\/or yellow to brown may be attributed to a drying of the tobacco. For instance, in one embodiment, the moisture content of the tobacco may be reduced to no more than about 35% using the ambient airflow. In another embodiment, the moisture content of the tobacco may be reduced to between about 17% and about 35%. Upon drying the tobacco to the desired moisture content, and prior to exposure to any combustion emissions, the tobacco may exhibit a dry nitrosamine content of no more than about 5 ppm, preferably no more than about 4 ppm, more preferably no more than about 3 ppm, and still more preferably no more than about 2 ppm.","Exposing the tobacco to combustion emissions is preferably accompanied by an increase in temperature (relative to the air curing phase of the method) in the environment in which the tobacco is located. As such, this exposure of the tobacco to combustion exhaust gases may be said to facilitate a further drying of the tobacco. In one embodiment, employment of the combustion exhaust gases may result in reducing the moisture content of the tobacco to no more than about 16%. In another embodiment, the moisture content of the tobacco may be reduced to between about 12% and about 16% as a result of this exposure to combustion exhaust gases. After exposing the tobacco to the combustion exhaust gases and drying the tobacco to the desired moisture content, the tobacco may exhibit a dry nitrosamine content of no more than about 10 ppm, preferably no more than about 8 ppm, more preferably no more than about 6 ppm, and still more preferably no more than about 5 ppm. Indeed, in some embodiments, the tobacco may exhibit a lower dry nitrosamine content after exposure to the combustion exhaust gases than the tobacco did after exposure to the ambient airflow and prior to the exposure to the combustion exhaust gases.","After the tobacco has been exposed to combustion exhaust gases, the tobacco may again be exposed to ambient airflow. This subsequent exposure to ambient airflow may be for any appropriate amount of time. For example, in one embodiment, this second exposure to ambient airflow may occur for a time sufficient to increase a moisture content of the tobacco (relative to a moisture content of the tobacco upon completion of the exposing the same to the combustion exhaust gases). Due to this \u201cre-exposure\u201d of the tobacco to an ambient airflow, the tobacco may resultantly exhibit a moisture content of between about 20% and about 25%. In some embodiments, re-exposing the tobacco to the ambient airflow may be characterized as allowing the tobacco come into order or case.","In some embodiments, the application of nitrogen-containing fertilizer to the tobacco (and\/or the ground on which the tobacco grows) is avoided for at least some period prior to a harvesting of the tobacco. This may be said to reduce the amount of nitrates associated with the tobacco after harvest. In other embodiments, fertilizers containing low levels of nitrogen may be utilized to facilitate growth of the tobacco. An example of an appropriate fertilizer having a low level of nitrogen would be one that, when spread according to the manufacturer's guidelines, includes no more than about 200 pounds of actual nitrogen per acre. Use of this type of fertilizer may also reduce the amount of nitrates associated with the tobacco after harvest (relative to tobacco plants grown with the use of fertilizer exhibiting higher levels of nitrogen content).","In the case where fertilizer exhibiting a low level of nitrogen content is utilized, the tobacco may have a moisture content of no more than about 26% after sufficient exposure to the ambient airflow and prior to exposure to the combustion exhaust gases. When the tobacco exhibits such a moisture content, the tobacco may exhibit a dry nitrosamine content of no more than about 3 ppm, preferably no more than about 2 ppm, and more preferably no more than about 1 ppm. Upon completion of exposing the tobacco to combustion exhaust gases for a sufficient time, and upon allowing the tobacco to come into order, the tobacco may exhibit a moisture content of between about 17% and about 26%. Exposure to the combustion exhaust gases tends to further reduce the moisture content of the tobacco. Accordingly, after such exposure to the combustion exhaust gases, the tobacco may exhibit a moisture content of no more than about 17%, and preferably between about 12% and about 17%. After sufficient exposure to the combustion exhaust gases, this tobacco may exhibit a dry nitrosamine content of no more than about 4 ppm, preferably no more than about 3 ppm, more preferably no more than about 2 ppm, yet more preferably no more than about 1 ppm, and even more preferably no more than about 0.75 ppm.","A second aspect of the invention is also directed to a method of treating tobacco. In this second aspect, tobacco that has been harvested and that includes an initial moisture content of no less than about 70% is exposed to an airflow that is substantially devoid of smoke at least until the tobacco includes a moisture content of no more than about 35%. Subsequently, the tobacco is exposed to smoke from smoldering carbonaceous material (e.g., wood and sawdust) at least until the tobacco exhibits a moisture content of no more than about 16%.","The exposure of the tobacco to airflow that is substantially devoid of smoke may be said to hinder formation of tobacco-specific nitrosamine(s) and\/or hinder metabolic activity of one or more anaerobic microorganisms. This is accomplished, at least in part, due to the substantially smoke-free airflow providing an aerobic condition about the tobacco. An example of a suitable aerobic condition is an environment having an gaseous oxygen concentration of at least about 20%.","A third aspect of the invention is directed to a method of treating tobacco in which tobacco that has been harvested is exposed to an airflow sufficient to provide an aerobic condition about the tobacco when it is initially green and\/or yellow at least until the tobacco is substantially brown. The tobacco exhibits a first dry nitrosamine content upon conclusion of this step. Subsequently, the tobacco is exposed to gaseous emissions from a burning of at least one carbonaceous material. The tobacco exhibits a second dry nitrosamine content upon completion of this step that is less than, substantially equal to, or not significantly greater than the first dry nitrosamine content.","Yet a fourth aspect of the invention is directed to a method of treating tobacco in which the tobacco that has been harvested and that is generally green and\/or yellow upon initiation of this step is exposed to an airflow sufficient to provide an aerobic condition about the tobacco for at least about 27 days (e.g., between about 27 days and about 61 days). Subsequently, the tobacco is exposed to exhaust gases from combustion of at least one carbonaceous material for at least about 25 days (e.g., between about 25 days and about 50 days).","Still a fifth aspect of the invention is directed to a method of treating tobacco in which the tobacco that has been harvested and that is generally green and\/or yellow upon initiation of this step is exposed to an airflow sufficient to provide an aerobic condition about the tobacco until the tobacco is substantially free of enzymatic activity. Subsequently, the tobacco is exposed to emissions from a burning of carbonaceous material at least until a surface of the tobacco includes a gloss or shine. This gloss or shine may be said to be attributable to an accumulation of phenols on the surface of the tobacco.","In yet a sixth aspect, the present invention is directed to a tobacco product precursor. Herein, a \u201ctobacco product precursor\u201d generally refers to tobacco that has been harvested and treated in accordance with the present invention, yet prior to a stage at which the tobacco is packaged and\/or distributed for human consumption (e.g., smoking, chewing, snorting, or the like). The tobacco product precursor generally includes at least a portion of a tobacco leaf that is substantially brown and that includes a plurality of phenols on an outer surface thereof. In addition, this tobacco product precursor generally exhibits a dry nitrosamine content of no more than about 5 ppm, preferably no more than about 4 ppm, and more preferably no more than about 3 ppm. Indeed, in some embodiments, the tobacco product precursor may exhibit a dry nitrosamine content of no more than about 2 ppm.","Still a seventh aspect of the invention is directed to a tobacco product precursor including at least a portion of a dark fire tobacco leaf. The dark fire tobacco of this tobacco product precursor is substantially brown and exhibits a dry nitrosamine content of no more than about 2 ppm.","The tobacco product precursor may include tobacco exhibiting any number of appropriate combinations of moisture content and dry nitrosamine content. For instance, some embodiments may exhibit a moisture content of between about 20% and about 27% and\/or a dry nitrosamine content of no more than about 1.5 ppm. Other embodiments may have a moisture content of between about 20% and about 26% and\/or a dry nitrosamine content of no more than about 0.9 ppm. Still other embodiments may exhibit a moisture content of between about 17% and about 26% and\/or a dry nitrosamine content of no more than about 0.8 ppm. Yet other embodiments may have a moisture content of between about 12% and about 18% and\/or a dry nitrosamine content of no more than about 2 ppm.","Various other features and refinements may exist of in relation to the above-disclosed aspects of the present invention. These other refinements and features may exist individually or in any combination. Moreover, each of the various refinements and features discussed herein in relation to one or more of the disclosed aspects of the present invention may generally be utilized by any other aspect(s) of the present invention as well, alone or in any combination.","The present invention will now be described in relation to the accompanying drawings, which at least assist in illustrating the various pertinent features thereof. A number of appropriate structures (e.g., buildings) may be utilized to accomplish one or more of the tobacco treatment processes described herein. Accordingly, various aspects of the invention may be realized utilizing structures exhibiting various shapes, sizes, dimensions, and componential make-ups. For example,  illustrates a curing barn  in which at least portions of one or more of the curing processes described herein may be carried out.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","12","10","12","12","14","16","16","16","16","10","14","10","14","16","10","10","10","68","70","66","16","16"],"i":["a ","c "]},"The curing barn  of  includes a foundation  that is interconnected with and\/or supports a frame  of the curing barn . This foundation  may be made of any appropriate material. For instance, the foundation  may be made of concrete, mason block, and\/or the like. Since the foundation  is generally exposed to heat from combustion, for example, of sawdust  and wood , it is generally preferred that the foundation  be made of combustion resistant material like those mentioned above. Further, this foundation  may exhibit any appropriate dimensions. In , the foundation  has a height  of about 2 feet. In other words, the foundation  extends out (or up) from the floor  by distance of about 2 feet. At least in one embodiment, it may be said that this foundation  provides a benefit of at least generally providing a spacing or separation between any combustible component(s) of the frame  and the wood  and sawdust  combusting on the floor  of the curing barn .","The frame  to which the walls  and the roof  of the curing barn  of  are interconnected may be any appropriate frame structure. In this case, the frame  includes combustion resistant (e.g., metal, concrete, or the like) posts , wooden posts , and wooden beams . More particularly, the combustion resistant posts  are supported by, interconnected with, or even integral with the foundation . Atop of and\/or interconnected with each of these posts  is a wooden post  to which a number of wooden beams  are interconnected. Any manners of fastening the beams  and the posts  to one another may be appropriate. As shown, the beams  are connected with the posts  in a fashion such that the frame  includes a plurality of levels  (e.g., first, second, third, and fourth levels -, respectively). While any of a number of appropriate spacings between adjacent levels (e.g., and ) may exist, the frame  exhibits a spacing  of about 4 feet between adjacent levels. Sticks  from which tobacco  is suspended may be supported by adjacent beams  associated with each of these levels  (see ). The tobacco  may be disposed on these sticks  in any appropriate fashion, and, likewise, the sticks  may be supported by the beams  in any appropriate fashion. For instance, each of the sticks  may extend or pass through one or more tobacco stalks and\/or leaves, and referring to , ends of each stick  may be supported by beams and or by beams and . Incidentally, these sticks  may be made of any appropriate material such as wood, plastic, metal, or the like. Moreover, a variety of appropriate quantities of tobacco may be associated with each stick. For instance, each stick may extend through the stalks of, and thereby support, about six harvested tobacco plants.","Referring to , a plurality of (here, three) roof vents  are associated with the roof  of the curing barn . More particularly, these roof vents  are located at a peak  of the roof . Other curing structures may include one or more roof vents that are not located at a peak of the corresponding roof (if the roof even has a peak). Further, while adjacent roof vents  may be separated by any appropriate distance, the spacing  between adjacent roof vents  (from a portion of one to a corresponding portion of another) of the curing barn  is generally about 10 feet. Referring to , each of these roof vents  includes a door  that is pivotally interconnected (e.g., via a hinge  or the like) with the roof  of the curing barn . The pivotal movement relationship of this door  of the roof vent  relative to the roof  enables an aperture  () of the roof vent  to be exhibit various degrees of occlusion and\/or obstruction as desired. In other words, the door  may be opened as far as desired or disposed in a substantially closed condition. While the aperture  (and thus, the corresponding door ) of each roof vent  may be any appropriate size, the aperture  in  is generally about 4 feet by about 4 feet.","Another component of the roof vent  shown in  is a fan assembly . This fan assembly  is interconnected with the roof  of the curing barn  and may be any appropriate fan assembly . For instance, the fan assembly  utilized in the curing barn  may be an appropriate Dayton model exhaust fan manufactured by Emerson Ventilation Products of Lenexa, Kans. Moreover, the fan assembly  may exhibit any appropriate specifications. For example, the fan assembly  may exhibit a diameter of about 36 inches, a power of about 1.5 horsepower (hp), and\/or an output of about 16,160 cubic feet per minute (CFM). It should be noted that other appropriate curing structures may have one or more roof vents that do not include a fan assembly. Further, some curing structures may be equipped with one or more fan assemblies that are not associated with a roof vent.","Still referring to , interconnected with the door  of each roof vent  is a control assembly . This control assembly  generally includes one or more pulleys , a cable , and a winch . More particularly, one end of the cable  is interconnected with the door  of the roof vent , and another end of the cable  is interconnected with or wrapped about the winch . In at least one embodiment, it may be said that the pulley(s)  is utilized to at least generally prevent contact (e.g., rubbing) of the cable  with the roof  and\/or the wall  of the curing barn . While the cable  may be any appropriate cable, rope, or the like, the illustrated cable  is stainless steel cable having a diameter of about 0.25 inch. Further, while the winch  is shown as being manually operatable (e.g., having a hand crank), a number of other manual, pneumatic, hydraulic, and\/or electronic winches may be utilized in this and\/or other embodiments of the curing barn . In addition, this winch  is shown as being interconnected with the wall of the curing barn . However, other embodiments may exhibit other appropriate locations for the winch .","To open the roof vent , the winch  is turned in a direction to draw more (or at least some) of the cable  about the winch . As seen in , this turning of the winch  causes the cable  to be pulled in the direction indicated by arrow  causing the door  to be pivoted about the hinge  in the direction indicated by arrow . Incidentally, the door  is shown in an open condition in . It should be noted that the open condition of the door  in  is to a degree that it at least generally prevents precipitation (e.g., rain) from entering the curing barn  via the aperture  of the roof vent .","To close the roof vent , the winch  is turned in a direction to let out the cable  from about the winch . This turning of the winch  causes the cable  to at least generally move in a direction substantially opposite that indicated by the arrow  causing the door  to be pivoted about the hinge  in a direction substantially opposite that indicated by the arrow . Accordingly, a degree of occlusion and\/or unobstruction of the aperture  of the roof vent  (via opening and closing the door ) may be controlled utilizing the control assembly . Incidentally, other embodiments may include other appropriate control assemblies for opening and\/or closing one or more doors associated with a roof vent.","Turning to , associated with at least one wall , and here, two opposing walls and , are a plurality of wall vents . These wall vents  may be found at a number of appropriate locations along the walls  of the curing barn . However, it is generally preferred that the wall vents  are disposed toward the floor , yet above the foundation , of the curing barn . While the wall vents  may exhibit any of a number of appropriate designs\/configurations, each of the wall vents  generally includes an airflow passage  and a door  that is pivotally interconnected (e.g., via one or more hinges ) with the corresponding wall  of the curing barn . Each of these doors  may be made of any appropriate material. However, here, the doors  are 2\u00d76 inch (width by thickness) pieces of wood of any appropriate length.","To open one of the wall vents , the door  may be pivoted about the hinge(s)  and relative to the wall  in the direction indicated by arrow  (). To maintain an open position of the door , an object (a brick, stick, etc.) may be utilized to prop the door  open. Alternatively, a chain that is attached to the wall  may be releasably connected to the door  to hold the door  open. By contrast, to close the wall vent , the object utilized to prop the door  open may be removed, and the door  may be pivoted about the hinge(s)  and relative to the wall  in a direction substantially opposite that indicated by the arrow . In embodiments utilizing a chain to keep the doors  open, the chain may be disconnected from the door , and the door  may be allowed to pivot about the hinge(s)  and relative to the wall  in a direction substantially opposite that indicated by the arrow . Other embodiments may exhibit other appropriate manners (e.g., manual and\/or electronic) of opening and closing a wall vent. Incidentally, while the door  of the wall vent  is in an open condition in , it should be noted the open condition of the door  is such that it at least generally prevents precipitation (e.g., rain) from entering the curing barn  via the airflow passage  of the wall vent .","While a number of tobacco varieties may be treated utilizing the curing barn , the curing barn  is preferably constructed to accommodate the curing of dark fire tobacco. Herein, \u201cdark fire\u201d tobacco refers to tobacco varieties that are generally exposed to smoke and\/or exhaust gases from burning\/smoldering carbonaceous material during a curing of the tobacco. Examples of dark fire tobaccos include Narrow Leaf Madole, Improved Madole, Tom Rosson Madole, Newton's VH Madole, Little Crittenden, Green Wood, Little Wood, Small Stalk Black Mammoth, DT 508, DT 518, DT 592, KY 171, DF 911, DF 485, TN D94, TN D950, VA 309, and VA 359. While the exemplary tobacco curing protocol  of  is specifically directed to the curing of dark fire tobacco, the curing protocol  may have application with other tobacco varieties as well. Further, while the curing barn  is utilized in the following description to facilitate understanding of the curing protocol , the following curing protocol  may be accomplished utilizing any of a number of other appropriate curing\/treatment structures.","After the dark fire tobacco  has been harvested, it is preferably placed on the sticks  while in a substantially green condition. In other words, the dark fire tobacco  may exhibit some yellowness, but is preferably significantly more green than yellow. The sticks , having the tobacco  suspended therefrom, are then placed in the curing barn . More particularly, the sticks  are placed so that they are supported by the beams  of the curing barn . Incidentally, for time efficiency and ease of loading, it is generally preferred that the curing barn  be loaded with the sticks  from the top down. In other words, a desired number of the sticks  having tobacco  suspended therefrom are placed on the fourth level of the curing barn  before the third, second, and first levels -are loaded. Incidentally, while not illustrated on the curing barn  of , the curing barn  is generally equipped with at least one access door (that may be any of a number of appropriate doors) to enable at least human access in and out of the curing barn , for example, during loading and\/or unloading of the barn .","The curing protocol  of  includes both an air treatment step  and a separate and distinct dark fire treatment step . Indeed, the air treatment step  may be characterized as a substantially aerobic stage of the curing protocol , and the dark fire treatment step  may be a stage of the curing protocol  characterized by a presence of a significant amount of combustion exhaust gases.","With regard to the air treatment step , after the tobacco  has been loaded into the curing barn , the tobacco  is exposed to an ambient airflow substantially devoid of combustion exhaust gases. Referring to , during this air treatment step  of the curing protocol , the roof vents  and the wall vents  are preferably open (at least to some degree). In addition, the fan assembly  of each corresponding roof vent  is preferably on throughout the entirety of the air treatment step . However, other embodiments of the air treatment step  may not include having the fan assemblies  on throughout the entirety of that step .","Having the fan assemblies  of the curing barn  on while the vents ,  are open causes air to at least generally be drawn into the curing barn  (as indicated by arrow  of ) via the airflow passages  of the wall vents . Upon entering the curing barn  by way of the airflow passages  of the wall vents , the air preferably flows about the tobacco  and (at some point) at least generally toward at least one of the roof vents . The fan assemblies  at least generally assist in directing airflow toward the fan assemblies  as indicated by arrows -of . The fan assemblies  may also be said to assist in directing airflow out of the curing barn  (as indicated by arrows -) via the aperture  of each corresponding roof vent . Other manners and\/or directions of airflow may be appropriate as well.","Another embodiment of the air treatment step  of the protocol  of  includes having the fan assemblies  on for a portion of each day of that step  and off for a portion of each day of that step . More particularly, the fan assemblies  may be on during at least some of the daytime hours and off during at least some of the nighttime hours. For instance, for every 24 hour period, the fan assemblies  may be on from about 10 AM to about 10 PM and off from about 10 PM to about 10 AM the next day. Other patterns and durations of having the fan assemblies  on and off may also be appropriate. A reason for this alternation of having the fan assemblies  on and off is that ozone (O) levels in the atmosphere tend to rise and fall over a 24-hour period. In other words, it is generally beneficial to increase the airflow through the curing barn  when atmospheric ozone levels are higher and to decrease the airflow through the curing barn  when ozone levels are lower.","Referring to , the ozone content of the atmosphere tends to be greatest between the hours of about 11 AM and about 7 PM. Likewise, the amount of ozone in the atmosphere tends to be lowest between about 12 AM and about 9 AM. Indeed, it has been found that increasing airflow through the curing barn  during periods of high atmospheric ozone content and decreasing airflow through the curing barn  during periods of low atmospheric ozone content has a significant affect on hindering TSNA formation. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the fan assemblies  may be on facilitating an active airflow in the curing barn  when atmospheric ozone levels are at least about 50 ppb (parts per billion) and off allowing a passive airflow in the curing barn  when atmospheric ozone levels are at most about 25 ppb. In another embodiment, the fan assemblies  may be on facilitating an active airflow in the curing barn  when atmospheric ozone levels are at least about 45 ppb and off allowing a passive airflow in the curing barn  when atmospheric ozone levels are at most about 30 ppb. In still another embodiment, the fan assemblies  may be on facilitating an active airflow in the curing barn  when atmospheric ozone levels are at least about 40 ppb and off allowing a passive airflow in the curing barn  when atmospheric ozone levels are at most about 35 ppb.","From a generally vertical standpoint, the wall vents  shown in  are preferably disposed below the lowest hanging tobacco  of the first level of the curing barn . This generally enhances the likelihood of providing a sufficient ambient airflow about the tobacco  associated with all four levels -of the curing barn  to promote the desired substantially aerobic condition. In some embodiments of the invention, the rate (and\/or other parameters such as temperature and humidity content) of airflow through the curing barn  may be controlled. However, with regard to the curing barn  of , the airflow may be said to be uncontrolled. A better characterization may be to say that the curing barn  has an active (compared to a passive) airflow therein. That is, the fan assemblies  function to draw air into the curing barn  (via the airflow passages ), to facilitate airflow within the curing barn , and to promote airflow out of the curing barn  (via the apertures  of the roof vents ). However, the airflow within the curing barn  may be said to be uncontrolled since the airflow is generally subject to wind conditions. In other words, even though the conditions of the vents ,  and the fan assemblies  may remain substantially the same from one day to the next, the airflow within the curing barn  may change from one day to the next (as well as during any given day) simply due to outside weather conditions. Further, some airflow both enters and exits the curing barn  via one or more of the wall vents . Still further, since the curing barn  is not constructed in an air tight fashion, airflow may enter and or exit the curing barn  via cracks and\/or gaps (e.g., in the walls and\/or roof) of the curing barn . Yet further, airflow at one location within the curing barn  may significantly differ from airflow at another location within the curing barn . It should be noted that some embodiments of the invention may employ curing structures in which only passive airflows (e.g., no fan assemblies or the like) are utilized in this air treatment step  of the curing protocol .","Exposing the dark fire tobacco  to this ambient airflow may be said to provide a substantially aerobic condition about the tobacco . This ambient airflow may be said to provide a sufficient amount of oxygen to and\/or about the tobacco  to substantially prevent metabolic activity of at least one anaerobic microorganism (e.g., those capable of microbial nitrate reductase activity) associated with the tobacco  and\/or to hinder or even substantially prevent formation of at least one tobacco-specific nitrosamine. Indeed, the lack of combustion exhaust gases in this ambient airflow may be characterized as airflow that is free of smoke generated from the burning of carbonaceous material (e.g., wood and\/or sawdust).","The air treatment step  of the curing protocol  of  is preferably conducted until the tobacco  changes from a green and\/or yellow color to a brown color. This change in color is generally attributed to a drying of the tobacco . Indeed, when this air treatment step  is initiated, the tobacco  preferably exhibits a moisture content of no more than about 70%. Further, the air treatment step  is generally concluded when the moisture content of the tobacco is reduced to no more than about 35%, and preferably between about 17% and about 35%.","The air treatment step  of the curing protocol  may last for any appropriate duration of time. It is generally preferred that the air treatment step  be at least about 27 days in duration, and more preferably between about 27 days and about 61 days in duration. It should be noted, however, that other embodiments may exhibit other appropriate durations for this air treatment step . Factors such as weather conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind, and the like) outside the curing barn  may affect the duration of this air treatment step  of the protocol . In any event, upon completion of this air treatment step , the tobacco  is preferably substantially free of enzymatic activity. Moreover, the tobacco  preferably exhibits a dry nitrosamine content of no more than about 5 ppm (parts per million), more preferably no more than about 4 ppm, still more preferably no more than about 3 ppm, and yet more preferably no more than about 2 ppm.","Subsequent to the above-described air treatment step  of the protocol , a low-burning or smoldering fire is generally provided under the tobacco . The provision of this low-burning fire, and, more importantly, the exposure of the tobacco  to combustion exhaust gases  () emitted therefrom is referred to as the dark fire treatment step  of the curing protocol  of . Referring to , a mound  of carbonaceous material that is disposed on the floor  of the curing barn  is ignited to emit these combustion exhaust gases  (e.g., smoke). In this case, the mound  includes wood  and sawdust . It is generally preferred that the wood  and sawdust  be of a hardwood-type such as one or more of oak, hickory, poplar, maple, and the like. In addition, is some cases, tree bark may also be included in the mound .","Still referring to , it is generally preferred that a height  of the mound  be no greater than the distance from the floor  of the curing barn  to the lowest portion of each airflow passage  of the wall vents . Accordingly, in this embodiment, the height  of the mound  is generally no greater than the height  of the foundation  of the curing barn . This arrangement beneficially prevents undesirable flare ups of the low-burning fire associated with the mound . In other words, this arrangement is utilized to at least generally manage the burn (e.g., rate, temperature, intensity, and\/or the like) of the fire. Incidentally, the roof vents  and the wall vents  of the curing barn  are preferably open (at least to some degree) during the dark fire treatment step  of the curing protocol . However, other embodiments of the dark fire treatment step  may include having one or more of the vents ,  closed during at least a portion of that step . For instance, in the case that weather conditions include significant winds, it may be beneficial to close at least some of the wall vents  to prevent the fire from flaring up and igniting the curing barn . In addition, the fan assembly  of each corresponding roof vent  is preferably off throughout the entirety of the dark fire treatment step . However, other embodiments of the dark fire treatment step  may include having one or more of the fan assemblies  on throughout at least a portion of that step .","The dark fire treatment step  of the curing protocol  is generally characterized by an increase in temperature (relative to the air treatment step ) within the curing barn  as well as a significant increase (relative to the air treatment step ) in the presence of combustion exhaust gases  (e.g., carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides (NO), and carbon dioxide) within the curing barn . Indeed, it is an objective of this dark fire treatment step  to expose the tobacco  to significant amounts of combustion exhaust gases . This is generally done for a variety of reasons. One reason may be to enhance the flavor of the resulting tobacco product. Another reason may be to deposit phenols on the tobacco . Still another reason may be to further dry the tobacco . As stated above, exposing the tobacco  to the combustion exhaust gases  is preferably accompanied by an increase in temperature in the curing barn  that generally results in a further drying of the tobacco . Indeed, the moisture content of the tobacco  is preferably reduced to no more than about 16% during this dark fire treatment step . For instance, the moisture content of the tobacco  may be reduced to between about 12% and about 16% due to this dark fire treatment step .","The dark fire treatment step  of the curing protocol  may last any appropriate amount of time. It is preferred that a duration of the dark fire treatment step  be at least about 25 days. For instance, in some embodiments, this dark fire treatment step  lasts between about 25 days and about 50 days. Further, it is generally preferred that the tobacco  be exposed to the combustion exhaust gases  at least until a surface of the tobacco  exhibits a gloss or shine. Again, this gloss or shine may be said to be attributable to an accumulation of phenols on the surface of the tobacco .","Upon completion of the dark fire treatment step  of the curing protocol , the tobacco  may exhibit a dry nitrosamine content of no more than about 10 ppm, preferably no more than about 8 ppm, more preferably no more than about 6 ppm, and still more preferably no more than about 5 ppm. Indeed, in some embodiments, the tobacco  may exhibit a dry nitrosamine content after the dark fire treatment step  that is lower than the tobacco  after the air treatment step  and prior to the dark fire treatment step .","In an optional, yet preferred, step of the curing protocol , the tobacco  may undergo another air treatment step  after the dark fire treatment step . This air treatment step  may last any appropriate duration of time. It is, however, preferred that this air treatment step  last for a time sufficient to increase a moisture content of the tobacco  (relative to a moisture content of the tobacco  upon completion of the dark fire treatment step ). The roof vents  and the wall vents  of the curing barn  are preferably open during this air treatment step  of the curing protocol . In addition, each of the fan assemblies  of the corresponding roof vents  may be either on or off during the air treatment step .","Due to this \u201cre-exposure\u201d of the tobacco  to the ambient airflow of the air treatment step , the tobacco  preferably resultantly exhibits a moisture content of between about 20% and about 25%. This increase in moisture content of the tobacco  generally provides an added benefit of increased durability of the tobacco . For instance, the tobacco  generally tends to crack and\/or break apart less at a moisture content of between about 20% and about 25% than comparable tobacco  exhibiting a moisture content less than about 20% (e.g., between about 12% and about 16%).","Upon completion of step  (or step  in at least some embodiments) of the protocol , the tobacco  may be referred to as a tobacco product precursor. Again, a \u201ctobacco product precursor\u201d generally refers to tobacco that has been harvested and treated in accordance with the present invention, yet has not been packaged and\/or distributed for human consumption (e.g., smoking, chewing, snorting, or the like). Due, at least in part to the curing protocol , the tobacco product precursor preferably refers to at least a portion of a dark fire tobacco leaf that is substantially brown and that includes a plurality of phenols on an outer surface thereof. In addition, this tobacco product precursor generally exhibits a dry nitrosamine content of no more than about 2 ppm and a moisture content of between about 20% and about 27%.","Other treatments may enhance an effectiveness of the curing protocol . For instance, ascorbic acid treatment of the tobacco (e.g., such as by spraying a 1%, 5%, or 10 ascorbic acid solution on the tobacco) prior and\/or subsequent to harvest may beneficially affect the resultant TSNA content of the tobacco cured using the curing protocol . As another example, pre-harvest treatment of the tobacco with an appropriate plant health regulator such as Messenger\u00ae manufactured by Eden Bioscience Corporation of Bothell, Wash., may also prove beneficial.","The following examples show test results under a variety of conditions. Reference to the curing barn  or a curing facility similar to the curing barn  may be made in the discussion of these results to facilitate understanding of the procedures that coincide with the particular test results. It should, however, be noted that these results may be achieved by employing curing processes of the invention in any of a number of other appropriate curing structures.","With regard to a first curing process, dark fire tobacco (more particularly, Narrow Leaf Madole tobacco) was harvested and, about two days later, housed in a curing barn. The curing barn used in this first curing process had a length (e.g., ) of about 40 feet and a width (e.g., ) of about 30 feet. Further, the curing barn had four tiers (e.g., -), and the tobacco inside the barn was divided into twenty samples of about two or three leaves. Incidentally, each of these samples included tobacco from each of the four tiers of the curing barn. Still further, the barn included seven fan assemblies (e.g., ). More particularly, each of three 36-inch fan assemblies were associated with a corresponding roof vent (e.g. ). The three roof vents were approximately evenly spaced along the peak of the curing barn. Additionally, the curing barn had a 36-inch fan associated with each of the four walls (e.g., ). These wall fans were fitted with doors to allow closure of the corresponding openings (e.g., when not in use). However, while the curing barn include four wall fans, none of the wall fans were on, nor were any of the corresponding doors opened during any portion of the curing process.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"TSNA,","TSNA,"]},{"entry":[{},"Sample","Moisture","as is","Dry"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"1","30.0%","0.54","0.77"]},{"entry":[{},"2","26.6%","1.49","2.03"]},{"entry":[{},"3","44.8%","0.41","0.74"]},{"entry":[{},"4","29.7%","0.42","0.60"]},{"entry":[{},"5","32.8%","0.39","0.58"]},{"entry":[{},"6","36.6%","0.41","0.65"]},{"entry":[{},"7","37.1%","0.96","1.53"]},{"entry":[{},"8","33.4%","0.56","0.84"]},{"entry":[{},"9","29.7%","0.96","1.37"]},{"entry":[{},"10","30.6%","0.40","0.58"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Avg =","0.97"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Std Dev =","0.50"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Max =","2.03"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Min =","0.58"]},{"entry":[{},"11","33.0%","0.79","1.18"]},{"entry":[{},"12","34.4%","0.28","0.43"]},{"entry":[{},"13","33.4%","0.29","0.44"]},{"entry":[{},"14","42.8%","1.84","3.22"]},{"entry":[{},"15","33.2%","0.84","1.26"]},{"entry":[{},"16","35.4%","0.60","0.93"]},{"entry":[{},"17","36.1%","0.64","1.00"]},{"entry":[{},"18","38.6%","1.11","1.81"]},{"entry":[{},"19","40.8%","0.45","0.76"]},{"entry":[{},"20","41.2%","0.32","0.54"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Avg =","1.16"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Std Dev =","0.84"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Max =","3.22"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Min =","0.43"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Approximately one day after housing the tobacco, the fan assemblies associated with the roof were turned on. More particularly, what may be characterized as an air drying portion of the curing process included all three of the roof fans running and the corresponding doors (e.g., ) being open. Again, the doors associated with the wall fans were closed, and the wall fans were not used. Additional ventilation included six-inch high foundation ventilators (e.g., wall vents ) that spanned the substantial length (e.g., ) of the side walls (e.g., ), which were open during the entire drying process. Accordingly, ambient air (the temperature and humidity of which was not manipulated) from outside the curing barn was at least generally circulated through the curing barn via employment of the various venting and fan assemblies. This drying process was allowed to take place for a duration of approximately 27 days. Tobacco-specific nitrosamine (TSNA) levels and moisture levels of each of the samples were then determined as of the completion of this drying portion of the curing process. These levels are provided in Table 1. It should be noted that the TSNA levels of the particular samples is provided in units of parts per million (ppm). Incidentally, samples 1-10 and samples 11-20 are included in separate calculations (e.g., averages, standard deviations) simply because samples 1-10 were housed on a south side of the curing barn during the air drying portion of the curing process, while samples 11-20 were housed on a north side of the curing barn during the air drying portion of the curing.

Another comparison that may be made is in relation to the data of Tables 1-2 versus the data of Tables 5-6. More particularly, the tobacco that was harvested and cured during a later portion of the calendar year (Tables 5-6) tended to exhibit lower TSNA levels that the tobacco harvest and cured during an earlier portion of the calendar year (Tables 1-2). This phenomenon may be due to a lower microbial count associated with the late crop due, at least in part, to lower ambient temperatures during the air drying portion of the curing process. Another factor that may contribute to this phenomenon is that humidity levels of the ambient air tend to be lower in the later portions of the year. These reduced humidity levels may contribute to lower TSNA content by reducing the microbial count of the tobacco.","In the experiments related to Tables 7-8, a fertilizer that was substantially free of nitrogen was the only fertilizer used to treat the Narrow Leaf Madole tobacco prior to harvest.

On average, at least a 50% reduction in TSNA content was realized using tobacco curing processes of the invention associated with Tables 12-13 as compared to the conventional tobacco curing processes associated with Tables 10-11.","Further analysis of Tables 10-13 may be made in regard to other varieties of tobacco. For instance, the finished VA 359 tobacco cured in accordance with the curing process associated with Tables 12-13 exhibited a total average dry TSNA content of only about 5.5 ppm (using the data of samples 31-32 of Table 13 and samples 28-31 of Table 12). Utilizing conventionally cured tobacco as a contrast, the finished VA 359 tobacco of samples 20-24 of Table 10 exhibited a total average dry TSNA content of about 7 ppm. Accordingly, about a 22% reduction in TSNA content was realized using tobacco curing processes of the invention associated with Tables 12-13 as compared to the conventional tobacco curing process associated with Table 10.","Other information worth noting in regard to Table 12 is that samples 17-27 exhibited an average dry TSNA content of only about 1.7 ppm. This is generally believed to be due to a combination of treating the tobacco only with low-nitrogen fertilizer prior to harvest and curing the tobacco in accordance with the process described in relation to Table 12. While the curing process alone provided tobacco having an average dry TNSA content of only about 2.3 ppm, the use of the curing process in combination with a fertilization regimen including only low-nitrogen fertilizer (i.e., less than about 200 units\/acre) provided tobacco having an average dry TSNA content of only about 1.7 ppm. In other words, this combination of low-nitrogen fertilizer treatment and a curing process of the invention may (at least as the data associated with Table 12 shows) provide tobacco exhibiting an average dry TSNA content that is about 27% less than that achieved by the curing process alone.","Table 14 shows data relating to another curing experiment. A conventional fertilizer was utilized to treat Narrow Leaf Madole tobacco at one or more times prior to harvest. The tobacco was harvested and housed in a curing barn about two days after harvest. Incidentally, the curing barn used in this experiment was similar to the curing barn used to cure the tobacco associated with Tables 12-13. The same day the tobacco was housed, the fan assemblies of the curing barn were turned on. More particularly, this air drying portion of the curing experiment included five of the roof fans running and the corresponding doors (e.g., ) being open. The foundation ventilators (e.g., wall vents ) were also open substantially throughout the air drying portion of the curing process. This air drying of the tobacco was allowed to take place for a duration of approximately 59 days. TSNA levels of the samples of the dried tobacco that were taken from different locations in the curing barn were then determined and are provided toward the left side of Table 14 in units of parts per million (ppm).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0107"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00014","num":"00014"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"10"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 14"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},"%","TSNA","TSNA",{},{},"%","TSNA","TSNA"]},{"entry":["Sample","pH","Moist.","as is","dry","Sample","pH","Moist.","as is","dry"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"10"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","5.25","21.3","0.62","0.79","1","5.07","23.0","1.60","2.08"]},{"entry":["2","5.46","26.4","0.13","0.18","2","5.04","23.1","0.51","0.66"]},{"entry":["3","5.54","25.7","0.13","0.18","3","5.19","20.6","0.44","0.55"]},{"entry":["4","5.29","24.1","0.13","0.18","4","5.08","20.0","0.50","0.63"]},{"entry":["5","5.32","25.2","0.17","0.23","5","5.10","21.6","0.81","1.03"]},{"entry":["6","5.52","26.1","0.13","0.18","6","5.07","22.1","1.93","2.48"]},{"entry":["7","5.49","25.8","0.13","0.18","7","5.13","20.6","0.59","0.74"]},{"entry":["8","5.56","25.0","0.13","0.18","8","5.16","21.8","0.64","0.82"]},{"entry":["9","5.58","26.8","0.13","0.18","9","5.16","22.9","1.09","1.42"]},{"entry":["10","5.59","23.3","0.13","0.17","10","5.16","22.2","0.40","0.51"]},{"entry":["11","5.84","19.1","0.13","0.16","11","5.37","19.5","0.37","0.46"]},{"entry":["12","5.53","24.0","0.41","0.54","12","5.29","22.4","0.31","0.40"]},{"entry":["13","5.58","26.2","0.12","0.16","13","5.09","20.1","0.41","0.52"]},{"entry":["14","5.60","25.6","0.03","0.04","14","5.21","18.7","0.57","0.70"]},{"entry":["15","5.45","25.0","0.03","0.04","15","5.02","21.1","0.48","0.61"]},{"entry":["16","5.71","24.0","0.03","0.04","16","5.16","19.8","0.39","0.49"]},{"entry":["17","5.68","22.0","0.19","0.24","17","5.17","20.6","0.47","0.59"]},{"entry":["18","5.66","26.4","0.14","0.19","18","5.02","21.2","0.28","0.36"]},{"entry":["19","5.52","25.0","0.26","0.35","19","4.87","23.1","1.13","1.47"]},{"entry":["20","5.66","22.0","0.03","0.03","20","4.88","20.0","0.35","0.44"]},{"entry":["21","5.46","25.0","0.03","0.04","21","4.90","19.7","0.46","0.57"]},{"entry":["22","5.52","24.2","0.03","0.04","22","4.92","22.2","0.30","0.39"]},{"entry":["23","5.58","25.1","0.03","0.04","23","4.91","14.6","0.29","0.34"]},{"entry":["24","5.37","24.3","0.03","0.04","24","4.99","21.2","0.35","0.44"]},{"entry":["25","5.61","26.1","0.03","0.04","25","4.96","21.9","0.38","0.49"]},{"entry":["26","5.67","22.6","1.45","1.88","26","4.92","21.3","2.47","3.14"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Avg =","0.24",{},{},{},"Avg =","0.86"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"StdDev =","0.37",{},{},{},"StdDev =","0.71"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"A dark fire portion of the curing process was initiated upon completion of the air drying portion of the curing process.

In other words, the curing process associated with Table 15 provided a cured, finished tobacco exhibiting almost a 90% reduction in average dry TSNA content relative to the substantially same tobacco cured in accordance with the conventional method associated with Table 16.","The tobacco of samples 25-28 of Table 15 and samples 34-37 of Table 16 was grown utilizing low-nitrogen fertilizer. With regard to these samples, Table 15 provides a cured tobacco with a reduced TSNA content relative to the tobacco cured in the conventional manner described in regard to Table 16. Indeed, the curing process associated with Table 15 provided a cured, finished tobacco exhibiting an average dry TSNA content of samples 25-28 of only about 1.3 ppm. This is significantly lower than the data of Table 16 in which the cured, finished tobacco of samples 34-37 exhibited a total average dry TSNA content of about 5 ppm. In other words, the low-nitrogen fertilizer treatment prior to the curing process associated with Table 15 provided a cured, finished tobacco exhibiting over a 75% reduction in average dry TSNA content relative to the substantially same tobacco that was low-nitrogen fertilizer treated but cured in accordance with the conventional method associated with Table 16.","Incidentally, a number of appropriate manners of determining and\/or quantifying the amount of tobacco-specific nitrosamines of tobacco are known in the art. For example, an alkaline methylene chloride extraction protocol is one known appropriate manner that may be utilized to provide the TSNA content data indicated in Tables 1-16. This protocol at least generally enables one to determine a presence and amount of tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAS) such as N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), N-nitrosoanatabine (NAT), N-nitrosoanabasine (NAB) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) in ground tobacco, leaf tobacco, manufactured tobacco, and tobacco products by gas chromatography.","Summarily, TSNAs may be extracted from tobacco samples with methylene chloride containing sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The extract may then be eluted through a mixed bed of magnesium sulfate and sodium sulfate using methylene chloride, evaporated to near dryness, and reconstituted in chloroform or the like. The individual nitrosamines may then be separated and quantitated by gas chromatography using chemiluminescence detection. Quantification may be performed in any appropriate manner such as by a surrogate internal standard technique.","The examples above assist in illustrating that levels of TSNAs can be varied from crop to crop depending on the amount of nitrite and carbon dioxide present during growing and curing. Conventional dark fire curing methods expose the tobacco to combustion exhaust including NOgases (generally resulting from fuel combustion) while the tobacco is green, yellow, or a combination thereof. Incidentally, these gases are believed to react with alkaloids in the tobacco to form TSNAs. Moreover, tobacco that is green, yellow, or a combination thereof generally exhibits a higher moisture content than tobacco that is substantially brown. This higher moisture content allows for increased absorption of or the ability to take on significant levels of NOgases relative to substantially brown tobacco having a lower moisture content. The present invention effectively eliminates exposing the tobacco to combustion exhaust gases until the tobacco is substantially brown and exhibiting a moisture content of less than about 35%. This practice effectively hinders the ability of the tobacco to take on NOand resultantly provides a dark fired tobacco product precursor exhibiting a desirably low TSNA content.","Those skilled in the art will now see that certain modifications can be made to the methods and apparatuses herein disclosed with respect to the illustrated embodiments, without departing from the spirit of the instant invention.
