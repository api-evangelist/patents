{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to wireless communications, and more particularly relates to testing the interoperability of devices that communicate wirelessly, such as with Bluetooth\u00ae enabled devices.","Short range wireless communication is available on many electronic devices, such as cell phones, microphone and earpiece headsets, laptop computers, desktop computers and is also widely available on many vehicles. Many of these wireless devices are configured with a popular wireless communication package, commonly referred to as Bluetooth\u00ae devices. Bluetooth\u00ae enabled devices are developed and sold by many companies. As a result, the internal implementation of technology employed in the various Bluetooth\u00ae enabled products may vary from one product to another. This often results in problems in trying to ensure the operability of one device wirelessly communicating with another device. In order for developers of devices to ensure proper wireless operation, a large scale interoperability test is generally required.","To perform a large scale interoperability test, developers typically hire outside companies or invest in developing an internal capability to manually test software and hardware associated with their devices' ability to interact with existing or prelaunch hardware. Typically, the interoperability testing is conducted manually by operating individual devices communicating wirelessly with a newly-developed product, such as an entertainment system in a vehicle. This requires purchasing a vast number of devices that may communicate with the entertainment system in the marketplace. As a consequence, the conventional interoperability testing approach requires substantial money and time.","It is therefore desirable to provide for interoperability testing between wireless communication devices that makes the testing more feasible and less costly.","According to one aspect of the present invention, a test apparatus is provided for testing interoperability of a first device to communicate with a second device via wireless communication. The test apparatus includes a wireless interface configured to interface via wireless communication with at least first and second devices. The test apparatus also includes a processor, memory and logic stored in memory and executed by the processor. The logic causes the test apparatus to sequence through a plurality of wireless communication actions to communicate with a first device, monitor behavior of the first device during the actions, and store characteristics of the monitored behavior in memory so that the test apparatus may be used to emulate the first device when wirelessly communicating with a second device.","According to another aspect of the present invention, a method for testing interoperability of a first device to communicate with a second device via wireless communication is provided. The method includes the steps of providing a test apparatus having a wireless interface configured to interface via wireless transmission with at least first and second devices and communicating the test apparatus with at least a first device. The method also includes the steps of causing the test apparatus to sequence through a plurality of wireless communication actions to communicate with the first device, monitoring behavior of the first device during the actions, and storing characteristics of the monitored behavior in memory. The method further includes the steps of emulating the first device with the test apparatus when wirelessly communicating with a second device.","These and other features, advantages and objects of the present invention will be further understood and appreciated by those skilled in the art by reference to the following specification, claims and appended drawings.","Referring now to , an interoperability (IOP) replicator and emulator tester (also referred to as test apparatus)  is illustrated for replicating a first wireless device  as shown in  and further emulating the first wireless device  when communicating wirelessly with a second device  as shown in . The test apparatus  is configured to test interoperability of the first device  to communicate with the second device  via wireless communication. The test apparatus  aids in development of future products, such as device , without requiring a developer to test each and every first device  with the second device  that is being developed. The first device  may include one or more wireless devices, such as Bluetooth\u00ae enabled cell phones, microphone and earpiece headsets, laptop computers, desktop computers and other wireless communicating devices. The second device  may include any wireless device capable of communicating wirelessly with one or more of the first devices . Examples of a second wireless device  may include a Bluetooth\u00ae enabled vehicle entertainment system, radio, or other device.","With reference to , the interoperability replicator and emulator test apparatus  is shown having a processor , a touch screen display , a wireless interface  and memory . The processor  may include a microprocessor, according to one embodiment. The processor  may include other analog and\/or digital circuitry including an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or other known circuitry according to other embodiments. The processor  processes input data, executes routines as described herein to replicate a first device and to emulate the first device, and provides output signals indicative of the interoperability of the devices.","Memory  may include any known storage medium, such as random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), flash memory and other memory devices. Memory  is shown including an application programming interface (API) portion  having a higher abstraction layer  and an abstraction layer  within the higher abstraction layer . Stored within the abstraction layer  is a profile wireless functional specification for learned behavior models . The learned behavior models are learned during the replication of a first device  and are stored in memory  and provide information relevant to the interoperability of the wireless (e.g., Bluetooth\u00ae) communication of the first device . It should be appreciated that a plurality of learned behavior models  may be stored in memory  to accommodate the learned replication of a plurality of first devices . Also stored in memory  is a device replication routine  for learning the behavior models and a device emulation routine  for emulating the learned first device  when communicating with a second device , according to one embodiment. Routines  and  are stored as logic executable by the processor .","The test apparatus  is also shown including a wireless interface  adapted to interface via wireless communication with a plurality of devices. The wireless interface  may allow wireless communication via short range wireless communication such as Bluetooth\u00ae, according to one embodiment. According to another embodiment, the wireless interface  may allow short range wireless communication via IEEE spec 802.11. It should be appreciated that the wireless interface  may allow other wireless communication including medium range and long range wireless communication such as may be experienced with a local area network (LAN) wireless communication.","The test apparatus  further includes a touch screen display  which may display output visual information to a user and may allow for a user to interface and input information to the test apparatus . Referring particularly to , the touch screen display  is illustrated displaying the user interface of a first wireless device, shown as a cell phone . In this example, the cell phone  is displayed on display  showing the phone display  and user input keypads  that may be actuated by a user to input information such as alphanumeric characters for commands. The test apparatus  may be configured such that the touch screen display  allows the user to simulate the entry of keypad inputs by touching the display  on the displayed cell phone device  such that the test apparatus  may simulate the user interface with a cell phone device. The intuitive user interface display  abstracts the sophisticated behavioral model and appears to the user as a cell phone in this example with input buttons for providing user inputs. Also shown in  is the memory  provided within a computer housing  and speakers  that allow for audio output to a user. It should be appreciated that the test apparatus  may be configured by employing logic programmed onto a computer as shown in , or may otherwise be configured. In the computer embodiment, the computer-based tool may be a personal computer or a computing platform with the learned behavior models , device replication routine  and device emulation routine  stored in memory.","The replicator and emulator test apparatus  serves both as a replicator to learn wireless interoperability of one or a plurality of first devices  and as an emulator to emulate the one or plurality of first devices  when communicating with a second device . The test apparatus  is shown communicating with a first wireless device, such as a Bluetooth\u00ae enabled cell phone  in . In doing so, the test apparatus  communicates wirelessly via wireless interface  with the first wireless device(s)  during execution of the device replication routine  and learns the behavior of the first wireless device(s)  such that a behavior model having characterization parameters is stored in memory for each first device .","Once one or a plurality of first wireless devices  have been learned by the test apparatus  and their behavior model characterization parameters are stored in memory, the test apparatus  may be employed to test interoperability of the first wireless devices  with one or more second wireless devices  as shown in . In this embodiment, the test apparatus  communicates wirelessly via the wireless interface  with a second wireless device  shown located on board a vehicle , according to one embodiment. The vehicle  may be a wheeled automotive vehicle as is generally known in the art. The second wireless device  may include any of a number of wireless devices that communicate wirelessly. In the embodiment shown, the second wireless device  is a vehicle entertainment system shown having a display and user inputs available on board the vehicle . The vehicle entertainment system  may incorporate any of a number of functions including radio, navigation, and entertainment as should be evident to those skilled in the art. The test apparatus  allows a developer of a vehicle or the vehicle's entertainment system to test the interoperability of a plurality of first devices , such as cell phones, with the second wireless device  to see if the second wireless device  properly operates to communicate wireless data with each of the plurality of first devices . In doing so, the test apparatus  executes the device emulation routine  to communicate with the second wireless device  to see if the first devices  work correctly with the second device . This enables a developer of the vehicle entertainment system  or the vehicle  to test interoperability of the second wireless device  with the first wireless device  without requiring purchase and use of all potential first devices .","Referring to , the device replication routine  is illustrated, according to one embodiment. The replication routine  begins at step  to start the application to begin the learning process, and then proceeds to step  to start up the Bluetooth\u00ae enabled first device to emulate. The Bluetooth\u00ae enabled device to emulate may include any of a number of devices including cell phones, wireless computers, audio headsets and other Bluetooth\u00ae enabled devices or other wireless devices. Next, routine  proceeds to step  to prepare the test apparatus and the first Bluetooth\u00ae enabled device for pairing. The pairing operation may include a conventional pairing in which the devices are configured to communicate with each other, such as entering a matching code (e.g., 0000), as should be evident to those skilled in the art.","Once the test apparatus and the first Bluetooth\u00ae enabled device are paired, the replication routine  proceeds to step  to exercise defined use cases. The use cases may include sequencing through a number of actions involving communication of the test apparatus with each Bluetooth\u00ae enabled first device. The sequence of events may include a pairing action, a connection action, a reconnection action, a profile action and multiple profile actions. The use cases typically may be a use that is generally required to exercise use of the device through its full range of behavior. According to one embodiment, the use cases may include a device pairing, a device service connection, a device disconnection and reconnection, and profile actions. The profile actions may be functional steps defined in the present and future Bluetooth\u00ae functional profile specifications for profiles including, but not limited to, hands-free phone profile, headset profile, advanced audio distribution profile, audio\/video remote control profile, phonebook access profile, object push profile, dial-up networking profile, and other profiles as updated and\/or adopted. These actions may be performed multiple times each, in every different valid sequence and by every different valid optional way possible to capture variation by user input. Use cases may also include multiple profile actions which are user actions (or use cases) which require simultaneous use of more than one Bluetooth\u00ae profile. Multiple profile actions may include a cell phone streaming music and receiving a call at the same time.","Based on the defined use cases, routine  may apply the results to develop a behavior model of the first device in step . The behavior model may then be stored in memory in step . The characterization parameters of the behavior model may include message response and sequencing, timing between event and responses, message and data formats of response messages, and optional specification features in the Bluetooth\u00ae specification. The stored behavior model characterization parameters are indicative of the operability of the first wireless device such that the test apparatus is able to emulate the first device. Once the characterization parameters are stored in memory, the replication routine  deletes the connection at step . Next, routine  proceeds to decision step  to determine if the test apparatus is finished learning this first device and, if not, turns to step . If the test apparatus is finished learning this first device, then replication routine  proceeds to decision step  to determine if more Bluetooth\u00ae enabled devices are to be learned and, if so, returns to step  to emulate therein the next first device. If no more Bluetooth\u00ae enabled devices are to be learned as the first device, then replication routine  is finished with the replication process at step .","Referring to , the emulation routine  is illustrated for the test apparatus emulating the first devices to communicate with a second wireless device, according to one embodiment. The emulation routine  begins at step  to start the application to begin the emulator process, and then proceeds to step  to start up the second device under test. The second device under test may include an entertainment system in a vehicle, according to one embodiment. Emulation routine  proceeds to step  to select a first Bluetooth\u00ae enabled device from a menu on the display of the emulator test apparatus at step . This may include a user actuating the touch screen display button on the test apparatus to select a desired first Bluetooth\u00ae enabled device to test with the second device. Next, routine  proceeds to step  to perform pairing and connection actions.","Once the pairing and connection actions are complete, emulation routine  proceeds to step  to execute a product test plan using the emulator in place of the first Bluetooth\u00ae enabled device. The product test plan may include the user interacting with the touch screen display of the test apparatus to enter certain inputs so that the test apparatus may check the interoperability of the first device with the second device. Once the product test plan is complete, emulation routine  proceeds to step  to delete the connections. At decision step , emulation routine  determines whether the test apparatus is finished testing the second device under test against the emulated first device and, if not, returns to step . If the test apparatus is finished testing the second device under test against the emulated first device, then routine  proceeds to decision step  to determine if more emulated Bluetooth\u00ae enabled devices are to be emulated to test with the second device under test and, if so, returns to step  to emulate the next first device. If no more emulated first devices are to be emulated, emulation routine  is complete at step .","The emulation routine  executes the product test plan by interacting with a user, according to one embodiment. The test procedure for executing the product text plan may include any of a number of actions that are performed to test interoperability of one or a plurality of first devices with a second device. One example of a test procedure for testing each of the plurality of first devices with the second device is described in the following table which provides the Bluetooth\u00ae profile, the requirement, the test procedures implemented and the expected results, which are recorded for each device that is emulated:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Bluetooth\u2009\u00ae",{},"Test",{},{}]},{"entry":["Profile","Requirement","Step","Test Procedures","Expected Results"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Registration"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["HFP","Pair","1","Press Talk button.

It should be appreciated that some of the test procedure actions may be automated and that the expected results may be automatically stored in memory and may be processed to determine whether the interoperability of each first device with the second device performs satisfactory. One example of a test procedure is given which includes actions for registration, connectivity, placing a phone call, receiving or ending a call, muting a call, providing tones, transfer function, indicator displays, third call\/call waiting, phonebook transfers, handsfree on\/off actions, registrations, and other actions. It should be appreciated that these and other actions may be applied for any given test procedure, depending upon the functionality of the devices and the expected interoperability of the devices. It should be appreciated that while the test procedure shown and described herein is one example of testing a first device with a second device by emulating the first device. It should be appreciated that the same or similar test procedure may be employed during the replication process to learn the characteristics of each of a plurality of first devices by performing similar actions and storing these characteristics in the test apparatus.","Accordingly, it should be appreciated that the test apparatus  advantageously learns the behavior characteristics of a plurality of wireless first devices and emulates the plurality of wireless first devices when communicating with a second device so as to allow for enhanced interoperability testing. The test apparatus  advantageously allows for the elimination of physical first devices when testing a second device so that a developer, such as a manufacturer of a vehicle or a device employed based on an automotive vehicle, may easily and cost effectively check the interoperability of their devices.","It will be understood by those who practice the invention and those skilled in the art, that various modifications and improvements may be made to the invention without departing from the spirit of the disclosed concept.
